Mrs. Diamant lyrical prose vividly took me to the land of Cannan and the banks of the Nile. If you have an interest in biblical and historical literature then this book is for you.This rich book follows the life of a biblical character that is briefly mentioned in the bible. Dinah's story continues in The Red Tent where the bible left off. I enjoyed reading of the old ways of women, of friendships and relationships made and loss.The Red Tent is several books in one, it is a lesson in history, a women's study, and a love story all in one. If you are wanting a book that contains, betrayal, passion, romance and good writing that captures you and does not let you go until the last page then The Red Tent is for you."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"The Red Tent is an honest look at Eastern Mediterranean womanhood long before the stir of liberation. It deserves respect as a resplendent narrative of love and acquiescence to the inevitabilities of women's lives in Canaan. Dinah is the type of woman who overcomes and survives because she takes power where it is offered and puts curiosity to work as a medical tool that saves lives, both male and female. Living in memory and a perpetually renewed love of family and children, she triumphs over regret. In maturity, she willingly seeks a new love that sweeps over her much as birth pangs announce the arrival of her son. An honored sage femme, she embraces a celestial reward--reunion in the afterlife with her beloved mothers, the wives of Jacob. This motif is neither trivial nor PC--it's universal."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"If you desire to be moved deeply and feel connected to the history of life through our female ancestors, read this book without delay. Be prepared to go on many journeys from the spiritual to the emotional to the visualization of ancient sights and sounds.I marvel at this book and how it's affected me by giving me strength. This is a midrash tale full of wonder and delight."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Although you don't have to be familiar with the Old Testament to reap the rich rewards in The Red Tent, it certainly provides an interesting counterpoint to the tale. (The tale can be read from Genesis 25:19 to Genesis 35). What is so rich about The Red Tent is its perspective, precisely, that of Dinah's--a woman before the God of Abraham was the only God around. Indeed, the women of this story have their own gods, their own traditions, their own stories. The power of this book lies in the depth of the storytelling; it is alive, captivating, and rich in the wisdom of women. Take, for instance, this quote where Dinah's mother explains a mysyery to her:&quot;The great mother whom we call Innana gave a gift to women that is not known among men, and this is the secret of blood. The flow at the dark of the moon, the healing blood of the moon's birth--to men, this is flux and distemper, bother and pain. they imagine we suffer and consider themselves lucky. We do not disabuse them. &quot;In the red tent, the truth is known. In the red tent, where days pass like a gentle stream, as the gift of Innana courses through us, cleasning the body of last month's death, preparing the body to receive the new month's life, women give thanks--for repose and restoration, for the knowledge that life comes between our legs, and that life costs blood.&quot;I always appreciate a novel that deepens your own perspective, one that calls forth in our own lives a fuller response to the events of our lives. The Red Tent is such a book. I am certain now that when my own daughters come of age, their will be a ceremony for them that expresses their own connection to the great mother Earth, and her sister the moon. But do not think that this is just a coming of age story for women, because it is not. It is a story woven with the threads of birth and death, love and agony, connectedness and solitude. And its culmination, its last breath, is a glorious sunset of wisdom and words."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This book was recommended and loaned to me by my mother, and I'm very grateful! It is so beautifully written that reading it is effortless. I love the wonderfully textured look at the lives of women in biblical times. If you are afraid that this book will be too religious, you will be pleasently surprised!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This is a book about the relationship among women. It begins with the relationship between four sisters and the connections between them. Throughout this book you will see relationships between a mother and a daughter, a daughter and a mother-in-law, and a daughter and a grandmother, you will even see the bonds between a women and her true friends. This book was so wonderful up until the very end. I gave it to my Mother and to my sisters who also could not put it down. This book will cause you to reflect on your relationships with the women in your life, from past to present. An EXELLENT READ"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This book was supurb! Best book I have read in a long time. I received it as a Christmas gift from my sister. From the Title and reading the backcover it was not a book I would have picked out and bought for myself. I am not Jewish and do not like period novels. I couldn't have been more suprised! I found myself reading it every spare moment! Even reading in the car on our way to Arizona last month. I reccomend this to all women.A MUST READ! My sister selected it as the &quot;Book of the month&quot; in her reading club. I am anxious to hear her clubs reviews on it."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"The first page of this book caught me, and I could not put it down. I didn't sleep, I just read and read. The Red Tent is well written, well researched, well thought out, and fascinating. Diamant's attention to detail is incredible! As a classical studies major I found the setting incredible, as a religious studies minor I loved the exploration of the ceremonies and rites. As a female I loved to find out more about women in antiquity, and as a person looking for entertainment I was not dissapointed! I highly recommend reading this book!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"On the positive side, this does a fairly good job of dramatizing the old testament stories, and the characterizations and environmental descriptions in this book are often very good, making their world very tangible in places.However, the story dragged for me, and as is too common in historical fiction, the author sometimes gets basic easy-to-research details of life embarrassingly wrong (no-one who knows how to spin says they spin wool or linen into 'string' - try 'yarn' or 'thread'). Her descriptions of birth feature drama over normality - as a woman who gave birth naturally at home in under 10 hours without flooding the room in gore (I think I ruined one towel!), I was rolling my eyes by the third birth scene. She even manages to work in a Pitocin-like induction by way of some mysterious herbal substance! And she seems to have not even imagined the strange high of unmedicated childbirth, and the feeling of power it can give a woman - though it is something she could certainly have read about even if she has never experienced it herself. Some 'womanist' work of fiction."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"My sister-in-law recommended this to me. It was a wonderful book and really made me wonder how this particular period in history would have been remembered if the stories of the women were the ones recorded! The author did a marvelous job of spinning a tale of the secrets, mysteries and bonds shared by women. I have recommended it to many friends."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I really enjoyed the author's writing style, but I felt after a while that the story became a little too interior, almost claustrophobic--I wish that she had described more scenes that really transported you to the places in the novel. I also thought that the strongest part of the book was the best; after Dinah left the company of her mothers the book became curiously weak, and trailed off. Not surprisingly, I didn't find any of Diamant's male characters very engaging. I loved reading about an exclusively woman's culture (perhaps I should say Womyn's Culture!) but I can see where conservative readers who are far more familiar with the Bible than I am would not appreciate the liberties taken with the holy scripture."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Anita Diamant has done a fantastic job of taking plain facts from the Bible and weaving them into this intricate story of Dinah and the women that surrounded her. Marvelous reading for anyone, and I certainly hope Ms. Diamant will grace us with another wonderfully written tale."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This is a story that is vivid, complex and compelling. It is narrated through the voice of Dinah, whose life is only hinted at within the more familiar chapters in the Book of Genesis about her father, Jacob, and his dozen sons. The bible lists the names of Jacob's wives: Leah, Rachel, Zilpah and Bilhah, but it is the skill of Ms. Diamant who breathes life into them. She places them within the context of their time and makes them totally human.Much of the story takes place with the red tent, the place where women retreat during their monthly periods and the place where births occur. I love reading details of midwifery and childbirth and the author made me feel I was right there, sharing the labors of the women as they brought new life into the world. The book also shed light on the communal lives of co-wives and the unique relationships that each one had with each other as well as with Jacob, their husband. But the story is much more than all this. There's tension, drama and conflict throughout, and a violent incident that changed Dinah's life forever. It was so horrendous that it sent me straight to a bible to check out the story and make sure that this was not something that Ms. Diamant had made up, because, after all, this is a novel. Sadly, I discovered that even though she did make up the personalities of the women, the incidents she described are right there.From the moment I picked up the book, I could not put it down. I was drawn right in and found myself trying to read it slowly to make it last longer. This is absolutely one of the best reads I've had in a long time. It's an historical novel at its very best. Not only did I love the story, but I also learned something about the time and place. And Ms. Diamant transforms the long list in the bible about who begat who into a living breathing story of real people. I give this book my very highest recommendation. It's simply wonderful!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Gosh - where to start?!? From a pure fictional point of view, I truly enjoyed this book. The female characters were well drawn, the prose was almost lyrical, the plot moved quickly. My first problem, tho, was reconciling a fictional book written about factual people with factual lives. Anita Diamant sticks closely to the biblical account on some details, but starkly vears away on many details. So my first question was: what is this author's worldview? what are the passions driving her direction of her novel? what is she trying to teach me? So, of course, I check out the other books she's written - modern day books about jewish culture. Ok, so she's a self-proclaimed (reform?) Jewish woman. But what I know about Jewishness really doesn't jive with the heart's cry of this novel which seems to have more to do with the strength/power/individuality of the women and their passionate pursuit of the goddesses they worship. Back to my original question - fictional account using factual people/places/ideology - what's fiction and what is fact? The Old Testament is filled with numerous accounts of God's &quot;chosen people&quot; turning their backs on Him and following other gods. The first commandment, thus, was &quot;You shall have no other gods before me.&quot; It is my belief that this struggle to purely follow God has existed from the beginning of time (ie. Adam &amp; Eve's fall from grace in the garden of eden...) and that the struggle continues to this present day (disclosure: yup, my worldview is a biblical one...) So I acknowledge that the struggle equally existed for Rebekkah, Leah, Rachel, etc. - biblical evidence includes Rachel equally calling out to God to open her womb (and subsequently praising God for hearing her and vindicating her) while she also steals her father's idols. So back to my original question - what's real, what's not? The conclusion that I came to is thus: Anita Diamant's rendering of the Genesis stories must not be accepted as &quot;truth&quot; or &quot;fact&quot; or even as an &quot;alternative interpretation&quot; of history. But her fascinatingly told story might be used to gain understanding of some of the pagan thought/practice/worship that our biblical ancestors struggled against and fell under the influence of."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"The ads proclaim: &quot;What the Bible would be like if it werewritten by women.&quot; I'm not so sure about that. The Bible is thestory of the triumph of monotheism, and the women characters in this book are idol-worshippers. However, such details aside, this is an engrossing novel that humanizes a &quot;minor character&quot; from Genesis and brings vividly to life one of the Bible's most disturbing passages: the &quot;rape&quot; of Dinah and the bloody killing of the men of Shechem by her brothers, Jacob's sons. Most previous midrashim (commentaries on the text) present Dinah as a brazen harlot who &quot;asked for it&quot; and brought disgrace upon her people. Diamant has created a warm, admirable (and very modern-thinking) Dinah. In this book it is her brothers, the fathers of the tribes of Israel, who are guilty of the disgraceful act. They were, but I wish Diamant hadn't made all of them quite so cartoonish and one-dimensional. Perhaps they had one or two redeeming characteristics. After all, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob are the ones Jews around the world invoke in their prayers every day. I applaud shedding light on the women, but couldn't that have been done without darkening the memories of the men? All in all, though, a lovely novel. And one that is apparently helping quite a few alienated Jewish women get in touch with their heritage."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"God is in these pages and backed scripturally and spiritually. Anita has put together a very realistic and enlightening account. From Moses Book of Genesis the blood of the daughters of Israel is now heard. Fascinating, I am half way through reading it for the second time.I want to recommend another book that is the most enlightening book I have ever read, which also has alot to say about the books of Moses. Karl Maddox book SB 1 or God."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Hi,Bought the book locally. Usually won't buy biblical history/fiction. I am one of Jehovah's Witnesses - and usually we won't read what others write about Bible characters. We are a very closed group.Little is known of Dinah, but she's presented in the Bible as &quot;just&quot; a rape victim. JW's teach that she had &quot;bad association&quot; in that she made friends with other girls - thus, that led to her being raped. As the scripture says &quot;Bad association spoils useful habits.&quot; In other words, it was kinda her own fault.But this book puts a fictional spin on the event, one I've never thought about. It also gives wonderful details of women's lives, (which the Bible conveniently leaves out.)The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because I didn't care for the songs, not my style. But I loved the book and the possiblities it put forth.A person could read it and say &quot;It's putting the Bible down.&quot; But the book is written by a Jewish woman, and it deals with the Old Testament, which is Jewish history. I think it makes the Bible human - as in Dinah was a human, not just a raped woman.Enjoy."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Dinah, the only daughter of biblical patriarch, Jacob, is mentioned only briefly in the thirty-fourth chapter of Genesis. Anita Diamant lifts this obscure woman from the pages of the Bible and gives her a voice. I believe THE RED TENT will become a woman's book; however, men don't let me dissuade you from reading it-it is well worth a masculine read. In THE RED TENT, Diamant develops a loyalty and a community among her women that modern women have long since lost. Their daily lives are unavoidably intertwined. They share the responsibilities normally assigned to women as well as sharing a husband. Diamant does not leave her women without faults, but in general they are literally and figuratively virtuous characters; however, many of her men are not represented in the highest regard. Jacob becomes a man of questionable character and does not appear godly at all. His sons are depicted as purely barbarian. Diamant does treat the men outside Jacob's clan a bit better. Other than the extreme embellishment of Joseph's character, I do not have a problem with Diamant's imagination. I believe this book is a good source for a movie, and I strongly recommend reading it-with one caveat: fiction is fiction, historical or not. It would be beneficial to read the primary source in Genesis first. There are only a few chapters that cover the period between Jacob and Joseph, and, by reading the biblical account first, the reader will truly appreciate Anita Diamant's skill as a writer of historical fiction."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I love historical fiction and read this book with some trepidation of how religious it might be, but you can practice any religion and read it as it is written, a fable describing the times from a woman's point of view. I completely fell into this book and could not put it down, I had to know what happened next. It describes a time when it seemed that women were respected for their womanhood, for their wisdom, and their contributions to the (extremely) extended family, but then again they weren't, in the sense that they still had to succumb to the husband's wishes. I also reveled in the thought of having my own &quot;Red Tent&quot; where I could lounge and party for three days during &quot;that time&quot; instead of having to go on like some warrior and pretend I am not uncomfortable. All said, I recommend this book to every woman, it may give you an insight into how the times have changed, and how they remain the same, over 2,000 years later."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Anita Diamamt has opened up a whole new world with this, her first novel. She has captured not only a time and place, but a feeling of unity among women that is lacking in the modern world. The narrative is beautifully poetic, having the ability to capture the hearts and minds of readers. Diamant uses startlingly real images of love, death and growing up. This is, all in all, one tremendous read."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Heroines: VariedFollow the trials and tribulations of Dinah, one of the many faceless daughters of the Bible, from the beginning of her life in the mystical Red Tent of her many mothers, through heinous betrayal, and finally a long-awaited and hard-won healing.What worked for me:I found the story to be unique, rich, inventive, and gripping. I didn't put the book down unless I absolutely had no choice, and even then I found my mind wandering back over what I'd read, trying to piece it all together.Size was not an issue in the book, but the women depicted were a varied tapestry of sizes, shapes, and colors.Personally I love birth stories so the fact that a large portion of the book centered on the lives of midwives was a bonus in my eyes. Also considered to be a plus were the many love stories included. Granted, I don't care for the notion of sharing a husband with other women, but I understand why polygamy was practiced in those days and it was certainly interesting to view Ms. Diamant's idea of how this particular clan of sister-wives might have interacted.What didn't work for me:Because it spans a lifetime some sections of the book required a long set-up, but for the most part the story was so well-written that I didn't mind waiting to reach that next level.This next part isn't exactly about \\"what didn't work for me\\" so much as \\"what didn't work for other people\\", but it was such a sticky topic that I thought I would toss my two cents in on it: Before picking up a copy of the paperback, I ...saw several scathing comments about it from both sides of the women's issue. Many people complained that the women were depicted as being too pagan and given too large a role in the book, while the men and their God were more-or-less emasculated and made into villains. I have seen other reviews written by people who were bothered with how limited and powerless the roles of the women seemed to be: cook, wife, slave, concubine. That the women did not design their own destiny but were merely carried along by circumstances beyond their shaping.For myself I carefully considered each viewpoint, took them both with a grain of salt, and guessed that the answer lies somewhere in the middle. The women wielded as much power as they could in the limited roles of females in an ancient patriarchal society which was surrounded, and therefore likely influenced, by pagan beliefs. Honestly, we'll never really have a clear idea of what life was like for the women of the time because most written records don't give much insight in that area, and while there are still cultures in the Middle East which seem unchanged over the centuries we know that they are not \\"exact\\" replicas of their ancestors of millennia past and therefore do not give us \\"exact\\" answers on this subject.Overall:I enjoyed \\"The Red Tent\\" and found it to be a very thought-provoking and fascinating read. I recommend it to anyone with an interest in Middle Eastern history or women's issues. I do not recommend it to anyone who feels uncomfortable with even the slightest departure from traditional and literal interpretations of the Book of Genesis."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Diamant takes a bare-boned Biblical tale and gives it flesh, blood, color, and skin. It doesn't matter if it's accurate or not; accuracy would be impossible to prove anyway. And besides, she's not trying to fool anyone: she does call it a novel, which is by definition a work of fiction. The result is an interesting tale and an appreciation for and closeness with the female characters of the book. Often when reading the Bible, we're too lazy or busy to take the time to imagine what it meant to pack up and move with flocks of sheep and goats and food and belongings. I am thankful for Diamant's efforts in having elucidated aspects such as these for us.From a literary point of view, however, I was disappointed. Contrary to other reviewers, I do not feel that Diamant is talented in \\"turning a phrase\\" or that she has \\"poetic language.\\" In fact, I found her language frustrating at best, mixing modern expressions with forced Biblical language... which is only called \\"Biblical language\\" because we have become accustomed to old translations. I found her style dry and, ironically, not particularly feminine. I also tired of her repeated adjectives, such as \\"mortified,\\" which was always too extreme a word for the situation.Diamant's purpose is never entirely clear--I disagree that she is male-bashing, since Dinah has appreciation for several of her brothers and a strong admiration for Jacob in his younger days. It is only after the murders that she turns against him.The plot is vague until about 2/3 of the way through, at which time it becomes simultaneously evident and predictable. Nonetheless, the details of female life during this time period and the relationships being established carry the reader through all this.Sometimes the characters seem forced to be so different; Diamant's efforts become transparent especially when characterizing Jacob's wives. Other characterizations are simply hard to believe: are 13-year-old girls really capable of such profound romantic relationships and gratifying sexual experiences in their wedding beds?Many of the actions seem unjustified or out of character. Diamant fails to sufficiently prepare her characters in certain situations. For example, why would a good and honorable man like Jacob, who took the time to walk equally with each wife and show tenderness in ways that shows he understands their different personalities, suddenly be so cruel with Dinah's fianc&eacute;? Does he agree with the action, or does he become suddenly spineless?Furthermore, many doors are opened which are never closed or passed through. What do Joseph and Dinah experience that they swear to secrecy, and what effect does that have on the story? What attacks Jacob, and again, what effect does that have on the story? Why would the old midwife make the strong prophecy that Dinah would be at peace near a river, which could have been the beginning of a plot, only to be proven wrong as a sort of afterthought near the end of the book? Why would Diamant name Dinah's second husband \\"Benia,\\" the same name as Joseph's youngest brother, and then have Joseph comment on the coincidence, without having any reason for it? Why does Dinah check in the pond to see her aging reflection, when she asked for a mirror during the birth of her son? Why can't she forgive Joseph, who is also treated horribly by their brothers and who had not agreed to the murders in Shechem?Nevertheless, despite these criticisms, the novel works because in the end, a good story has been told, and it has the fine quality of tying up a lot of (but not all) loose ends in a clever way.I'm sure I didn't appreciate her suggestion that Joseph was a homosexual anymore than anyone else did, or any other of her \\"Biblical inaccuracies,\\" if we can call them that--because they destroy happy images we created for ourselves in Sunday School (among other reasons). But it is the author's creative license to do what she wants with her characters, and if anything else, it challenges us to defend our beliefs even more strongly or to read the Bible with a more critical eye, which are the kinds of things which lead to better understanding and truth. An artist who can have this sort of effect on her audience certainly can not be considered unsuccessful. Her art has accomplished its goal through its provocative read."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This book breaks through the male dominated, written, and preached Old Testament and takes me back to the Red Tent. I would love to speak with Anita and ask here how she developed her characters, ones that were based on one or two line mentions in the Book of Genesis. This book is a celebration of women and womanhood."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"It is very rare when a book opens up to us the whispers of our ancestors, tears the veil from the unseen world, and unites us with the beauties of the sorrrow from all our lives and even lives before. What a precious gem indeed, this book that called out from beyond time with the voice of all the women who came before, and all who will ever be. This is a novel that seems to become the very fingers of the Goddess reaching out for us, and after reading this I will always know that I am not alone, for the joys and sorrows of my mothers before me are Her, and the laughter and tears of my sisters are Her, and they speak to me as Her. As a woman this book shows me that I take my place now in something too great to be recognized except in the most precious moments of life. Here is a story to unite all women and to show that the courageous spirit of women is the Goddess Herself."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This was a great read! I could not put it down The stories in the Bible are somewhat thin, here the auther fleshes them out and takes you back in time."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"There are those who are offended that their cherished Biblical Matriarchs aren't portrayed like they were in Sunday School, but they are missing the point! The ancient Hebrews were moon worshipping matriarchal people and they really were not &quot;Jews&quot; until centuries after the Exodus. Why do you think we refer to the Sabbath as a Queen? The Holy Temple was filled with symbols and sacred objects our current rabbis would have fits about. Leah practiced sympathetic magic with mandrake root to assure fertility, and I could go on.The woman who was upset by this need only look up the part in Genesis where Rachel steals the household gods and hides them under where she sits, claiming she has her period.Anita Diament uses Midrashic details which lend further veracity to the story.I found this book well written and deeply moving. I actually feel the Matriarchs are more precious to me now that I had ever thought before. These are mothers I am proud to descend from, and although it is very much a work of fiction, Anita Diament makes them very real."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This was a beautiful, odd, sometimes painful, often thrilling book. I couldn't put it down, and finished it at 1 am, two days after I started it. I felt it had the best ending of any book I ever read. Pure poetry."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I found this story to be delightful, intriguing and insightful! It is beautifully told and gives the unique perpective of what it was to be a woman during that time.

The narrative truly pulls the reader into the story, I for one could not put it down!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I enjoyed the story a great deal and read it quickly wanting to know what would happen next. I've read it twice already and now would like to review the Bible itself to get a better understanding of the story."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This back cover of this book states it is \\"historical fiction\\". I am not a biblical scholar at all, but I began to have grave concerns about this book when I read the marriage of Jacob and Leah took place 7 months after they met, not 7 years. The second concern I had was how Laban was so unwelcoming to Jacob when he first met him. Not true at all, he was fully welcomed into his uncle's family. I could go on, but these two incidents were enough for me to get out my dusty Bible and reread portions of Genesis, where my memory was correct and this \\"historical fiction\\" book sadly misleading. I expected historical fiction to be, well, historical, with at the minimum basic facts as given in Genesis. So, I doubt I will finish this book, and can only hope that those who read it understand that it is not based on the written Biblical stories. The book appealed to me as it was a NY Times bestseller, but I can't trust or believe this imaginative's writer's story. Just don't believe that the Biblical characters/scenes/behaviors are adequately represented in this book. They aren't. It would worth it for a book group to do a comparative study between this book and the Bible."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"In this retelling of the story of Dinah found in the Biblical book of Genesis (Chapter 34), THE RED TENT by Anita Diamant (1997) is captivating in plot and depiction. The only mention of Dinah in the Bible was about her supposed rape by a Shechemite prince. It is thoroughly about women, and truly for women. The length of the book was a bit much because it's from her preteens to death. But if you can withstand the \\"life story\\" length, it is worth the read.THE RED TENT answered a lot of questions I've had about life in bible times, especially about women. The red tent is where the women of that time gathered during their monthly flow and where they birthed babies. It answered for me what the interaction between men and women was like. It was truly a male driven society and there was little interaction between the genders.It is apparent that Anita did her homework and researched the pagan background of that era. There are many things I did not know about why God said \\"Thou shalt have no other gods before me.\\" It is because of how many gods they worshipped during that time.I enjoyed the embellishments of the story at times, but know that there are some which were definitely wrong. The important one was how Jacob and Leah married. Anita portrays the switching of Rachel for Leah as Rachel's fault but Biblically it was Laban who switched them, swindling Jacob. I strongly disagree with the details she gave in the marriage between these too. It could not have been a happy one as Anita portrays. (She seems to be an optimist and twists the story in a positive light even through the tragedy of Dinah's life.)Nonetheless, I consider this story a worthwhile read because of how close the Bible is to my heart. I have always had trouble reading the mysterious words of the Bible and for someone to depict a story from the female point of view, makes me bubble with questions and curiosity. Now that I have a tid-bit of an idea about the role of women, maybe I will understand the Old Testament stories better. It is an eye-opening portrait of a woman of the Bible and the life she might have lived.I'd give this book a 3. Good: No regrets. I found this quote on Anita Diamant's website. She wrote: \\"The amazing word-of-mouth support from readers and from book groups, has made THE RED TENT a publishing phenomenon. First printed in 1997 with no advertising budget and few reviews in major newspapers or magazines, this book only found its audience through the loyalty of readers, and the support of independent bookstores.\\"I thought it was amazing that this book found me. Let me know what you think if you read it."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"The novel is a fictional account of the life of Dinah, Jacob's and Leah's little known daughter and sister of the more famous, Joseph. The red tent was where the women in Dinah's family would retire to during their monthly period, away from the men. In the red tent they rested, shared womanly rituals as well as the simple joy of story telling. The bond between the women in the clan was built here, while the elder women passed on traditions and stories to daughters.The details on daily lives, rituals and beliefs of the early Egyptians and Israelites were interesting. It was easy to get involved in the characters and be thrilled for Dinah as she matures into a woman and finds love, and sympathize with her when tragedy strikes. I rooted for her as she healed, and hoped for a happy ending.This novel made me read the bible again and ponder what the figures in our religious history were really like as real people- fathers, mothers, brothers or friends. It was clear from the onset however that the writer took some characters and a few facts out of the bible and made a WORK OF FICTION around them. It is not a historical account nor does it claim that some common beliefs from the bible are a lie. Some portions in the book may be more offensive than others - the examples of bestiality, bisexuality and bizarre midnight rituals that divirginize young ladies which didn't seem essential to the story but added a bit of shock factor. I recommend this novel for its entertainment value. It is interesting and easy to read but do not expect a factual, concise biblical account or you may be disappointed, misled or even offended."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Don't hesitate - it really is as good as they say! I must admit that when someone recommended this book I was hesitant. Mainly, I didn't want an overdose of someone else's skewed/manipulated perspective on religion especially not on Christianity, Judaism etc. I have my own views, thanks. And honestly, I kick myself for waiting so long to read it - twas brilliant!! Basically, it read like a Phillipa Gregory novel - thing Old Testament version of The Other Boleyn Girl! She enthralls you from the first page and it never lets up! I finished it in 2 days :) and passed it on to my 48-year old mom, 20-year old sister, 25-year old cousin, and two friends - all whom loved the novel. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Oddly enough, this is my second favorite book after TENNIS DATES. Smart, witty and incredibly insightful this is a must read."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"After reading the Red Tent, I bought it a a gift for my sister, my daughter, and most recently for my niece. My niece read it in 3 days! I guarantee it will take up residency in your mind and in your heart!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"In Genesis Chapter 34, the brief tale of Dinah, daughter of Jacob and his first wife, Leah, is related: this young woman, after visiting the women of the nearby city of Shechem, is \\"humbled\\" by the son of the king, who then wishes to marry her. In one of the more distasteful episodes of the Old Testament, after agreeing to become circumcised, the men of Shechem are then brutally killed by Jacob's sons Simon and Levi, and \\"took Dinah out of Shechem's house, and went away\\" (34:1-26). Dinah is not mentioned again. Anita Diamont takes this short story, and creates a brilliant portrait of not just Dinah, but all of her \\"mothers\\" -- the four wives of Jacob: Leah, Rachel, Zilpah and Bilhah. Dinah is the narrator of their lives and hers; through her memories of the stories each \\"mother\\" told her, a view of women's lives in the ancient world comes to vibrant life.In the early part of the novel, the women's lives revolve around the 'red tent' of the title, where women retreat during menstruation and childbirth/recovery. Here is where Dinah learns each mother's story and version of their lives with Jacob. When Dinah tells her version of the Genesis 34 story, she is clearly in love with the prince (and he with her), and following the biblical version, the deceit and violence of her male relatives destroys her bright future. Rather than fade away, however, Diamant takes Dinah to Egypt, young, pregnant and afraid, in the company of her mother-in-law, an Egyptian noblewoman. Here, Dinah gives birth to her only child, makes a new life, and finds a good man. She encounters her birth family again, when her father dies (as at the end of Genesis, although she's not mentioned in the 'historical' account).Dinah has little good to say about the male members of her family; Diamant does a good job of presenting an alternate view of Jacob and his sons through the eyes of the women in his life. Although some may have an issue with a fictional and not always positive depiction, I found the book engrossing and believable in terms of how women in this era were viewed by their men, and how they created their own reality both in and out of the 'red tent'. Well worth reading!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Stories of women in the Bible are few and far between. When they are included, they are often temptresses, harlots, or victims. Occassionally they are heroes. Because of the time and influences of authors and editors, their stories are limited and culled. Anita Diamant examines the life of one of these women, Dinah. In Genesis 34, the story of her rape and the revenge enacted by two of her brothers (of the 12 sons of Israel) is presented, but nothing is ever written about her again. Diamant tells her tale from Dinah's point of view. She begins by telling the stories of the wives of Jacob, which to her are as important as the life of Dinah.Diamant shows her love of Biblical history and scholarship by presenting the smallest details and showing their importance. She embraces the tone of a woman of the time. She takes every scrap of mention of the women in Jacob's life and weaves a beautiful and compelling tale. She creates characters with spirits. You'd swear they were women you could meet soon, women you could admire and learn from. While reading many Bible stories, I've often be confused by the motives of the characters and wanted to know why they acted a certain way. I knew why the women in the book did everything they did. I still don't understand why the men acted the way they did.This is a very female story. The title of the book should make that obvious-it's named for the isolation of women during their periods. Every day life is important-cooking, cleaning, weaving, child-rearing. Some of the best writing she does is when she describes childbirth. I rarely get weepy when reading, but I did choke up when Dinah describes the need for a special song or prayer for a mother when she first looks upon her newborn. She also describes the distance women in this time had from Jacob's god and reminds the reader that when this story was written, the world was still polytheistic, ruled by many gods, of which, the god of Abraham was one.I've read about midrashes, stories that rabbi's wrote to explain the actions of the characters in the Bible or because there seems to be a gap. The story of Lilith as the first wife of Adam is one of these, if memory serves me correctly. I think that Diamant wrote this in that tradition. I commend her efforts and wish that other novels taking on the lives of women of the Bible were so well-written and concieved. This is an interesting one to read withThe Handmaid's Tale (Everyman's Library)."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This book is the best book I've read in a long time. It is literary bread and water: fleshy with life, sustaining and fulfilling, yet clean and unadorned and quenching. It is the story of the life of Woman, told through the life of one woman. At times we see through the eyes of a girl-child, observing so many new details with a slow hand, and this first part of the book is luxurious and comfortable. Then you are suddenly a woman speeding through painful, empty years, and then finally savoring the last slow memories of the sweet years before death. Dinah, the woman, is a character mentioned in the Bible, though in that text her story is short and black and white. This telling is anything but. A multitude of characters with unfamiliar names is handled with grace and genius, even after asking myself \\"Why can I tell all of these strange people apart and remember exactly who they are even after they haven't been mentioned for whole chapters? It is an untraceable brilliance--I felt like I knew and could see four mothers, twelve brothers, countless acquaintances, two lovers, children, and every supernumerary character with only one line of description concerning them dropped here or there. Nothing that I have read has captured the entire human experience in such touching and vivid terms as The Red Tent. It is definitely one of those books that you can't finish in public- you have to save those last five pages for your empty bedroom and a box of tissues, for nothing has ever made me feel so alive."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This is a beautifully written novel, and it does an amazing job of transporting the reader back in time to a completely foreign culture, time, place, and way of life. The characters are all incredibly rich and detailed (yes, even the male characters, I think they were all as intricate as the female ones), and the story is deeply moving.I was always disappointed whenever I would read the Bible and find that the stories mostly focused on the men; while the women would be off to the side, completely silent, often only mentioned in regards to the sons they had borne. This book turns the Old Testament narratives inside out, and describes the familiar stories from the womens' point of view, while celebrating the mystery and wonder of life.A note for Christians, especially those who criticize the book because it doesn't completely follow what the Bible says regarding the events...this is a work of historical fiction written by a Jewish woman, and I don't think it was ever meant to be a work of Christian fiction. Take this book for what it is, an exploration of the historical period and the relationships between ancient women. The Bible never says that Dinah embraced her father's God.I always wondered what happened to Dinah after the events in Shechem, and this book followed her story to the end of her life in ways I never expected. Diamant has a rich imagination, and is a skilled writer."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This should be assigned reading for all women of the Jewish or Christian faith. This is wonderfully written from a woman's point of view of Biblical times. I have a much better understanding of what life was like for them."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Just fascinating! Anita Diamant's \\"The Red Tent,\\" is a chick book (although my husband also likes it), but extremely well written and researched. Diamant's fluid and lovely writing style, historical perspective, thoughtful observations, action, and the interaction between characters is gripping. I resisted reading it because of all the hype, given that such popular books are typically not good literature. This is not true of this book. The topic of menstuation does permeate the story a bit much for my taste: but that subject binds the themes of fertility, love, birth, and family, around which the story revolves. The historical research that is interwoven in this book is just fascinating, particularly the segregated lifestyle of the early Jews and the worshipping of Canaanite gods and the Hebrew god in the same family (and by the same family members). It's like Joseph's Campbell's insights about the evolution of our concepts about God have been brought to life in this very good novel. From the reviews and the publicity, I feared it would be too feminism oriented and too religiously preachy, but it is neither. I also highly recommend \\"The Last Days of Dogtown\\" by the same author."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"In writing The Red Tent, Diamant seems to have actually lived the history of which she writes. Very well considered, historically accurate, thoughtful, interesting, and a great story (of course). Really gives food for thought."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This book is the best book I have read in the last 10 years. I envy Diamant's creativity in taking such a small character from the bible (Dina) and turning her into such a multi-faceted character. What a joy to read!I wonder why she decided to paint some of the men (like Joseph and Jacob) in such a bad light when they are perceived as such strong men in the bible. This book taught me so much about life in biblical times and made me want to learn more about the bible and that is a wonderful thing. Many thanks, Anita!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Dinah of the Bible was only mentioned in passing, but Diamant has taken her and given her a face, a personality and the trappings of being human. The Red Tent is a richly detailed look into the lives of Dinah and all those who surround her - from her father Jacob who was almost sacrificed to God, to her brother Joseph who was sold into slavery in Egypt. The familiar stories woven into what might have happened behind them. As a Christian, it was a delight to identify key happenings of the Bible in this novel and visualise the tale from another perspective. Read it even if you are not a believer. Of the hundreds of books I've read this year, The Red Tent is among the handful that will be treasured, recommended and be read again and again."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Upon finishing The Red Tent, I was struck by the strong similarities it had with The Mists of Avalon. The most obvious similarity is that both books retell a familiar story from the point of view of a (previously) minor female character. However, I thought that the strongest links between The Red Tent and The Mists of Avalon were those that make them successful fiction. Both books have vivid settings, realistic characters, strong dialogue, and an epic scope that is respectful of the original source material. Still, The Red Tent should not be seen as a ripoff of The Mists of Avalon. Instead, it is a stunningly original work that shares many characteristics with other successful retellings of old myths. Those who are familiar with the original tale and those who aren't will find a fascinating story that is worth reading."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This book was definitely one of the best books I have ever read. I was lost in the story. I would rank it right up there with Memoirs of the Geisha. You'll love it if you are interested in how people live in different areas of the world and time periods."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"by those who quarrel with its possible lack of total historical accuracy (never mind that with Dinah we are discussing legendary times).

Each spoke to the reader directly...I loved that! You knew what the women felt. They were given identity. I was hooked after reading the first page. However, I must say I became gravely disappointed with the turn of pages post Dinah's retreat to Egypt. She became shallow. Why didn't we hear about how she coped with the changing world she lived in? What kind of foods did she eat? Why didn't she speak to her Father? Hmmm. Nonetheless, this was a great book and worth every penny."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I love Diamants style. She not only gave each woman in The Red Tent character but a voice.

However, nothing could have prepared me for what I was about to get myself into. This is, by far, the best book that I've ever read. It gets your attention right from the beginning and doesn't let go. I honestly did not want it to end. While it's a fiction novel, I still learned more about the 12 tribes of Israel and the woman's role in society during &quot;Bible times&quot; than I have by just reading the Bible. The book actually made me want to dig deeper into the Bible and look for similarities."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Based on a fleeting Old Testament reference to Jacob's daughter Dinah, Anita Diamant presents us with Dinah's wonderful life story in The Red Tent. Dinah is the only daughter of four mothers, and each of them -- Leah, Rachel, Zilpah and Bilhah -- is a different, compelling character, simply and gracefully rendered. Their relationships are complex: loving and jealous, joyous and painful, tender and harsh. The special rituals which come to pass in the red tent, the place of all things exclusively female, form an anchor for the tale as they were an anchor in their lives.I loved this novel... sucked it down like a milkshake and wished there were more. My one regret is that because this is so thoroughly perceived to be a &quot;women's novel,&quot; it won't occur to my male friends to read it for its story, and the story is really the point. You'll laugh, you'll cry. Read this book."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"The Story of Dinah, daughter of Jacob, sister to Joseph of multicolored coat fame, &quot;The Red Tent&quot; is a biblical story without the bible. A fictional tale of a woman who is barely a footnote in the bible, &quot;The Red Tent&quot; draws you in from the beginning.Anita Diamant, who has written some really lovely books about Jewish life, has written a story of a biblical women who gets little notice in the actual bible. Full of rich description and interest, &quot;The Red Tent&quot; is a must read! You'll wish Ms. Diamant wrote about every biblical woman just so you could read more!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This is one of the best books I have ever read.

A must read for anyone who is looking for a great book club book. My friends and I absolutely loved this story!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"The Red Tent by Anita Diamant is by far one of the finest books that I have read in some time. Diamant seems to have a way of drawing you into the circle of women allowed in the red tent. This book is told through the history of Dinah, daughter of Jacob and Leah of the book of Genesis. In Dinah's story you are brought to the red tent as an eyewitness to exactly how women would have been treated by their men and by eachother. There is humor, mystery, anguish, entertainment, fear and the story of education during Biblical times. Very much like in the Bible itself! This book is definetly one for my personal top ten lists of &quot;must reads&quot;."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This book is truly captivating, and so meaningful to women as a culture. Honestly, I don't think you have to be a woman, let alone a feminist to appreciate the wisdom and beauty of this story. I cannot stop talking about it with all my friends, sisters, and mother! Through Dinah's voice, the story gives modern women a noble and intricate picture of their place not only in the bible, but also in ancient history. &quot;The Red Tent&quot; will make you truly appreciate the love and wisdom of your &quot;sisters&quot;! And then, call your mother!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I enjoyed reading this book very much. I love the way Diament takes a biblical story and opens it up to include the women characters we don't always hear about. It is like a modern day &quot;midrash,&quot; or Jewish legend. And with regard to a previous reviewer who decries it being &quot;Fiction, not totally accurate&quot; -- well he's right, it is fiction, but that is what fiction is supposed to do, create new worlds and stories that take us beyond the realm of true to life events. If you liked this book, you should also check out Tova Mirvis's The Ladies Auxiliary, which does a similar thing with the book of Ruth, only in a modern Southern city."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I was so excited to read this book, as I'd heard it was \\"really good.\\" I'm afraid I didn't get very far and I ended up dumping the book in the garbage. There are a lot of strange things going on in the Old Testament, I agree, but I thought the beginning of this novel was very crude. Laban's pictured as a sex-crazed fellow who is lusts after and chases the female goats, or whatever they had. Jacob is seen gratifying himself out in the open.I think Anita D. has really done her research. I would have loved to enjoy the book and the results of her hard work, but couldn't get past the portrayal of men and women \\"of the covenant\\" living such selfish, coarse lives. I'm sure I'll hear from everyone about what a prude I am, but reviews are based on personal reactions to literature, so I think I'm entitled to my opinion. Not everyone likes that kind of garbage. She dedicated this book to her daughter, and I wouldn't have MY daughter read it."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Some would suggest that this novel is not worth the time it takes to read it based on the idea that it is not a correct Biblical account. Well, of course its not. This is not a religious fiction novel (in the sense that The Chosen would be, or one of the many series dedicated to expansion of knowledge and faith in Christianity) rather historical fiction. I found it to be inspiring, and fulfulling.The novel portrays Dinah, a woman in the Bible cited as a great source of tragedy and shame. This novel shows her story in a different light, depicting her childhood, life, and death, in a way which gives strength to women of them time, rather than their male counterparts. More important than Biblical accuracy is the way which Diamant depicts religion and faith of the time, along with the lifestyle and the respect for the differences between men and women that is all but unknown today. If you want Biblical accuracy, go elsewhere. If you want a novel of courage, faith, and new perspectives on what you thought you knew about feminine strength and history, look no further."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"We read the red tent for a book club in our Church. I loved the concept of womanhood and sisterhood. It was a little shocking how she portrayed some of the Characters from the Bible. I was especially disappointed with how she portrayed Rebecca. (She turned her into a type of Lady Catherine Deburg - from \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" (Rebecca was cold hearted and portrayed more as a goddess worshipper always sitting on her throne and Isaac was some feeble man in love with some caretaker). I was also shocked by some of the ritual scenes the women carried out on eachother. Mainly, if you think of it as pure fiction, you may be alright.. but if you know much about the characters from the Bible, you may have some issues with it. It was an interesting read, but definitely not one I loved."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Let me first say that this is and probably always will be one of my favorite novels. I find the narration *amazing* and the take on the story of poor Dinah refreshing. I also love that Ms. Diamant is not afraid to highlight the flaws in her amazing female characters.However...the reason I cannot give this novel five stars, despite it being a favorite of mine, is because of some of the liberties taken by Ms. Diamant. It is one thing to take the few Bible verses about Dinah and re-work her story a bit, because even those verses leave an open door on whether or not she was actually raped or whether her brothers committed the murders out of jealousy and greed. I can even deal with the Reuben/Bilhah/Jacob love triangle that is hinted at throughout the story, or the fact that maybe Joseph was a bit human and did not actually completely forgive his brothers for selling him into slavery.On the other hand, I just cannot bring myself to agree with Ms. Diamant's mention of the Godly woman Rebecca actually becoming a priestess/oracle of pagan goddesses, of Jacob possibly dealing in bestiality, or of her strong hints that Joseph preferred men over women, if you catch my hint. I just feel that at with these practically useless plot points she was treading a very fine line between extolling upon the short story of DINAH, and blasphemy."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"A different type of book from what Im used to, but very enjoyable. Didnt want to put it down and didnt want it to end. Im not overly knowledgable of the Bible, but this made me go back and reread the story of Jacob. I highly reccomend."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I could not put this book down. It's a great story with vivid characters and historical descriptions that takes you, the reader, on a wild tale. Although there is little mention of Dinah in the Bible (Genesis 34), the story tells a rich and exciting tale of Dinah, a young girl born into a family of boys (and indeed a huge extended family), who discovers what it's like to become a woman. This isn't a really a \\"Bible story\\" (so don't not read it because you think it may be about religion); it's a story of a girl who goes through many hardships to become a woman, a wife and a mother."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Anita Diamant's \\"The Red Tent\\" is a story of one of the most mysterious women in the Bible. Dinah is mentioned only briefly in Genesis, but her life was full of turbulance and affected many. This book is not to be taken historically, it is clearly the work of the author's imagination. Diamant breathes life into the character of Dinah as she explores what life was like during Biblical times for a woman of Dinah's status.The story is told through the eyes of Dinah herself, giving an intriguing perspective. The story takes the focus off of the men that are so familiar in Jewish history and shows the life of the women. It shows the bonding that can be established between groups of women - love and competition all bundled into one.This is a very enjoyable book. I will stress again that it is a work of fiction. Do not expect to use this book as a historical resource."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This work was a delight, and really brought the concept of life in ancient times alive in a rare and compelling manner. I loved the way the main character evolves; how the PR that's been reported about her life didn't match true events; and the sheer humanity of her generation and their lifestyle. I thought this book brought genuine insight into the teachings of the Bible, and wish there were more like it."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I am a sophomore in high school, and my English class was given a choice of three outside reading books that related to our study of the Bible as in Literature. The Red Tent was one of them, and since The Forever King didn't appeal to me, and Death Be Not Proud seemed a little boring, I decided to go with The Red Tent, and I wasn't sorry.This book is on my top five favourites list. I thought it was good in the beginning, but I really got into it towards the end. It's very explicitly narrated, but I don't have a problem with that, and so I would warn anyone with a weak stomach or with an intolerance for sex. I also loved how Anita Diamant didn't try to convert her readers to Judaism or Christianity or whatever religion. I loved her prose; it is poetic and graceful; and as I read more I found I couldn't put the book down.Highly reccommended."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This book is worth the read! Lose yourself in a great story and learn about the old testament at the same time. As I read the book I yearned for the type of communion with other women that is spoken of in the book. In our fast-paced society it was healing to escape to a time when women were in tune with their bodies and their hearts and found comfort in eachother. I wanted to finish the book yet didn't want it to end. Just two warnings: the lineage and names are confusing at first and this book is not for the squeamish. Violence and childbirth graphically described."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Technically, The Red Tent is a biblical tale, but in truth, it is much more. While Anita Diamant took the character names and their basic situation from the Book of Genesis, she manages to transcend that simple story, adding flesh and vitality, breathing life into it. And who better than a female author to bring the story of daughters and mothers to life?In fact, the very title is evocative of this life-giving role, for it was here, within the red tents, that women separated to during menstruation and childbirth. Although Diamant is re-imagining a story originally told by men, she liberates the characters, allowing each woman her own flaws, gifts and story.\\"I had four mothers, each of them...giving me different gifts, cursing me with different fears.\\" So begins the complex tale of not only Dinah, Jacob's only surviving daughter, but also of all the women in her life, including the four sisters who are Jacob's wives - Leah, Rachel, Zilpah and Bilhah. Diamant begins with the stories of Dinah's mothers, sharing her fascination over sisters who love, admire, tolerate, counsel, resent and share the same husband. Because Diamant gives each woman such a distinct personality, Dinah's relationship with each is equally unique.Through their stories, a veritable oral history in writing, we learn of the sisters' complex relationships with each other and with Jacob. At times, and perhaps rightly so, Jacob seems to serve merely as a catalyst for the development of the relationships between his wives, and eventually Dinah herself. The female inter-relations transcend even his role as patriarch of this extensive family. When Bilhah offers to bear a son for Jacob on Rachel's behalf, \\"she was lonely walking into her husband's tent alone, without sisters\\".Through Dinah's own story, which comprises the remainder of the novel, the story becomes more personal, transmitting the poignancy of loss, the complexity of love and the strength of forgiveness. Whereas previously this story was about jealousy, wrath and punishment, through Dinah's voice, it becomes one of love, understanding and growth.The Red Tent is Diamant's answer to the question: \\"What if a woman told this biblical story?\\" Her answer is a story lyrical in prose, compelling in the telling and visceral for its scenery and emotion. As Dinah explains at the close of her tale, \\"there is no magic to immortality.\\" Readers will discover, however, that there is magic in the story."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"\\"The Red Tent\\" is a beautifully written, gripping story that had me engrossed from the beginning. The stories of Dinah and the women in her life are rich, compelling, with fascinating attention to details that bring the reader into a different world and time.That said, the book has its flaws. The female characters are complex and multi-faceted, but every male character in the book is flat and two-dimensional. In addition, while the women in the book are all celebrated as heroines (with the exception of Ruti, but she too is left unexplored, a shallow \\"victim\\" character), all the men are evil, ruthless, cruel, perverted, or stupid. There are only two main male characters who are \\"good\\", but even they are superficial characters with no depth to them. Also, some of the scenes seemed unrealistic to me, especially the joy and release Dinah experiences following her final words with Re-mose. As a mother myself, I found that part hard to believe.I also found it odd that an author who seems to have such passion for the monotheistic, Jewish faith would portray her God and Bible in such a negative light. To the contrary, the book appears to celebrate pantheism and feminism, while scorning the Jewish \\"patriarchs\\" and the original story in Genesis.All in all, I enjoyed this book, and as a woman I related to the stories of birth, death, and life in the circle of women. But if you are a man, beware--you may not find many characters in the book that you can relate to or respect."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I read most of the reviews before I bought this book, both negative and positive and decided that this is a MUST read.A wonderfully intelligent decision on my part I might add.I have always questioned the existence of a god, and why so many have unwavering faith. I came to my own opinions about god starting at a young age. Thus, cementing the knowledge of a god-figure is no more than an incredulous fictional tale. The mystery of creation inside a woman's womb has long been the tool for men to use against women by either placing them upon a pedestal or declaring them as wicked creations of the devil. I could never understand how a fictional book which is trusted as truth by some, chose to exclude a woman's perspective. There is no sort of feminine history included within the bible text nor is there any respect for women with these supposed enlightened men. Women are seen as obedient dogs, a vessel for men to seed with no real value other than the creation of life within her womb.So with all this being said, The Red Tent, the account of a woman's perspective gives women a voice regarding the fictional body, which is known as the bible. Our own tale which has forever been absent.This amazing book shows women that we have the strength to change history, the knowledge to change our future, and we are just as important as ALL males. It reminds women we MUST rewrite history by making our voices heard. It is about sisterly love and compassion and respect for what is FEMININE. It creates a maternal bond with women which seems sadly to be dormant today.Reading this story, gave me hope to seek out these connections with my ALL my sisters and to celebrate in the diversity of who we are."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I loved this story, not only because it was well written, but because of the concept around the &quot;Red Tent&quot; or menstrual tent. If women still celebrated their menses like this we wouldn't refer to that time of the month as &quot;the curse&quot;. I wish I had read this book before my daughter started her menses. It would've helped me to celebrate this time with her in a more appropriate fashion. The comradery that existed between these women because of these few days they shared in solitude each month left a lasting impression on me."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I loved the first two sections of this book. We get in on all of the gossip beteween the sisters, and grow to love each one of them for there unique qualities. Dinah was born in the second section, then we learn of her everyday life in Canaan. I liked the third section of the book as well, but as some points it drug on for a while. It also bothered me how they spelled Rebekahs name incorrectly in the book, and I had to go back to my Bible several times to be able to distinguish the fiction from the real story. All in all a good book."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This was an excellent story. I really enjoyed Diamant's fictionalized account of a woman from the old testament. The details she includes of day-to-day life during this time period reflects a lot of research on the part of the author."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I finished this book last night...I had to finish it so that I could get some sleep at night! This book was absolutely wonderful...and hard to put down. As mentioned in other reviews, I suppose it would be hard to read this book if you don't want to consider biblical stories as having other possible perspectives. To me, however, this book was more about growth and maturation...and a certain &quot;centering&quot; that happens when we know to do right (even if it means questioning that accepted authority of the time), know who we are, and where we stand. After having lived through some painful chapters in her life, Dinah learns to savor the sweetness of all things that are good, including her own abilities and contributions to her community. In the end, love is the only thing that really matters anyway."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"The Red Tent by Anita DiamontOne of the more popular historical fictions of the past few years, THE RED TENT by Anita Diamont is the story of one of the lesser known of Jacob's many children, Dinah. Dinah is only mentioned in a few chapters of the book of Genesis. However, while her brothers took a more prominent role in the Old Testament, in THE RED TENT the character of Dinah is given prominence. Her story is told in epic-like fashion that spans several decades, starting from her childhood with her four mothers and her father Jacob, to her days as a woman living in a foreign land. The story of Dinah is the story of what it was like to be a woman thousands of years ago.I am not an expert in the history of this time period, nor am I an expert of the Bible. I cannot say whether any of the historical facts are accurate, and whether Anita Diamont followed the bible (she obviously didn't, if she decided to extrapolate and create a fictional life about Dinah, daughter of Jacob). THE RED TENT, however, is more of a celebration of being a woman than it is a story of a biblical character from the bible. While most of the stories in the bible are focused on strong men, it is refreshing to read a story about a biblical character that is female and who overcomes many hardships to create a life for herself. THE RED TENT was not my favorite book read in 2002, but I can say that it was one of the more unique and interesting books read that year."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"My husband gave me this book for Christmas after the birth of our first child, a daughter, a month before. I do not know if I would have appreciated this tale of the bonds between women and their relationships with the moon and her cycles as much had I not just given birth to a daughter.This story, through its portrayal of women as chattal, actually gives us an understanding of the mystic strength of women and the power they possessed even in such dismal times for women's suffrage. Dinah and her &quot;mothers&quot; each hold a secret strength that enables them to not only survive but triumph over the daily life of their era, which by today's standard (at least in the US), is unthinkable.I especially warmed to the stories of the Red Tent itself and the time the women spent in its shroud.I will give this to my daughter to read when she is old enough."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"The Red Tent was a gift to me from my sister-friend, Diana. I began reading it in late August, 2001...completing it in short time, enjoying every unfolding scene. I began to realize that this &quot;ancient story&quot; is one that has not ended, but has continued over hundreds and hundreds of years.In an effort to take in the events of 9/11...to understand &quot; the roots of our world in conflict&quot; I re-visited The Red Tent and found a story that now has become a daily focus in our media. The story of the tribal woman and her humble, compassionate ways of serving, in order to survive in a world dominated by raw male, animal instinct.; his warring nature. Reading The Red Tent, you will find a study of the roots of men at war and the constant effort of tribal women to plant seeds of love...with each passing of the lunar cycle for them comes a new opportunity. The keys to understanding the mystery of this current cycle of challenges we know as modern life, are given in this wonderful story. I applaude Ms. Diamant's storytelling skill and the colorful pictures she paints with her words. This book is a blessing. Share it with your son, your daughter and your mom...Don't miss it!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Last time I looked, this was a fiction book...not a retelling of the bible. I thoroughly enjoyed this book, thought it was extremely well written and engaging. I then wanted to review the book on Amazon but decided to read some other reviews first.It seems that most of the negative reviews say that the reason they don't like the book is because it doesn't match what the bible says about the characters, or that it is anti-men, too feminist, or that it has too many child birth scenes, etc, etc. Get a life people. I understand that your religion is important to you. Therefore if someone wrote a book about figures in the bible that went against their portrayal in the bible and labeled the book NON-fiction, I guess you would have a reason to be offended. But this is a FICTION novel.For the life of me I will never understand why people can be SO offended by something that supposedly goes against their religion. If you are truly confident in your religious choices, then anything that is said about it, no matter how blasphemous, shouldn't be able to touch you, right? Then why get so offended and scared that people might question it? If you don't feel its true, just ignore it and go on and read the bible over and over again and don't ever have a thought beyond that. Leave the creative thought to the rest of us who actually have an imagination. The people who believe that God sees whats actually in our hearts, not the God who wants to police our literature."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"If you've ever wondered... how a tribe of people could cross the Red Sea, reach the other side, and then record only what Moses said in thanksgiving without giving his prophetess sister more than a verse to spread her wings... if you've ever wondered why we hear so little about Dinah and her significance... if you've ever wondered what the women were doing when they weren't helping Mary and Martha... then you'll enjoy this book thoroughly. I read a review from a disappointed christian who felt it wasn't accurate. Speaking as a person of faith, I recognize it for what it is -- a story, which does not diminish my faith in the least. It's a great read, and I recommend it to anyone who has ever wondered."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I am not a religious person, per sey, so I was not put off of this book by descriptions of sexual relationships, acts, and preferences. Also, I was not familiar with the bible or the story of Dinah before reading this book; that didn't hinder my reading at all, so if you're concered about being confused if you're unfamiliar with the bible, don't be.That being said, this book was one of the best that I have ever read. I came away from it feeling incredibly proud to be a woman; I feel that I have been given a gift that, previously, I was semi-unaware of. I feel powerful. The story of Dinah and her mothers is empowering, and my faith in myself and in my abilities as a woman has been renewed. It's almost as if this book has given me something that I can't exactly explain...\\"The Red Tent\\" will definitely be a title that will remain on my bookself, and I will give it as a gift to all of my female friends. I will read and reread it, and I have a feeling that it will speak different words to me with each reading. Definitely a must for any woman, religious or not."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This is a compelling story through which, as a young (and green) adult male, I have grown a little wiser. I have grown to understand women and their perspective a bit better. The story has quite a few amazing twists that leave you shaken for hours.The novel is definitely the best book I've read in years - simply couldn't put it down."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I finished reading this book at 2:45 am this morning. Being a woman, a mother, a sister, a wife, a person who has wondered aloud about all those silent women in the Bible- this book arrived like a huge white bird and landed right in my living room.It's sad to read reviews that poo-poo the &quot;feminist&quot; point of view.It's also ironic, as you can easily see how the mental, emotional and physical chains of a male dominated society in the time of Joseph and Jacob lead entire societies to commit heinous crimes against each other because some man's gods told him to do so. Today we would recognize their behavior as narcissistic, sociopathic and ego maniacal. Or do we??In the days of Dinah, the woman who tells this rich and lucious story, women only stood up and spoke their truth in the secrecy of the red tent.It is a bold lesson for &quot;religious&quot; women who blindly follow the lead of men. Contemporary women are forming their own &quot;red tents&quot; through discussion groups, gatherings and the renewal of valuable female friendships.Read this book. Be enlightened. Be enveloped. Be engrossed. Be outraged. But read this book.Anita Dimant is a writer with the awesome power bring us into her worlds and to send us home with the smell of lotus in our nostrils and dust from the desert roads on our shoes. Thank you Anita!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"As with many truly good fiction books I couldn't put this book down. I grew up hearing the biblical stories that Anita Diamant uses to weave her own version of Dinah around and I thoroughly enjoyed the new perspective she gives to old legends.I have heard people put this book down because of it's questionable historical content. But to me the beautiful tale of Dinah, her mothers, and the colorful women to which she comes into contact are just as real, albeit gender biased, as the bible itself. If you are looking for a lesson in actual history, you may do better reading something else, especially if you consider the Bible to be a completely accurate account.However if you are looking for a taste of the life of a woman in the time of Genesis; if the magic and wisdom of the maiden, mother and crone are something you seek out; if you are in the mood for a very well written historically based fiction novel, then I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I listened to this as an audio book, while exercising, and I think that enhanced its worth. Read conventionally, it might have struck me as contrived, and its tone as sentimental. Heard, its tone was more authentic, matriarchal, compellingly focused on life from a female, body- and cycle-oriented perspective. I found it to be a truly feminist novel, not in a political sense but in the sense of being saturated with a female, almost gynecological outlook. Its evocation of childbirth, the matrilineal connection and other female verities are among the most compelling and genuine I know."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"The Red Tent captured my full attention from the first sentence. This book is a must read for women on any type spiritual quest. In it I found characters that were so real, I now feel as if they are dear friends. I read this book at least once a year and gift it to every woman in my life. Anita Diamant is an incredible writer, her ability to connect to the universality of the community women create rings as true today as it did in the times women shared space in the menstral tents. Read it, you'll fall in love, cry your eyes out and find lifelong friends in it's pages."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"We have been lost to each other for so long...I am so grateful you have come...Blessings on your eyes. Blessings on your children. Blessings on the ground beneath you. My heart is a ladle of sweet water, brimming over. Selah.&quot;As of 082903, this book is among the Top Ten Most Popular (most registered) Books on BookCrossing.com. It's not hard to see why. It's the kind of book that should be passed from sister to sister, mother to daughter, generation to generation. Women in the Bible have generally been portrayed as virgins or harlots, often serving as postscripts to the more familiar stories of men who begat men. But who gives birth to those men? Strong, splendid, complicated, terrible, beautiful women.Anita Diamant weaves a compelling tale of the most vivid, human characters. Her writing flows like the Nile. Rock on."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I loved this book. I literally could not put it down and I stayed up all night to finish it. The ending in Egypt was nowhere near as good as the beginning, but it gave a satisfactory end to the book. As far as men liking it, my husband thought it was very good too, and he finished it quickly like I did.I think it's interesting that the only people here who don't seem to like the book are very religious people."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Anita Diamant's superb book takes the well known story of Jacob and his 12 sons and gives voice to the women long silent. This work of historical fiction explores the experiences of the women in relation to their men as well as the relationships between the women.The first half of the book is the story of Jacob's four wives: their love for the same man, their conflicts, and the bond between sisters and women. Each month the women join together in the red tent for several days. Rather than a source of disgrace, the book gives a reaffirming message of what it means to be a women and worships the ability to give life, which the mothers pass on to their daughter Dinah .As interesting as the relationships between the characters, the book presents a myriad of the religious practices of the time. Througout the book we see that the women continue to practice their own religious beliefs, until a dramatic conflict with Jacob. In the second half of the book, the reader is able to catch a glimpse of Egyptian gods and godesses. However, these mentions are often brief and may leave one wanting to hear more and explore the level of monotheism that was really practiced.The second half of the book follows Dinah into Egypt after she flees tragedy in Canaan. The second half is less interesting than the first, but the reading is fast and moves quickly. The portrayal of Joseph is a far cry from his broadway persona and there is little in the way of explanation for why he has become the greedy selfish man that he is.Dinah's sotry ends with a bitterswee tone. After seeing her family from afar at her father's death, she receives some sense of reconciliation from the family that remains. After returning to Egypt, Dinah dies surrounded by loved ones and returns to her waiting mothers. The ending offers some conclusion to the divides within her family and we see that life continues on."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"As other reviews have noted, this book is historical fiction. It takes the portion of Genesis dealing with Jacob and his wives, and later with the rape of Dinah, and rewrites them from the perspective of Jacob's only daughter, Dinah. Through her eyes, we see the cameraderie and jealousies of Jacob's four wives, Leah, Rachel, Zilpah and Billah. We get a fully developed sense of their personalities. We are treated to a speculation of what life was like for women in pre-Christian times. Finally, we learn about the life of Dinah, who is barely mentioned in the bible, but who in Diamant's novel leads a full, rich life.This is a wonderfully imagined novel. Diamant speaks with such an air of authority, and her characters are so richly created, that I had to keep reminding myself that this book is, indeed, a novel. Women in the bible are rarely given a voice. Unfortunately, this is true throughout so much of history. Here, however, the women's experiences are in the forefront, and are just as compelling as the men's stories. This is a beautiful tale of mothers and their children set during a time when such stories were never really told. Very original and highly recommended."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Anita Diamant is a very talented writer who draws you into her story with her emotional highs and lows. Throughout the book I felt that each woman should have a story to tell and leave it in such a poetic way. I appreciated the respectful place she gave to woman and mothers.This is of course HER story. There are more contradictions than parrellels with the original Biblical story. In order to really enjoy it I had to remind myself that this was her story throughout the book. I think she should have followed the Biblical account more closely or written her story without using the biblical characters and names.I wished that the author would have left us with more hope.A sad ending from my viewpoint."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"It is not surprising that Anita Diamant's book garners 1 star from some reviewers and 5 stars from others. As a novel it is engaging and memorable; the story of an ordinary girl who becomes a woman and the time and family she lives in. What offends some people and fascinates others is the heroine and her family are religious icons in three major religions. Fleshing out details and imagining alternative events is part of the relgious tradition of at least two of the religions (and arguably the third.) If you find speculation and imagination about relgious topics undesirable, then this book is clearly not for you. If, on the other hand, you find the thoughts and meditations of others about religious matters stimulates thinking and reflection of your own, then this is a book to read.The author's characterization of some biblical figures is far from my own, for others her \\"take\\" is quite close to what I imagine. For example. I admit that I have always thought that Essau got short shrift in the bilical tales and I like his depiction here. If you want the old stories told the old way look elsewhere."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"DO read this book! The characters are dusted off and brought to vivid life - you will care so much what happens to them. The natural acceptance of the cycles of women's lives, both physical and emotional, is refreshingly welcome. Didn't want this to end, yet couldn't stop turning the pages. I could read this book twenty times and still come out with something new."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This may be the most beautiful book that I have ever read. It is the story of Jacob's family from Genesis (about chapters 29 through 50) as told through the voice of Dinah, the only daughter of Jacob. We hear little of Dinah in the finished product of Genesis. The story goes that she is raped by the prince of Shechem, and her father, Jacob is offered a hefty brideprice from the king, but demands that all the men of Shechem be circumsized. Surprisingly, they agree and all the men, including King and prince, go under the knife. On the third day of their recovery, the sons of Jacob slaughter all of the men of Shechem and plunder the city. We hear nothing else about Dinah. It's a disconcerting story and it leaves me begging for all the behind-the-scenes details that the Bible leaves out. There happens to be a Jewish tradition called Midrash where the imaginations of God's people fill in the blanks that the Bible leaves us.Anita Diamant follows in this tradition and makes a remarkable contribution to it. The Red Tent is a very human perspective of the biblical story, bringing to life the polytheistic culture and their connection and dependence to the things of the earth. It imagines possible motivations, reactions, emotions, and relationships of the family that are left out of the biblical telling of the story. The \\"red tent\\" is meeting place for the women of the family during the \\"new moon\\" of their menstruation and it is an image of the strong sense of womanhood that is celebrated in the book. It is refreshing to hear the biblical story from a woman's voice. After reading it, I told my wife I feel like I understand her better.I was a biblical studies major at Messiah College and this major gave me a more human understanding of the Bible, knowing that the authors were the people of God trying to interpret their own history. This point of view helps me deal with a lot of disconcerting passages in the Hebrew Bible/Old Testament such as Dinah's tale. The Red Tent gives me a story which adds vision and imagination to this point of view. It is artfully written and reading it was to be a participant in something beautiful."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"although this angle on the biblical story of Dinah is fictional, I found the details on ancient midwifery breathtaking...I'm even more proud to be a woman after reading this book &amp; the happy ending is worth all the pain in the first 2/3s of the book"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I need a book to have detailed, interesting characters in order to keep my attention and grab at my heartstrings. This book had them. There were many characters but each was rich with characteristics that empowered me to create them in my own head. Just having had my first child, I was very interested in the midwifery tales and the mother-daughter bonds in the book. I don't over-analyse books but it is hard to find one that I remain interested in enough to finish it and this was definitely one I would recommend and someday read again."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"After reading the story of Genesis I was urged by a friend to read The Red Tent. I must admit this was the best read that I've had in a long time.This novel paints a picture that provides texture and substance to the story of Genesis. Although the depictions are only half truths it enlightens you to what could have or even may have occurred. Dinah's story is filled with far more significance than that of the bible and you feel her plight and the betrayal that was handed to her. The story of her four mothers, Leah, Rachel, Bilhah and Zilpah was engrossing and potent.This is a novel that I will definitely read again and again!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This was one of the best books I have ever read. I loved hearing this bibical story from a womans point of view. This is the story of Jacob and his sons from Dinah his daughters point of view. This is an Excellent read! A must!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Perhaps not the &quot;best written&quot; novel in the world, but it does lend a new perspective to life as a woman in biblical times. Also fleshes out the Jacob stories, and really makes you appreciate living in this century. I found it very entertaining and a solid read.... well worth the trip!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"The Red Tent brought clearly to mind the timelessness and beauty of mother-daughter relationships, not only in our own family but between women of all cultures. It reminds us that whether you live now, then, in the United States or Afghanistan, it is family, love and truth that endures"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Any time an author writes about even marginal biblical characters, it is hard to know how it will be received. I can understand how some people might be offended by this book. I don't think I would recommend it everyone. Yet it is a very beautiful story of Dinah, only daughter of Jacob, sister to the Twelve Tribes of Israel.The author has told a woman's story. Biblically, the Israelites do not yet exist at this point, since Jacob is to become Israel only after the birth of his sons. God was only beginning to reveal Himself to a family He was forming one son at a time.It makes sense that at that time there were still many people who worshipped other gods, the Great Mother, etc. The place of woman in society was secondary to a man's. That the women would try to preserve what was theirs: their meeting place, the place where they were women together, where to be a woman was not a curse, is plausable. The fictional character Dinah is very believable. She tries to make the best of her situations, learns to suffer and rebuild her life. She triumphs.It's a very well written story. I look forward to Ms. Diamant's next book."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"My stars! Such a beautiful story. This is the story of Dinah. The daughter of Jacob mentioned in the Bible. There isn't much mentioned of Dinah in Genesis, but Diamant uses her brilliant talent and imagination to weave a story so heartwarming that you wish that it were actually in the Bible.This story is told in Dinah's voice. We get a look at how Dinah viewed her life as a child and young woman growing up in Canaanite society. I was connected to Dinah and the story of her mothers from page one. I was emotionally moved at practically every page. One page I was smiling or laughing. Another page, I was brought to tears.A magnificent book!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I don't know exactly what it was about this book, but I felt so liberated and enlightened when I finished reading it! It makes me proud to be a woman! I recommend it to men and women of all ages."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I was intrigued from the very first sentence of this book. In this piece of fictional history, Anita Diamant gives a voice to women whose stories have long been forgotten or ignored. She does a favor to all women by reviving this sisterhood. The Red Tent is one of my top 5 favorite books. I recommend it to everyone that I know."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I was a little hesitant to read it, simply because I kept hearing it was a &quot;woman's book&quot; surrounding &quot;menstruating in a tent&quot;. The beginning was a little dull, but stick with it, once you get to know the women, you will live with them throughout this religious era and come to get a perspective of what it would have been like to live in those times. I didn't have any biblical background and was able to follow the story. It is not a &quot;light&quot; read though, if you are a Bridgette Jones/Love story reader, this is not for you."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This book is an incredible reweaving of a biblical myth. Although it is fiction and some dislike facts being changed, they benefit the story that is being told. It offers a wonderful perspective. As a pagan woman I was engrossed from start to finish. I picked it up and did not put it down once until I finished it. I thought this story was brilliant and masterfully told. Highly recommended!!!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I read this book during my pregnancy. It left me with a feeling that birthing and motherhood are great events and rights of passage. Though this may not stricktly follow the Bible's orriginal story, it is an excellent read. I could not put it down. I laughed and cried my way throught it. Books like this, told in first person, with an ever unfolding events make me want more from the same author.Well done Anita D!!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I loved this book--I couldn't put it down. I read it in 3 daysIt had such detail and what is amazing is that the author uses characters from the bible. It is written as if the bible were written by a woman. The characters were so real. It is a fantastic book."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"My husband and I chose to read The Red Tent aloud becausenovels with strong story lines are good for that kindof reading. We've just finished it, and I would saythat it's more of an epic tale, the entire saga of awoman's life (and beyond, for it begins before herlife on this earth does, and goes into the future, aswell). It is the story of Dinah, who is mentioned asthe daughter of Jacob in Genesis 34, and the terribletale of what happens to her contained there iswonderfully retold in The Red Tent.First, I have to say, this is a \\"chick book.\\" Thewriter is very detailed about the life of women andtheir bodies, and the book is very focused on thewives of Jacob, and Dinah's part in this as she growsup. But what I found the most interesting about thiswas that even though Christians and Jews know Jacob inthe Bible as a patriarch of their religion, this book,written by a woman who has penned such titles as\\"Choosing a Jewish Life,\\" \\"The New Jewish Baby Book\\"and \\"How to be a Jewish Parent,\\" is not focused onreligion or religious feeling. Dinah's mothers (Leah,her biological mother, and the other three wives ofJacob, Rachel, Bilhah and Zilpah) worship, some morecasually than others, various goddesses. Leah andRachel's father has family and household gods(mentioned in Genesis), and the supernatural incidentof Jacob wrestling with the angel is very gentlyglossed.I found Diamant's tone to be somewhat distant, and herlanguage a little cold, but by the end of the story, Icould see why the writer might have made a consciouschoice to do this. It befits an epic, one might say.And her treatment of the event that is told in theBible about Dinah and her brothers' murders of theShechemites haunts the rest of the book as one mightbe traumatized for life after witnessing an atrocityin youth.I should also mention that the book is interesting onan anthropological level, though, I do not know howsure we can be of the accuracy of Diamant'sdescriptions of life in the Middle East during OldTestament times, but her acknowledgments give creditto scholarly institutions, resources and colleagues. Ifound this aspect of the book very engaging, and Ithink it will inform my reading of the Old Testamentfor some time to come."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"this is a great book...i loved it. it tells the story of dinah, a remarkable woman with a huge heart. from her mothers stories to her life, this is a wonderful book. Anita Diamant, you have written an amazing book."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"My daughters have also read this book, and each of us has been affected differently by it. I am in middle-age. Looking back on my own life, I'm able to see &quot;the what-ifs&quot;; to know how the choices I made affected the long-term; to accept the bad I have known as well as the good, because it put me where I am today. I know that Life is bitter-sweet, and that the bitter makes the sweet taste sweeter. &quot;The Red Tent&quot; gives this lesson, along with Hope in the midst of despair, and Compassion that grows from deeply-healing wounds. This beautifully-written book uses a familiar story, pulled into the light of what human life is really like. It was an honor for me to step inside Dinah's life."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Ms. Diamant's novel, &quot;The Red Tent,&quot; is such a wonderful concept - biblical characters seen from a woman's point of view. Wonderful read!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This was an amazing book. After hearing people talk about it for a while I finally decided to pick it up and read it. The start of the book was wonderful. I love how it started out with the 4 mothers and then how it got into Dinah's story. Dinah was a wonderful charactor with an intersting story. The first two parts had me hooked. The last part I found it bit hard to get into but I liked it.I love this book and hope to read more similar storys to this."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I had read everything else that the airport bookstore had to offer and so finally broke down and bought The Red Tent. Was I surprised! What a delicious, wonderful, historical, emotional and passionate novel!! The reader is introduced to the many wives of Jacob (Book of Genesis) and their proficiencies and charms each by Dinah, Jacob's only daughter (and as the only woman in her generation - left to continue to hand down the tales, traditions, foods, etc.). The Red Tent is the place where women go to \`be women\\": pass their menstruations, give birth, prepare for marriage, and when they are ill. This wonderful place becomes the \\"women's room\\", the place for the younger ones to learn and the older ones to teach, and place to go if one is ill and need of comfort.The first half of this book, filled with the sweet remembrances of the women in the red tent; their stories and their skills (midwifery, cooking, gardening, herbs, sewing) is the dearest - it is amongst these mothers that Dinah learns to become a midwife. There is something powerful and beautiful about women celebrating what they are all about. The novel changes somewhat when Dinah tells us the tale of Jacob's family's move into the land of Canaan (to flee the oppressive nature of Laban, the father of Rachel and Leah). Near urban life, Dinah is tempted by the excitement of the city, and the new extended family (Jacob's brother Esau's family). What happens to Dinah in this book is more satisfying that as it is suggested in the bible. In this tale, she is in love with the Prince Shalem and he with her. They are to be wed, but in Shakepearan tragedy, Dinah's brothers (believing she has been raped by Shalem) fall upon the city and murder Shalem and many others. While not a happy event, it is more satisfying, obviously, to believe that Dinah experienced true love. She gives birth to a baby boy and flees with Shalem's mother to Egypt where the boy is raised. In her later years, a much-subdued Dinah eventually stumbles upon her dearest younger brother, Joseph (of technicolor coat fame), she sees her son grown, and she falls in love again. This is a wonderful novel about the value and continuity of the women in history and one I am sorry I waited so long to pick up and read."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"You won't start to love this book until you read the last twenty pages where you are finally targeted back to the original biblical story it depicts.y Anita Diamant does not put a single effort into arousing the reader's emotions; perhaps she is even avoiding any emotion at all.Nevertheless, you can not help but sympathize with Dinna, as though she is your own self. One can sense what she senses- eventhough her senses are more or less ancient;this unconcious arousal of emotions is pure art and what you will enjoy when reading this literary piece.The Rent Tent is no doubt a masterpiece."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I read the entire book in one day. I couldn't stop reading it; it was so beautifully written, so compelling, and I just had to find out what happened! I have never read a book that fast in my life!!! It's a very intense, very affirming book for those rediscovering women-based spirituality."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I just loved this book. Most of my reading is fiction, the odd biography and a rare science fiction, so I'll read a wide range of books. The Red Tent was reccommended by a friend, and I'm so glad that I took her advice. The story was well written. Usually I enjoy books with more dialogue, but the author has such a way with words that you get a very clear picture without excessive description. The story seems very real as you read and it made me want to sit and read it cover to cover in one sitting. It certainly is on my top 10 book list."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Really 4.5 *'s. I was first put off by the description of this book. My mother told me that it was about the women in the bible.....just did not really grab my attention. Regardless I picked this book out for my book club anyway. We just loved it. Diamant took different stories from the bible and filled in fictional events. It was so good. I loved how she brought us into these individual's lives, describing so much that is so foreign to us. Read it with a friend so that you can discuss the lives of these women."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"While undeniably conjecture, it is refreshing and interesting to catch a glimpse of biblical stories completely from a woman's perspective. Long overdue and well done. On the top of my recommendations."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"To me, I know I've read a truly good book when I have a hard time coming back to reality after I've read it. This is one of those books that I became so absorbed in that I lived it. And I re-live it each time I reread it. I'm sad that I have to come back to my own world each time I finish it.Diamant has done an excellent job turning a few unemotional biblical details into a novel that captures the flavor of the historical time it covers, particularly from a woman's perspective - but also just in general. It is to me a clear case of fiction being truer than fact. The characters come alive, have personalities and motivations that you just can't discern from the biblical version.While it differs from the biblical story in many details, this actually alerted me to things I had missed in the Old Testament version of the story - the teraphim, the handmaidens... as well as giving me the perspective: &quot;Hey, I never thought of it that way, and I bet it did happen like that back then!&quot;."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This book is excellent and tells a fascinating tale of the women from the beginning of the bible. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"An easy, yet wonderful, read. I wanted to skip my vacation just to sit in the hotel and finish this book! Some men might even enjoy this book, but I would imagine its magic to shine brighter in the eyes of a woman."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I am an avid book-reader, and found this to be one of the best books I have ever read. I didn't think I would like historical fiction. I always thought it would be too much like &quot;history.&quot; But it's not. It is an amazing story in which I was totally absorbed. I couldn't put it down and finished in 2 days."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I can't find the words to descibe the connectedness I found with the main character of this book. If I had the funds I would buy it for everyone I know. This has been by far one of the best reading experiences I have ever had. So much was accomplished in it's three-hundred and some pages. I look forward to reading it again as well as this author's other writings. Full of female yayness!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"When I first picked up Anita Diamant's \\"The Red Tent\\", I assumed it would be a novel that I could only appreciate as an outsider. For one thing, I've never read the Bible and don't know anything about life in Ancient Canaan; I don't come from a large or particularly close-knit family; and, last but not least, I'm not a woman. Yet, always interested in experiences which differ from my own (yes, I do think it's very important to try to understand something about the other 51% of the world's population), I decided to give \\"The Red Tent\\" a shot... and absolutely loved it.True, it is difficult for me to identify directly with some of the situations in this novel - giving birth, to give one notable example - but I think Diamant's story is universal enough to be enjoyed by everyone, regardless of gender. We all know what it's like to grow up, to fight with our families, to feel like an outsider. We all, at one point or another, experience lose, pain, joy and happiness. And we all, ideally, know what it's like to be loved and supported. Diamant's treatment of these experiences and these emotions make this book a joy to read and a shame to put down. The characters are fascinating throughout and Diamant's obvious compassion for them (the central female characters at least) help them come to life for the reader. Through the voice of Dinah we experience the joys and the sorrows of early family life in Canaan, and then (not to give too much away) the heartbreaking effects of death and jealousy which throw the tribe of Jacob into chaos. From a stylistic point of view, Diamant's use of imagery and symbolism is also very interesting (pay attention to her use of blood, the moon, and water). This is one of those very rare books that takes you to a distant time and place, yet is still able to teach you something about your own life as well.Overall, this is a hauntingly beautiful novel that I would recommend to everyone and anyone!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This book was purchased for a library reading group. I thought the book was OK but I do not think it is appropriate for a mixed group discussion."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"If the Bible had been written by a group of women this is what it may have been like. As we follow the story of Dinah, whose brother was Joseph of the Amazing Technicolor Coat fame, we see how Bible history unfolds through the eyes of a female. Treated indifferently by the men of her family she bonds with her mothers and aunties during their time in the red tent. The red tent is a place where the tribeswomen went for a period of days during their moon cycle. Here they gave birth, passed their monthly courses, grew old, and passed on their knowledge to each other.As we follow Dinah through her early years and adolescence, we witness her coming of age and becoming one with mother earth. We watch her personal growth as she learns to love, to lose, and to love again. We watch as she trades the family of her youth for the family of her maturity.Biblical history takes a back seat here, giving the story just enough to form the backdrop of a powerful story. Dinah's brother Joseph is portrayed more realistically in this story as a man who wears his celebrity amongst the Egyptians as a heavy yoke instead of a crown. He becomes much more human.The characters in The Red Tent became so much alive for me that I hated to see the story end. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This book was very compelling. I could not put it down. Please do not miss this page turner. Please realize it is fiction and as such threatens no religious beliefs. Enjoy."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"The Red Tent, by Anita Diamant is an amazing fictional retelling of the story of Dinah in the Bible, told from the perspective of Dinah herself. Anita Diamant's words come to life on the paper, allowing you to experiance the story first hand. You will smell the spices in Leah's cooking, toil with Rachel as she struggles to bring yet another life into the world, be enraptured in the mystery of Zilpah's legends, and grieve with Dinah over the loss of a loved one. You are able to connect with each character at a very personal level and sometimes even consume the character entirely as yourself. There were times throughout the book that I myself felt as if I were Dinah tearing my father apart with my bitter words, or crying uncontrollably as I held my dead husband in my arms.I would recommend this for a reader that is well versed in the Bible. Although the story does stray from the one told in the Bible, it is beautifully written and an emotionally enthralling read. Being well versed with the story of DInah in the Bible allowed me to better connect with the characters and have extra insight into the lives of some of the characters whose histories and futures are otherwise unspoken of. However, this is a wonderful book for those that don't know a thing about the Bible and are just looking for a very emotionally attaching, page turner that they aren't afraid to cry in front of."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"A friend let me borrow her copy immediately when she discovered that I had not read this book. I loved it. I bought a copy for my sister. It is a book for all women to read. It surely will touch you. The book is very hard to put down once you get started. I just kept wanting to see what happened next."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"The Bible lightly mentions a girl named Dinah in Genesis 34, but all we hear about her is how she is ravished by a prince. Diamant couldn't let this poor girl be ignored any longer. In The Red Tent, Dinah's life blooms into full color and we get to fall in love with a ficticious embelishment of this Biblical character. There was a lot more sexual language than in the book than I thought there would be, but I earned a deeper apprication for this girl and her family members, who get a lot more recognition nowadays than she does (her father is Jacob and her twelve brothers are the leaders of the twelve tribes of Isreal). The sex in this book was a little disturbing because I didn't expect it, but I had a lot of fun with the story."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"#1-I enjoyed reading about the everyday life of bibical women.#2-The old saying, What doesn't destroy you, only makes you stronger is never more apparent than in this book for the main character in this book. You almost gain strenght from reading about her.#3-Not only is there hardship, but also love, some joy and certain lonliness that I really related with.#4-I enjoy seeing the main character finding her strengths through her weaknesses and becoming a strong individual who found her own kinds of happiness in spite of her hardships."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This is a novel for people who are either familiar or unfamiliar with the Old Testament. As Horace observed, the purpose of literature is to delight and to instruct. The Red Tent does both. Diamant's story delights the reader because Dinah's life is an adventure. Her years filled with great love, friendship, adversity, fear, anxiety, and contentment. These are the elements of a full, rich life. Diamant teaches her readers the intimate details of an Old Testament woman's lot in life. She weaves the culture's traditions, customs,laws,and superstitions into Dinah's story.It is a novel about women, but men should read it too because they come away with a better understanding of what it is to be a girl, a wife, and a mother."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This book sat on my bedside stand for several months as I passed over it in favor of every other book on the bookshelf. I don't recall very much about the stories from the Bible, and I just didn't think I'd be able to understand The Red Tent, let alone enjoy it. I finally took the book on vacation with me, and resorted to picking it up during a bout of insomnia - I was sure it would put me right to sleep. Wrong! I stayed up the entire night reading this book, and found the characters and stories fascinating, horrifying, wonderful, and gut-wrenchingly tragic. This book has remained my absolute favorite book ever since that night four years ago when I finally picked it up, and couldn't put it down."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Obviously, the author is making up most of the book; it is, after all, fiction. However, there is a bit too much distortion from the original inspiration. Joseph turning into an arrogant bisexual was difficult to believe.The characters were often two-dimensional and, after a while, quite predictable. Dinah, for example, falls in love instantly, knowing that the man she has just met is good, kind and a wonderful lover merely from the look in his eyes. This perfect stranger fortunately has the identical feeling, and the two fall into perfect harmony in an instant. Harlequin Romance, anyone?What REALLY bugged me, however, was the founding premise that ALL the women of the tribe gathered together (in the red tent) during the new moon to bond and celebrate their menses. Nobody seemed to have cramps, either; it was just an extended pajama party. Also, apparently, during that time, not only was everyone's period *exactly* 28 days, not only were they all perfectly synchronized, but they all menstruated specifically during the new moon! Oh, and menopause consists of a sudden cessation of menses one month and no other symptoms. Riiight.It's fine with me to take literary license with Biblical stories, but don't try to deny basic biology. I don't think the human female has changed that much in a few thousand years."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This book was a challenge to read. I finished it specifically so I could write a review for others. While the book is written well, talented story-telling with deliciously disgusting details for readers who love a twist, it is historically inaccurate and a blasphemis portrayal of the real Bible characters. I wish the author had used other names for the characters, as her account of Dinah's life detracts and misleads others from understanding the original Biblical character Dinah.The themes in this book are pretty much sex and idol worship, to the point of obsession as all other sub-themes revolve around these two. They also appear to be how women have control over men as well, which is another common theme - radical feminism. Beastiality, rape, and sodomy are encountered on occasion. Dinah's coming of age where her Red Tent sisters insert an idol inside her vagina to break the hymen upon her first menstruation was particularly disgusting.For readers who are interested in the story of Dinah, I would suggest another historical fiction novel: \\"Grace in Thine Eyes,\\" by Liz Curtis Higgs. It is the fourth in her \\"Thorn in My Heart\\" series that mirrors the life of Biblical characters Jacob, Leah, Rachel, and Dinah."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"\\"The Red Tent\\" is an amazing and extremely compelling story. I was really captivated by the characters and everything that happens to them. Dinah makes for a great lens and an interesting voice. However, I was not a huge fan of the writing style. It was a bit confusing at times and overall way too touchy-feely for me."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I absolutely love this book. I have read it so many times that the pages began to fall apart from the stem's binding. This book exudes passion, love, deceit, self realization, history, mystery and so much more. The words tend to fly off the pages whenever I read this book. Anita Diamant did a wonderful job creating a fictional extension (the female perspective) to a non fictional character and foundation."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I found this book very interesting in many ways! The dynamics between sisters, mothers and daughters, daughters and elders - amazing tales! I also find Jacob's relationship with his wives intriguing! I am now on my second read and am starting to have questions which I may not find the answers for, but really appreciate the thoughts this book has started!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I loooooove this book. My Catholics girlfriend from work recommended this book to me; I am Baptist and it connected us in so many ways.I never thought to think about the women's point of view. I love that this book gives the women a voice. I cried, laughed at the moments of this book."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Incredibly well written...grips you from the beginning, even if you are not familiar with the bible. A very new point of view."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"The sexual and day to day lives of women BC. The evolution of the midwifery role and the invisibility of women in the family structure is explored beautifully."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I really, really loved this book! Such an intriguing story. All I've ever known of Dinah is what the bible has to say- that she was &#34;taken and subdued&#34; by the Egyptians and then there's the whole revenge rampage her brothers go on. Of course, not much in the bible is about women so women's lives in biblical times has always been such a mystery. This book was wonderfully written and, while we'll never really know if it's accurate, it felt very realistic and believable. Dinah and all of the many other women in this book are such strong, rounded characters with much more depth than I could have ever thought of. The descriptions were just incredible and rich and wonderful. I didn't want it to end! It's so interesting to me, to see a common story like that of Dinah, taken to the next level."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"How do I review this book, seriously??! THE RED TENT came to me highly recommended, and now it is included in my favorite books of all time. Go read it.It only took me 2-3 days to read, but THE RED TENT went with me everywhere - planes, trains, and automobiles, everywhere! There was no way I was putting this book down! Unfortunately for my friend and fellow book-lover, Fran, who loaned me this book, I owe her another copy, because this poor book looks like it crossed continents and went through customs. I'm so sorry, Fran!Let me start from the beginning. A few months ago, I was invited to join a new book club. During our first meeting, we thought it would be fun to discuss our favorite books. Listed among the group were: A Tree Grows In Brooklyn, East of Eden, The Glass Castle, Little Women, The Kite Runner, Pillars of the Earth, Room, Still Missing, and other books that were among my favorites as well. Among the books, there was one book I had not read, THE RED TENT. Everyone was shocked that I had not yet read The Red Tent, nor had I heard of it before (I know, I know!), so a copy of the book was thrust into my hands with the assignment to read it post haste!It took me a little while to pick it up, because I was a bit intimidated by the plot. I know the story of Jacob, Joseph and his brothers (thanks to Andrew Lloyd-Webber) but my overall knowledge of bible stories is severely lacking. Once I got rolling, it didn't matter. Anita Diamant took Jacob's bible story and expanded it to include details of his wives and his only daughter, Dinah.THE RED TENT is a celebration of women - their bodies, their minds, their hearts, and the bonds that tie them together. Brilliantly written!It was highly recommended to me, and now I highly recommend it to you!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I STARTED READING &quot;THE RED TENT&quot; TWO DAYS AGO AND NOW I RESENT ANY INTERRUPTIONS. IT IS ONE OF THE MOST ENRICHING, ENLIGHTING AND INSPIRING BOOKS I HAVE EVER READ. IT WAS RECOMMENDED TO ME BY ONE OF THE WOMEN IN MY DISCUSSION GROUP AT OUR TEMPLE WHICH IS CALLED &quot;GOD TALK&quot;. EACH WEEK WE DISCUSS THOUGHT PROVOKING TOPICS CENTERED ON THE TORAH, BIBLE AND OUR EVERDAY LIVES. I AM GOING TO SUGGEST THE GROUP READS THIS BOOK AND DISCUSSES IT FULLY. IT WOULD MAKE A WONDERFUL BOOK CLUB SELECTION FOR ANYONE AND I MEAN ANYONE. POWERFUL AND PROVOCATIVE! A MUST READ MANY TIMES OVER."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"When checking THE RED TENT out at the library, it seemed as if it was a departure from my ordinary reading choices. I enjoy romances, mystery, intrigue, historical fiction and humor. I was enchanted with the fact that the book contained all of these. I found that the womens' trips into the red tent were indeed, something to envy. Our society is so fast paced that the thought of spending three days with the ladies of my family on a regular basis would be a dream come true. I enjoyed the literary license that Ms. Diamant took with the reuniting of Dinah with Joseph. I too picked up my Bible to check story lines. The characters were written so that each person had such a distinct personality that the diverse/ethnicity of their names made them easy to follow. It was a tough book to put down. I look forward to more of the same."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Anita's Diamant's previous books on Jewish life showed a wonderful writing style. Now, her first novel shows that biblical characters can be brought to life in a fascinating tale of sisterhood, love, deceit and revenge. Looking at the biblical story from a woman's point of view makes the story strong."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"The deep flowing themes of a woman's life are so poignantly captured in this book that it will stir any mother or woman's soul. The agonies and joys, the intense pain and deep-rooted ecstasy experienced by these women transcends ages and speaks to their sisters today.Yet upon closing this book I found myself disappointed. Diamant pumped life and passion into these women of Genesis but failed to make the story a believable interpretation of the biblical account. The bible, written by women, would still have been God-inspired; it wouldn't have been &quot;The True Story of Jacob, Laban, Joseph...&quot; And while even the biblical portrayal of these men does not make them out to be super-human saints, Diamant depicts them as barbaric tyrants who follow the lead of an almost misogynistic god. Her heroines worship instead a mother goddess who is in tune with the lives and cycles of women.In taking liberties with scripture to write this fictional account of Dinah, Diamant writes beautifully about the inner lives of the women in the red tent, but regrettably fails to capture the aspect of their God, who understands perfectly the intimate enigma of woman.Poignant, stirring, but far from uplifting and sadly unsound in its most baisic structure, &quot;The Red Tent&quot; is nearly there but very far."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I completely agree with Beutler on this book. I was very interested and excited to read this book and when I got into it, it just made me sick. I questioned if I should continue reading it to \\"give it a chance\\" but I find myself struggling. The story is not based on facts and she is fully aware of it. She feels that she has the liberty to change the facts and then tries to justify it. Something so clear in the bible of Jacob working 7 years for Rachel- she states they negotiated to 7 months then adds in the end of the book that time is irrelevant as they did not have a calendar back then...If the bible says 7 yeas, why change the facts? After this point I continued to find false statements about Rachel and her sister.It is a good read if you are not aware and have knowledge of the biblical text. But it is not even close to what the bible represents. DO NOT READ! She claims it is biblical when it is clearly not."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"As a new mother, I felt this book pulled at my heart strings - following a girls journey from childhood into womanhood and then to motherhood. You learn to love Dinah early in the story and wish she would never grow up - but she must stand the trials of her mothers before her and learn her place in the universe as a mother, daughter, wife, and sister. Don't listen to people complaining about the lack of biblical accuracy - that's why it is called \\"BIBLICAL FICTION\\" and the Bible is mostly fiction anyway so I don't know what the big deal is. I initially thought it would be very religious, but there is no propaganda in it. I am not Jewish or Christian, but I found the story captivating and finished in just a couple of days because I couldn't put it down."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This is a well-written, easy to read novel. Because the author's style is not complex, this novel is very good entertainment. All of that being said, I was sorely disappointed in The Red Tent.I was expecting an historical novel based on the book of Genesis in which the theology was consistent with that expressed in Genesis, and in which the basic cultural aspects of the story were consistent with those put forth by theologians and historians. Instead what I got was a subtle, post-modern mishmash of radical feminism, new-age deism, and animism. It's ironic that the familial relationships portrayed in the story are more akin to 21st century suburban New England than the Canaan that existed 4000 years ago. The plot should in no way be considered to be anything more than a fanciful interpretation of the story of Jacob's tribe from the book of Genesis. In fact, it inspired me to think of a modern equivalent in which President John F. Kennedy was running the USA by taking orders from the Pope. Hmmm, there may be a decent novel there. . .Of course, this is fiction, and the story is crafted well. But if the reader wants a story that better reflects the message in Genesis (or the Torah), he would be better served by the novels by Francine Rivers about the matriarchs."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This book is so compelling,it grabs you from page one and dares you to put it down! Definately a 'woman's book'. If you are a mother, you will have a new appreciation for your life after reading this book. I recommend it to all women, but to mothers especially."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I finished the book this morning. I was stunned.Yes, it was well written -- but I'm afraid that's all the good that can be said for it. If you're looking for embellishment of the Old Testament account of Jacob, Leah, Rachel and of Dinah, forget it.This wasn't embellishment -- it was poetic license gone mad. Jacob work for seven years to marry Rachel? Aw, heck -- Ms. Diamant apparently didn't believe any man could *possibly* love a woman *that* much -- and just cut it down to seven months. Dinah raped by a prince (and the subsequent revenge of Jacob's sons)? She got the revenge part down -- but, well, Dinah actually didn't get *raped* -- she immensely enjoyed the whole incident. According to the author, that is. (Poor Dinah).What is interesting is that this book is being hailed as a &quot;new look at an old story&quot;. In fact, it doesn't do that at all -- it makes a mockery of it all instead.Jacob is originally portrayed as a nice guy turned idiot. His &quot;god&quot; (as the author puts it) is barely mentioned and, when He is, grossly insulted (a huge chip on the shoulder of the author, perhaps?)Who *is* mentioned repeatedly, however, is probably every damn silly pagan god in that area at the time -- and the worship of them is portrayed as noble. How's this: Dinah ends up in Egypt, apparently forgets her own Judaic gods, and starts worshipping the Egyptian gods instead. Hey, whatever god happens to be handy, I guess. No wonder the God of Moses became popular.One last note: the red tent is where women went to have their menses and give birth and do woman stuff. Sounds like a great idea. But again, the reason for doing so is based on paganism. (There was a god for the first menses, a god for birth, a god for this, that, blah blah blah). Take away the pagan gods, and the whole reason for the red tent ceases to exist.Bottom line: If you are a believer of either the Judaic or Christian faith, prepare to be insulted by this book. (If you're Pagan, you'll love it).And really, do we even *need* red tents anymore? Of course not. Now pass the Midol."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"She (the author) is very good but what I did not like was to take the characters in the Bible and make up stories about them. I cherish the Word of God and take great offense to her liberality with the Word. She said that either people love what she does or hate it. I disliked what she did very much. She is a great story teller but not with characters in the Bible."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This book is a truly insightful and amazing look into life during biblical times.... from a woman's point of view. Beautifully researched and wonderfully descriptive, you truly begin to feel as if you are living in that time period with Dinah and her family when you read this book. The tension, pain, loneliness and joys are truly palpable. Although we will never know just how accurate this piece of fiction is, I enjoyed the ride immensely. I was sorry to reach the final page."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This book is a beautiful, fictional exploration into the lives of biblical women. These women were wise and strong and worshipped their montly cycles as a part of nature (we should all learn a thing or two from this). It's a very interesting perspective from a very talented storyteller. I hope Ms. Diamant will venture into this realm again soom. You won't be disappointed!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"From the get-go I will say that I am an atheist and was very sceptical about even picking this book up. In all honesty, this is one of the best books I have ever read (and I read a lot!)The detail is so believable you could swear Diamant was there in the flesh to record every living moment. It is a great book for women...and believe it or not, somewhat therapeutic. Any woman could find a way to relate her life to one of those in the book. The many facets of life, whether woeful or triumphant, are realistically portrayed in this novel.The Red Tent is a veritable page turner and one to be kept for the personal library.The true glory in this piece is that it does not harp on religion. It is simply a wonderful story. This can be appreciated by everyone, regardless of religious beliefs...being at somewhat of a religious disadvantage, I find that rather refreshing."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"The Red Tent is such an intriguing celebration of women. Based on a brief story in the Bible, Diament leads us into the lives of some amazing women. The novel stresses the importance of female relationships, that are lacking in contemporary society, and emphasises the gift of storytelling."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Such a great, wonderful tale based on a true Bible story. The author took a basic Bible story and turned it into a wonderful story by filling in the details. I could not put it down!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I loved this book! I read it for my bookclub, and at first was skeptical, but this book left me wanting more! You really get a great depiction of the lives of women of this time period. The vast differences between the lives they lived and the lives we are so fortunate to have today is amazing. Yet the bond between mothers and daughters, sisters and friendships transcends the time lines. These women also were married with children, but the roads they travelled and their struggles were so vastly different than our own. I would highly recommend this book, although do keep the family tree in the front of the book bookmarked as the family is so large you can get off track with the realtions at times. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I try to guard my 5 star ratings, so this one isn't quite up to that, but it's really higher than a 4. It's a beautiful story that is also gorgeously written, and I loved every page. It's also a neat perspective on several biblical characters whom the Bible merely mentions and then brushes past and forgets. As a child, I always wanted to know more about these women. Anita Diamant answered that prayer. There is very little truly historical information on the women themselves, but their times have been studied extensively, and Diamant has done her research well to present a novel that practically breathes on its own."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This book was a struggle until I reached thesecond part of the story. Ms Diamant shinesfrom this point on. I have recommended it to severalfriends despite the slow start."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"The Red Tent took my breath away. Its absorbing narration, provided by the character of Dinah, the daughter of Jacob and Leah, is timelessly poignant. The story is original and entrancing, but it's the women who make the lasting impression. The strength, soul, and wisdom of the female characters made me feel like I was included in a secret society -- the society of women, a world which men have never been able to understand and have therefore written off many times. I strongly recommend this novel to anyone, and I count it among my favorites."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"For the first half of this book, I had a very difficult time keeping all the characters straight. The book moved slowly, I didn't understand who was narrating at first, and I was frequently turning back to refer to the family tree printed in the beginning. Fortunately, I continued reading. Once I got to about page 200, I could not put the book down. I would read other fiction by this author."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I enjoyed reading this book immensely. I approached it as I did \\"A Wrinkle In Time\\" in that though it was historically based, the conversations and personality traits of the characters were not necessarily factual..however this in no way took away my interest in what was being said nor did it remove me from feeling I was a part of the experiences Dinah had. This book is a gift and I think Ms. Diamant for it."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"About two thirds of the way through the book, I would have given it a mere two stars. I felt that the narrative was unfolding slowly, and too much time was spent providing minute details about the everyday lives of these characters. I also found descriptions to be repetitive. Overall, it really was pretty yawn-inducing, up until the point when Dinah starts menstruating. I like to read books in one sitting, or depending on the length, in several concentrated blocks. With this one, however, it took me a full two weeks to finish the first two parts of the book. Not a good sign. But I hate abandoning books, so I pressed on.So why the 4 stars in the end? Because I found myself moved despite the slow start. It made me feel connected to all the women who have come before me, who faced unimaginable struggles and intense pain and suffering to bring life into the world. On the last pages of the book, there is a line that says, \\"We are all born of the same mother.\\". I wasn't particularly interested in this sort of sentiment when I started the book, but by the end of it, I understood it completely."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"The story of Rachel and Leah is one of my favorite in the Bible. It is filled with genuine pathos. The feelings of jealousy, lovelessness, hope and despair make the story of Rachel and Leah a perfect choice for modern literature. The tragedy surrounding Dinah is likewise compelling, with rape and revenge at the crux. So I began to read The Red Tent with much anticipation. But I felt like I was continually disappointed. The story that was told was a good one and well written, but it was like retelling Romeo and Juliet where they decide to fall in love with someone else and move on. A beloved tale should not be tampered with so.I was constantly distracted by the differences between it and the Biblical account. There was plenty of embellishment -- in fact you couldn't have a fictional account with out it -- and it was easy to say, \\"this wasn't in the Bible but it could have happened that way, right?\\" But there was also a lot of contradiction with the Bible, even with simple details like Leah having seven sons instead of six. And there was not so much as an author's note to say this was a creative choice or came from extrabiblical sources. I began to think that maybe it had just been a while since the author had read the original telling and was doing the best she could to remember it."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I read this book with some friends, some of whom had a deep emotional connection with the story of Dinah in the bible and some who did not. Those who did were admittedly put off by the liberties the author took in changing the story from the bible. Personally, I believe it is intended to be a fictional story and so I took it as such. I thought it was a very easy and quick read, I was able to identify with the characters and felt like I was right there with them. I have to say I loved the ending, which is not true for many books I've read. I gave a copy to my step-mom as a gift and recommend it to anyone I think will appreciate it for what it is. It's beautifully written."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Anita Diamant's \\"The Red Tent\\" is a work where rituals and traditions speak of those silent biblical moments that have seemed to disappear through the lines of the important messages the Bible has voiced for. The book is live and full of detailed descriptions of relationships and characters. It progresses in a very natural way, just like its teller, Dinah, it grows with her, lives with her, ends with her.The worlds in the book are complete, children, men, women, the society is a big family, their emotions, their daily lives, their festivities, everything has been arranged in a very detailed, smart, intuitive and captivating approach. Idolatry has as much force as true faith, love is as powerful as hate and death is but the obedient of both, life is empty when judgment befalls and full when forgiveness makes way to reconciliation.Dinah is the honest guide, the voice behind the untold story of ordinary men and women chosen by a mighty God."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"The Red Tent / 0-312-19551-6I'm not usually a big fan of Biblical novels, because unfortunately sometimes authors use the source material as a crutch to produce a poor story, paper thin characters, and unlikely plot propulsion, and still expect readers to buy the result. However, Diamat manages to avoid this by filling in the available gaps in the Biblical story of Leah, Rachel, and Dinah with a rich history and mythology that rings plausibly true.Diamat's biggest success is by discarding much of the negative portrayals of the women central to the narrative; here, Leah and Rachel do not hate each other so much as have a (relatively) normal sibling rivalry relationship. Leah comes across as very sympathetic; here she is a determined, strong woman - a good cook able to please her husband's palates and an able mother. The blame for the \\"wedding switch\\" is laid entirely on Jacob's shoulders - Diamat emphasizes the unlikelihood that Jacob wouldn't immediately realize his beloved Rachel had been substituted for Leah. Jacob, in his complicity, effectively purchases two good wives (and then four), for the \\"price\\" of steady employment.Diamat also discards the idea that the women meekly discarded their life-long idols for this new god brought to them by their outlander husband. (This much seems to be rooted in fact: it is clear that the 'queen of heaven' was worshiped by Hebrew women for centuries, and even mention of the practice is made in the Bible.) The women make a good show of pretense to their new husband, but see no reason to discard their family's theology and social values just because their new husband says so. The women value the feminine divine and completely disdain the 'sacred hymen' theology as having only value to men - as proof that a girl cannot be pregnant with another man's child - but none whatsoever to women as it increases the pain of the wedding night.Most boldly, Diamat discards the idea that Dinah's lover was her rapist and instead maintains that the story was a ploy by her brothers, made up to allow them to slaughter the men in the city. This is nicely handled, as well as the fact that Dinah is never mentioned in the Bible again: she has left her family and emigrated. Unfortunately, this is where the novel breaks down as the abuse and abandonment Dinah suffers at the hands of her adopted mother-in-law seems to be handled unnaturally. It seems out-of-character for the wise older woman to hate Dinah so passionately for things not her fault; in this culture of men and brutality, it seems likely that this woman would realize that this was no more Dinah's fault than her own. Of course, people are rarely completely logical, but the narrative stumbles enough to seem more like a plot device than a natural response.In the end, this novel is deeply intriguing and far better than most, but the last third of the novel does ring a tiny bit hollow at times.~ Ana Mardoll"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This is a great book for any female that grew up with more than one motherly influence. I thoroughly enjoyed it and have not met any person that did not like it."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"The Red Tent, which apparently is a huge favorite of many, many people here, has become a huge favorite of mine as well. The book was so incredibly vivid that Ms. Diamant brought me into Dinah's world, a world where custom was everything, and a woman could only find peace, rest and sisterhood inside the red tent.From the very beginning, where the reader is told that she has hands and feet softer than a queen's, I was captured. I could smell the smoke from the cooking fires, mixed with the breezes from the hills and the dinner in the pot, and the not-so-lovely smells of children, and men and animals. The author painted a picture with her details, but didn't become so enraptured with detail that she forgot that she was writing a darned good story. Like a butterfly, Ms Diamant flits from story to story as she weaves the tale of a life, staying with each until we are satisfied and full, but without ever languishing long enough that we become bored with the people, characters and places. The stories keep us off kilter just enough to make things interesting, because we think we have heard them before -- and we have. Maybe.My only complaint is that Ms. Diamant paints the men as broodish and selfish, not knowing anything about the women in their lives, and being quite happy with that state of affairs. C'mon! I know that times have changed, but people have not, and if a man cares about a woman, he will not dismiss everything that is important to her. Jacob was painted as a man who cared so little about the women he loved that he failed to honor even one of them. He was painted as barely able to tell one from the other, at least in the dark. I was also struck by the dark and angry portrait of Joseph, who has come through history as a hero - but not here. Men do not fare well at the touch of Ms. Diamant's pen.Finally, this isn't a book to start at bedtime. (You won't be able to get up for work in the morning) It's the perfect book for a day in bed with the sniffles, or the faux-sniffles. Grab some tissues (for the sniffles, of course), a cup of tea and this great book and you have all you need for a day of travel through countries and centuries, all to meet a woman whose tale has been forgotten by the years gone by. Give Dinah a wave for me when you meet her, okay?"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I really loved this book. It was very wel written. I enjoyed the complexities of each of the characters and how each of them helped to build Dinah's story and life."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I was introduced to The Red Tent several years ago when it was first published. More than four years later, there are still passages from this amazing book that echo in my mind and heart. Recently, as I re-read it for the sheer pleasure of its amazing story, I discovered even more reasons to applaud Ms. Diamant's first work of fiction.Through the voice of Dinah, the only surviving daughter of Jacob and his four wives Rachel, Leah, Zilpah and Bilhah readers are transported to Old Testament times and given a view of society from a female perspective. While Dinah is mentioned in passing in the Book of Genesis, this is a work of fiction. Those who have made mention that this is what the Bible would be like if it had been written by women miss the enduring qualities of truly good fiction--a universal theme, the ability to reach across generations and still speak common truths, and characters who transcend time and place as they bring to life the story they share.The Red Tent offers readers much to applaud. Here is a study (albeit fictionalized) of female society in ancient times, a love story, a survey of the early practices of slavery, war and deception among men, a glimpse of the early place of mid-wifery in society, and the bonds of womanhood as a means of passing the important stories from one generation to the next.Using the backdrop of \\"the red tent\\"--the literal place where women stayed during their menses and childbearing because they were thought to be \\"unclean\\" during those phases of their life cycle--Diamant creates a place where women share not only the physical bonds of womanhood but the emotional bonds as well.The theme of women passing their stories from one generation to the next is paramount. Even today, in most cultures, it is the women who are entrusted with the storytelling of their generations. Through Dinaha's eyes and voice we are privy to the stories the ancient women of Old Testament times may have shared--those stories that never made it into the Old Testament because the scribes were males.Today, more than 2000 years after Dinah, her story holds relevance and excitement, joy and sadness and common female bonds worth savoring--and passing along to future generations.by Lee Ambrosefor Story Circle Book Reviewsreviewing books by, for, and about women"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I recently read this book for a class of mine and absolutely loved it. Diamant takes a young girl mentioned twice in the Book of Genesis and creates an entire life for her in The Red Tent. Her story is compelling and her characters stay with you after the book is done. Diamant's powerful language sucks you in and spits you out different. no matter what religion you practice, the red tent is definately worth your time."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"The author of THE RED TENT has done to parts of Genesis like say Marion Zimmer Bradley has done to the stories of King Arthur and the Trojan War in The Mists of Avalon and The Firebrand (which are two of my favorite books). She has changed the perspective the story from the men's the women's, mainly Dinah, Jacob's daughter and the narrator of the story who is only briefly mentioned in the Bible. I liked this book. I never usually read books thoroly I get at the library but the first line of this book had be hooked. Don't get this book though if you are expecting a religious Christian account of the women in the bible. This book goes along the same line as The Mists of Avalon I have to say with many references to the goddess and pagan beliefs. The complaint I have though as that the author did overdo some things (for example, Jacob doing stuff to himself). These things I could have done without but this book is still worth 5 stars!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I would have never picked this book up if it had not been a selection of my book club. The mention of the Bible and the cover art would have scared me away, but I am glad I had the opportunity to read it.This is the story of Dinah. Apparently, the Book of Genesis suggests that Dinah was raped although it does not say this outright. I don't know much more about what the Bible has to say on the subject, but I found that you do not need to know the Biblical history to get involved in this book. Diamant has taken that small mention of Dinah and expounded on it. What results is a wonderful celebration of femininity.The women of \\"The Red Tent\\" rejoiced when they had their first menses. They saw this as an exciting time and they were elated to be able to give life.I enjoyed the fact that Diamant allowed the women to find pleasure in their own bodies as well as their lover's. I don't know how realistic that would be in those times, but it's nice to think that it could have happened."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"A wonderful, inspiring, and captivating book for all women. It should be &quot;required&quot; reading!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"My grandmother, my mother, and I all read this book. As a non-practicing Jewish family, we all felt this book touch our roots in some way. I had an indescribable feeling inside when reading this book. It was as if I had somehow been there long ago. I loved Diamant's Old Testament based work intensely. It is a very historical, drawn out, detailed novel so be aware of this before you delve into it. It is still, however, fascinating and a beautiful account of the tragic and amazing life of Dinah, daughter of Leah and Jacob. I couldnt get through Diamant's fictional work but this one is definitely recommended if you are at all interested in feminine historical fiction."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I must have cried a hundred times while reading this book. I loved it! I really enjoyed Dinah speaking directly to the audience; I think that device underscored the assumption that this is a story for all women. The message that I got from the book was that we are all sisters, with the same hurts and joys, bound together by the things that make us women--childbirth, menses, love. Anita Diamant did not write this book, Dinah spoke through her."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I share the opinion of all the other rave reviews but must add that as a student of feminine Bible study, this is a 'must read' from that aspect, for not many other texts can bring to life as &quot;Red Tent&quot; does the more detailed and personal lifestyle of Biblical women. You won't be able to put it down until finished reading. Really beautifully written."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I rarely take the time to write reviews of books I read, but I needed to for The Red Tent. The book was recommended by a business acquaintance and I'm so thankful to her! It's a beautifully written book, full of color and imagery. It made me smile, and cry not only for the storyline, but for the way it was written. Like any life story (set in a novel), there are tragic and tearing moments, along with happiness and joy. Women will especially like it!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"The Red Tent is an excellent read - a quick page-turner. You want more! The story of Dinah and her mothers is a wonderful look at true woman kindredship. The care for one another and celebration of their feminity was refreshing. I will share this book with my daughters - when they are old enough, as some of the references to men's sexual behavior is quite mature. I had the pleasure of attending a book signing with Ms. Diamante. She intended the book to be fictional- not completely historically correct, although her creativity was phenomenal. I was almost disappointed to know that the \\"red tent\\" was fictional, as her portrayal feels so realistic. I highly recommend this book for all women- young and old. It's one that I am certain to read time and time again."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Its a rather interesting story. Diamant did a good job in trying to dig the female's voice of the times. Clearly he/she who was given the priviledge to learn how to read and write (which was mostly boys in that time)told the story to future generation, hence THE BIBLE...Diamant told an interesting story with 21st century lessons on womanhood. It comforting to learn that inspite of growing in a place where polygamy was the norm of the day.. the women in the RED TENT still had issue with sharing a husband but peaceful co-existed... however I cant help but to wonder if the author's ideas shaped by the present day attitudes that forced her to tell the story that way....Makes me wish there more stories of that time in history were told through the voice of the women.An interesting read. Worth of all the praise it has been getting."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"It's enjoyable, and somewhat creative. But should Anita Diamont's book get more stars than Ondaatje's English Patient.

I found it to be a disgusting portrayal twisted with biblical references and most of them inaccurate. This book is a blasphemy againt God. I was so unsettled in my spirit reading this, I could go no further than the part one of it. There was positively no Christian basis to this book, and I will never again purchase a title from this author."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"...and little else. The women have NO power; they only imagine they do."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This book tries to pass itself off as biblical in nature while it is pure fiction. The author clearly blames God for not providing women with enough leading roles in Genisis and attempts to remake the bible in her own feminist image.There are a number of similar anti-Christian books on the market that employ the same strategy (The Davinci Code is a good example). The author cannot denounce the Christian reglion outright, so fabricating a blasphemous storyline to replace the original is the alternative goal.Anita Diamant is Jewish and not Christian. She has written books outlining how to reject the Christian religion and convert to Judaism. I would suggest \\"The Red Tent\\" only as a companion guide to someone who has such a goal. It is not a book written to help a Christian woman deepen her understanding of the role of women in the Old Testament."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This book portrays the men of the Bible as sex perverts. It even describes a scene of bestiality and masturbation. I can't believe people like reading this kind of filth."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"When the author writes that her story is a readical departure from the Biblically text - she claims it is because she tells and unknown part of the story -- fleshes it out for us -- and that she tells it from a woman's perspective. It truly is a radically departure -- but that is mostly because she plays very fast and loose with the Biblical account. She doesn't just fill in missing details -- she changes whole facts. The God of the Bible gets very few mentions at all - and nearly all of them derogatory. If you're into idolatry and pagan religions -- and you like to see the God of the Bible mocked and made fun of -- then this might be your kind of book. As for me and my household -- we will serve the Lord."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"If you want to write a story about pagan Cannonites, feel free to do it. But have the decency to make up the names because the story of Genesis (to the sincere believer) is the story of the living God entering the lives of pagans and setting them aside for a relationship with Himself--away from their pagan past. It's not that the book has inaccuracies (which it tels you it will) it's that the inaccuracies work to undermine the true elements of the real Biblical story. It's like a book on race relations and sensitivity training published by the Klan. Furthermore, to malign Jacob and Joseph (wheter intentionally or not)for the advancement of a philosophy that began in the early sixties by Mrs. Friedan is absolute hubris and should be viewed as breathtakingly offensive to Jews and Christians alike and be seen as an ersatz Christian &quot;Satanic Verses&quot;.What's so unfortunate is that we live in an age of such limited Bible literacy that believers don't even know they should be offended by this kind of nonsense.Oh, the writing was nice."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I really regret reading this. Why on earth was it in the religion section of the bookstore? It should have been shelved with the occult books. It reads like it was written by an atheist, or maybe a pagan feminist. I destroyed it because I didn't want some other unsuspecting victim to be fooled into reading it, thinking because it's in the Christian section, that it's a Christian book. According to \\"The Red Tent,\\" men are pigs, the Bible is wrong, God is cruel, Joseph loved boys, and so on. It went on and on and ON! The overly long, lovingly detailed descriptions of the joys of paganism and idol worship were stomach turning. Don't pollute your mind or heart with this trash!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Most of today's women do not gather together once a month to sing songs, to massage each other's feet, or to tell stories, yet I think most of us long for that. Even those of us blessed with fulfilling marriages to men ache for a sisterhood. Anita Diamant has given us a piece of a family most of us will never have. I do not know how historically accurate this book is, though from the reviews, I gather it is not biblically accurate. For those of us who are not history buffs or attached to the bible, the accuracy is unimportant. What matters is the love between the women. Like any piece of art, the emotions are enriched beyond what most of us feel day to day. Reading about walking for weeks through the desert with your family and a herd of sheep is far more thrilling than actually doing it. That's the nature of books. Yet we still long for the emotions as they are portrayed in narrative. After reading this book, a friend called me distraught. For forty-five minutes I listened to her and helped her develop a plan. Near the end of the call, I made a joke and she laughed with relief. At that moment I realized I do have a sisterhood just like the women of The Red Tent did. They had tents and straw. I have coffee houses, cell phones, and email. Frankly, I bet that on most cold nights most of the characters in this book would have traded their sheep for my thermostat. The friend who lent me her book asked each woman who read her copy to sign the inside cover. Signing my name was my initiation into a modern day sisterhood. Not only was this book a fun read, it also helped me realize that the stories we tell each other as we put food into the microwave are as special as the stories told over a cooking fire."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I'm not surprised to find such contradictory reviews of this wonderful novel. There's no such thing as tabula rosa readers when it comes to this book. Each reader inevitably comes to the story with their own religious beliefs and education. This is the dilemma: do you consider Anita Diamant's story to be a pure work of fiction inspired by a brief portion of Genesis or do you consider it to be an attempt to flesh-out that story? Putting my own prejudices up front, I pretty much considered this to be a pure work of historical fiction - an imaginative story well grounded in historical research. From this point of view, I consider the book to be a huge success. Not only is it a compelling story, but it is also beautifully written. The author gives us a rich and fascinating glimpse at her interpretation of two ancient cultures. Given that much of the historical record (biblical or otherwise) does not elaborate upon the private lives of women and families, no one should be surprised that Diamant has created/altered/expanded upon these subjects. I think she did an excellent job of creating and contrasting a unique society where women had their own rights and powers and the more traditionally accepted assumption that women were frequently powerless and vulnerable in early patriarcal society. Whatever your own personal views, you are sure to find this a compelling and thought provoking read."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"What a beautiful read! I was so mesmerized by the tale of this family and the women that held it together, I could not put the book down. Wonderfully written and a book that I will keep in my collection. Awesome!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"The Red Tent is not a book for those reader looking for fictional novels of biblical stories. Although the novel is the story of Dinah, the conflict between female-based religions and Judeo-Christianity is at the heart of the novel.Another reviewer referred to The Red Tent as a &quot;chick&quot; book and I would definitely agree. I think the novel does appeal more to female readers than male reader simply because a large portion of the story is about the community of women.Diamant tells an interesting and engaing story. This is a worthwhile read."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I read through this in the space of an afternoon and evening. The story is very compelling and offers a logical insight as to what could have happened. The vibrant richness of the tale makes a world that has long been forgotten seem real again. After I read it I had to reread the passage in the Bible. I was glad that Dinah finally regained her voice through the delightful prose of this exquisite novel."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"In perusing the other reviews written here about The Red Tent I noted several folks berated this book for its historical inaccuracies. I don't know about how historically accurate The Red Tent is, or isn't, and for that matter I don't think it's possible to view the Bible as a compilation of unbiased historical truisms either. My opinion about this book comes strictly from the viewpoint of a lifelong lover of reading, not from that of a thin skinned religious sort nor that of a historian.Diamant's rendition of Dinah's life suited me just fine as an entertaining story... I wasn't looking for an education when drawn to the Red Tent's provocative cover. Plain and simple, I was looking for literary entertainment set in a time and place far removed from modern times. From start to finish I found exactly what I was seeking between the covers of this book. I confidently recommend The Red Tent to other open-minded folks out there. I found it to be a very engaging story."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I enjoyed this book a great deal. It was given to me by a friend, who received it from a friend, and I passed it along to yet another woman. Diamant is a revisionist, and for me her story is engaging on three levels. The first is simply how clearly she illustrates the subjectivity of written history. The second is her charming language. While it changes from the beginning to the end of the novel (becoming less focused, I think), the spirit and sentiment remain. The third, of course, is the riveting story line. I do think that the first part of the book, when Dinah lives with her family, is more lucid and moving. However, I was held in thrall from beginning to end. It is clearly a book that will appeal more to female readers, and I am wont to call it a masterpiece of any kind, but it is a lovely escape, well-written and well-thought, and I will probably read it again."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"After reading the red tent, I was upset with myself for having ranked several other books as five stars. This wonderful story deserves more credit than any book I have read in a long time.Dinah begins her story, as must all women, with the story of her mother. She has not one, but four, and their lives weave together to tell a story that is not often told - a story of women in biblical times. Diamant is able to explore deeply both the separate worlds of women and how they connect with men. Dinah's mothers tell her all of their stories as a way of continuing themselves through their only girl child, and Diamant has a way of showing both their voices and Dinah's.Then, after a horrible sadness, Dinah must continue on her own. It is at this point that her strength and character, rather than that of her mothers or family, come to predominate.Drawn from one lone biblical paragraph, this book is a wonderful look at what the bible, and our history books, might be like if told from a woman's point of view. Absolutely amazing, and a must for all women with an interest in our commonalities."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I bought this book because I was intrigued by the idea of a Biblical story being conveyed through the eyes of a woman. I was not disappointed. While I had a difficult time getting into the book at the begining, once I got about 50 pages in I was hooked!The detail and imagery that the author uses help to portray a very realistic environment. Not being particularly well versed in biblical lineage, I found the &quot;family tree&quot; diagram particularly helpful, and I referenced it quite a bit during my readings.Anita Diamant has written a book that is not only a joy to read, but also one that appears to be particularly well researched and conceived."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I was captured as soon as I read the first page. I found this book fascinating and breathtaking. The description of women and their daily life and responsiblities in such ancient times was wonderful yet heartwrenching. And of course we always knew the relationship between Leah and Rachael had to be more complex than any childhood Bible stories ever expressed.I bought this book on a weekend away with my old college girlfriends. I contiuously recommend this book because of it's uniquely feminine point of view of an otherwise masculine world. It has wetted my appetite for more! The concept of the Red Tent continues today in my life by the yearly retreats with my college friends.

Why? I hated it. If it weren't on my reading group list I wouldn't even have finnished it. It wasn't the writting style or the topic (I love biblical historical fiction/nonfiction). I hated how Anita Diamant took the lives of these characters and portrayed them as complete hethens. She took a basic story found in the bible and exploited it, changing biblical fact to get her own agenda across and in the process making this book a slap in the face to every christian and jew that reads it. How sad. Don't waste your money on this book!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I agree with Caralen! This book was so infuriating and disgusting!!! Rather than fill in the Biblical story with a woman's perspective, the author chose to twist the story around to suit her feminist fantasies. She turned Laban into a vicious monster who had sex with sheep and beat women. She suggested that Rachel, instead of hiding Laban's idols under her saddle, menstruated all over them. Every other word in the first part of the book was &quot;blood.&quot; We read this book for my reading group, and in order to refute all the inaccuracies, I printed the Biblical account for us to read during our review. The Bible has such richly human characters, and the stories are extremely compelling. There's no reason to slander their lives in a fictitious account. Ms. Diamant should be ashamed of herself."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This book was terrible! I really thought it would be a good Bible story but incredibly, it was a very poor one. It was good to learn that Jacob was a tender lover but a \\"sorry\\" father and leader. Oh, and Joseph had sex with men and was hated by all who worked with him. This was a book of fiction! There was no character development so when people died, I wasn't even sad. Remember, don't read this book if you want to read about God's chosen people; you'll end up wondering why they were chosen!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"The author clearly betrays her lack of familiarity with the times and customs of places she describes. The characters are caricatures of the persons from the Bible. The prose is also awkward. The fact that some of the plot contradicts the biblical text is,I suppose, poetic license. Too bad Diamant is no poet. How can anybody like this book?If you want good and well written novels on biblical themes, try Paulo Cuelho's &quot;Fifth Mountain&quot; or Lion Feuchtwanger's &quot;Jafteh and his daughter&quot;.Mann's &quot;Joseph and his brothers&quot; is a much better treatment of the Jacob's family saga than &quot;the red tent&quot;"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I heard so many good reviews from my friends that I had to give this book a try. I was VERY disappointed and saddened by the sexual explicitness of the author. To be frank, she makes Labon a pervert, Jacob a masturbater, and Joseph a bisexual. Christians do not need to be reading this. Remember: Garbage in - garbage out! I am most saddened by the many readers who eat this stuff up, as if sexual sins a normal part of life. They are not supposed to be a normal part of life. And, yes, even the bible acknowleges that Dinah was raped, but the bible does not go into the details in order to teach us lessons. We do NOT need to read this kind of garbage as our entertainment."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"What I found actually disturbing was how the author twisted the facts of the Bible. I would encourage you to read Genesis 25 through the end of that book to learn the true story. It is obvious that she took great pains to rewrite history or else that she does not believe the Bible to be truth.What is most frustrating to me, is that she uses SOME truth and then twists other truths into blatant lies. Just to give one example, Joseph did NOT succumb to the temptations of Potiphar's wife and did NOT sleep with her. In the facts that the writer has twisted, she denies the power of God in the entire lineage of Jacob.She sums up her theme in the last couple of pages when she writes, &quot;there is no magic in immortality&quot;. Well, there may not be magic in it, but what she is really saying is that immortality has nothing to do with God, which is a lie."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I love historical fiction, but I prefer that any modern anachronistic sensibilities stay out of the story. While I expected a biblical story told from the female point of view, I was not prepared for a feminist agenda. I also expected some expansion and revision of the bare facts of the original story (which is, after all, the task of the historical novelist), but I found Diamant's efforts to be perverse and lacking in imagination. I give the book three stars, as I do believe it does a decent job of depicting some aspects of the daily life of women in those times."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This book is shallow, glib, pandering, and, from what I have been able to find out, not historically accurate. Not interesting. Not well-written. If you are interested in re-tellings of Bible stories, check out Jim Crace's Quarantine. It's literate, intelligent, and a creative piece of fiction."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I loved this book! As a pagan it confirmed the truth of what happened to women, the strength they had and their faith that held out! Their faith in the Goddess got them through Quite a lot! I can see why christians may not aggree with this book because it tells some truth about a religion that was stolen away by christians, but we are gaining alot of ground with wonderful storys like this one!!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"How many people have read the Old Testament and wondered what all those characters were really like? What do we really know of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, not to mention the women who were their wives and daughters, slaves and concubines? The Red Tent tells the story of those first Old Testament women, of Leah and Rachael, Zilpah and Bilhah, and of Dinah, the narrator, the only daughter of all four sisters, all four the wives of Jacob. We touch on the story of Jacob and Esau with Jacob stealing Esau's birthright from their father Isaac, and the story of Joseph who was sold into slavery by his jealous brothers and who subsequently became a famous ruler in Egypt. Those are the stuff of infinite Sunday School lessons that children have learned for centuries.But who has told the story of the Bible's women? Not many until Anita Diamant gave us The Red Tent. This is the story of Biblical women's lives and hardships, joys and sorrows, humiliations and triumphs that is not told in theBible. Set apart from male society almost exclusively except for serving and sex, these brave women spent themselves in lives of hard work, spinning, weaving, grinding grain and making bread, tending gardens and cooking meals that they ate only after the men were served and finished.The red tent is the literal and symbolic icon of female society where the women went once a month for three days as the moon goddess visited them; where they were allowed to rest, tell stories, sing and make offerings to their gods of fertility and harvest, of the moon, stars and universe. The ancient beliefs, traditions and superstitions lived on in the stories that were told each month from mother to daughter in the red tent.This is also a story of early midwives who aided births and kept women and babies alive with their skills and feminine empathy. The plot takes us into the land of Canaan with Jacob's family and ultimately to Egypt where Joseph and Dinah reunite after many years. The heinous deeds perpetrated by the sons of Jacob live in infamy throughout all time, but their victims eventually find redemption and peace.The Red Tent has passages that bring tears of recognition to women of all ages; women share the procreative spark that is theirs alone and which hence, endows them with power and unity that no man can ever be privy to. What a wonderful book to celebrate the joy and sorrow of being a woman, not to mention the ultimate priviledge!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This book is an interesting read but is definetly a work of fiction. It adds much to the lives of these historical figures which is not based on biblical scriptures. If you know the Bible you may become offended about midpoint by the direction the author takes these historical characters. This book left me with a sense of sadness for all the people who read it and will believe it as truth."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I was hoping to like this book. I thought it would flesh out more possibilities in the story in interesting ways. I was disappointed. Instead of reading about pastoral Middle Eastern women of 1700 B.C., I found myself reading about liberal and enlightened 20th-century Western women, who just happen to be herding sheep in 1700 B.C. The men, of course, are timeless two-dimensional caricatures of ape-like males who molest children, have sex with the sheep in the fields every night, lead poorly, stink horribly and eat everything. (Except for the one hero-man in each generation who looks gorgeous, treats women like equals, falls head-over-heels in love, and is amazing in bed the first time, and every time) The book is heavy-handed from beginning to end, making sure you know exactly how the author feels about male-female relationships and god-worship and not letting go at any point. By the time the women get together to rape the 12-year-old girl with a goddess statue in a disturbing coming-of-age ceremony (her best friend had earlier been banished from the community for not taking part in the ceremony) and it is treated as a \\"beautiful moment\\", I'd had more than enough.I always finish books. At the very least, I figure that I have to do the book justice in a negative review, so I read every word until the bitter end. But I had to speed-read this book after page 200, something I probably do no more than once every 100 books I read. It was just that agonizing. I'm usually considered a liberal and even a feminist, but this book was so heavy-handed it became unbearable, and the lack of historical accuracy in favor of preaching 20th century values took away the one thing that could have made it interesting. If you really really like feminism, Goddess-worship, and the mocking of men and want to see those three things shoehorned into every chapter of your book, then this is a great read for you. Otherwise, I really, really wouldn't recommend it."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I had to read this book for one of my college classes and I absolutely loved this book. I found myself getting completely involved in the story line and didn't want to put it down. I was all ready interested in Biblical stories, so that's what drew me to this book in the first place, but I had never expected that I would be drawn in this much. I was almost sad to see it end.Anita Diamant has such a great way of writing. I found the characters to be real. I was surprised by how Diamant interrupted some of the things in the Bible, but she does say that this is a fictional novel and to not take it as the Bible truth. This book is just Diamant's take on this story in the Bible.Diamant's book brings together women of similar circumstances and shows how they work together and strive as a family. This book represents women's strengthen. Also, Diamant praises women's bodies and, things like the period and birth, is a joyous occasion according to Diamant and she recognizes that fact. We as a society usually turn away from these images and dread them, but Diamant has a different perspective on it and explains how women have this amazing gift inside them.So overall, this is an amazing story written by a great author and I have enjoyed reading every page!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"First of all let me say that I really enjoyed this book. I thought it was extremely insightful, beautifully told, mesmerizing and emotional. I don't often feel all those things in one book.To all the people who have posted reviews saying that they threw down the book in disgust/threw it in the garbage/gave it to the dog, I have a question: why did you think that you were going to like this book? The chances are that the fundamentalists that take the Bible as literally as possible in 2004 aren't going to like a woman's story of Jacob and his sons.I am a Christian, but this book made me realise something I had never thought about before. Jacob and his sons slaughter the city dwellers, murdering them in their beds. Where is the God of Jacob's compassion for those people? Why, then, does God forgive Jacob and his sons, reiterating that they are his chosen people?Something to think about for those reviewers who pray for mercy on Anita Diamant.A wonderful novel."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"After having this book recommended to me by practically every second woman I've talked to recently at my church, I decided to give it a try. I was initially impressed by the concept of reinterpreting a biblical story from a woman's perspective. Though the biblical stories are interesting as written, they often lack a deep look at the motives and thoughts of individuals, particularly the women. So looking at Jacob and his sons from Dinah's perspective is a wonderful idea.Often, Diamont's version of the story is somewhat plausible when compared with the biblical narrative. Even the story of Dinah's \\"rape\\" is not completely contradictory because what happened in the book might have been construed as a violation from a certain perspective. She was young, and the coupling with Shechen occured without her father's knowledge. The idea of the women still practicing polytheistic worship also has some scriptural support in that Rachel did steal her father's household gods. These sorts of variations amount to an interesting study of how the same events can be seen differently by different people.Unfortunately, Diamont's attempts to weave depth into her female characters is not always successful, and it is rarely successful with the male characters. She often violates the well-known maxim \\"show, don't tell\\" by having Dinah tell us what her brothers, mothers, lovers, etc. are like without always showing us why she saw these people in that way. The story would also have been more compelling had there been some sympathetic men among the Canaanites. As it is, the novel reads at times as simply a diatribe against men and their God. As a result, the story becomes simplistic rather that a richly layered expansion of the scriptural account."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Perhaps i have missed something that the other reviewers got out of this book, but i did not find it at all interesting, or particularly well written. A lot of it was simply a list of 'who begat who'. Nor did I find the talk of the red tent particularly inspiring or &quot;empowering&quot; - but i don't think that women having periods is anything particularly important - it is just something that happens, not something we should be ashamed of or celebrate. I didn't find that the narrative of this story drew me in - i couldn't really care for Dinah and her family or what happened to them. I finished the book, because i thought that perhaps all the good bits were at the end. I was mistaken on that account.I also thought that the book was a bit misleading - while historical stories usually are about exceptions to the rule, this book gives Dinah a much more free life than women of her 'station' and situation in life would have had then. Diamant glosses over the fact that life for most women living in Old Testament times was hard."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"When I enjoy book as much as I enjoyed \\"The Red Tent\\" I always make myself read the \\"1 star\\" reviews. Here are some things to know before you read this book and are disappointed:1) It is is fiction. It is found in the fiction section. It is listed as fiction.2) The Bible is not exactly a verbatim account of history. I realize that this offends many, but the old testament is a compilation and translation of many stories and facts over a very long period of time. Personally, I can barely get a phone message correct. The \\"biblical scholars\\" who took offense made me smile. They need to refer to my #1 comment. The middle eastern experts also need to refer to #1. For me, this book opened my mind to a time period that I previously had little or no interest in and knew very little about. Because I read this book, I did more research to learn the facts.3) Women menstruate. Men, if this offends you, beware. Women, if you find it icky to talk about, again, probably not the book for you. Let's just say the title is a big warning that this is a large part of the book.4) There is a lot of emphasis on childbirth because before birth control, this tended to happen. A lot. Again, if birthing is too much, this is probably not the book for you.5) The writing is wonderful. I think the reason this book draws such a strong reaction is because of how well the author depicts each situation and character. It is amazing. I felt like I was there.6) This work of fiction made me think of how many versions there are of history. I am Catholic and I had never really thought of how ridiculous circumcism is or sounds to outside religions. This also made me rethink my original perception of those crazy, statue worshipping pagans (again being Catholic and growing up in a bible thumping, born again town, I could relate). I walked away with a \\"What if..\\"7) It's unique. So many authors have tried to replicate this book. I think it's great that it inspired an entire genre of historical fiction from D List history makers. Kind of a \\"History from Kathy Griffin's Perspective.\\"So read it as fiction and you will enjoy yourself. If you think it's a documentary, you won't like because I'm sure there are many inconsistencies. This is extremely well-written, well developed and overall a fabulously enjoyable read. It is by far one of my all time favorite books- largely because of the writing and that it made me curious about a time period that I knew little about prior to reading the book."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I must say that I was a bit apprehensive to purchase this book due to the fact that the plot deals with characters of biblical times. (I am not highly informed on these subjects) However, my roommate encouraged me to read this book because she said that it was a great book. Well, I decided to go for it and bought the book. I couldn't have been more pleased with a book purchase. You do not have to know anything about biblical history. The story is amazing, I actually found myself reading the book feeling like I was sitting next to the women inside the \\"red tent\\". Diamant did a wonderful job putting the reader in the mindset of the characters. Reading this book will put you in the front seat of an emotional rollercoaster. I found myself crying, happy, in shock and enraged. This is probably my all time favorite book."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Isn't funny how sometimes you just look at a book, and read about a book and the whole thing just doesn't appeal. The whole subject matter of a little-known character from the bible, really didn't sound that crash-hot. Also, (and I hate to admit this) but I didn't really like the cover either. So if you are like me, don't be put off. This is actually a gripping story.The book has all the family tree information you need and the prologue introduces the tone of the book as well. it starts with Dinah narrating - then the first chapters are about her female forebears before we hear her own story.Given that this is the female line at the same time as some of the best known stories, that of Jacob, Esau and Joseph (Dinah was Joseph's sister) it is a whole different perspective on the life and times. History is not being -re-written here. Dinah survives by the barest of mentions and so this is loose idea of what her story might be with what is written about her brothers taking a back seat.It is a work of fiction, and while I realised that, I felt it was a well written account - the fictional side always there, but the story was powerful and I felt it might have been real. The details of life and culture blend in with stories of people that seem real. I really enjoyed the style, it bought the whole feel of the times to mind so strongly - I really felt I could taste the tastes, see the sights and colours and even smell the smells of the time.A strange subject, powerful characters, you will feel like you have visited the life and times of these people."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This is a wonderful and powerful story of women under the opression of men. Definitely a book I would give to my daughter. The narration is wonderful. I felt as though I was actually living the story! I couldnt put it down and actually read it in 2 days. Just goes to show that women are powerful and there would be no world without us!!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Not only is this a great read, it also makes you think. And what more can you ask? As a rushed society, many of us have forgotten about where we come from and who we are. Women especially don't realize that our bodies are amazing vessels, and that we need to learn to cherish them, take care of them, and each month climb into our own &quot;red tents&quot; and reflect.I recommend this book highly, and my own dog-eared copy has been shared with all of my loved ones."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Having 5 years of formal jewish education, I read The Red Tent with a stable biblical background although it was starting to fade with time. Reading Diamant's novel made me feel so close to my roots that I was literally crying my eyes out toward the end. The main reason for my sentimental reaction was Dinah's strengh and faith in herself which I found absolutely overwhelming. We will never know what really happened but true or not, this book is a doorway to many people's lost or faded Judaism. The novel is truly a masterpiece in its language, its characters and most of all its story which made this book one of my all time favorites."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Anita Diament has brought to us an inspiring novel describing the world of women in the days of Jacob, Rachel and Leah.Dinah is the only daughter of Jacob and Leah; the book is written in her voice. This compelling story brings the women of the old testament out of the shadows of the patriarchy and allows us to become intimately acquainted with the matrelinial lineage of Genesis. We are invited into the &quot;red tent:&quot; the dwelling where women spend their moon time, give birth, and recover postpartum. We follow Rachel and Dinah through their careers as midwives. We experience Dinahs sorrow when her brothers avenge the &quot;disgrace&quot; of her royal marriage. And we follow Dinah into a new life in a new land and her subsequent happiness and fulfillment.This book will make you cry with joy for Dinah's life journey. It is not often that we are exposed to the stories of the biblical women and Ms. Diament is a gifted storyteller; there could be no better voice!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I enjoyed the time period in which this novel was set. However, I would have preferred it to be completely fictional and not based upon real people. Why? For the simple reason that there are several obvious contradictions to the biblical account of Dinah and her family. I would encourage any who wish to read this book to first read the following passages from the bible: Genesis 25:19-34, 27:1-28:9, 29:1-35:26, 37:1-36, 39:1-50:26. Not all of these are directly tied to the novel, but they give background and family history. Pay close attention to 29:22-30, 31:34&amp;35, and 39:10&amp;12. Even if you know the stories of Jacob and Joseph, it won't hurt to refresh your memory."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Having heard so much about the book I accepted a friend's offer to let me read it. Admittedly it was interesting enough to keep my attention and I finished it in a day; however, I don't quite understand why everyone speaks so reverently about the book. I find it rather odd that so many women accept the book as historical truth. Diamante readily admits that the Red Tent was an plot device she invented (based on the idea that such tents existed in some cultures but not where the story takes place) and yet time and again I hear people talk about how it &quot;filled in the blanks in the Bible for them&quot; or that &quot;Diamante's explanation makes more sense than what was written in the Bible&quot; as if she were a historian offering new facts. I wasn't offended by the liberties she took with some of the Scriptures that the book was supposedly based on, but it left me feeling like the story could have and probably should have been written about a woman in different time and place rather than an author's interpretation of history for the sake of spinning a fictional tale."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This staggering work veering around Red Tents (the tents where women of yore huddled during their \\"times of the month\\") is actually two books interwoven into one.First, it details the imagined lives of Rachel and Leah, two wives of Jacob (both true biblical figures.) This runs for about 70 pages in length and is somewhat less charming I believe. Diamant has written nonfiction books previously, The Red Tent being her first novel, and her documentary-style factual musings show through in this first part of the novel -- I felt I was reading a detailed history of childbirthing, not a novel.But that changes with the second part of the book, the life of Leah's daughter, Dinah. This is where I felt the true story takes off.Dinah, still young, meets Shalem, a handsome Egyptian man of wealth and status and falls in love with him. This infatuation is reciprocated, and for a time the two engage in merry lovemaking. But these joys of communion quickly run dry as a \\"Romeo and Juliet\\"-esque drama ensues when their families do not necessarily see eye-to-eye on the proposed union.It's a long novel, and a bit melodramatic if you will. Some descriptions of sexual relations are a bit too explicit for comfort, and made me wonder how they contributed to the novel. But the other bits in the book make it all worthwhile, particularly the female camaraderie -- we get a vivid picture of such bonds among wives, concubines, and the children they raised in concert. The ultimate denouement lends a simple but effective lesson to accept life and its pleasures/travails for what they are.I guess anyone interested in either religious or social history would find this book fascinating. Even for the rest of us, this is an evocative read that I'd recommend in a blink!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This is, first of all, a richly drawn portrayal of tribal life in the ancient Near East -- a vastly different world, woven with such loving detail and lushness as to be wholly persuasive. The lives of the women of the red tent, all but neglected by history, are brought to life here. Their voices are rich and lyrical and perceptive of the nuances of life. Powerful and moving. After reviewing the relevant chapters of the Old Testament, I had even more appreciation for The Red Tent. Passing comments left unexplained in the biblical account are fleshed out with rich human emotion and personality. Seen within Diamant's tapestry, the scene of Jacob crying out upon kissing Rachel is deeply felt by the reader. Other passages so vital to the biblical account are, appropriately, completely peripheral to the story told here. Diamant's interpretations of biblical events and people are novel, controversial, and compellingly real and believable."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Readers who look at this book as a standalone work of fiction will be drawn into the rich imagery of life in biblical times, particularly a woman's role in it. The prose is lovely and the story is told in a measured and deliberate way, allowing the reader to come to his or her own conclusions about key points in the story. Those who expect a book which remains completely true to its biblical sources will probably be disappointed. I enjoyed it, however, because of the different perspective it offered on those old stories. At the very least, this book may cause some to take another look at the way they have read the bible. One wonders what was left out of the scriptures and what else may have been happening during those times. For those who imagine that women had little role in this patriarchal society, Diamant shows otherwise and even demonstrates that there were rare opportunities for women to become empowered and even determine their own destinies within those strict confines."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Reading the Stories, lessons and Poems of the Hebrew Bible (Also known as The Old Testament) can be rather daunting and at times, unimaginative especially to the non-scholastic reader who may not have a complete grasp of what is behind the writings and narratives. Particularly a read of the book of Genesis one can get lost in all the begetting and begotting. However, thanks to Anita Diamant we can have a better understanding and idea of what life was like for these people we read about in the Bible.From a mere footnote comes a rich story of a woman living the ancient traditions of a people we know little about but thought about quite often. After reading The Red Tent, it will start to make sense and bring together a new understanding. Unfortunately, One is unable to use this text to gain a complete scholastic understanding of the ancient and historical books but no doubt your tongue will be wetted a bit and you'll begin to thirst for more knowledge and understanding.Enough has been said already about the themes of women's issues in this book that I don't need to elaborate on them. I invite you to read this story and see for yourself. I read this book in 3 days, which is unusual for me, but I could not put it down. Diamant offers a solid bibliography for further reading and research if one is so inclined. This is not a \\"religious\\" story but certainly one of religious understanding and a plus for spiritual growth in gender appreciation."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"An intricate and intriguing tale of one family's history.

A real one just the same. Even though the story would be hard to prove against the facts of the Bible, it gave the reader a chance to see how the family unit was handled and cared for in that time and place. As a women I found the story very nurturing. It is amazing how women have cared for other women through the centuries."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I did appreciate the perspecptive that this book gives on the womens lives of the time - but I really expected more then I got. Good Read just not an awesome read."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I loved this book. The author shows what it would be like to be alive in Old Testament times. Her style of writing is superb and very lyrical. The characters from the Old Testament-- Dinah, Jacob and his wives come alive and you see how they lived their lives You see the friendship these women share as well as the conflicts that come from sharing a husband. This is the best book I've read about Biblical Times."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I picked this book up at the store not knowing what it was about but I liked the title. During the reading, I was compeled to search Biblical references regarding the characters. It felt like more than a novel. To understand the nature of women's desire to be with each other and also their desire to cling to their men became the theme of the book for me. I could identify with many of the situations and the desires. I liked it. I am presently reading Good Harbor and I like it too."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This work of historical fiction kept my interest as I flew through this book. The stories of these women is really interesting and the tale is told well by Diamant. This is one of my favorites!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I am no religious scholar, nor do I care much for any organized religion, so I was very hesitant to purchase this book and then it stayed on my shelf unread for months.I am in a Woman's Club and it was the selection for one of our 4 literary clubs within the group. I discussed it with a friend who had read it and she shared the study group's discussion and questionaire. The questionaire had a lot of biblical and theologian-written stories comparison recognition. This detained my selecting it for another 3 months, but then my curiosity got the best of me, for not one of the several people I talked to (and I am not usually this skeptical) had a negative word to say other than some did not appreciate all the sexual allusions.It is an excellent piece of historical fiction. Dinah is unforgettable. The women in her family at the beginning of the story approach (except for the incest) the relationships of my mother and her sisters to my sisters and me and my sister's relationships to my nieces and my daughter.Dinah's 2 marriages have simiarities to my one, but only in the best parts of her marriages. Her relationships with her friends and co-midwives are well built. I am having a difficult time now letting go of this novel to begin another. I do not want to lose this friend."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"The bible stories that I read and memorized,never talked about the women.This even humanized the characters.The telling of this story through the characters eyes.This made the tale even more appealing.It almost seemed real,even for a novel.This book even broke a lot of tales that have told. The way the Egyptians were portrayed and traditons that were handed down."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This is a story based on people from the Old Testment, and of course it may not be true, but it gives strength and importance to women who are more often than not unappreciated and forgotten in history and especially Christian history. The womens' experiences just represented the kinds of struggles and pain that women in general experienced at the time. It made me appreciate what it means to be a mother and a woman - the caregivers of the earth and of man. I have no doubt that the way Diamant describes daily rituals and processes are extremely accurate. And maybe Dinah wasn't raped and really was in love, but her brothers couldn't handle not being in control of her sexuality as men have been for thousands of years. Read it as a beautiful story, not as sacreligious or evil - otherwise how can you truly enjoy literature and learn anything at all?"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Girl With A Pearl Earring, by Tracy Chevalier, is the story of a maid, &quot;Griet&quot;, and her work with the famous painter, Vermeer. Her duties as a maid do not include being an assistant to Vermeer, and Vermeer's art is not to supposed to be of a maid. But, the two interact despite the enormous class difference. Here we are brought into a painting which comes to life the minute the first page is read. The following pages paint a slow, yet careful and beautiful work of art that brings the 17th century to the reader's mind. A message that shows how both an artists' eyes and a young &quot;wide-eyed maid&quot; exchange pearls of wisdom. The story is as beautiful and solid and bright as a tightly strung pearl necklace. Images are deceiving, for white pearls may not be white after all, rather many colors mixed to create an illusion that satisfies an artists' -- and the readers' -- mind."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"how could a jewish female not love this book? i could not put it down the first time i began to read. dinah's story of the strong women of her family is historical fiction, however, diamant makes you feel as if you can experience the story from inside the tent. i cannot wait to share the book with my jewish women's group!!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Disappointing. This book promises an exciting new perspective from the point of view of women of biblical times but I found it tedious and unengaging."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"The Red Tent was the most welcoming and beautifully written story of Jacob,Joseph, and their families. It relates stories we have read from the Bible and makes the people seem real."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I really disliked this book. I am not a religous person, but I read the chapter in the Bible this book described to try to see how the author created the book. The author does not \\"fill in the blanks\\" of the Biblical story. She rewrites the story. The Bible says Joseph had two sons. The author implies the handsome Jospeh is gay as he is wont to gaze whimsically at his even more handsome male servants. Geez! If you want to create a new character who is gay then by all means do it, but the author crossed the line. Elsewhere in the book, Dinah, the young heroine has premarital sex with the Prince and the Prince's Mother encourages the match. The book and the Bible point out that nothing is lower than a shepherd and Dina is a shepherd's daughter. Would the Prince's Mother encourage such a match? No way. And, the four role models for this girl are her mother and the three other wives. Does anyone really think she would willingly have premarital sex given her upbringing? This is not even 1900, it's some thousands of years ago where virginity was (probably) considered the most important thing a woman brought to her wedding night. An author needs to \\"take you there\\" and make you feel the experience. Yes, it is a fictional story, but the story doesn't ring true to me ... at all. Finally, I have shuddered everytime I have seen a frog since reading this book. Thanks a lot, Anita!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I couldn't even finish this novel because of the incredible inaccuracies to the true Biblical account. I enjoy novels which use actual biblical stories as a backdrop and expand on actual accounts and characters, suggesting what &quot;could have happened,&quot; as long as they keep the facts straight, but the author of this novel changed so many of the facts that I could not enjoy the novel and finally got rid of it. The Biblical truth is so much more interesting that what she came up with anyway. I read the book because a friend of mine who does not know the Bible asked me to read it and tell her if it was true, because she assumed the author wouldn't have changed the actual story thus she believed everything the author wrote. After reading as much as I could endure, I told my friend the true story and pointed her to the actual account in the Bible, but I'm afraid she will always get the story wrong now that she has The Red Tent stuck in her head. The author had a chance, but she blew it!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Although this book has been highly touted, it was definitely not worth reading. The story is boring, sugary and poorly written. The story line (was there one?) was poorly constructed. I understand what the author was trying to do (write a story from the womemn's perspective) but while trying to fill in the blanks of the biblical story, she drew a blank herself."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I'm interested in Judaism and historical fiction, but I found The Red Tent rather dull and a bit too much of a bodice-ripper for my tastes. Gave up after a chapter or so."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This book was highly recommended to me by friends I respect and given to me as a holiday gift by a priest. I was very disappointed. I think it is a cheapening of the human experience by focusing on the physical and reducing women to primarily &quot;cow-like&quot; experiences and men to &quot;ram-like&quot; behavior. In other words, I prefer my historical novels with more dimensions than bodily functions. I read it all with near-disgust at the lack of spirituality in a historically spiritual era and because of the reduction of women to a merely animal level. I found it a disappointing, one-dimensional book."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"What a wonderful story about woman. Could not put the book down."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I was hesitant to read The Red Tent at first- I wasn't looking for a heavy, religous book. I decided to read it because my mom kept telling me how much I'd love it. It turned out to be one of the BEST books I've ever read. It is a very colorful story set in an exotic time and place about as far from my life as you can get! It is a book that I feel all women should read- and read together if they can! Diamant does a wonderful job of exploring the many complex and important relationships women share with each other throughout their lives. It is a beautiful story- I promise you will not be disappointed!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"The Red Tent tells us what it meant to be a woman in the time of Genesis.The story is fascinating and a page turner from start to finish. Diamont only lets us down with the fact that the book does come to an end. Which, I must say, is the best ending to any book I've read. Thank you, Anita!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Wow, this was a book that stayed with me. I thought Diamant's writing was amazing. You could tell she researched it. As you read, you really understood Dinah and what it was like to be a women in ancient biblical times. It takes you to a time in history that is different, but you don't want to leave it. As a previous reviewer said, it is probably a book for women. You either love the book, or hate it. But considering its a best seller, most people must love it. But no matter who you are, you learn what ancient womanhood was like in the biblical times. They experience love, hate, passion, death, and tragedy. There is also the theme of relationships between mothers and their children. I could not put this book down."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This book is incredible. I grew up learning the Bible at school. This book is very accurate and its just amazing, wraps you in the rich stories, takes you back to the time, the smells, the food, the sites .... I read this book more than ten timesit's really beautiful, i recommend it to all"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Yes, I have read it twice and could easily read it again. I liked to hear the stories from the Bible retold from a woman's perspective. After reading it I went back to the Bible to read the same story, albeit from a different perspective. This book is highly recommended."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"The Red Tent is an absolutely enjoyable read (especially for women). The first few pages were slow moving &amp; may deter some browsers, but once you get into the book it'll be hard to put down. I can never keep the biblical characters straight (who beget whom), but this story helped me understand the family tree of Jacob. (There is even a helpful diagram of the family's lineage in the front of the book, that I often checked to keep everyone straight.) The characters become very real &amp; captivating. I never gave much thought to the lifestyles or cultures of the biblical times, but this book really gives you great insight while entertaining you also. I would never sell my used copy, because I want to pass it around to every woman I know. This would be a GREAT choice for a book club to read &amp; discuss."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"...with the author's view/characterization of the men in this story, the imagery and descriptions of the people, places and events in The Red Tent are lustrous and at times truly poetic. Diamant paints scenes with her words and one actually feels as if they are inside the tent with the women on nights of &quot;the new moon&quot;, walking across the rippling waves of the river as the family journeys to another land and taking Dinah's last breaths with her.The Red Tent is filled with emotionally-charged events that will make the reader, laugh, cry &amp; cry out in sheer horror. I recommend this book and am surprised there aren't more reviews here with it being a best-selling novel. CLB."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This story was not bad, in fact it was quite interesting, if you don't mind the descriptions of crude reality. I admired the storytelling and gossiping of the women in the red tent, and I enjoyed the scandals of death, love, hate, and suspicion; but most of all I beamed at the women's prospect of those days, and the difference between men and women.This book has suspicion, surprise, romance, it is the ultimate women's story. But what i was not expecting were the crude tellings of mens lust for animals, and girls secrets of love. So this book is not truly meant for children."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I finished RED TENT last night. I have mixed emotions about this story but overall I enjoyed it. The author is an excellent writer and I personally feel she dug really deep to write about a bible story so vividly and fictionly (is that a word? :-). I referred back to the bible and other sources for the real account of Dinah's story and must say the author did an excellent job of sticking with the story from the bible. For some reason I just couldn't get into the story until it was 1/2 over and perhaps this was due to my busy schedule but another side of me just found it hard to believe certain things mentioned in the story. (don't want to spoil it for others who have not read it yet) so can't be too descriptive.Again, I enjoyed the book and would probably recommend it to others.Great Job Mrs. Diamant, your writing style and character development are to be applauded. The flow of the story was good and I genuinely appreciated the bible names used and those that were made up."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I loved it. Have it on audiobook.. and i will definately be listening to this over and over again."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This is a great story. Covers several generations. It made me appreciate how much easier it is to be a woman today. I enjoyed following the characters through their lives. You do not often get to see a character's entire life. Not left wondering..."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This is an old and obscure Bible story told from the point of view of the women.Anita Diamant brings the Bible to life with a grip of the facts and an understanding of the truths behind them. She suffuses the novel with authencicity born of much research into those ancient days and what life must have been like, especially, for women in Old Testament times . Diamant peoples the novel with characters we can identify with, even though they represent a distant epoch.Ms Diamant brings vaguely remembered Biblical characters to life in such a way that we get a real sense of their personal hopes and daily struggles. We see those ancient times through the lives and interactions of the women who found a measure of meaning and purpose in the red tent, where the men could not join them.The vantage point offered is that of Dinah, Jacob's daughter. She has insights into the Patriarch that we might have missed were we reading only the Book of Genesis. Yet, what we learn through Dinah's eyes is perfectly in keeping with the message of Scripture. Ms Diamant's approach is both authentic and inventive-and would be an excellent model for anyone who would like to more fully understand figures from the ancient world.With Dinah, we go on an imaginative journey and find out the limitations of that ancient society as well as its opportunities. We see what a courageous and determined woman can accomplish even in a world dominated and determined by the men in her life. Power in the midst of weakness is only one of the messages the book conveys.It is fair to say that Sunday School was seldom this good! Wise teachers and creative preachers, please take note. This is how it could be.Ms. Diamant: Bravo!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This book although based on a different time and place... it was a great escape from this day and age. I couldn't put it down and can't seem to pass it along to a friend... I have recommended it to many though..."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This book is amazing. It is so rich with imagery, you feel like you are in biblical times yourself. The story is beautiful and feels true. You owe it to yourself to read this book."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Here is a book that takes you in from the very first page. The characters are all familiar from years of Bible school and scripture reading, and this is a creative, enlivening story created around them. The cultural significance of the red tent is most interesting. I am sorry we have lost the tradition."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"i loved the Red Tent. It was recommended to me by readers who loved THE KITE RUNNER. I don't read much of the Bible, and I have never given birth to any babies, but I still loved the book! Easy reading despite all the biblical families; yet complicated because of the complex characters."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I loved this book. I read it in two days while on vacation. The story telling is so rich, yet it was an easy read. I would recommend this book to any woman."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I love historical fiction and I loved this book! Read it!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I read this book 3 years ago when I was 19, and it sparked my interest in reading. Before this book I only read (skimmed) the books I HAD to read for school.This book was so full of colorful detail of a person who only recieved a quick blurb in the \\"Good Book.\\" I loved how the author took a few statements from the Bible and turned them into a fairly secular novel. I loved reading about the time period and the ways of Biblical life. I definately recommend this book to any woman."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"From someone who rarley finds the time or the patience to indulge himself in another place or life, it is with absolute openness that I share my feelings for Dinah and her life. This book took me there through it all. I now can attest to being a fly on the wall, with the writing I was in the tent and by the waters. I saw the events which carried over into my own dreams. When I neared the end I trembled as the remaining pages grew smaller and smaller, and then I teared and sighed when it was done. The accounts of Dinah's life are very clear and memorable as are her interactions with her family and those strangers she comes about to meet. It will take me days to get over the new life I have just come to know, and have appreciated my new aquaitences along the way."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"A true favorite. The imagery that the author uses just draws you into the story, and won't let you go until the very end. If I could give this book another star I would. This book steps you back in history and makes you feel as if you are living the life of the character."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"The book The Red Tent, by Anita Diamant, was a very good book.

Ever since Dinah was born, she was allowed in the red tent during the women's moon cycle, which was usually not permitted unless she had started her first blood.The story was relatively peaceful, with only smaller conflicts, until Dinah fell in love with a Prince. Her brothers, infuriated with the romance, conspired against the two lovers.This book was very well written. It is the story of Dinah, daughter of Jacob, in the Bible.

This book is more appealing to a female audience but a book that should be read by everyone. The book begins before her birth, settling the audience into the time. The author does a wonderful job of grabbing the reader by the collar and dragging them into the book, with the audience looking through the eyes of Dinah her story is one that could cause laughter or salt tears."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"The Red Tent has to be the best book I have ever read. I found the story to be heartbreaking yet inspirational. It has opened my mind and heart to learning as much as I can about this period of time. I am now on a mission to read similar bibical fiction.I highly recommend this book - an excellent read!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I have heard about this book for years and have finally read it. I was thrilled to find it as enjoyable as I'd heard and more. A great insight into life in those times ( the way mentstruation was celebrated and enjoyed - so different today !) and how accepting, even relieved, women were when their husbands took other wives and mistresses. Whilst this may still happen in some parts of the world they certainly dont happen where I come from ( Australia) and I found these stories alone were enough to keep me enthralled. Then of course there is the tragedy and intrigue, the betrayal and love. As a career mother of 3 I cried through the whole first 3 chapters( and all 14 babies) and all the loss and celebration. I cannot fathom how people were once respected for simply having dozens of children and it was wonderful to see(for a change) the love and enjoyment these people got from their daughters and not just their sons. The fact that this was all based loosely on the book of genesis also kept me intrigued and to be honest has piqued my 'agnostic' heart.To all those doomstayers who can help comparing it to the Bible and picking out every inaccuracy, guess what ! I bought this in the 'Fiction' section of my bookshop and guess why ? ITS FICTION. !! I dont think the author at any time pretends otherwise and I think she does a wonderful jobs of loosely interpreting a few ( never confirmed) stories and giving them life in her own way. Bravo !"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"The Red Tent is a midwife's book. An epic tale set in biblical times, this story is about the lives of the women whom the Bible only mentions in passing. Anita Diamant has woven the historical record with beautiful and descriptive narrative along with enough fiction to make her first novel a real winner! I could NOT put it down and when I did, I had vivid dreams often which woke me up only to send me into another long stint of reading... even at 3am! As a midwife, I very much enjoyed and connected with these lovely and wise women and their world and work. I connected with them in an almost spiritual way thanks to Diamant's almost lyrical style. I was drawn into the Red Tent as if sitting among these women as they went about the work of assisting with the birth of a baby or ritually welcoming a new young women among them.I can see how this book might strike some as a little &quot;weird&quot; or &quot;odd&quot; especially if the reader was seeking a book based only on biblical writings. The Bible doesn't say much about these women. It merely mentions them as the historical record focuses on Jacob and his sons and their lives.However, this IS &quot;THE&quot; book for women and young women, especially those on the path of midwifey! What a wonderful read for those of us whose lives revolve around the cycles of women and their bleeding time or birthing time.I absolutely LOVE this book! I hope others will find as much satisfaction as I did while reading it!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Anita Diamant has written a powerful masterpiece that touches the hearts of everyone who reads it. A fictional account of the wives of Jacob from the Old Testament. Narrated and written from the point of view of one of his daughters this book follows her from childhood through her older years. The love, incredible longing and pain you encounter while reading this book far surpasses those you have ever read. Incredibly touching, entertaining and mesmerizing. A wonderful book. One not to be missed!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Diamant's novel is a tale rich with imagery. She paints a picture for the reader that is expansive but not overwhelming. Diamant's account of the biblical character Dinah is hard to put down, to say the least. The relationships Dinah has with the other women of the red tent are beautiful and leave you with a strong sense of family and sisterhood, as if you were related to these women yourself. I found it hard to leave this story; even when it was over I still wanted to know more. Dinah's triumphs and downfalls left me exhausted. Diamant takes the reader through a story that is full of adenture and tragedy. After reading the novel I felt that I had indeed traveled the long journey of Dinah's life."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I kept seeing this book and wanting to buy it - I kept putting it back on the shelf. THen I read that Julia Roberts read it and loved it in O, Magazine - but that didn't convince me either. Then, My best friend sent me a copy for my birthday and I LOVED IT! Every woman should read this book and remember to honor our her-story. A brilliant book. Brilliant."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"....in the bible, jacob is portrayed as anything but an honorable man. he is protrayed as a schemer, a coniver and very self-centered. the fact that dinah in this book wears rose-colored glasses is understandable - the man is her father.this book is not exactly anti-male, but neither are men portrayed in an admirable light. laban is a con artist who is out-conned by a better con artist - jacob. his sons, including joseph, are extremely self-centered (read the genesis they come off pretty badly).you rarely hear about the women and that is the point of the red tent. it gives us a glimpse into the lives of these women. life in those days was hard. women (and men) grew up very fast and childhood and adolescence were not an indulgement, merely a stage to get thru until one became a productive adult..... this book takes a very minor story and makes it breathe life. if anything it describes the day-to-day, month-to-month, year-to-year cycles of life. everyday was a struggle for survival. food had to be cooked, clothes made (and i mean from scratch) children tended to, flocks tended etc.i was glued to this book until about the last 100 pages. after the [invasion] of dinah and the murder of shechem, the story want downhill and i had to force myself to finish it. i wish instead dinah had stuck around (the bible gives us no clue what happened to her - so at that point fiction really kicks in) and give us her take on joseph's dreams and his brothers selling him into slavery, rubean's treachery w/ bilhah, er and on and judah's bieng ensnared by his own lust w/ tamar etc.while diamont does take some events out of their biblical order (jacob wrestled w/ the angel before not after he served laban) she does refer back to many familiar stories....jacob was a very self-serving man who didn't care that his sons massacred an entire town - he was only concerned w/ the way that it would impact his reputation and fortunes. read the original....its a pretty good read too !!!!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Anita Diamant...please write more of these!! I am a Presbyterian Minister who picked this book up (on recommendation from other clergy) about a week after giving birth to my first daughter, Magdalyn. The timing was incredible as I have connected, in a spiritual way, with the sisterhood of mothers and all who assist and nurture them. Yes, some creative license has been taken with the scriptural account...but most good preachers do the same thing every Sunday! The story is moving, grand, life-affirming... I will read it again and again for inspiration as a mother and wife, as well as a woman. How wonderful to have stories brought to vivid life such as this!!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"The Red Tent is a fictionalized account about the biblical figure Dinah, Jacob's daughter. Anita Diamant uses the last half of Genesis as the basic framework for her novel. She then embelishes the gaps in the Old Testament with &quot;what might have happened&quot;. Of course her detailed writings are fiction, but it is interesting to read familiar stories from the female perspective.I enjoyed the novel, and liked the second half of the book better than the first. When starting the novel, I found myself frequently looking at the family tree at the beginning of the book. As the novel progressed, family dynamics changed dramatically, the narration blossomed and I was drawn into the lives of the characters. The Red Tent is worth reading."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"What can I say about this book that hasn't already been said? You will laugh, you will cry, you will love it!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I read this book rather quickly. I was glued to it and could not put it down. I know this is a story about the supposed rape of Jacob's daughter Dinah, however it is my opinion that the truth was a little closer to what Ms. Diamant wrote. I enjoy books like this, Firebrand, and Moon Under her Feet. I think that the Judao/Christian mythology leaves out so much, and the stories we read in the Old/New Testaments are biased. I think the women in Jacob's life, and in Jesus' life were more deserving of a few blurbs, and the men who wrote these books were threatened by the power these women posessed. (Firebrand is not in the bible, it is about the seer Kasandra from ancient Rome, but still an incredible story). This book is eloquent, emotional and realistic to me. I felt as though I were in their tent with them. And yes, the matriarchs and Dinah never do embrace the god of Jacob, but I felt this made the story complete and rich. The god of man killed (or atleast subdued) the ancient goddesses, and I do not see why we should give Abraham, Isaac or Jacob any reverence for their horribly immoral, lewd and violent lifestyles. This story shows the triumph of women, no matter what men can try to do to them, their spirit and connectedness to the great divine will always previal. It is refreshing to read a new perspective on a desperatly shallow story about the &quot;greatness&quot; of Jacob and his pack of wild sons who destroy all the men in a town for their sister's honor. As I said, most likely it happened more like Ms. Diamant portrayed it. This is a beautiful, sad, and fulfilling story that will enrich the lives and perspectives of anyone who reads it."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This is one of the best books I have read to date about women. It's a must for both men and women--to discover life as it was and how it relates to women and men of today! It will stay with me forever."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"As a fictional story, _The Red Tent_ is vivid, rich and beautiful. It is feminist in what I consider the very best sense of that word: valuing female-ness, in all its aspects (sisterhood, menstruation, sex, pregnancy, birth and motherhood), for its own sake, and not making any attempt to make women be like men. It gives the impression, unlike so much of the Biblical fiction I've read, of being utterly true to the times it records. But therein, unfortunately, lies the problem.As a fantasy story or mere historical fiction, with completely \\"invented\\" characters, this book would not disturb me. But instead it takes the female characters of the Bible, the wives and mothers and daughters of the Patriarchs, and portrays them as truly pagan women, with little or no interest in or respect for the God of Abraham, whose worship even by the men of the family seems tenuous at best. To see, for instance, Rebecca portrayed as a pagan oracle, insistent on perpetuating pagan rites among the females of her family, is profoundly troubling to me. I don't doubt that the Patriarchs' families were influenced by the paganism of the world surrounding them, but to envision these women as pagan priestesses seems to go too far--at the least the idea saddens me greatly. And I'm perplexed, since the author appears to be Jewish and has written several works of non-fiction about how to live as a Jew. Why such a woman would write a book that has more in common with neo-paganism than the Biblical narrative is a mystery to me. Because for all this book *has* (and it has much), the one really crucial thing it *lacks* is any hint of faith in the God of Israel. I imagine for a lot of readers that absence wouldn't be felt at all, but I felt it, and for me it spoiled what was otherwise a profoundly good book about what it is (or should be) like to be a woman."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I can't imagine why I bought this book. I must have seen some mention as I was noodling around on the computer which made me think I would like it. Well, I didn't like it, not at all.The book jacket bills this as a historical novel about \\"God's women.\\" It is the story of Dinah, who is only briefly mentioned in Genesis. She is the daughter of Jacob and Leah, the granddaughter of Isaac and Rebecca, the half-sister of Joseph (the one with the coat of many colors), and the indirect cause of the slaughter by her brothers of all the men in a town.Here are the reasons I disliked this book.I have always presumed that the author of a historical novel took reported history and then added embellishments, interpretations, motivations, whatever, but hitched the narrative to established events. That is certainly not the case here. The only historical account of these people and events is in the Bible, and Diamant chooses to change that history to suit her narrative purposes. Dinah is not raped, as reported in Genesis, but falls in love and willingly has sex. Her father Jacob does not work for seven years to win his first love, Rachel, but for seven months. (This is a famous biblical love story, if you not familiar with it.) And so on--there are many departures from the source history.And these are not \\"God's women\\" at all. They are portrayed as having a kind of Moon Goddess, new-age-sounding religion which includes a very graphically described piercing of the hymen in a coming-of-age ritual. According to this novel, the women do not subscribe at all to Jacob's monotheistic beliefs.And the men--almost all portrayed in a very derogatory light--are variously involved in bestiality, incest, self-pleasuring in public view, and so forth.And the writing, which is terrible. Diamant constantly just tells about events rather then portraying them. It's like the biblical account in that way, with its \\"And it came to pass.\\" Or as when a child tells you the plot of a movie and says, \\"and then,\\" over and over, just hitting the high points. At no time did I forget I was reading a novel and not living the narrative, and I am a most susceptible reader for any writer even remotely capable of creating a fictive universe.So I say, to the few potential readers who might still not have read this, don't bother."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"The Red TentWhen I was told to read this book, I almost didn't after reading the back cover. It sounded like it would all be about Genesis, maybe something that I would not understand. But once I started reading it was hard to put down. This book is all woman!!It's a story of the life of a girl named Dinah. She describes the red tent, and how the women gathered there to bleed together during there moon. There, she learned secrets of being a women, what to expect. Her mothers shared their thoughts with her.The way she described her life was so real. It put me there, I could almost see myself walking around and being one of the women. The women all had there own tasks to keep everything going right, and to help out their family. The journeys and friends she met along the way of her life were so adventurous. The way she described her love was powerful and made me want to fall in love, just like that.The way she lived her life, having many mothers, and having to serve the men was different, yet so interesting. It made me happy to live in this lifetime, rather than that lifetime."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"some of the other reviewers missed the boat. the author never claims to have written a historically accurate biblical story. she did an excellent job of telling a story from a completely different view point, compared to what we are used to reading in the bible.the story was extremely enjoyable. the bonds between family members, and the events that took place held my interest the entire novel. this is one of my top 5 books of all time. do yourself a favor, and read it, with an open mind."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Although, I have to agree with another reviewer who said that the book only began to interest her about half-way into it, I must say that I am SO glad that I kept on reading. Some critics may say that the story is overdone, with a birth every 5 minutes and I must confess that I shared this sentiment, at first. But by the end of the story, and in some parts in the middle, when I found myself weeping, I could not deny the fact that this was a great book. Not having read the Bible and being unfamiliar with the story of Dinah when I read this, I looked at it from a strictly fictional perspective. Yet, the vivid descriptions and skilled story-telling made the tale come alive and I felt as if I was witnessing events that truly happened. Though, this novel was far from a history book. It may have taken me a while to getused to the unusual metaphors in the text, but I grew to love the beautiful writing style of the author and each of her characters. All in all, I plan to recommend this book to any and every woman I meet. I say woman because I am uncertain as to how a man would view this form of literature packed with details of menstruation and childbirth. Regardless, I commend the author on creating this extraordinairy MASTERPIECE of a novel! There are no words to describe its brilliance!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I knew I was absolutely head over heels in love with this book while I was reading it on my lunch hour, in a cafe full of people, and was moved to weeping.

This book is one of the most beautifully written, heart-breakingly touching and poignant books I've ever read.In part because it paints such a vivid picture of the life of women in biblical times, and in part because it celebrates and makes the reader reflect on the timeless nature of relationships between mothers, daughters, sisters and aunts.I'm so glad I read this book, and I will definitely read it again."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"For anyone who is a fan of historical fiction, this is a book for you. I have never read anything which so vividly portrays the Biblical time and place which we've seen displayed over and over (think Ten Commandments) on TV and in books. If you're put off by the idea that this is a &quot;Christian&quot; book -- don't be! The author portrays the women as pragmatic, going about their business and participating in their traditional culture -- including worshiping their old gods. The men -- well, they're involved in some crazy business about &quot;the one true God&quot; but it leads to nothing but trouble. My only complaint about this book was that the author spent so much time and detail fleshing out the first 2/3 of the protagonist's life and then sort of rushed through her later years. I would have gladly kept reading for a few hundred more pages in order to get the full level of detail all the way through. Well worth reading!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"My women's book club chose The Red Tent as our first assignment, and I am so glad that we did. As a religion major in college and a former long-time Sunday School-kid, I was familiar with the main stories of Genesis (Jacob's ladder, Rachel at the well, Joseph and the Pharaoh, etc.), but this novel gave those familiar stories a new depth.By expanding the events in those twenty or so chapters of Genesis dealing with Jacob and his family into a fictional narrative, Diamant has succeeded in providing a rich, emotional story of generations facing religious, political and cultural changes. Dinah and her mothers - both real and adopted - are strong, three-dimensional characters who help provide a view of what life might have been really like in the time of Genesis, including the joys, the conflicts, and the struggles that women faced. This was an excellent book, and I can't wait to discuss it with my book club!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Dinah is mentioned briefly in the bible as Jacob's daughter who is raped by a prince. In this book, Diamand brings to her readers the rest of Dinah's story as she imagines it to have happened.With the coming of the new moon, the women of the camp enter the red tent to wait out their monthly bleeding. This is where Dinah spends her childhood, being the only daughter among the four sisters wedded to Jacob. There she learns the life stories of Leah, Rachel, Zilpah and Bilhah, all of whom she calls her mothers.The book is divided into three sections, all different phases in Dinah's life. Diamand writes of Dinah's relationship with each of her brothers and the circumstances which led her to flee from her family and curse their names.The story of Dinah, the blessed midwife and mother of a prince of Egypt, is one of beauty. The majority of the Bible focuses on men, as if women had no part to play in the history of humanity. The Red Tent shows the world that women are just as strong and sound-minded as men."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It is beautifully written, and delves into the minds of women during a particular time period in a way that any modern woman can relate to. Relationships, coming of age, the role of family, and love are all explored in this fictional account of the life of Dinah. Throughout the book, it seems as though Dinah is recounting the story of her life and family to you, personally.However, it must be kept in mind that this is a work of fiction, the idea for which came from a brief passage in the Bible. Many of the reviewers who didn't like this book cited inaccuracies with the Bible. Well, this is not the Gospel - it is fiction, and never claims to be the word of God. And it is no detriment to the book whatsoever.I loved this book, though it was a bit depressing at times (but not enough to make me wish to stop reading). There is a message of hope within it, and Diamant's exploration of emotions and humanity are well done and easily read. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I was told over and over by countless female friends that I should not read this book. Thank goodness I ignored them. True, they were not lying when they said this was a book about biblical women menstruating; but that trite summary fails to do justice to the beauty, energy, and depth of this remarkable novel.This is a book about relationships. It is about the relationships that form between women and the experiences that bond them together. It is about the relationship between women and their bodies, between women and the earth, between women and their men, between women and their gods. It is a book about the role of women as life-givers and as preservers of the cultural heritage of their people.The other summary commonly attributed to this novel is that it is how the Bible would have been had it been written by women. This is also misleading. While many of the characters are also found in the Bible, The Red Tent is very much an original work of fiction. Diamant remains true to the inspirational roots of her story while weaving an elaborate and original tapestry of her own.This book strongly reinforced my belief that good literature transcends gender stereotypes. As a whole, this book may appeal more to women than men, but any man who enjoys good literature will appreciate this fine work."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"The descriptions of biblical life are wonderfully colorful with a story of a women who pulls at your heartstrings."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"A solid look at the positives and negatives of women's relationships with themselves and each other."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I picked up the book and could barely stop reading it. I could not help it but to be under the spell of feeling as if I knew the women who were supposed to be Judiasm's &quot;first women.&quot; I was close to choked up by the end of the book. Imagine, not being able to name your own child or have final say in the upbringing of the child. I was facinated by some of the comments about Laban, who I had already made guess as to being a child molester, as being so outrightly stated as such. How did all of his daughters &quot;know&quot; this was more than just degrading and unpleasant, or did they? Which leads me to making the one negative comment that I must make. That is, why did these women continue on in their idolotry anyway? Why, that is, did the author write it that way? The personalities are mostly well drawn but there are some bugs in the stew."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Before launching into one of my tiresome &quot;reviews&quot;, I must admit that I bought this book, along with Welcome to the World, Baby Girl!, because I share a name with the main protagonist. Shallow? You bet your bookmarks.However, my on-line book group was scheduled for a discussion of The Red Tent, hence giving me one more reason to spend 20 bucks I didn't have.Notwithstanding my appalling ignorance of all things Biblical, despite my rabidly Catholic upbringing (I wanted to be a disco nun), I know nothing beyond the book aside from Diamant's skill as a writer and the resounding voice she lent Dinah. She not only creates a compelling woman out of the cardboard woman we meet in the Old Testament, but brought to life a cast of women worthy of the many uninteresting male figures who overshadow them in the big book.One complaint: The story turns too far into the lives of those outside of Dinah's family - her mothers recede into the background. Because of this, Diamant digresses into what is largely uninteresting, at the expense of the interesting.I wanted to know more of the two-dimensional Jacob, whom I like to call Milksop in Sandals, and Shalem the Stallion, Dinah's first hubby.But who the hell cares, read the book. It's good enough, and her name is Dinah. Dee-nah."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I don't think I could even begin to list all the reasons why I love this book. Suffice it to say that it is probably one of the best books I have ever read, and I read a lot of books. I have recommended it to everyone I know, practically. And so far, they have all loved it. Even if it takes you a long time to usually read a book, this one won't. I have 2 kids, one of them a baby, and I managed to read this book in 2 days. Please, please, please read this book. I HOPE she writes more books. I will be buying them in hardback."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This is an interesting book historically and dramatically. The changes made by the author to the biblical story were daring, yet intriguing. Diamont takes the story of Dinah, daughter of Jacob, from Genesis and gives another possible version of how things could have happened. Diamont fleshes out this mysterious woman who is mentioned, what, once? and gives her a chance to speak for herself. The characterizations of the people involved in this story; Leah, Rachel, Zilpah and Bilnah in particular are obviously well thought out and extremely well researched. This book will give you an increased insight into, probably not Dinah, but the way people lived in these biblical times. An immensely enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"wonderful read, i do not have any sisters so i can feel her want,but her female influence is something i wish i had growing up."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Even though this book is a simple, quick read, do not think for a moment that it does not touch or challenge the reader. Often, I found myself hardly waiting for what could possibly happen next, and at other times I found myself rereading a paragraph and saying \\"How fresh for a story that was from so long ago.\\" The language is not fascinating, but it does have its own cadence, and gives the book a gait that moves the reader forward, as if the reader could need anymore prodding beyond the plot. I am not sure how true to scholarship the meat of the book is, as I am less of a Biblical scholar than most, but I do know that I found it very credible, even in terms of language and slang used. (There are a couple of places where it does slip-toward the end of the novel the narrator claims to have \\"peed,\\" which didn't strike me as a consistent manner in which to refer to the act as befit the rest of the novel.) The description, literally, is the novel's best feature-I became very thirsty, hungry, etc. just from reading of the narrator's various experiences. A good book to curl up with a spend a rainy day reading, and better to pick a rainy day to combat the dust of the desert that you will surely taste as you read the book and are swept away by its exotic, succulent voice."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This book takes us back to a time when women were not equal to men. However, the honoring that took place during this time seems so remarkable. Women honored each other, men honored women and children honored their parents, how lovely. The struggles and deep bonds shared between the women in the red tent lifts the spirit and warms the soul. Anita Diamant is phenomenal, her words paint a portrait brimming with clarity, heart and soul. This is a must read for every woman. I can only hope that one day mothers will share this with their daughters and teach them to honor their bodies and cherish becoming and being a woman."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Dinah's story is amazingly touching, it makes the reader think about their own childhood memories. Anita Diamant lets the reader experience Dinah's growth and maturation, feeling the warmth and the bitterness of her memories. The ending seems rushed slightly, however the novel in a whole was written with such spirit and depth that it is hard to put down. Amazing, a wonderful read!!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I found this to be a wonderful book...and you need not be a church-goer for this novel to grab you from the first sentence. I couldn't put this book down. The true excellence of a novel is how well the descriptions make you feel you are actually there witnessing every event. No one will be disappointed after reading this novel!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This book was Great!! It takes you \\"behind-the-scenes\\" of the Bible. While Dinah was only hinted at in the Bible, this book tells her tale of her four mothers and her life in the red tent. It grips you from the start, and you don't want to put it down until you are down. It was such a good story! Diamant didn't use language that the readers today wouldn't understand. It was very readable. While reading this story, you start to realize how life was then. You realize how good our lives are compared to the way people in those days lived. I HIGHLY recommend this book!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I found this story to be completely fascinating. I've always enjoyed Biblical stories, and to see Anita Diamant to enrich these tales with her own version of Dinah's story was stunning to read. This novel is heartbreaking and amazing. I highly recommend it to anyone who is interested in the Bible, women's literature, or anything in between. You won't be disappointed!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This woman is strong, but so subtle in how she can perservere no matter the circumstance. It also shows how little a woman really had all those years ago. I loved it and will read it again. I even loaned to a nun friend of mine. And she loved it. Good reading, and makes you want to read it quickly."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Dinah is Jacob's only daughter and your very close friend along those hours you spend reading her story. Dinah's story with all its losses, gains, happiness, sorrow, tears, laughter, failure, triumphs and with all its blood will change you. It will change the way you look at the Bible and how you perceive its stories next time you read it. It will change your perception of pain and sacrifice. It will change the definition of family and friendship in your psyche. It will depress and regale you and then it will kiss you goodbye. This is one of the most remarkable stories I have ever read. Though it is a work of fiction, it's very credible. For all I care, this could have been Dinah's real story it's that good.The story is told from Dinah's perspective as she recounts her childhood memories with her mothers: Leah, Rachel, Zilpah and Bilhah. She takes you into a world you only read about in the Bible or the Koran. Through her words you will go through a world of shepherds, sorceress, oracles, traditions, customs, midwives, honor, and, of course, the red tent. She continues telling you about her heart's joy and pain as her mind sways between sanity and insanity, between love and hatred. She tells you stories from Canaan and Egypt as her life takes her from the former to the latter with great anguish and agony. She tells you the story of Joseph and his climb to power in Egypt. She gets to tell you about her relationship with Jacob-her dad. She finally gets to talk directly to you since the Bible did her no justice by completely ignoring her story.I highly recommend reading this book. It would be great if you can get a friend, partner or a family member to read it with you so you can discuss it afterward. There is ample material worth discussing in this very well-written prose. This book is a light read and you will be breezing through it in little time for that the characters will take you out on a ride of historic proportions that will keep you asking for more."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This book is absolutely beautiful and tragic at the same time. This story stays with me and I felt as if I was living another life through Anita Diamont. I recommend it to anyone willing to get caught up in the most romantic tale."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I absolutely love this book! What a masterpiece! There is a description on the back of this book that states something similar to: if the bible were written by a female, this is what it would be. I couldn't agree more! For anyone who has even the most remote interest in the bible, this is a must-read. Even for people who haven't the slightest interest in it, this book is amazing. I love to read, and have read many books, but this is by far, one of my favorites. It made me smile; it made me cry. It is an absolutely beautiful story. I didn't think I would be interested in it, or enjoy it. It was given to me as a gift, and I could not have been more wrong. Buy it... you won't be sorry!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I came across this book by accident, but once I started I couldn't put it down. Everything about it is so romantic and passionate (not in the romance sort of way). Strong women who perservere in the hardest of times. i would totally recomend this book."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I cannot express just how wonderful I found this book to be. It is one of those books that gently leads you to another time and place and opens itself up to you so that you feel immersed in this other timeplace and savor each moment you spend there. I checked this book out of the library but when I finished it I ordered a copy for myself. This book is a rare gem that entices one to read and reread, to dwell among its pages and become lost among them."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This is a wonderful work of fiction that gives an astute and well-researched peek into women's lives in this time period. I was fascinated to learn about typical relationship practices between husband and wives, the purpose of the red tent, the food preparation, etc. I approached this book with the understanding that this is one author's idea of the life of Dinah. I did not have pre-concieved notions that this book would foster religious education and values. As one who does not avidly read the Bible or attend church, I would say that I would barely have connected this story to the appropriate chapters in Genesis had I not read the reviews and excerpts. In fact, this book made me more aware of the evolution of religious beliefs. I often thought of parallels to The Mists of Avalon with regard to the Goddesses and the female rituals perpetuated by Rebecca and by Jacob's wives. It was a wonderful and sad story."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I enjoyed this book from the start. This made the old testament seem new and fresh to me."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"My mother sent this as a Christmas gift for my sisters and I. This is my favorite gift this year. I can't wait to share it with everyone I know. The care Anita Diamant takes in telling this story in unparallel. I have never been so moved. Although completely fiction, the way that she describes the characters relationships is true even today. It will make you look at your relationships and the legacies that you are leaving behind. Simply amazing, I feel blessed having had the experience of reading this novel."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"The latest trend of historical fiction, or borrowing from history to write a novel concerns me. I find that people have a very, very hard time seperating fiction from fact. Although this is a very well written and enjoyable book the author herself will tell you that the \\"Red Tent\\" did not exsist in Biblical times and it is somewhat uncertain how it was used in the American Indian culture she borrowed the idea from. I enjoyed this book but I do wish that all readers would take it upon themselves to research the facts and fictions behind these types of stories."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"After so many glowing reviews of this book I found myself dissapointed at the end. I just never really cared about the story or the characters enough throughout the entire book. Granted, the second half is more interesting than then the first, but just barely enough to keep me reading through to the end.I was really hoping for some heartwarming story to connect me to my fellow women but that never happened. I don't think it was necessary for the author to deviate so much from the Biblical story, or at least the part that was described in the Bible. I also found the way she painted most of the men as despicable was distracting and unnecessary for portraying the hardships that women in those days no doubt suffered. If I had to describe this book in one word, the word that keeps coming to mind is disappointment."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Loved how fact was woven together with fiction to make an interesting story to enjoy"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"There is a review titled \\"seeking biblical based fiction\\" that goes on to say this book is not for you if you are. However, I disagree. I do not know what lengths Anita Diamant went in her study of Dinah and this time in history and I assume she did a great deal. If you are familiar with the story of Jacob and his daughter Dinah from the biblical account, than there will be some things in the book that surprise you. However, I encourage Believers to read this book with an open mind, realizing that these were very real people and real events and that this book is FICTION. The events in the book that seem to be contradictory to the bible could have very well been the way it actually happened.I give this book 5 stars because it is written wonderfully and it is one of those books I was sad to end because I wanted the story to continue! You will not be able to put it down."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Here is to the strength of women of the past, the present and the future!Dinah is captivating. The book is perfectly detailed with emotions that overwhelmed me, brought me to tears and made me take my daughter into my arms. Worth more than five stars...Here is to the new moon!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"A wonderful retelling of a familiar Bible story from a woman's perspective. Humorous, thought-provoking, touching, a great read."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Being a biblical scholar myself, I always enjoy reading books about characters we don't hear enough about, especially women characters. This book gives us a colorful, insightful look at the story of Dinah, as well as the lives of the wives of Jacob. While the reader must remember this book is fiction, I think Diamant gives us an intelligent look into biblical times. I'd recommend this book to anyone looking for a good read."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"It's been a while since I read \\"The Red Tent,\\" but it stays with me still. I truly believe it is one of the best books ever written. I've even given it as a gift to my Mom, aunts, in-laws and the few girlfriends who haven't read it. Highly, highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Based on the second half of Genesis in the Old Testament Bible, The Red Tent tells the story of Jacob, his four wives, 12 sons, and one daughter from the women's point of view. It is a fictional life story of Jacob's daughter Dinah, whose name only appears in the Bible 9 times, with 7 of those in chapter 34 of Genesis.Told in the first person, Dinah starts with how Jacob came to her family and married her mother Leah and her aunt Rachel. The red tent of the title is the place to which the adult women retreat during the new moon when they are menstruating, and is the place where the women's traditions and stories are passed on. Month after month Dinah, and we the readers, slowly learn the structure of this early tribal culture that will eventually become the Jewish people.Unlike the Genesis version, this is a strongly matriarchal story, and the activities and visions of Jacob and his 12 sons are just background to the childrearing, farming, cooking, spirituality, and crafts traditions of the women of this time. Especially strong are the birthing traditions because Dinah is portrayed as a midwife.Anita Diamant does a wonderful job of revealing the culture and setting through the words of someone of the time. Dinah is telling the story and it is not until the very end that we discover her intended audience. This is a well-crafted glimpse into the struggles and joys of ancient tribal women of the Middle East."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I recommend this book to ALL women! Wish some of the customs in this book were still around today!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I like to read books that can give the reader an idea of life during a different period of history and still tell an interesting story. I have always thought of the bible as being full of gripping stories. This book just expands upon one of those stories.This book heavily focuses on women's fertility. At the time I read it, my sister was pregnant. I may have found the book more interesting because it related to events in my life."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I used this book in a summer course this year where I give my students basic historical and cultural information about a people/period then we read modern fiction set in that same period and culture. I found the book to be very interesting but the history revisionist in many ways especially regarding women and gender roles. Some of my students found the characters boring while others liked the \\"every day\\" aspect of the narrative. If you like revisionist history and stories that explore the everyday life then you should like this. A word of warning: the Joseph in this tale isn't the Biblical Joseph as hero you may expect."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"After chapter upon chapter of a very enjoyable and totally believable story, Diamant started to tell a crazy tale in the middle of the book that made no sense. I was very annoyed, but since I enjoyed the book so much in the beginning, I decided to trudge through to the end. Happily, the book got believable and enjoyable again. When I finished it, I got out the Bible to see what in Diamant's book was &quot;real&quot; versus &quot;made up.&quot; It was then that I realized that the crazy tale--the one I was so annoyed about--was, indeed, from the Bible itself! It was the stuff that Diamant had fabricated that seemed so believable and real! What an excellent writer!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"When I picked this up for my book club, I was dreading the fact that I'd have to read it. Once I got through the first third of the book, I couldn't put it down. I don't think that this will sit well with people who interpret the Bible literally, but it is an interesting adaption of biblical stories told from the woman's point of view. The cover led me to believe it was a very religious-based novel, but I think it asks the reader to question many of the things found in the Bible and to try and find the story behind the words on the page. Interesting characters, lots for discussion -- a good read."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"20 minutes into the book the characters were well established and I was hooked. It was a wonderful story. And any book that can prompt an individual to read the Bible, in this case Genisus, is GREAT."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I loved this book! It took an all but forgotten character from the bible, and made her real. Better still, it made the time in which she (allegedly) lived real.I love the red tent -- the concept. I wish there were a red tent for me to go into once a month. The opportunity for connection and rest is one all too many of us lack. --"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I am not of Judeo-Christian background but am an avid reader of the Bible. This is a wonderful book full of love, suspense, heartbreak and happiness about a biblical life so greatly overlooked by the sons of the Chosen. It is fiction but it has the flavor and feel of truth. It also gives us a good look at some of the real people in the Bible. Their faults and foibles should in no way color our acceptance of the good they did and the history they created. Anita Diamante is a credit to authors everywhere. These characters are very real and human. I'll read it again!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Anita Diamant has an amazing talent for convincing you that you are part of her story. She has taken a base from the bible, and greatly expanded on it. Her writing style is enticing, drawing you in. Dinah is mentioned in short violent passage in genesis, and is then forgotten. You are given a base on which to set Dinah's story, and without it you wouldn't understand what was happening.The start tells you about Dinah's four mothers and father. Diamant then begins telling of Dinah's life from her [Dinah's] point of view. Her mothers led a life that cherished a woman's \\"coming of age\\" and menstrual cycle. As an only daughter with 4 mothers Dinah is told all her mothers' stories, and tradition is sometimes bent. Although not told from a religious point of view, this book has a great story to tell and is very enjoyable to read."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I must first point out that I am not an Oprah-book-reading, Lifetime-television-watching woman. There is nothing wrong with that, but I normally don't like what I call \\"chick\\" novels or television. But somehow I was recommended The Red Tent and I got the unabridged audio version from the library. I listened to it while packing up my house for a move. Boy, the time did fly. Anita Diamante's words made the biblical world come to life. As a student of theology, I was swept away by the wonderful descriptions and depiction of WOMEN in the biblical world, something that is very rare. Diamante has obviously done her research, ...But if you don't think of yourself as religious and want to avoid this book because of that, you will be missing out."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"She really brings to life what Bible times might have been like ~ very believable. After reading the Red Tent, I re-read the story in Genesis. While she expanded the details and took license (like the existence of the \\"red tent\\" itself), it's amazing how closely it follows the Biblical account. A good read for mothers and daughters to share."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"First off, this writer is very good. Her descriptions of the characters and of what is happening is beautiful. It was an easy book to read although it is for more mature audiences.However, overall I was not pleased by the book. I didn't like how graphic the novel was. I just felt that some things could have been left out of the book. I also felt that the author took too many liberties while creating personalities for the people of the Bible. She tarnishes the names of people by making them into sexually perverted people and the Bible gives no indication that they were.Although the book is well written, I would have rather had the author stay more parallel to what the Bible says about the characters mentioned."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I really enjoyed this book. Though graphic at times, I loved the deep resonating message of the beauty of what it meant to be a woman and the intricacies of relationships from a woman's perspective. The book doesn't scream a message of feminism, it permeates truth by painting lovely and deeply passionate glimpses into the life of a woman in biblical times.There were many pieces of this story that made me yearn for these kind of connected woman-to-woman relationships. It also amazed me the difference in how the natural cycle of a woman was treated and viewed back then as opposed to how it is now. It was celebrated as a time to rejuvenate, to fellowship, to invest in sisters and mothers and daughters. Now, every time a cycle comes along it's an embarrassment, an inconvenience.I loved how even though there is deep sadness in the story, the joy is in the journey and the blessings that, I believe, God can and will bring. Though the road is difficult and unfair, the journey is always worth it."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"From all the male-centric biblical literature we get our first glimpse of the women behind the men. We are allowed into the red tent and share their hopes, fears, loves and ultimately the female experience we can all identify with. It's a shame that the religious tradition this follows does not take the time to honor their heroines but with this book at least some have a voice. To every woman in the world, read this and feel the connection that surpasses religion and culture, the connection we all have as women."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I am not yet half-way through the book and I may not make it to the end. The writing itself is not bad, although I think the best part may actually have been the prologue. Yes, I knew this was a fictional account, but I cannot see why the author felt the need to change things unnecessarily - even down to the point of switching which mothers bore which children and creating a set of twins that did not exist. With such basic facts distorted, it makes it hard for me to even focus on what the author is trying to say. As far as what she is trying to say, it is possible that some other reviewers may have hit the nail on the head when they spoke of the overemphasis on all varieties of sex, however, I am not yet certain that those accusations are fair. I am perfectly alright with historical fiction that adds to what is known, but when really basic facts are totally changed it frustrates me. I guess that is part of being obsessive-compulsive; one of my obsessions is having things in order and accurate (when possible). If one is bothered by a blatant disregard for the facts, then one will find this book very frustrating."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"The New York Times Bestseller, The Red Tent, by Anita Diamant, is a fresh retelling of an ancient story: How the twelve sons of Jacob became the twelve tribes of Israel, but told from the point-of-view of Dinah, Jacob's only daughter. The focus throughout is on women, child bearing and rearing, and the stories and customs that are passed on from mother to daughter in The Red Tent. Dinah is mentioned only once, in Genesis 34, and she never speaks, but her tragic tale would have dire consequences. Diamant gives Dinah the voice that the Old Testament denies her. It is a poetic voice, but also credible coming from the daughter of a tribe of shepherds from biblical times. The story is in three parts: The first part is what she was told by her mother and the other women of the tribe about how her father, Jacob, came to marry all four daughters of Laban. The second part is Dinah's own childhood and growing up. The third part is what happened after the terrible events of Genesis 34, when she goes to Egypt, a mother and a widow, and raises her son, who will become a high ranking scribe.In the Old Testament, Jacob is in love with the beautiful Rachel, but is somehow tricked into marrying Leah, Rachel's elder sister. He eventually marries all four of Laban's daughters, and has twelve sons by them, and one daughter. Leah bears him Reuben, Simon, Levi, Judah, Zebulun, the twins, Naphtali and Issachar, and finally the only daughter, Dinah. Zilpah also has twins, Gad and Asher. Bilhah has only one son, Dan. The beautiful Rachel has only Joseph, and much later, the youngest son, Benjamin. Diamant asks why so many children with Leah if he was tricked into marrying her and really loved Rachel? She gives a much more plausible explanation for the relationship between the four sisters and wives, where Rachel has difficulty bearing children, and becomes a midwife, searching for that elusive child of her own. Dinah becomes her apprentice, thus she is initiated into the mysteries of The Red Tent at an early age.In the second part, Jacob has prospered but most of his hard work has only enriched his father-in-law, Laban. He wants to leave him, taking a portion of his flock that is rightfully his. They prepare to leave, but Jacob is troubled by unfinished business with his brother, Esau. Esau was the eldest of two twins, and thus he was the favorite of his father, Isaac. Yet, Jacob was the favorite of Rebecca, and Jacob took advantage of Esau, and swindled him out of his blessing and birthright for a bowl of porridge. Jacob's tribe sets off for new land, and on the way he meets Esau's family, and settles the old scores with him and his father, Isaac. In Anita Diamant's version, Rebecca lives apart from Isaac, and is a respected oracle with a cult of woman followers.Once they have established themselves in the new area, Dinah, now a midwife in her own right, is asked to be the midwife for the concubine of a local king. While in the city, she meets the prince, and they fall in love. The king and prince ask Jacob for her hand, and offer a rich dowry. Jacob, under counsel of Simon and Levi, are outraged and ask a terrible price for the dowry: That all the men within the gates of the city will be circumcised. Though they agree, they take advantage and while the men of the city are recovering from their ordeal, they are all killed.The Old Testament never tells what ever became of Dinah after this treacherous act, and it also never says how she felt about the matter, but if you would like to hear this hitherto untold story, you will find it in The Red Tent. The Red Tent tells an old story, but by changing the perspective and focus to women, it is like a fresh and totally new tale. Even though you may be familiar with what happened from reading the Bible, you will still want to hear how the story is told in this alternative version. Though well researched, with lots of details about the rituals and customs of the day, it is fiction--albeit a richly imagined fiction--and one that tells the other side of a story that really deserves to be heard."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I put together a summer reading list for myself to get a break from school text books every year. I picked this book randomly and I'm so glad I did. I love books based in historical times and the imagry in this book is absolutly beautiful. I fell in love with Dinah and the women she grew up around. I know its fiction, but Anita made it seem so real, she gave Dinah a face and a story. If you're not into history the beginning can be a bit boring, but the book as a whole is so captivating that you simply must read it for yourself. This is a book that I will past on to family and friends for many years to come."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"When reading this book, whatever your faith, you must remember this is a work of fiction. However, you can't help but feel saturated in the imagery and descriptive nature of the book, which simply sucks you into believing it must have been real. From the dynamics of sisterhood to the cultural aspects of belonging to a large family in that time and place... you will not be disappointed in the journey this book takes you through the eyes of the protagonist. My faith is Christian and I wasn't offended by the beauty of fiction Anita D. weaved for the Biblical family of Jacob. It is an honest read, true to the soul, and simply a story that brings every woman to life when seeing through the eyes of Dinah. Seeing through the eyes of Dinah you experience her awkwardness, her glories, her growth from child to womanhood, and her keen observations that make you want to see an hear more, instead of getting bored. Personally, I read this when I was pregnant and SO glad I did. I bought this book for my best friend immediately and almost didn't give the book back to the friend I borrowed it from. It's definitely a fantastic, essential chick read and it brought me out of my snobby \\"non fiction only\\" rut."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This is a work of fiction....but I think that Dinah must have whispered her story in Anita's ear.This story is about Dinah,her mother Leah and all her beloved aunts, Rachel, Zilpah and Bilah.Brief summary:She is Jacob & Leah's only daughter and is adored. She spends many childhood hours in the red tent with the ladies. They live in Canaan. She marries. Her husband is killed. She & her child go to Egypt and live in a palace. She becomes a mid wife. She is re-connected with her brother Joseph. She leaves the palace. She meets a wonderful man and is married again. She lives a full happy life. She grows very old. When death comes she goes to be with her mother and aunts in heaven. It is much like being in the red tent again.Dinah's name is only mentioned 1x in the bible and we know nothing about her at all. The author has made her come alive and written one of the most fantastic stories you will ever read.It is spellbinding. You will not be able to put the book down. Once you are finished with it you will never forget it. It is much more than a 5 star book. It is a must read for all women.Anita Diamant 6/27/51 is married and has 1 daughter. She writes fiction and non fiction. This book was a best seller."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"After reading some of the reviews, I had to check and make sure for a second.If you're looking for a historically accurate book, go read an autobiography. This is not a book about history, it's just a story loosely based on the Biblical story of Dinah. Which from what I remember (I'll admit, it's been a while since I've read Genesis or this book for that matter) you don't get a lot of detail on in the Bible. Diamant failed by not doing her research about the time period she was writing about...but if you're not a history buff, you probably won't even notice!I read this book a good 5 or 6 years ago I believe and I remember getting offended by some of the things she said about Jacob...but then I realized, HEY! IT'S JUST A BOOK! After that, I couldn't put it down.I recently gave this book to my mother to read, who is, for lack of a better term, a HARDCORE CHRISTIAN. She LOVED it, read it in a couple of days.Yes, the book has MANY inaccuracies, no it is not a book that is going to reaffirm someone's faith in Christ...THIS BOOK IS NOT A WITNESSING TOOL - it is a story, about a girl, who had a difficult life and seemed to have felt that her father didn't love her enough. A story a lot of women can relate to no matter what time period they're from."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This story of Women was powerful. I read it in 1 day because I could not put it down. Do not be put off by the fact that it is &quot;biblical&quot; in nature (though for those of us who ourselves are grounded in faith it is that much more awesome). It is a truly wonderful book for everyone to read. I recommend it without hesitation!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"If you are curious about this book- get it from the library ! The author is so incorrect about known Biblical history that when she weaves this ficional story one has to wonder what \\"facts\\" she has just created for \\"story sake\\"! I wanted to learn about certain Jewish and ancient customs- now I wonder if those depicted are fiction too - one has to be carefull in writing a \\"story of fiction\\" from Biblical history- don't change what is already known-- it confuses everything ! I've read another fiction book about Mary and Joseph's time and their trip to Bethlehem (a most famous Bible story)- none of the known facts as it related to the Bible were changed- and that was a \\"good read\\"! If you are a sincere reader of the Bible's Old Testament- you will be upset when you read this book-- too many known facts distorted! A lot about the other gods and religious practices of anciesnt times is included--but are these fact or fiction too? Iam surprised that one who has written so many other books about (real) Jewish cutoms, practices would write a book such as this. Disappointing read!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"At first, the book is daunting, with all of the names and families and places, so hard to grasp and keep track of. But then, as I struggled, as if I were driven to read this, I found it all falling into place and the era being reminiscent of the biblical stories I have been told only outlines of in my catholic educational roots. From a women's perspective, I found a reason to continue reading these book about the days of Genesis, so as to learn the history of my appointed sexuality, so before I was even finished with this book, I had ordered two more. Sarah and Rebekah, the women of Genesis, (both wonderful book also). But four weeks later I'm at a loss, as I wish I could coninue this subject matter through reading these type of books, yet I fear that I have exhausted the variety. I hope there will be more to come.I really enjoyed this book, the manner in which the story was told, and the authors historical research that was evident in it's ability to take me back into the biblical stories of the many hours listening to the written word in church."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"The Red Tent is the type of book that you will have a hard time putting down. Anita Diamant is an excellent writer who has brilliantly adapted a biblical story that was just a mere mention in the Bible and turned it into a whole book and an excellent one at that.This is the story of Dinah (Jacob's daughter and Joseph's sister) and her mothers Leah, Rachel, Zilpah, and Bilhah. I thought it was interesting to read about the customs that the women followed during that period of time especially about the way the celebrated their monthly cycle and how they beared children.I looked up the passage in the bible that refers to Dinah and the authors account of the facts was accurate, but most of the story is fictional. We know that the bible was written by men in a time when women were second class citizens, but this book makes you think that maybe there are more women in the bible that could have her story as told as compelling as Dinah's. I hope that Ms. Diamant or maybe another writer can bring more of these stories to life, but for now I highly recommend reading The Red Tent."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Guy here, reading a &quot;girl&quot; book...excellent, excellent, excellent. Effortless to read. Great characters and story. Couldn't wait to pick it up each night. Was depressed when finished, wondering how I'd find another book as good."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Dinah is an unforgettable character. This book grabbed me from the first chapter. I enjoyed the author's characterizations of Rachel, Jacob, Joseph and Rebecca. The prose is beautifully written and effortlessly evokes the world at that time. It is a riveting portrayal of the struggles and relationships of women's lives long ago, many of which still resonate in our lives today. I'd recommend this to any lover of historical fiction."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I work in a small bookstore so when one book starts selling unexpectedly well I take notice, and if I have the time and inclination, I read it. The Red Tent was once such book, and I'm profoundly grateful my customers brought it to my attention! It is well-crafted, compelling and thoroughly enjoyble reading, a fascinating insight, utterly believable, into a time gone by. ..."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Don't read this book if you are looking for bible study. But if you want to read FICTION, then it's a good read. It uses the bible as a launching point, not as a resource that must be closely followed. It is an imaginative, colorful exploration, not intended to have any claim of accuracy. As such, it succeeds. If you like this book, you should also read The Ladies Auxiliary by Tova Mirvis."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This compares well with another work of historical fiction relative to the Bible, &quot;Dear and Glorious Physician&quot;, which presents details about the life of St. Luke, the Evangelist. &quot;The Red Tent&quot; adds enrichment to the story of the lives of the sons of Jacob, about whom we know mostly Joseph and his travails. 'Deena' represents the strength and courage of all people of fiber, particularly when life is not the walk in the park that one hopes for. Her steadfastness in being victimized by her brothers, then her aloof mother-in-law removing her son from any sense of filial relationship, and her persistence in remaining true to herself, finally reconciling with her family through the eyes of a youngster-what a WOW wallop! Overall, it is a wonderful story of compassion and love."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This was indeed a well written fiction. The writer did do her homework in Ancient Near Eastern religious practices with regard to cultic practices of fertility cults. However, it is not wholly accurate historically. The cultic relgious practices of the Egyptians, Canaanites and the like did influence the Israelites and later Jews of the Ancient World. BUT it is also important to remember that the Israelites and their ancestors practiced separation, if not isolation from common pagan practices of these other peoples. Religion was regulated by the patriarchs and priests of Israel. The religious practices of the characters in this book would not have been tolerated by the Israelites, and may have even lead to &quot;stoning.&quot; However, it is important to say that the Israelites did not operate in a social vacuum. They were influenced by other cultic practices by the peoples around them. This was commonly denounced by their own prophets and priests, as seen in the Prophetic books of the Old Testament. Also it is important to note that &quot;the red tent&quot; is NOT found in the Hebrew Bible, which is the historical source for the religious practices of the Israelites and later Jews.With that said, approached as FICTION, one can appreciate this book. BUT the condoning attitude toward fertility cults of the Ancient World by the women of the Israelites is NOT ACCURATE."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I am 75% of the way into the book so far and wanted to go ahead and post my opinion, and I agree with the others that it is a women's book. My husband would hate it. I believe in God and His divine wisdom, but I'm not religious, I don't go to church, and I haven't read the Bible. However, I do teach in a Catholic school (you don't have to be Catholic to teach in a Catholic school), so I'm not ignorant of these issues either. I wasn't real familiar with Rachel, Jacob, or the rest of the cast of characters from the Bible before I began reading The Red Tent, so I enjoyed it simply as a work of fiction. From what I know about the time period, the setting seems accurate. Men were the protectors and decision-makers, and women had kids, cooked meals, and served the men. That is how it was. Heck, it's still like that in many third-world countries! I was not insulted by the book's message. I thank God we don't live in a world like that anymore, but I can enjoy reading what life was probably like 2,000 years ago. I recommend the book as a piece of fiction, not a political essay on the mistreatment of women or a violation of sacred text."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This is a great story that highlights the life of Biblical figures I had previously known little about. I think we can all agree that women besides Mary are not often elaborated on in the actual bible.The concept of a Red Tent, a place where women go for menses and childbirth, is a wonderful concept. Menstruation was celebrated instead of something to be ashamed of. One of the messages I took out of this book was that being female is something quite special. I also felt it emphasized sisterhood and caring for other women. These are all values we could stand to have a little more of. I can see why this book was so popular."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I can't imagine any woman not liking, really, LOVING this book. I am in the process of reading it a second time and I am just as enthralled with the story, the writing, and the characters as I was the first time. Maybe even more so.The book follows the life of Dinah, daughter of Jacob and Leah, from before her birth to her death. As a young girl, she was showered with the love and wisdom of her mother and her three Aunts, Bilhah, Rachel and Zilpah. At the onset of her young adulthood she falls in love and tragic events, caused by her own brothers, are soon to follow. Dinah continues her life as best as she can, gives birth to a son and finally finds another great love to grow old with. There is some redemption towards the end of the book for the great tragedy that happened to her, but it was not enough to make up for it. The end of the book will make you cry, not because it is sad, but because it is profound.This is a book that will either enforce your beliefs as a woman or change them for the better. I have recommended it to every woman I know, and every single one of them gave it rave reviews."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I was so relieved to see that many scholars have weighed in about the historical accuracy of this book, saying that the author seemed to have done little research. When I reached page 20 where the father of one of the main women characters in the book is described as \\"bothering the flocks like some horny boy, his lust was legendary. The ewes run like gazelles when Laban walks up the hill.\\" And on page 31 \\" Zilpah takes Rachel up to the highest pasture and showed her the boys having their way with the ewes, who bleated pitifully and bled.\\"I mean it just about destroyed the 23rd Psalm for me. \\"The Lord is My Shepherd...\\" suddenly seemed sort of sordid.And Jesus was always using the metaphor of being a good shepherd.But these days I guess anything goes, and we're all supposed to be sophisticated and act like things like bestiality are okay, and in the old days, all the shepherds did it.I was very disappointed by this book. I had such great hopes. Genesis from the woman's point of view sounded like such a great read, but forget it. This book totally grossed me out."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Of course this tale is fiction, but it rings with such truth and probability that it made me weep. I wept for the fact that their stories even have to be fictionalized in the first place because we know so little about them. I identified so strongly with the characters of this book that I felt as if I have always known them, because they have been in my dreams and speculation all my life. Dinah speaks directly to the reader as if you are one of her beloved, lost daughters, and by the end you know you are.Any woman who has suffered the pangs that organized religion forces upon her, and knows deep within her female heart that God does not consider her, with her bleeding, birth, and lactation, inferior at all, will love this book.I have been in the process of rediscovering the Sacred Feminine, and learning that the fact that she is missing from the scripture has nothing to do with God, but the lack of understanding on the part of the early Christian Fathers. It was their fear, ignorance, and prejudice that took her, the Earth Mother and her daughters, away from us, and it makes my heart soar that women are reclaiming her again, restoring the balance of male and female energies, as a necessary part of our Spirituality. If the need to connect with the Ancient women, the ones who knew all the secrets of the ways to feel fully female and proud in the presence of God, unashamed of their bodies and it's functions, then this book is for you.The story itself is a kind of allegory for what was done to women's spiritual life in general. When Simon and Levi slit Shalem's throat, they are &quot;avenging&quot; Dinah, or so they said publicly, when in reality they were serving their own purposes and political positions towards the King. The same could be said of the stamping out of the Goddess, the way she was separated from God in our minds in order to &quot;save and protect&quot; us from her. In doing so, we, just like Dinah, we cut off from the very thing we loved and treasured.Thanks, Ms. Diamant, for helping me a little further along the path!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"The Red Tent was an Ok book. I had to pull/drag myself through it on occasions. I loved the bond between the women. PLEASE do not buy this book and expect it to follow the Bible. It appears that Ms. Diamant took a couple of names, their genealogy and some Jewish and &quot;pagan&quot; traditions and threw them together. I would not recommend it and will give it away to the first friend who is interested in reading it."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"The cycle of menstruation is a common theme within this book. This is an uncomfortable subject, yet The Red The Red Tent wipes away the notion of a woman's menses as disgusting, filthy and private. Menstruation is regarded by the four wives of Laban as a magical process that marks womanhood; a monthly reminder for all women that their bodies are beautiful temples of creation. Read this as a woman and you will take on a whole new perspective on your body and its capabilities."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Not a surprise that one reviewer compared this book to \\"Mists of Avalon\\" -- both books insert contemporary neo-pagan beliefs and sensabilities into stories set in earlier times, and both books delight advocates of women-centric neo-pagan spirituality.Diamant is a skilled writer, but don't expect upon picking up this book that you will be reading either a biblically or historically accurate account of the times."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I do not understand the glowing reviews for this book. The first half reads like a gynecology course for the ancients. (I must admit the second half improves, but not enough to carry the book.)It is clear that the author has a dim regard for the men of the bible, and she takes every opportunity to trash them while simultaneously elevating the women to priesthood. The women follow a goofy religion of gods and goddesses, worshiping mother earth, which culminates in a disturbing ritual at a girl's first menses.This is supposed to be historical fiction about the early Jews, yet the women don't even know about Abraham's God, and it doesn't seem that the men do much in this regard, either. I had hoped for a glimpse into early Judiasm, and was sadly disappointed.The basic story is interesting, but could be told in about three pages. The rest is tedious prose. Don't waste your time on this one."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I bought this book thinking it would give me some insight into the lives of the women in the bible but was very disappointed as it focused too much on the idols and pagan ways of the women and wives of Jacob.It wasn't even scripturally sound .If you write a book based on truth then get your facts straight !The life of Jacob was centered on the God of Abraham and Isaac, the one and only true God but Diamant portrayed him as a pagan who compromised his faith for the love of women.In the true account of Jacob and his family's story his children would have been influenced by their father's faith.What a load of rubbish, I was looking forward to the historical accounts of eastern women in that time.There is nothing worse than reading historical novels which belie the truth and destroy and discredit actual characters."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I wasn't expecting to enjoy this book as much as I did. I was very hesitant to read it since this book was based on a biblical story and I don't like preachy books, but it was amazing and drew me in after the first couple pages.I loved how \\"The Red Tent\\" focused on the bond between mothers and daughters and the power that they hold within the family. This book explored the life of Dinah, the only daughter of Jacob, and the sister of countless brothers. As the book's narrator she takes you through the perils that all girl's face even though the customs have changed drastically since biblical times, but still she makes it easy to relate.Overall, this book is one of the bests I have read all year."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Last night, after I finished this book, I unintentionally woke up my husband in bed with my sobbing. I am not ruining this book for you--there is joy in it, and sorrow. Diamont's writing style coincides with the style of the Old Testament, which enhances the believability of the book. It's not to say that this is how the Bible would be written if written by a woman, but it is to say this book provides a snapshot of what it would be like to be a woman during ancient biblical times. The threads of sisterhood, womanhood, motherhood, gratitude, pain, and the joy in ordinary, everyday life are beautifully woven together. I cannot recommend it highly enough. What a privilege to have found and read this diamond of a book."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I absolutely adored The Red Tent! Absolutely. And I'm even a christian -gasp-!! I know that this is a work of fiction, but a lot of christians don't want to realize that idolatry was rampant in the Middle East during biblical times. This just shed some insight into what could have happened, and I love it. I feel that women hold a certain power that only grows when we get together. READ THIS BOOK!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This is the first 5-star review I've ever given on Amazon. Diamant's prose is powerful and mesmerizing, hooking the reader from the very first page. Dinah takes us to a place we care about, filled with people we care about (either good or bad), and recreates such vivid sensory input that it's a disappointment to put the book down and go back to the everyday world.Diamant takes just the right number of risks, re-casting the familiar story and characters in such a way as to make you go \\"Aha!\\" but without veering off into the realm of wildly goofy or too modern. The second act isn't as good as the first, and the climax is more of an anticlimax, but it's more than worth the read. This is the standard that most modern Biblical fiction aspires to (the one that re-started the trend), and few measure up. As fiction, it's a highly readable, believable, entertaining, heartbreaking work."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This book speaks straight to the heart of the feminine soul, and it made me long to strengthen the sisterhoods of family and friends around me and celebrate what it means to be a woman. Diamant moves the reader with every exalted emotion you can imagine, ultimately making a statement about the human condition as well. But most of all, she makes you consider what it might be like to embrace what we (women)are rather than mourning it as a curse. And at the very least, it's an incredibly entertaining suggestion of what life might have been like so many thousands of years ago. I definitely admire the \\"seemingly\\" authentic atmosphere she has created, with realistic and often accurate names and places, considering how little is available to us for understanding that way of life. I know relatively little about the bible (Gideon is my dog's name and just a coincidence), but after finishing this book in a day, I went straight to Genesis and actually laughed out loud at how her book made what is referred to as the dryest reading in the bible come alive on the page with possibility. I could read the generations like a book, and keeping in mind that all one has is their imagination to interpret what is written there, Diamant's definitely does an incredible job of filling in the gaps. I challenge you to try it for yourself, if only for the kick! Because whatever your opinion is after reading this book, I think you would not be disappointed you spent the time."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"The Red Tent is a fictionalized account of Dinah, the only daughter of Leah and Jacob in the Bible. Genesis 34 tells her story, but Dinah says that story does not portray the exact picture of what happen. The indication in Genesis 34 is that Dinah was raped by a prince of Shechem and then the king offered a bride-price for her to her father. However, her brothers were insulted and felt that their sister had been treated as a whore, so they demanded that the prince, the king and all the men in Shechem should be circumcised in order for the prince to be able to take Dinah for his bride. The king agreed to this, but two days after the city's circumcision, Dinah's brothers came in and killed all the men in the city. Dinah's story ends there in the Bible.The Red Tent begins with Leah, Rachel, Bilhah and Zilpah as young girls/women, at the time Jacob comes to their camp to find a wife. It continues through the marriages, the births of the children and then Dinah begins to tell her own story. I won't go into detail about what happens in the palace with the prince, because that would spoil the story. However, once the prince has died, Dinah flees her family and travels to Egypt, where she lives out the rest of her life.In this retelling, readers will recognize scenes from Genesis, such as Leah becoming Jacob's bride ahead of Rachel, Jacob's struggle at the river Jabbok and Joseph's becoming a ruler in Egypt. However, The Red Tent tells these stories in a slightly different way. They are all told from Dinah's perspective or from her mothers' perspective. Having never really given much thought to the story of Dinah, I found this book quite entertaining and VERY thought-provoking. Re-reading Genesis 34, I found that Dinah's account of her time in the palace in Shechem does not contradict the Bible. So, read the story with a thoughtful mind and heart.Ms. Diamant has a remarkable way of making the past come to life and I thoroughly enjoyed her writing style and her characters."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I have not yet quite finished &quot;The Red Tent,&quot; but have thoroughly enjoyed it so far. I am a Christian and a traditionalist in many ways, but I do not share some Christian readers' apparent distaste for Diamant's presentation of the patriarchs. I have long seen the Hebrew Scriptures as a story of a people's often-stormy relationship with God, and their discovery of what it means to be God's people. Jacob is still only the third generation called into the covenant made with Abraham. God is a mighty God, but the people to whom He gave free will can be stubborn! One critical reader asserted that if Jacob were really the kind of man presented in &quot;The Red Tent,&quot; Judaism and Christianity would not exist today. I have to differ: these faiths exist today, not because of the man Jacob was or wasn't, but because of the God that God is.Diamant's story enhances the feeling I have for this particular stretch of Genesis. It creates a wonderful picture of daily life at the time, and gives what I would guess might be a fairly accurate picture of this family's spiritual experience. Throughout the Hebrew Scriptures God's people continue to fall back to the comfortable worship of false gods. That Jacob's clan does not yet fully understand what it means to be the people of the one God strikes me as very human and very likely. We look back on these stories (whether in scripture or in a book like Diamant's) with the perspective of millenia of institutional monotheism. Jacob and his family lived a world that's so long past it takes (for me, at least) the imagination of a writer like Ms. Diamant to fully bring it to life."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I purchased this book due to my interest in woman's place within the Christian/Judaic religions. The thought of reading a novel which takes place in the dawn of post-pagan times fascinated me. I was not let down. The story of Dinah from childhood, through adulthood and death was filled with vivacious descriptions of life as a woman in Caanan and Egypt in pre-biblical times. Anita Diamant manages to captivate the reader with her vivid accounts womens'day to day activities as well as their overall role in their various tribes. Their ranks as wives to their men, their involvement with their children, and the world around them.A true 'window' into our past."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This is a fascinating tale that takes the story of the bible and expounds upon the family and time that was originally represented. I am not a strong religious person, so don't let the subject matter turn you off from this terrifc book. I found the liberties Diamant took added so much to this book. I enjoyed the way she wove the stories together and gave voice to Dinah, who was just a few short lines of verse in the bible. This book is a beautiful representation of the complex relationships between sisters, mothers and daughters. This story is often touching, full of sorrow, but also relays the joys of womanhood. Excellent read!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I've read a lot of fiction that is based (sometimes quite loosely) on historical events. Like much of history itself, a lot of historically-based fiction is often written by and/or about men and tells their stories. This one is different because it is written by a woman and tries to re-create (as fiction) the stories of a group of women from the Old Testament who are barely even mentioned and really only have &quot;footnote&quot; status in the Bible (another book written from a man's point-of-view). From this book I felt like I got a glimpse of what life must have been like for these female protagonists back in Old Testament times. If you've never read the Bible and don't know anything about the Old Testament, don't worry-- no prior knowledge is required here. Just be prepared to become totally immersed in the lives and sagas of these women through the eyes of Dinah."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I think every reader would find a connection to Dinah. To me, it was a beautiful story of a woman's life.. of her aging into an adult, her closeness with the women around her, her relationships with men- romantically and otherwise, childbirth, death and the trials and errors of being a woman. Above all though, I think it paints a strong picture of what life was like for women during Biblical times. I especially enjoyed the subject of midwifery... the herbs used and the bonds and spirituality that is tied to it. I definately would argue that this is one of the most interesting and influential books I've read. I've already mailed out a copies to my mom and my sisters!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"The Red Tent is a fascinating account of the transition from polytheism and women's power, to monotheism and men's domination. The Red Tent is a readable, enjoyable account of the life of the nomadic early Hebrews at the dawn of montotheism and its corrolary: patriarchy. The spirit of the women sharing the red tent during their menstrual cycles is both captivating and intimately believable. I felt the power emanating from their shared knowledge of vastly important &quot;secrets&quot; such as childbirth, recipes, and family management. As their spirits, as well as their gods, faded into the background, the loss was palpable and ever so real. Bravo for a writer who can transform these (almost) prehistorical women into recognizable &quot;actors&quot; in the drama of the feminist struggle."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I hated even the IDEA of this book; I've always cringed at anything resembling Biblical historical fiction. But after three failed attempts, and reading the rave reviews here at Amazon, I decided to give it another try. By the time I got a couple of chapters in, I was hooked.With her spicy and textured prose, Diamant paints an honest and three-dimensional heroine. Her brothers, too, spring to life on the page: Reuben, Simon and all the twelve tribes right on down to Joseph.In this book, Diamant has managed to weave midrash with modern insights to bring her women's lives into focus. While the men tend to fade into the background, probably some would say the Bible itself is guilty of this in reverse.Some readers may object to Diamant's diverges from traditional interpretation; for instance, Dinah's rape is turned into a love affair. But Diamant writes so knowledgeably and with such respect for existing traditions that it's difficult to fault her, especially given her clear fascination with her subject matter.While it may be uncomfortable to discover in our foremother Rebecca a petty old crone, or see our other mothers practicing the fertility rites of their ancestors, there is a reverence here as well, a compassion for all these mothers and fathers who paved the way for monotheism and morality as we know it today.This is an important work for Jews and non-Jews, believers and non-believers. The Bible wasn't given in a vacuum -- it was earned by the sweat and blood of the earnest, hard-working desert nomads we meet perhaps for the first time through Diamant's novel."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"The Red Tent is a beautifully written book. A tale of an ancient world that leaves the reader moved. I was hooked after reading the first few pages of this story. Anita Diamant has a true gift as a writer. I found myself transported to ancient biblical times and found myself being able to connect with the women in this finely crafted novel. The Red Tent is a book that modern women can connect with. A story of love, pain, celebration, and honor.I found it to be captivating, and thought provoking. A wonderful read."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"A friend referred me to Diamant's The Red Tent. I thought it would be similar to Francine Rivers' Lineage of Grace series wherein she tells the stories of the five women listed in the lineage of Christ in Matthew 1. Rivers adheres strictly to the Biblical accounts of these woman and takes liberties that with what is left unsaid that are consistant with the rest of the story. I have no problem with this. Diamant, however, adheres only loosely to Dinah's account, as one reviewer wrote. While she didn't get a whole book in the Bible for herself, Dinah isn't written like Enoch (who barely gets a sentence or two about his existance) -- there's a bit to work with here.The writing is amazing - so earthy and sage. I couldn't write like that if I tried. The women are painted as very pagan (which may very well be so, as they stole Laban's idols when they left with Jacob), and the book lumps the God of Jacob in with any other god worshipped at the time. I didn't find it to be true to the Biblical account, and I don't like it when writers do that.All in all, the writing was beautiful, but the plot left much to be desired. I barely finished it. There is a pagan ritual for a woman's first menses that Diamant writes about in detail that I thought unnecessarily graphic. Not for the faint-hearted (and I am hardly such), and do not, as some have in other reviews, label this a Christian book. It is no such thing."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"The story takes place during Biblical times. Dinah is the daughter of Jacob and Leah, and the story revolves around the \\"red tent,\\" where women gathered during their menses, and where they were cared for during birth and illness. It is a strong testament of the strength of women to care for each other and their families during a time of intense hardship and strong male dominance.This is a book that's hard to put down. The story follows Dinah through childhood, to adulthood, and to her final earthly breath. It's woven around her \\"mothers,\\" Jacobs many sons, her husbands and son, and life in Canaan and Egypt. You get a front row seat to the customs of the time. Diamant brings the past to your doorstep in this fantastic book."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I think this book takes biblical fiction to a whole new level. I thought it was wonderful. She was open and out there, well researched, and honest. She didn't hide the fact that there were other gods worshiped, even with all the Jewish books she has written. She didn't hide the fact that most men had many wives, and that their sons were not always what they should be. She was open that sex and abuse were staples even bad then. I appreciate her. I love the fact that she took a \\"small\\" character of the bible (in comparison) and made her real. So thank you to the author well done."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I was nervous about this book at first. My grandma gave it to me to read and I thought it would be overly-preachy (all I knew about it centered around women from the Bible). I was pleasantly surprised. It certainly stands on its own and is not preachy at all. The interactions between the mothers and their daughter were beautiful. The story line held its own and all the historical details added a lot. I just loved it. Would definitely recommend it."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"The story was well written and pulled me into the pages quickly. I was expecting something completely different. While I was aware that the author was not a Christian, I was expecting a little more Old Testament history. The women of the story all worship many different gods and goddesses. I was expecting more. I was not disappointed with the entertainment of the story, but other than most of the characters names come from the Old Testament, and certain stories coming into play, there is very little to this story that could be classified as Biblical fiction. I love Egyptian history and fiction, and I think this would fall more into that category."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I read this book just after giving birth to my first daughter, this December 2006, so I found this women-centric novel fascinating not only for its religious history, but also for the intimacy with women from the earliest days of Judaism it offers. We learn minutiae of their lives, how they ate olives, bread and cheese and drank beer, how they spun thread most of their waking hours. The story drips the blood of women in birth and labor, and of women and babies who die because of pregnancy. The narrative also introduces us to women of cultures that still contrast today, Jacob's clan from Haran (modern Iraq/Syria) who migrate to Canaan (modern Israel), of which the narrator Dinah is a member, and, later, the Egyptians of Dinah's mother-in-law, Re-nefer. The women of Jacob's clan cherished daughters as their own living memories, as ears and eyes to carry on their own histories, secrets and beliefs. Those of Re-nefer's wealthy Egypt valued class and stature, prizing signals of both. Both cultures decorated women, the former with bangles and herbal scents, the latter with perfumes, make up and linen. Both dealt with death as an intimate part of birth.Seeing the story from Dinah's eyes gives us a new angle on the story of Jacob, a vision from the world of women, which misses the details of the men's travails because Dinah and her four mothers seemed to live in a reality separate from that of their men. They dined separately, slept separately and conducted the business of their days separately, with only occasional consultation. So we miss the warped logic that must have carried Simon and Levi to murder Dinah's new husband and his consorts. We miss how Joseph's brothers resolved to sell him into slavery and how the entire clan of Jacob ended up in Egypt themselves.The story resolves nicely, accounting for all of its characters and providing peace for its little known Dinah."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Hogwash. Great opportunity to paint words about life for women in Biblical times but...once the author crossed the line from history to fiction she lost me. I now consider the entire book garbage and will strongly recommend against anyone I know reading. I feel sorry for those who read this and think the Biblical truth can be found. Read Genesis instead...just as exciting, same characters but the truth can be found."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I was extremely dissapointed with this book. It could have been great except for the unbeleivable amounts of untruths and downright lies concerning Biblical truth. They were totally unneccessary. The author took it upon herself to rewrite scripture. Very dangerous! The book could have been plenty interesting without them. Dont believe everything she writes as gospel because it is NOT. Also there are some very gruesome chapters that if true would be history but instead are only fictional. Too many people unknowingly think this book is biblical fact when it isnt at all."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"We purchased this book for a book club reading for Christian women. After reading just a short way into it, we realized it was not Biblical, had no Biblical facts in it, wasn't even a good fiction book, and was generally deplorable. Don't buy it; don't read it. It's trash."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"With all of the fundamentalist hand wringing surrounding Harry Potter(undeserved), I can't believe that this book isn't being condemened from every pulpit. This book is a pagan catechism. From the perspective of the narrator of this story The Goddess is good and the God of Abaraham is only one in the long list of petty gods and goddesses that must be appeased. It is entirely possible that the real Dinah may have believed this,but this book should have clearly warned the reader that this is a strongly anti-Jewish/Christian book."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"The Red Tent is to be avoided at all costs and though I haven't read any, I would urge the entire world not to buy Anita Diamant's other books. Please prove to her that women aren't stupid enough to be duped into buying a book by doing your market research, spending a few weeks in the Library of COngress and pressing all the right feminist, biblical and new-age buttons. Worthy, patronising totally lacking in historical credibility and just plain boring. This book just proves that taking an old, politically incorrect story and correcting it is far from a foolproof recipe for great literature."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I'm not familiar with the Old Testament, nor am I a mother. I have less than zero interest in the female bodily functions of others. I don't know nothin' 'bout birthin' babies and I don't want to. That said, I found this book a chore. It was, in fact, an assignment for my book club. Had it not been, I would have steered clear of it. However, if these topics enthrall you, pick up the book and knock yourself out. None of the women portrayed were deeply drawn. Dinah (pronounced &quot;dee nah&quot;) herself was not fully formed. The men were meer stick figures, less than two dimensional. It is, by far, the bloodiest book I've ever read. There is more blood and gore in this innocent novel than in any Steven King horror fest. At best, it's deeply superficial. And finally, I would not want to set foot in a red tent. Ohh...the smell of it. That's what I was left with."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Sickeningly obcessed with one aspect which though important is not the be-all and end-all of womanhood. Its slant is so unifocal and simple/singlemided as to be truly an embarassment to women and demeaning to both sexes as portrayed. I read through this junk so I could criticize it having read through it entirely, although it was obvious to me after ten pages that the style and perspective were remarkably immature. The writing style is dumbed-down to a fourth grade level. If she could get off her gender obcession she might write nice books for young readers. God forbid a young female mind should read this!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I found the book to be teribbly obsessed with one thing, and one thing only - sex. While realizing that Biblical people were human and certainly procreated, this book seemed to be more about one woman's fictional sexual growth than about the truths that are in the Bible. The book jacket says that this book is the way the Bible would have been written if it had been written by a female. I think not."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I picked up this book expecting to read something that would enhance my faith and understanding of the Bible; however, I was offended by it. This book celebrates paganism and portrays bestiality as &quot;normal&quot; behavior. I also find it implausible that all women in those days menstruated at exactly the same time and it only lasted for 3 days - a real stretch, don't you think? It was quite a disappointment."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I know I am in the minority here, and I'm sorry that I didn't find the book as enjoyable as the other readers. I must admit that this book was interesting as I did learn a few things about the traditions back in those days. I also liked the author's writing style; however, I feel that the author rewrote the original story that was in the Bible. As a young Christian woman, I thought that this book would give me some great insight on women's faith back in those days. Unfortunately, it was the wrong kind of faith as most of the book seems to be talking about other &quot;gods&quot; and &quot;goddesses.&quot; I wish I never read this book because it &quot;trashed&quot; the characters of many important people of the Bible (i.e., Jacob, Rebecca, and especially Joseph). Like another reader here, I also would not recommend this book to other Christian believers as this book had some very graphic sexual details and again the trashing of many Bible heroes. Thank goodness I didn't waste any money on this book (as I borrowed it from the library). It's an interesting tale here; however, the original version in the Bible is so much better. Good luck with your decision and reading."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This is a wonderful book and very well written. The characters are intriguing and the writing style is in conjunction with biblical times. Would highly recommend reading this book, especially if you are interested in biblical times and experiencing how women lived in those days."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I read THE RED TENT in a purely historical context, and I was well pleased. I did not read it for Biblical accuracy, but rather for the story of a community of women from another time and culture. Anita Diamant's lyrical writing immediately dropped me back into the time of red tents, seemingly the only place where women could speak frankly about their lives. Here is a story of love and hate, betrayal and loyalty, prejudice and hardship, sorrow and joy. These emotions are valid in any time period; it is simply the women's reactions to them based on their circumstances which are different. Diamant's writing style is easy to read, and her portrayal of this community of women, this sisterhood, is almost archetypal in its tone. I honor the women of the red tents for their strength and courage, for they are ancestors to all women. After all, their dreams are not that different from our own."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This book brought the ancient times in to an entirely new perpsective for me. I found myself completely immersed in the people, the customs, the places and the feel of all that was surrounding me.Ms. Diamant brought forth the true feel of how life must have been for a woman at the time of Dinah. I thank her for this book.This is the one book that I truly did not want to end."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I felt this book was about more about the relationships between women than a book about a religious figure. For me the story really revolved around the complicated, emotionally charged feelings of triumph, heartache, loss, fear, jealousy, forgiveness, bonding and love that women have for each other, whether it is close friend or especially family. I wish I had a red tent to go into each month with my sisters and mother to sort these feelings out. The men in the story are no worse or better protrayed than in other books (especially the Bible) - we probably all have known men similar to them in one way or another, but love them anyway just like these women do. If you want accuracy skip this book as it is a novel that takes license with biblical history but if you want a good hard-to-put-down read, this is it."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This is my all time favourite book - set in the times of the Old Testament and possibly how the Bible may have read if it had been written from a woman's point of view. It is a book filled with sorrow and celebration of being a woman - from the innocence of young girls sharing the 'red tent' (place where women gather each month during menstruation to celebrate being a woman, support and learn from each other) to the act of childbirth - a right of passage into the world of women.The Red Tent is incredibly dramatic, beautifully narrated, historically fascinating, obsessive reading and emotionally draining(!!! I laughed, I rejoiced, I sobbed!!!) I have recommended it to everyone I know!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"It is rare that a book draws me in so fully and completely as \\"The Red Tent\\" did. The book sat, unread, on my shelf for a long time - it looked so thick and I knew once I opened it I would give my heart over to it... and indeed I did...and then I immediately passed it along to my daughter to read.While I am fairly Bible literate, this is not a requirement to read this novel - in fact, it would serve as a more compelling introduction to the culture of the times moreso than the old epic movies that used to be so popular and all seemed to star Charlton Heston... *smile*While this is the story of Dinah - the narrator - it goes backward far enough in history and just enough forward to make the circle of the story feel complete. I loved reading about Leah, especially, who in the past I always pitied. Diamont's Leah is not to be pitied - she is to be honored and respected. The women who married - and shared Jacob - almost made having multiple wives a perfectly ok practice. I know, odd - but the camaradie and caring they shared was amazing - and the community of \\"the Red Tent\\" made me wish we had something akin to this in present day.... Respite from all the guys and a time to bond as women.... even when rivalries flared and problems arose, there was always someone left who cared....Mid-way through the book there is a tragedy and I almost stopped readiing, it hurt me so deeply. How often has that happened in my reading life? Never! I might stop because I was bored or indifferent, but not here.\\"The Red Tent\\" is not filled with suspense... its romantic elements are woven artistically into the fabric of the story - there is murder, there is rape, there is abuse, there is sibling rivalry, there is loss and love... but mostly there is heart and connection in a family that stands the test of time and generations - that rights poor choices over generations and keeps the stories of the family alive through oral tradition.I also loved the ongoing theme of the mid-wife repeating itself and appearing across the generations. Again, there is more life - even for the barren women.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"First and foremost, The Red Tent is a work of fiction, in the great tradition of Biblical Midrash. Midrash takes a story from the Bible and weaves a tale around it that helps explain and embelish the meaning of the incident. It uses references from the original source to help explain how and why an incident occurred and how it relates to our lives today.The Red Tent takes the story of Dinah and uses it as a window to explore the world of women in world of early Old Testament times. Women lived in a separate world, but one that was very rich and full of life, pain, and most of all love. We don't usually get a glimpse of this because so many of the stories told about this period are told by men, who were excluded from the women's world. (Is it so very different today?) Is the life presented 100% accurate? Probably not. But it seems to carry the spirit of the times and opens a world that is obscured by the patriarchal writing of the Old Testament.The book is graphic in places and even blasphemous, but that is viewing the world through today's very narrow vision. Worship of idols was (and is) common. Birth, life and death were seen as part of the natural flow of life.I recommend this book as a path to opening our eyes to things that we don't usually see. This is the best that fiction can do."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Diamant's book resonates with the powerful, life-giving spirituality of womanhood - a spirituality which echoes throughout the history of humanity. Her beautifully crafted novel is a shining testament to the miracle of motherhood and the ancient wisdom of women's bodies. That the story of Dinah is based on a biblical tale is entirely secondary to this overriding theme. The book is a exquisitely written work of fiction and should not be assessed as a work of scripture. As an atheist I was dubious about a book with such a religious provenance, but Diamant is skilled in making her fiction historical and accessible to all, for which I commend her. With authors as enlightened and talented as Diamant writing today there is hope that the secrets and beauty of feminity may not be lost and swallowed by the partiarchal society we fight to exist in. And for that I am truly grateful."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Anita Diament has outdone herself, and everyone else for that matter, by crafting the masterpiece that is The Red Tent. Based on the brief story of Dinah in the Bible, found in the book of Genesis, chapter 34, Diament adds enough of her flavor to propel this book into the fiction category, but still remains true to the culture and time. As I read it, I constantly employed resources, including my Bible, so as to separate the fiction from the facts. I must say that I was impressed at how true to form this book was, while still engaging me to the point that I was canceling plans to read it.The Story is of a young girl coming of age within the powerful tribe of Jacob. As the only girl of Jacob's four wives, Dinah learns through her experiences within the Red Tent (the tent where women are confined during menstruation or during and after giving birth) the blessing that is womanhood. She will witness the power of lovers, of sisters and lifelong friends, and will come to know the joy and gift of motherhood on her journey to becoming a renowned mid-wife. Full of earthy undertones, free spirited women, and Jewish history, this book is truly incredible. I have yet to find one that compares. However, part of its powers lie within Diament's attention to detail, leaving some readers aghast at the graphic nature of the honeymoons and births. Those scenes though, are few and far between, and if readers can see past the details and into the power of true love and submission as is foretold, you will in fact recognize their significance to the plot.Do not read this book expecting a sweet novel on the perils of being a woman. Instead, expect an experience handed to you by a determined and inspired author. Prepare yourself for a journey into the life and tribulations of a daughter, sister, mother, wife, healer, and giver of life. Most of all though, expect a journey within yourself."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I really enjoyed this book a lot. I have also read Dinah's story in the Bible. There, she is barely mentioned. The author weaving this story gives a lot more meaning for me.The style of the writing is something I liked a lot. The story moved along and the relationships were easily understood. When I read the same names in Genesis, I had problems keeping everyone straight. Not so with the book.For me, seeing how cultures and areas treated women differently, was fascinating. It would seem that even in ancient times, some were much more progressive than others. In Dinah's tribe, although women were honored and revered, they were still kept separate. Yet in neighboring tribes/areas women were treated with indifference or not to be thought of at all. I found this to be much the same as today. It brought to mind how women in different cultures are allowed freedom and in others, their lot remains the same as thousand of years ago.Dinah's father Jacob seemed to not pay much attention to Dinah at all. It was almost as if he didn't know what to make of her, so ignored her instead. I felt his reaction to her husband was because he thought of her more as property than as his blood.I would rate this book at 4 1/2 stars - between very good and excellent. I would recommend it to be read - but mostly to my female friends. I feel the writing flows and the relationships between all the women make this a particularly good read."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I was at first fascinated with the storytelling in this book. Riveted by the perspective of a woman in ancient biblical times I was eager to read more. However, having studied the lives of Isaac, Jacob, and Joseph quite a bit, I began noticing that Anita took a lot of liberties with the accounting of biblical history. In my opinion at book based on the Bible should at least remain true to the facts around which the story is centered. From the love professed between Leah and Jacob to the character of Joseph I found that she dramatically distorted the truth to serve the purposes of her story. I think the story is well written and in any other context (non-biblical) I would have thoroughly enjoyed the book as a great story and a great character. She needed to have found another setting for her character of Dinah to retain her credibility as an author. I don't think I will be reading any more of her bible character based stories."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This is a sensual tour de force. Diamant lovingly describes the richness of sensations Dinah experiences in her life: the feel and smell of the midwives' herbs and medications; the taste of her lover's mouth; the strength of a river's current when her family forded. The sexual scenes were among the most effective I have read. The entire book reminded me, ironically, of the first chapter of Peter Ackroyd's recent biography of Thomas More.As a work of fiction, it shows great imagination. The plot's deviation from the story in the Bible is almost (although not quite) entirely credible. Conjuring the relations between women of 4,000 years ago, and even creating an entire women-centered religion, are praiseworthy accomplishments.That said, other aspects disappoint and annoy.The tone of the writing appears intended to breathe heightened significance into the actions of the women in the community. I have the unconfirmed feeling that this is a literary decision bordering on the political, a way of making this book feel as important as the Bible. Unfortunately, the righteous descriptions of people's sensations and reactions felt more like an educated alcoholic's expatiation on some happy aspect of their lives: it feels almost maudlin, rather than important.One can enjoy this as a great work of imagination, a description of a past that never was, just as the Harry Potter books are a great romp through a magical world that doesn't exist. However, Diamant wrote this to tell us something about our world today. Women chafe under the determination of the men, except when they act in realms unknown to males (childbirth, menstruation, worship of the Great Mother). Women's stories are recovered from the dustbin of history, and given greater attention than those androcentric stories our patriarchal culture has allowed to be passed down for the last 40 centuries. Worship of &quot;El,&quot; the monotheistic practice that started us on today's paths of Judaism, Christianity and Islam, is just another option in the panoply of pagan practices. The message for today is that organized religion doesn't address women's spiritual needs, but paganism does.The problem with Diamant's underlying message is that she misses the revolutionary nature of Abram's and Jacob's practice. If you believe that the Jews reached a fundamentally new understanding of God, you cannot enjoy this book.I'll focus on Leah's reaction to Reuben's circumcision, on page 42. Dinah describes how unsure Jacob was about whether and how he would perform the operation. The next paragraph opens with &quot;still, it had to be done.&quot; Leah agonizes and feels sick over the coming &quot;mutilation&quot; of her son. Further in the paragraph, we learn that the foreskin means nothing to Leah - so she doesn't care whether he gets circumcised after all? The paragraph ends with the women in the Red Tent laughing at the delicate equipment men carry between their legs.To summarize, this fellow Jacob shows up as a stranger to a tribe in some isolated hills in Palestine. He marries several of the women, then declares that his understanding of his obligation to the one God requires him to cut off the foreskin of his sons' penises. The women react to this by saying &quot;whatever - just as long as we can still make fun of what you're born with between your legs.&quot;The Red Tent posits that it is somehow an injustice that we have preserved the men's stories from those days, and not the women's. While Dinah's story is remarkable, and she lives a wealth of interesting experiences, Diamant never suggests anything in her story worth saving over four millenia; certainly the women's response to circumcision is forgettable, particularly when one considers the significance of circumcision.Circumcision was a sign of the covenant between God and His people after Abram showed faith. It is a vitally important part of the Jewish religion at the time. It is connected to the amazing and disturbing story of Abram being willing to murder his son Isaac because a voice in his head, which Abram recognized as God, told him to do so. The story and the rite have been preserved for centuries because they plumb the depths of our souls and help to bring us into a new relationship with the divine. They say something deeply meaningful to us even today, and in every age. I recommend reading Soren Kierkegaard, Fear and Trembling, for further understanding of the horror and majesty of this story.This new religion broke with prior pagan religions in that it was based on faith, rather than material gain. It required faith to practice, and the reward was faith. Dinah and the other women get material and sensual benefits from their polytheistic worship of wooden statues and other gods: her curses to her brothers are seen as effective, she feels an oceanic unity with womanhood on her first menstrual period, she prays to the gods so that women facing a death in childbirth live. But she doesn't have faith, which is everything (according to Kierkegaard, and according to monotheistic religion). Faith is the trusting relationship with God, the peace that knows no understanding (for who can understand Abram's peaceful resolution to murder his son?). As the individual relationship with God, faith is democratic - accessible to all, regardless of sex or social position - and freeing. &quot;Oppression&quot; means nothing to a person who has faith; the person with faith overcomes it. Despite today's female elite fashion to scorn monotheistic, &quot;patriarchal&quot; religion, that kind of religion offers the most effective way today to overcome perceived discrimination.This brings me to the opening of the paragraph I mention above - &quot;still, it [circumcision] had to be done.&quot; Why, if Leah felt sick about the pending mutilation? Jacob was one man in a solitary community. His father-in-law, Laban, was not part of the covenant, and probably couldn't care less. Surely Leah could have enlisted her sisters to oppose this, if she felt afraid on her own. In previous pages, we learned that the women in Palestine could determine which of their sons received the father's birthright and which received his blessing. The implied answer, &quot;that some man decided it and the women had no say,&quot; does not make sense. The domestic power arrangement at the time had to involve a great deal of consent from the women, a conclusion which affects how one sees today's women's movements.The Red Tent exalts feeling, sensation and emotion as our validation in life. It ignores the centrality of faith in the religions it scorns. Since I see religion as primarily a way to practice faith, rather than a way to feel better, I could not give this work more than two stars."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Although beautifully written, I cannot endorse this book in any way. To say that this book takes liberties with the Bible story is to understate the problem in the extreme.This book contains reincarnation, violence, graphic sex, and implied beastiality. This book in no way illuminates the real themes of the story of Jacob's family: Division and reconcilliation, jealousy and forgiveness, and the redeeming power of God's love."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I really hated this book. But not necessarily because of the writing style or character development. I think the reason why I just hate this book so much is because it was labelled as religious fiction. So I read it, hoping to feel something spiritual, but it is not really a religious book. At least, not Christian; it's more like the goddess cult. That's fine, but don't sell it as something else.The author's ability to weave a whole story around this one verse in the Bible is pretty cool, but the story is really just a vehicle to push feminism and the goddess cult along with it. The women in this book don't really believe in God--He's for the men--rather, they believe in female pagan gods and &quot;girl-power&quot;. The whole emphasis of the book is on these women and the world they create for themselves; God is thrown in there as kind of an aside. And while all of the men in the book are flawed and mostly selfish, the women are saints, living in harmony with each other. This is, of course, completely unrealistic and absurd. I wish I had known this before paying money for this book because then I wouldn't have been expecting one thing while being sold another. As it is, I feel gypped."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I also found this book disappointing. From a christian viewpoint it is disappointing and also inacccurate. It is earthy and vulgar and filled with descriptions that belong with private matters. I had hoped for something that reflected the daily lives of Bible women of the time period and I can't believe that all they did was this most of the time."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"The Bible is a wonder of verbal economy, and there is much to be derived from contemplating the original story. Inexplicably, Diamant changes the original account with grievous results. She omits mention of Abraham's contribution as the first adherent of a monotheistic diety (focusing instead on the binding of Isaac in an impossible way). The great event of that era is that monotheism took hold during the time of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. The women must have had an important role in furthering the idea among their children, including the concept that circumcision of 8-day-old boys represented not a &quot;mutilation,&quot; but entry into the covenant with God. (Eight days old is a good choice for circumcision. By then, the child's health can be ascertained and the infant is young enough to heal quickly and to forget all about it.) Yet Diamant's version is drenched with idolatry among the women, and this is its greatest fault. One of the wives even calls Jacob &quot;Baal.&quot; TILT! Diamant is so obsessed with sex that she uses it as a blunt instrument, and, in so doing, fails to call up details of what actually must have obsessed the women: their children. She invents twins where none were born. By making Bilhah black (perhaps referring to scholarship concerning whether Ethiopian Jews are descended from the tribe of Dan), Diamant didn't seem to know what to do with Bilhah's second son, Naphtali, so she made him a twin of Leah's Issachar. Not only is the book riddled with these and other needless deviations from the original story, its writing style is simple and awkward, no more than a partial cardboard diarama. One imagines that the tension between Leah and Rachel was electric, yet we get no sense of it; and the picture of Rebecca is at odds with what we know of her. This family compound must have bustled, but the scampering and squeals of little kids do not run through the story, neither their colicky cries nor skins and scrapes, nor do we see the kind of sweet chaos lots of kids can cause, nor do we know what their mothers taught them, nor do we even know where the kids slept. What of other details? What cooking utilsels were used, how did they brew beer and make bread, where did they get salt and yeast? Dinah searches for herbs, but what herbs? Diamant doesn't tell us, so we don't have any sense of the aromas. Nor does she say how chores were divided. If you have to read this book, read it carefully. Ultimately it is insulting to the principles of the three religions that are descendants of Abraham: Judaism, Christianity and Islam."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This story was interesting in it's historical value, but I was expecting the story to at least mention God. This was Jacob's family - Joseph, Ben, Judah, etc. God is never mentioned in this book.This book is just a story, one that will hold your interest, but it is not inspirational, scriptural, or spiritual.If you read it, just read it for a story. That's all."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This book is well written and definitely has a story to tell. However, it is a fiction and at time it becomes hard to remember that. Please, be advised it is inaccurate description of Biblical events."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Tedious and ponderous. Very poorly written. Simplistic plot with no development of characters. The story was not well integrated into the historical time period, and in fact, seemed mostly unconnected to it. The characters were presented within a 21st century pychological context. It simply is not possible to understand the story or characters unless it was placed in the correct cultural context. Putting 21st century charaters in skins among livestock does not make them even remotely historically authentic. The only historical item I gleaned was that women sat on straw during their periods."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Although this book is interesting in a historical context, the sex and inappropriate portions far outweigh the good parts of the book. I felt like I needed to go wash my eyes out after reading part of this book. Filthy!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Diamant knows how to weave a story, and I give her credit for weaving a good one. But I take exception to her using a Biblical story and seemingly ignoring God in all of it. I understand there is a need for authenticity of the times and the deities that people worshipped, but the role that God played in all of these characters' lives was dwarfed by the shadows of gods and goddesses who did not answer their prayers. Funny--when Jacob wrestled with an angel of God, no mention was made of this--just that Jacob was severely wounded. When Rebekah came into the story, she was an oracle for a goddess--the God of Isaac would not stand for this. It seemed that the men had their God and the women had theirs. But ask Sarah earlier in the book of Genesis why she had a child past her childbearing years, after an angel told her she would and she laughed from disbelief. Ask the Egyptians years later when the plagues were sent so that Pharoah would set the Israelites free. Who wouldn't believe in the God of Abraham and Isaac and Jacob after that? This book may fill in the gaps, but with pure fiction."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"A &quot;biblical story&quot; of birthing and bleeding. Very little description of landscape, home, geography. Lots on sexual activity. I quit reading after 90 pages."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I liked the idea of expanding on Dina's story. However, the content was sometimes a little to personal, at times gross, for me. I was also taken aback when I saw how much Diamante deviates from the actual text. This is not just an expansion of the story, but sometimes was outright false. A good story if not taken literally."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Well written, well researched, but what an absurd spin on the tale of Dinah in the Book of Genesis and the circumstances surrounding the defending of her honor by her despicable Father and Brothers in the face of her long suffering Mothers. Frankly in my estimation, this is just an example of blatant male bashing! I am a woman reader, and I might add very well liberated and in suport of female causes but lets give men some credit rather than always depicting them as heartless predators. In attempting to develop a strong female character in control of her life in a primitive period of history, Ms. Diamant, struggles eloquently to plead a plausible case but fails to do so with any reasonable semblance of acceptance. If the author persues the use of the Bible for her future works, she certainly has a lot of fertile ground to work with. I'd be very interested in her rendition of the Story of Eve. Sorry can't give the same praises to this one as your other reviewers."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This book portrays the women of the Bible as worshiping many other gods but not Abraham's God. I found this very disturbing as I have read other great books by Orson Scott Card (Sarah) (Rebekah) (Rachel) in the \\"Women of Genesis\\" series that are so inspiring and are faithful to the Bible account. I know this book has received good reviews but I believe it is because the readers have not read better, more accurate accounts. Another recommended writer is Lynn N. Austin's series called 'Chronicles of the King.' The first book in this series is \\"The Lord is my Strength.\\" There are 5 books in this series and you will feel yourself being pulled closer to God and prayer. All of Lynn Austin's books are wonderful and so good you will not want to put them down."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I picked up this book, expecting one thing and getting another. As a result, I hated this book. If you're looking for a Christian religious fiction book (as advertised) you're going to be disappointed. This book does take a Bible story but then winds up really being a book that focuses on \\"woman-power\\" and has more of a goddess cult feel than anything. The women in this book are strong, caring, intelligent, spiritual and practically infalliable. By contrast, the men are mostly manipulative, deceitful, brutal, cowardly and cruel. If I'd wanted this kind of propaganda, I'd have read Gloria Steinham. If you are looking for a good religious fiction book, read The Robe or Quo Vadis. If you're just looking to read a bestseller, and have no other expectations, than go ahead and read The Red Tent."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"While it was a great idea to write about a Biblical event from women's point of view, Diamant is obsessed with California-mystical sexuality. How many descriptions of oiled hair and bloody childbirth can you read?"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"it's about time that orthodoxy in all its forms crumbles.here is part of the crumbling of the weak mortar.love it.the overly patriarchic impulse needs it's own tent to cower in."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"The Red Tent was given to me as a gift by a close friend that loves religious history. Although this book is fiction it is written extremely well and after the first few chapters it grabs you and you can't put it down. I can't wait to read more books by Anita Diamant. I hope more people discover this gem."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This book is one of the best I have read in a long time. It takes a little bit of time to get into it, the first couple of chapters you have to get your bearings and try and remember the names(there is a family tree to help). After that, I couldn't put the book down!! Whenever I had to stop, I couldn't wait until I could pick it up again! Fascinating, how women were treated, and treated themselves, the hierarchy in the tent, a microcosm of the world where everone had a job to do and Lea is the \\"CEO\\" and coordinator of it all. How women were actually held in honor until or unless men decided otherwise or women let them.As it is today."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"i read this book for the drama and adventure and history. it's a very enjoyable story with fascinating characters... but all the good characters are women. the male characters are very one-dimensional. the women sometimes seemed to be out of place in time. it doesn't necessarily make the book less interesting or enjoyable to read, but the political correctness made me roll my eyes a few times. the book had three faces: a historical romance, a journey of feminist liberation, and a study of religious sociology. each of those is a worthwhile subject, but i'm not sure that the combination worked very well. the writing is beautiful and the images are vivid and the plot is engaging. it's a wonderful book if you can ignore the distracting political message."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"....then this is not the book for you. While the story was entertaining, I found that many of the events written about by the author were in direct contradiction to the Bible. For fictional books based on Biblical facts, read Francine Rivers' Lineage of Grace series."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"For anyone looking to gain insight into the Biblical story of Jacob- well, skip The Red Tent. Other than the names of the characters, there is nothing remotely scriptural about this book.I found this book offensive in the extreme- a perversion; and particularly man-hating."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I eagerly began reading this book expecting to love it. I love historical fiction and have read many fictionalized accounts of biblical characters. This book was a huge disappointment!!! It was just awful. My first problem with the book is that the author felt the need to change the facts known about these characters lives as found in the Bible. Why would she do this?? It was absolute slander against the forefathers of the Jewish and Christian faith. Sarah, Joseph and Jacob were totally misrepresented and facts were totally changed to fit the story. I could also have done without the bit about the men copulating with the sheep. Yuck! Besides these problems, I felt that the characters were not developed and the authors writing style lacked descriptiveness. For example, the title of the book is &quot;The Red Tent&quot;. At the end of the book, we don't know much about the red tent. Is it truly red? Is it located far from the rest of the camp? Do all the women go at the same time (as the author implied)? While the women are in there, who does the cooking for the men? What do they do in there? tell stories, yes...but do they do weaving or sewing etc. I felt like I was really lacking a visual description of anything she wrote about. My suggestion is that you enjoy historical biblical fiction, try reading some of Francine Rivers books. She stays true to the bible, and yet gives wonderful accurate, descriptive portrayals of what women's lives would have been like."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I am amazed that readers labelled this book \\"feminist.\\" Author celebrates polygamy, polytheistic paganism, idol worship, and a 'red tent' ritual, wherein women squat around every month for days on piles of straw like a bunch of hens! That's supposed to be a good thing! Real life-affirming, woman-bonding, like a girls dorm. And aren't they all so supportive, considering that they're all married to the same man? They only shed itty-bitty tears when Jacob selects one of 'em for the night. And what a man was Jacob -- such a schlub the mind boggles to imagine him chosen by God as the wellspring of His religion. All the men of Jacob's tribe were knuckle-scraping sheep-shaggers, according to Ms. Diamant. But the Egyptians, so clean and civilized, and what hunks! Shame about them, Joseph (who, it is broadly hinted, is gay) did so well there. Why couldn't God establish his Religion among the Egyptians, who are so well-dressed, with beautiful homes?I really wonder, are the \\"1.5 million women who have loved this book\\" so lacking in discernment? Girls, this is no more than an especially pulpy (and gamy) entry in the Cecil B. DeMille Bible.Don't buy this -- in fact you can have my copy. If this book is \\"feminist\\" I'll eat Bella Abzug's hat in Macy's window."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"this book talks a lot about things of a sexual nature. not a book for people who have respect for the men in the bible."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"What wonderful insight Anita Diamant provides us into the everyday lives of Biblical women!

Through the long summer afternoons, we discuss all the books we have read since the last time we have been together. The Red Tent was strongly recommended to me this past July and now I worry about what my friends think I like to read. The author of the Red Tent has taken an excellent idea, and probably has done research of a decent quality, and managed to turn out a book of remarkable pap-like quality. This is a good story exceptionally badly told. Save your pennies."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I read this book after being told that it was a wonderful feminist story (I'm a women's studies professor). Please! It was dreadful---so poorly written that I could not bring myself to finish it.I also found myself incredibly annoyed with Diamant's obsession with menstruation and birthing (and I say this as a specialist in the history of gynecology!). Diamant seems to feel that menstruation and birthing define women. How anti-feminist can you get?! Lots of women don't have menstrual cycles and never reproduce---does this mean they aren't really women? As an historian, I also found it inaccurate (I realize it's a novel and so it shouldn't matter that Diamant doesn't seem to have any understanding of women's lives in the biblical period but the book was so poorly written, the characters so lacking in definition that I found myself overly critical of her historical ignorance).I find myself wondering why this book receieved so much attention. I would never recommend it!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This book was suggested to me by a close friend who had read good reviews in the Atlanta paper.

The idea for the story is wonderful but I was greatly disappointed."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"My name is Dina. I did not rise from the dead to protect my name and that of my family, though I feel tied to my namesake, centuries away. This book was so very nicely written that it made me very sad to see how FAR FROM THE BIBLE it is, making our Mothers mere idol worshipers. The beauty of our Mothers is that in a time when idol worshipping was commonplace, they broke the consensus- often paying a heavy price- in order to worship one G-d. Maybe the next book of this genre will be better...."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"&amp;#65279;I was completely surprised that the author, an alleged expert on Judaism, chose to ignore the basic theme of the Bible while telling her story of the women of the Old Testament. The Old Testament is the story of one God and His people. The author chooses to ceaselessly glorify the most disgusting pagan rituals while inaccurately retelling the story that is in the Bible. For example, Abram and Sarah were told by the Lord - NOT by some goddess - that they would bear a son. The Bible says that Joseph did NOT sleep with Potiphar's wife, and on and on with the distortions. To \\"flesh out\\" the Biblical characters and give them dialogue and a storyline is well and good Why did the author consistently change the story as found in the Bible - for what purpose? The many errors in the Biblical story plus the endless goddess worship that the author seems so enamored of, made this a book I was glad to be finally finished with. I think historical fiction should try to accurately portray the subject, not re-write it. The idea of women bonding, as I am sure they did, within the red tent and in their lives was an idea worthy of a book. The end result was a huge disappointment."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This book grieved me.The author portrays men as silly and arrogant. The fallout of their decisions cause the pain of innocent and wise women. The book is not intended to be history. Rather, it is to be fiction. But Diamont took real people from the bible and sullied their names."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Interesting story but trying to be historical fiction is wrong. Its a complete mish mash."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"The Red Tent is a story told through the eyes of Dinah, a woman who lived during Old Testament times. Many readers think this book is based on a story in the Bible, but it is actually about 1% truth and 99% imagination. The premise of this story is that Dinah, a daughter of Jacob, is telling the reader about her life as she is remembering it many years after it occurred. Jacob had four wives, and thus Dinah had four mothers. Dinah spent much of her childhood observing the four very different feminine characteristics of her mothers, listening to their stories, and learning their traditions. The lives of these ancient women revolved around childbearing and child-rearing. Childbirth defined their triumphs, their tragedies, and their sense of self-worth. The story tells us about the relationships between women of the time and the bonds they formed. When Dinah transitions from girlhood to womanhood, the women of her life celebrated with her, and Dinah eagerly anticipated the new phase that this transition was to bring to her life. However, early in this new phase of Dinah's life, a great tragedy occurs that alters her forever. A traumatic series of events caused Dinah to leave her family and her land for a new life and a new culture. Despite the time and distance that separatd her from the people of her past, Dinah continued to be influenced by the women of her childhood. In everything Dinah did, she carried part of her mothers with her. Many people who have read this book have expressed dismay that the story contradicts the Bible. Personally, I don't understand why anyone would expect the story to agree with the Bible? This fictional story is told through the eyes of an imperfect human being looking back on her life, while the Bible is the truth given breath by the perfect God. I think maybe the whole point of this story is that when a human being looks back on her life, she may see things very differently from the actual truth. In truth, Dinah was raped by Hamor's son. But isn't is plausible that the trauma of his murder caused Dinah, later in life, to perceive they had a great love affair? The truth is that Jacob was, in spite of his mistakes, a good and faithful man of God. But isn't is a possibility that his only daughter never knew him or loved him and saw him as a weak man? The truth is that Dinah's brother Joseph was intelligent and of high moral character; he never slept with Potiphar's wife despite her attempts at seduction. But isn't it likely that false rumors, like those told by Shery in The Red Tent, were spread about Joseph? And isn't it probable that some of the Egyptians grumbled that Joseph was stupid and arrogant, and belittled his talents? The truth is that Jacob did not love Leah. But isn't it believable that Leah could have distorted stories she told to Dinah to make Dinah believe Jacob did love her? I found this book to be a great break away from modern-day stories. I thought it was interesting and intriguing. The reason I give it 3 stars instead of a solid 4 is because I feel that the story would have been much better if Dinah had accepted the one true God, as her father Jacob did. I could have become more attached to the character of Dinah if she had embraced God and sought prayer in her times of need. Still, this book is worth reading... as long as the reader understands the difference between fiction and truth!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This is the best contemporary novel I have read!

I was extremely upset on the author changing the Almighty God to a heathen God..."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"For anyone who enjoyed this book I have to ask, \\"Do you believe in the Bible?\\" I do not recommend \\"The Red Tent\\" for any person, Christian or Jew, who believes in God. The book was creative, well written, and obviously well researched but completely offensive to any believer of the Bible. The God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob was mentioned maybe five times and rarely, if ever, in a positive light. By contrast, the idol gods and goddesses of Dinah's \\"mothers\\" (such as Innana) are mentioned on every other page and are recognized as the unbalanced belief system of these women who dominate the book. The cover of Diamant's book suggested that \\"The Red Tent\\" is what the Bible might have been had it been written by God's daughters, instead of the sons. I highly doubt it since these daughters did not believe in God. The Bible is not a work of fiction, nor is it a story written by men. It is God's Word. I am a woman and appreciate an interesting work of fiction from a woman's point of view, but to take a section of the Bible, twist it and remove God is not something I can appreciate even under the name of \\"novel\\".I would like to recommend a series by Liz Curtis Higgs, beginning with \\"Thorn in My Heart\\". Higgs has taken a biblical story, filled with the lessons God intended us to have, and turned it into a work of fiction where the characters grow and learn with God, not without Him. In my opinion Higgs' series was just as creative, well written and well researched. It was also almost entirely from a woman's point of view. (Although I enjoy hearing from the man occasionally as well.)If you love God and enjoy a well-written story, read Higgs. If you want to learn about menstrual cycles, idol worship, and how vindictive women (and men) without the love of God in their lives can be, read Diamant."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Definitely on the raunchy side. Only got through the first 30 pages, which included mention of masturbation, bestiality, and descriptions of genitalia. These are just not things I want to spend my time reading about."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"As one other reviewer claims, it is extremely slow reading for the first 150 pages or so. I found myself having to look back to the beginning of the book several times to understand the family tree as the members were being introduced. Jacob had so many wives, that it was hard keeping track who was who and which wife had which children. The last half of the book picks up quickly and truly captured my interest. Give this book a chance and don't put it down because it is slow reading to begin with but it is important to get the family tree straight and learn of the mothers stories to understand the latter part of the book. The thing that I liked best about this book though, was the fact that it was so different. So many books are so similiar that after awhile they all seem alike. This book is unlike any other and for this reason I truly enjoyed it."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Most people I encounter who have read this book absolutely loved it. But for some reason it was a struggle for me to get through. This is perhaps because the writing is inconsistent. At times there is great detail which seems to drag and I found I was anxious for the story line to move on. I believe the fascination with this book is the fact that we know almost nothing about the everyday lives of women in Biblical times. In that respect, the author shows great imagination and is to be commended. However, if you are a writer, or even a fan of great writers, this book will disappoint you."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Diamant paints an almost surreal landscape of the ancient civilization within which Dinah resides. She did an excellent job making the reader comfortable with a culture that is ancient and foreign. I was even privy to the mysteries and secrets of life within the red tent, the place where women go during that time of the month, and also the place where life begins. Birthing, blood, breastfeeding, and gossip fill the pages, but this male reader enjoyed the storytelling regardless. It is clever the way in which Diamant uses the Genesis narratives as a springboard for Dinah's story. At points her perspective comes off as being entirely different, even contrary, to the traditional interpretation. This will infuriate some strict fundamentalist Christians (but some of these supposedly angered individuals will secretly continue reading the book to the very end regardless). Jewish readers probably won't get as easily offended, because they are familiar with midrash, storytelling based upon familiar narratives, which is precisely what this is. A note for the more sensitive reader: Keep in mind that this is a work of fiction. Even I was a bit irritated that the women didn't take their husband's god (El) a bit more seriously than their household gods. However, she did do an excellent job in portraying a confusing world in which superstition and silly pagan practices were much more widespread than most people would think. I enjoyed this book as much as I did Orson Scott Card's book, Sarah, and Joseph Heller's book about David (I think it's called Dear God). Another creative re-presentation of various parts of Genesis can also be found in my book A NEW BEGINNING by Eric Westra."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I'm certain it was the cover that drew me in at first. But by the end of the short prologue, I was hooked. And I can't even say why.Yes, it was interesting to learn the history and see how life has changed, and how others never change. But it was the poetry of the language that got me. It had the same sincere appeal that someone from another country has when speaking English, although slightly broken. The lack of ease with the language forces them to speak in heartfelt terms with direct simplicy.I just loved this book -- It will likely be one of those I read over and over as you would a poem -- finding new meaning with each reading."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"At first I just kept thinking that this was going to just tell a story -- but it was much more than that, it evoked emotions from the recesses of yourself that you never knew existed. The intriguing tale of all the women and the hardships (both physically and mentally) that they went through was well written. I have to admit that when I finished the book I thought it was &quot;okay&quot; -- then I just couldn't stop thinking about everything that happened and it made me like it more and more. Definitely both a learning experience of the historical past and an emotional experience through the characters."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"An absolutely amazing book!!!

However, it was an amazing tale of a woman named Dinah, as she saw her life as well as those around her in those times of Abraham and Isacc.

Interesting, was how much the women went through in those days, and how different cultures are from one place to the next. It kept up the pace and had surprising turns.

I logged on to the encyclopedia to see if certain parts of her story were pure fiction, or fact. It was literally impossible to tell at most points in the book what was coming from her mind, or from her research. I've recommended this book to my mother, sister and best friend... And I also encourage you to experience it as well. There are elements of terror, love, learning and growing... You will relate to the women in her story."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"It is difficult to explain why I just did not like this book. Perhaps it is because as a reader of the Bible and a student of history, it just seemed off the mark....too much sex and unlikely events.I am not a fan of historical fiction and read this book only because a book group is going to discuss it at our next meeting."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"THE RED TENT gives some interesting insight to the lives of the women of Jacob's family. Unfortunately the fictional elements added to the true story of Jacob caused me distraction. The author's writing style is poetic and captivating but this book is not a good read for those who know and love the heritage and truth of the Bible."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"The author made no attempt to follow the Biblical account of Jacob and Rachel. She took a Bible story and turned it into a bastardized version for sensationalism and the bucks. I was disappointed because I really wanted to like this novel. Had she created fictional characters for her story I'm sure I would have felt differently. As it is, the only use she made of the Bible was a source to name her characters, so it doesn't surprise me that the secular world gave her glowing reviews."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"If you are looking for authentic and biblically based christian fiction, this book IS NOT it. I began to read it with high hopes but could not even finish it. I was very disappointed that the author was not accurate in the portrayal of the Biblical characters."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I Love to read. When this book was recommended to me I looked forward to a fascinating book about the beginnings of Judiasm and a woman's look at the Bible. Instead I found it to be boring, inaccurate and disgusting. The lowest rating allowed was one star, otherwise I would have given it a zero. Anyone who tries to slant a rape as being a &quot;she invited it&quot; is sick. This is definitely the first and last book of Anita Diamant's that I ever intend to read."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"The author certainly is at liberty to write almost anything about Dinah since the Bible says so little about her. It offends me, however, that she would take such liberties with Biblical characters such as Joseph. The Bible gives us a great deal of information on Joseph. For the author to trivialize Joseph in such a way is appalling and as I see it, a cheap way to sell books. The author wrote, for example, that Joseph had sex with not only Potiphar's wife (not Biblical) but with Potiphar as well. It's one thing to fictionalize characters we know little about, but to distort Joseph was completely unnecessary."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"With each chapter I debated whether to continue. Although it is mildly entertaining at moments, I am somewhat offended by the author's need to alter events from that which is recorded in the Bible. I am mystified as to the motivation behind such alterations. In some cases the truth is more dramatic than this retelling. Furthermore, I am at a loss to understand the author's need to portray her religious forefathers (and mothers) in such a poor light.The author's frequent use of misplaced modifiers kept me guessing - - disappointing from a journalist.Someone else's review said, &quot;Don't believe the hype.&quot; I say Amen!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This is one more review among a thousand....The book is well written, no qualms about that. The female characters are engaging, the male characters brutish. Reverence for the gift of life well detailed, as well as many, many pagan rituals. Libations to Asherah poles and worship of gods and goddesses were well detailed, and the acrifices to the God of Jacob considered wasteful of flesh (I wonder if Ms. Diamont unintentionally left out the documented sacrifices of children to the Asherah poles?). I noticed the incredible amount of liberty taken with the story (Rachel's and Leah's bride price to be seven months vice years) and paints nearly all the males in a very bad light. Jacob chases sheep around in his older years, and moves from a strong, beautiful man to a stupid brute like the women's father. The brothers were murderous (which is well documented), one of them takes up with his aunt, Joseph prefers the company of boys, and the name of God &quot;becomes the worst insult&quot; a person can spit. Generally a well-written story, but some of the characters are vague and typecast which keeps it from total suspension of disbelief.I threw the book away, into the garbage. One of the only times in my life I have. And I will not recommend it either, just on those merits described above. However, I found myself offended that a major force that moves the characters in the book, namely, the God of Jacob is rarely mentioned, and when He is, painted in a barbaric light. The tenets of Judaism and Christianity are non-existent, but complicated pagan rituals are. The house gods were worshipped, to be sure, but after the God of Jacob (aptly named) made himself known, the paganism stopped in that camp. The poetic license is phenomenal, and skewers the story to its very basic levels, rewriting history to fit, labeled fiction. I must agree with another reviewer, would we have excused as fiction odious labels to Ghandi or Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.?As a new student to serving the God of Abraham, Issac, Jacob, and Lord Jesus Christ, I find this retelling of a famous story to be bent beyond recognition to the point of being farcical, which diminishes the one major good point it had, which is being well-written."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I read The Red Tent at the recommendation of friends. I will not recommend it to anyone else. Although the beginning started out well, I had to struggle to make myself finish it. The story has been familiar to me since I first read the Bible for myself, but Ms. Diamant's style of writing could not hold my interest. And since what little we know of Dinah is found in the (historically accurate) book of Genesis, I found it difficult to understand why a Jewish woman would want to write about Jewish men in such a down-grading way, or about Jewish women in such a pagan way - and about both of them in such an inaccurate way. Not only inaccurate, but a deliberate twisting of the truth. Ms. Diamant should have made her book truly a fiction and named her characters after non-Biblical people."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"The reading was good, the characters playing typical parts - lover, evil father, jealous brothers, etc and everything about the book made it hard to put down. So why the low grade? Well, it's about history. This was written about characters of the Bible and there is aboslutely no realistic element to this story. At best it is an excellent Mills & Boon romance novel. To write a story making out the patriachs and matriachs as little more then petty minded people living with problems similar with problems we encounter today takes away the beauty and the spiritual entity that is the Bible. How dare a book lay claim that Dina was having a torid love affair when in the Bible she was raped (and that is one example of the appalling mistakes). There is absolutely no connection with reality here. If the author wished to make a typical romance novel, she should have chosen characters of a different era or made the characters up. This book is fictional and to use names that are a reality is twisted. I hope my comments are read and a person considering buying this book will think better of it and either read the Bible and relevant sources or go and buy a nice pretty fiction romance."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This is a fictional novel about the bible times of Jacob, his wives and their children. Dinah, who is telling the story, is Jacob's daughter by Leah.The book begins describing peaceful times when Dinah hasn't reached adulthood yet. The women during this time went into the \\"Red Tent\\" during their monthly cycles. There they had many discussions about life and love.When Dinah becomes a woman and gets married is where the book gets very interesting (although the whole book kept my attention very well). Dinah becomes a midwife. She had been taught by her Aunt Rebekkah and becomes the most-skilled midwife at the time. Midwives were definitely needed at that time, since many women died during childbirth.The author does a fantastic job, in my opinion, of creating a fictional novel about the lives of real people during bible times. You can also learn some bible names from this book and how they are related. Normally, while reading the bible, I skip a lot of the names describing the lineage."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This is a fictional story that amplifies and brings to life the story of Jacob, Leah, Rachel, Bilhah and Zilpah found in Genesis chapters 29-35. You will never forget the story of Dinah and the sons of Jacob again. You will FEEL that you are living during biblical times. This is an unforgettable story.The story is told from Dinah's perspective as she grows up until her death. It is both happy and sad. Dinah describes her life with wonder... When she is young she focuses on the customs of the time and place including seclusion in the red tent during their period, childbirth customs with a midwife, polygamy and ritual circumcisions.The author captures all of the many emotions through the eyes of Dinah including how Leah shares Jacob with his more favored wife Rachel plus his relations with handmaids Bilhah and Zilpah... The story continues as Dinah becomes old enough to marry; how she is sent away to the palace and becomes overtaken with Shalem. She tells how despite much sorrow and suffering, she survived and lived to be an old woman in peace..."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It is true as others have said that this book is not factually correct in relation to the Bible, but it is not meant to be. In the beginning of the book the author states that it is a work of fiction. She no where claims the book to be factually or historically correct. Dinah is only mentioned in the Bible a couple times, so it stands to reason any story of 'her life' would be fiction. That said, I thought the book was wonderful! I loved the whole concept of the Red Tent where the women gathered monthly to rest, communicate, bond and support each other. The roles of woman and mother was honored and cherished, and the beginning of a young woman's cycle was celebrated. When did modern day women begin to call this &quot;the curse?&quot; The book made me wonder who I would have in my Red Tent; who would be my 'sisters' in this celebration of life. Certainly not as many as in the book, but that would be no surprise. The numbers would increase with the number of wives! The descriptive writing in the book really made me imagine I could smell the water, or the flowers in the gardens. I highly recommend this book to anyone. You do need to not compare it to the Bible, and read it as a book of fiction to really feel and enjoy the powerful stories of the women in The Red Tent."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"The Red Tent is an excellent novel that breathes new life into the ancient heroes and heroines of the Book of Genesis. An outstanding companion to the Red Tent is the well-written and less known, The Genius of Genesis: A Psychoanalyst and Rabbi Examines the First Book of the Bible (nonfiction) by Dennis G. Shulman. Read these books together, as I just did, and you'll certainly see things in the Genesis text and yourself that you have never seen before."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Although I had a few theological issues with this book, it was clearly well-researched and well thought out. It is a deep look at the silenced characters of the Bible (the women), without whom, there would be no stories at all. This is a deep look into the lives of the women of this time, a culture that many of us have never thought much about. Reading this book will give people a better understanding of the culture surrounding the Biblical stories, as well as getting the reader to question what lies between the lines of these stories. It will give the reader a much deeper understanding of and appreciation for what the people within this culture dealt with."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Anita Diamant could have and should have done better research. A lot of the things she puts into the book are not Biblically correct. First, she says that Naphtali is Jacob's son with Leah, but Naphtali is the son of Bilhah and Jacob. Second, Diamant changed around the story of Joseph in Potiphar's house by saying that Joseph and Potiphar were male lovers and that when Potiphar's wife tried to get Joseph to go to bed with her, Diamant said that Joseph did! These things are not true!It was interesting to read, save for the historical mistakes made by Ms. Diamant."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I am an avid reader especially of historical fiction. The Red Tent by Diamant was an absolutely wonderful read. Diamant clearly did her research into the land and culture of her characters, and was completely successful in incorporating &quot;a woman's understanding&quot; into the novel . Dinah's whispers, dreams, and longings become your own within the first chapter. Close your eyes and feel her excitment the first time she sees and touches the river, or experience the fear that she and Joseph experience at the place of Jacob's beating. You will also acknowledge Leah and Racheal's jealousy and the longing of a barren woman to feel a child within her own body.It is not &quot;spiritual&quot; or &quot;religious&quot; although the characters, places, and events are taken from the Bible. It is simply a story of a woman's being.This is one of the most well written and captivating books that I have read in a long time."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This was the best book that I have read this year. My daughter begged me to read it, and I finally gave in just to appease her. I loved the characters, and I was so sorry when the book was completed. I loved this book."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"The Red Tent. Her narrative into the biblical times in which she was born leans more to poetry than prose and the words flow as gently as a river carrying the reader from one day to the next.Based on the mere mention of her name in Genesis, this astute author has created a magnetic story which evokes the emotions of love, hatred, envy, despair, joy and unfathomable sorrow.The red tent is one which is assigned to the women at the changing of the moon...and for three days they may rest from their daily chores; laugh, play and pamper one another. It is just for women..young girls who have not as yet matured are forbidden. Except for Dinah! For she is the only daughter of the four wives of Jacob, among many sons. Jacob had usurped his father's inheritance from his brother Esau. I mention this because the meeting of Jacob and Esau is a particularly poignant segment.And so Dinah is to learn many wonderful things and feel the love of all the wives, her own mother and her aunties. Rachael, her one aunt who becomes a midwife, takes her under her wing and teaches Dinah the birthing secrets of Biblical times. This is one of the lessons in this novel: not to let skills die..but to pass them on from generation to generation as also seen in Jacob's father passing on his knowledge of husbandry to his son..and Jacob leading his sons along the same path. They all learned by observance and eagerness. A powerful lesson indeed!We are lead by Dinah's narrative through her childhood to her coming of age. The ceremony which accompanies this occasion is one of great joy among all the women in the camp and is described in such a way as to draw you into this revelry and make you a part of the rejoicing.And so her life unfolds and is laid out before you in stunning array. To tell you her story would be a disservice to the reader and most certainly would affect your enjoyment. So I will not do that. Follow her yourself through sweet, bittersweet, sad and devasting moments and live her life as she did. You will find it a most rewarding experience and one which will linger a long ,long time.When you are finished reading, share it with your friends, but do not give it away. For I can assure you, you will want to read it again and again in the years to come."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"A friend of mine suggested I read this book, since I enjoy reading about the lives of other women (real &amp; fiction). I couldn't put it down. Three days later, I was disappointed that it ended. I'm sure there are people who will find this book disgusting and blasphemous at times, but I believe that there are real human beings behind the ones we read about in the Bible. How can we not believe that during the Old Testament times people didn't have the same problems, tendencies, and relationships found today.Dinah's story brought biblical times to life. I enjoyed reading about the tedium and excitement of her days. Women would find this book more enjoyable than men. Open-minded readers will find it hard to put down. Conservative spiritualists will most likely be angered. This book isn't for everyone, but I really liked it myself."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Red Tent has encouraged me in that even though the mysterious \\"El\\" was something the characters wanted to know more about (and seemed to revere), they struggled with their own historical beliefs and values. This book has inspired me as far as continuing my desire to help spread the Gospel to those who do not know Christ personally but have a knowledge of Him"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"would have enjoyed sneaking this book around to all my girlfriends--in SIXTH GRADE! I couldn't get over how sophomoric the writing was--it was funny. Sometimes, she just clobbers you over the head. I would cite some examples here, but I read it a few years ago, and can't remember any. If you just want to pass time, this book will fit the bill, as the overdose of sentimentality will make you forget how bad the writing is."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Do you want to read a book that will keep your interest?

Do you want to read a book that stays in your thoughts for a long time? READ THIS ONE! Don't pass up this book. READ THIS ONE!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I read this book a while back on the recommendation of my sister. I love reading about women in times past, and to imagine what it would be like to live then. This is a story of the very distant past (4000 years ago) which elaborates on family relationships, survival, and human flaws. The loyalty between the woman is very touching (though considering they are all married to the same man, the author is taking some liberties with reality) Dinah's narrative allowed me to actually walk in her shoes and imagine myself around that tent where they lived. It gave the characters of the bible distinct personalities that we could relate with, and I found that entertaining. I felt more in touch with them as people than I did when I read the bible. I also saw the spirituality in this book, and was moved by Dinah's statement at the end of the book to the reader \\"Wherever you go, I will follow\\". It reminds us that people who are gone can be kept alive in our thoughts.So, why the three stars? The reason I gave it three stars is because I really think Ms Diamant should have stuck to biblical facts. I found myself annoyed when it was proclaimed that Jacob loved Leah more, when in reality it WAS Rachel. I did not like the way she portrayed Rebecca, as some kind of Out-Of-World Oracle that was unreachable to her family members. This just seemed weird to me. Trust me, the bible supplied PLENTY of fact for her to work around and make a story. Why change a book that is thousands of years old, and the most important book every written?(...)In short, dont look for fact or any kind of subtly. But the story itself is good."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Although this was an entertaining novel, I think that the third section could have been left out entirely. It dragged on far too long, and did not really accomplish anything. Overall it was too fictionalized to even be half believable, otherwise I might have enjoyed it more."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Many problems abound in this fictionalized account of a Biblical story. In the Red Tent we are supposedly told the story from Dinah's point of view and apparently learn the true life of the women in the bible. Apparently this is to make up for the lack of women in the bible. Unfortunatly this thesis is false, the Torah and Tanakh abound with strong women(unlike other holy books). Remember Deborah who gathered her armies or Esther who saved the Jews or Judith who cut the head of Holofernes. Now the Red Tent's main problem is its obsession with Paganism, almost as if the author set out to make fun of the Torah and monotheism. This is terribly insulting and ruins the story because it makes this book seem overtly political, an assault on religion.The most fantastic parts of this book include the distortions. The Bible tells of Jacobs long 7 years of work to marry his wives yet this book makes it 7 months. Why? To fit the feminist narrative and make Jacob seem a small brutish male. Next the book distorts the story of Dinah. Dinah is only mentioned briefly in the bible and she is mentioned as a victim of a rape, her brothers in turn raze the city to the ground where the rapists originated. But in the \`Red Tent' Dinah says she enjoyed the rape, this typical feminist twist is odd because it almost indicates that rape should not be punished and in fact that Dinah wanted to be raped because she \`went out'. This caustic analysis harms the story and casts further insult upon the Biblical narrative. The use of Paganism in the \`Rent Tent' is a totally fabricated incident, insinuating that all Jewish women worshipped dozens of gods and not the \`god of jacob'. Meanwhile the pagan gods run the gamit, some never existed at the time of Jacob and some were involved in child sacrifice, so why didn't the women in the tent sacrifice Dinah? If the author wanted to write a book glorifying rape and paganism then why didn't she just make up a story why did she fabricate and assault a biblical text?"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"The beginning of the books does indeed capture some very good images of female bonding. The storytelling is bland and general but does miraculously infuse life into the female characters. I was very disappointed and horrified at the extreme misguided liberties this book took. Why does the author feel she can blantantly rearrage history to fit the so-so story she told of Dinah? She could have atleast wrote a more interesting subplot to a story that was already half way written. The chapters pertaining to Jacob in the Bible are far more interesting then this narrative which loses steam halfway through.I wish I could get my money back on this book."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I commend anyone able to actually finish this book. It is one of the very few books I've never finished; I usually persevere through arduous reads, but I had no desire or need to trudge through the Red Tent. This book didn't expand my knowledge or awareness of anything, and I am not the better having read the two thirds I did endure.Diamant does put forth an incredible effort to bring her characters to life, but there are so many characters she spends so little time describing before jumping to the next character that the reader is left reeling from the chaos.I enjoyed Diamant's descriptions of the gods and her portrayal of how the women of the house of Jacob were not women of the God of Israel. She excellently portrayed the mystery of Jacob's God, showing us a time before the Ten Commandments, when the Fathers of our faith knew so little of God that they followed His will blindly. All Jacob and his family knew of God before the revelations to Jacob were the stories of Abraham travelling to a foreign land, Sarai giving birth in her old age, and God commanding Abraham to slay his beloved son, Isaac, before providing a lamb in Isaac's stead.I appreciate Diamant's attempt to step into another culture and show how women of this time period dealt with polygamy and their status as chattel. However, as much as Diamant wrote well, she put the biblical accounts she pulled the story from to shame. Diamant changed much of the stories taken from the Bible, for no apparent reason. Her changes were not for the better, they, in fact, weakened the story.The book had some areas of intrigue, such as her retelling of Dinah's rape and aftermath, but for the most part the book seemed to drag. It seemed like Diamant describes every birth to the house of Jacob, and then a few others as well. I understand Dinah was learning the trade of midwifery, and Diamant was telling of the plight of women in this society, but the birth accounts were a bit of an over-kill.I wish I had been Diamant's editor so I could have cut out the extraneous ramblings so readers could enjoy the remaining short story."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I am almost finished with the Red Tent and I have to admit, it is very engaging. However, as a Christian and a student of the Bible the book is at best, a guilty pleasure. It is a wonderful fantasy but SO FAR DEPARTED from the Scriptures that it no more resembles the Bible than Joseph and the Multicolored Dream Coat or The Last Temptation of Christ. I almost have to wonder at the author and her purpose for writing it. I am almost certain that she too must be a man-basher, and a paganist. The fables she weaves about the gods and goddesses drip with her admiration and fascination with them. She seems almost indifferent to the True God and her Jewish faith. It's sad really how lost she is if her writings are any reflection of her true faith. That she would refute and dismiss facts such as Leahs weak eyes and the circumstances surrounding Leah's marriage to Jacob is shocking. She is also cavelier about the truth surrounding Dinah's rape and disgrace. She explains that Jacob's wrestling with God and being renamed by Him is nothing more than an attack by demons. If so then the foundations of true religion are shaky at best. Then again, one must remember this is only a work of fiction. However, to weave such a tale makes me believe that she must not truly embrace Biblical truths and certainly does not hold them sacred. I sincerely hope that no poor soul ignorant of the Word of God will embrace this farcical creation as truth. In it the great matriarchs of faith are reduced to man-hating witches. It makes a sad statement really."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I thought this was one of the worst books ever written. It has so much historical distortions that fit neatly into a radical feministic viewpoint of the biblical times. This book demonizes males of the biblical times. Furthermore, it takes the central character and tries to make us believe that a girl who is barely into puberty can have a deep romantic sexual experience and fall deeply in love with an adolescent male after just meeting him. The entire book is contrived. Furthermore, it is an insult and affront to the Old Testament."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I loved this book! This book does an excellent job of re-telling the story of Dinah from the female perspective. This is great piece of historical fiction, which gives you a peek into what life would have been like for women in Biblical times. The book is well written and the characters are well-developed and interesting. I disagree with some of the reviews which say that the story deviates completely from the Biblical version, what I found especially compelling about the story is that it is very believable. It is different from the Biblical version the way that any retelling of events would be when coming from different perspectives. The story is especially captivating for those of us who are frustrated with the way women are portrayed in the Bible and are dying to catch a glimpse of \\"her side\\" of the story. I do recommend you read the stories of Jacob and his wives and particularly the story of Dinah in the Bible if you have never read them -or- if it has been awhile since you last read them--- however, I suggest that you read them AFTER you read the book to prevent spoiling the story."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This is a story of Dinah, a little-mentioned person in the book of Genesis in the Bible, contained in the passage that outlines the lineages of Jacob and his 12 sons. The author has detailed and filled in the pieces around Dinah's life beginning with her mothers and then as a midwife, wife, and mother herself.Set in a Shepherd's camp and then in Egypt, this author has pulled out all the stops of her imagination and taken her readers back in time to a man's world where many wives were the norm, many children were sired, many less children were born, and many women died giving them life. This novel was written from a woman's perspective about this particular world, and it lushly illustrates the events, interactions, and emotions surrounding the ebbs and flows of life. Dinah's early experiences revolve around five &quot;mothers,&quot; the one who gave her life and the other four who were married to her father. These women and their younger offspring all spent time in the Red Tent, where the cycles of a woman's life were experienced in all their richness.The Red Tent is in the genre of The Mists of Avalon by Marion Zimmer Bradley, which is high praise indeed, for that is an exquisite book. The Red Tent is wonderfully written and masterfully crafted, and it is a magnificent work. It illustrates with passion the important events in life -- coming of age, courtship, marriage, and of course the birth and the giving and sustaining of life -- from a female's viewpoint during the time in which it was set. Men ruled the world then, as they do now, and it gives one pause to ponder a woman's role, and a woman's treatment, in a man's world. The givers of life add so much incredible richness and joy to life itself -- the grand miracle of giving birth, sustaining life, nurturing, the special gifts of appreciating beauty and creating beauty in the world with their presence and their energies. It was an incredible experience reading this novel, going where it directed, feeling the events it detailed, and considering the unique fortitude it took to survive and thrive in that world."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I think this is a great read for women from many religions and ethnic backgrounds. It is about women, sisterhood, friendship, love, sex, family ties and quarrels, motherhood and even a little childhood. You will appreciate womanhood more after you read this book. It might even keep you from complaining about the pains of being a woman. This is now on my favorites list! I picked it up to read every free moment."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Okay, most novels leave us with a good or even great story, but we are left pretty much unchanged. This book left me with new perspectives of the stories I have heard so many times throughout life, but more than that, it left me with a new view of our strenth, pride, perseverance and legacy as women. It is beautifully written, and is extrememly entertaining, if read not being too skeptical of what is true and what is embellished fiction (Come on--It is a Novel! ). I recommend this book to all who question our history and those who don't."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"What a delicious, enjoyable reading experience this book gives! Diamant writes so descriptively, so tightly; there are no wasted sentences. I was never tempted to &quot;skip&quot; a section. The protagonist, Dinah, only daughter of the Patriarch Jacob, speaks in a voice growing stronger and more confident as she matures. I will remember Dinah for a very long time, always with an inspired smile on my face."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"As a Jewish woman, and avid reader of historical fiction, this was a great find for me. The evocation of the lives and relationships of Jacob's wives with one another is stunningly written. It's a beautiful book.Sections of it drag a little. The scenes in Rebecca's shrine at Mamre and some of the sections set in Egypt seemed more like a stock fatasy novel than the rest of the book, and I found they broke the spell a little. Also, I wish some of the religious tensions had been better articulated. But these are fairly minor quibbles--and I agree with the reader above that if Anita Diamant wrote a book about Esther, I would camp out in front of my bookstore to get to it as soon as possible.Get this for your daughter. A must read book."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I am very surprised to see good reviews for this book. There is not an ounce of depth to any given character....all surface garbage and sex that amounts to a loathesome soap opera with a pitiful ending. If you have an ounce of Jewish or Christian pride you will be disgraced by Diamant's portrayal of Biblical men and women of God. Her history is so skewed that she can't even manage to get the names or the lineage correct on the first page of the book (for example Jacob's son Simeon is \\"Simon\\" and some of his children are listed with the wrong mother, or made into twins when they weren't). I was shocked to see that she has written books on Judaism since she has no respect whatsoever for her true heritage. This book is nothing more than a garbage romance novel that is not worth the waste of money."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Diamant has obviously done a lot of research about the lives of women and the social roles they played back in the days of Jacob. She weaves an entertaining story of Dinah, daughter of Leah, who is mentioned only briefly in the Old Testament. As much as I enjoyed her fictitious account of Dinah's life, I have to reduce my rating because she leads anyone who hasn't had proper Biblical instruction astray about some of the things that happened in the house of Jacob with his sons. Joseph did not sleep with Potiphar's wife, nor was he arrogant and unforgiving to his father in his last days. Joseph was sent to jail because he wouldn't bed his master's wife, and she lied about it. Also, there is no way Jacob would have put up with the false idols of his wives under his roof for as long as Diamant's version implies. There are other things that don't sit well, but if you like well drawn out fiction with some historic value, this book is a fairly good read with a sympathetic and admirable protagonist to drive the plot along."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed \\"The Red Tent.\\" The female characters were fascinating (though the men were somewhat two-dimensional), and the plotline was compelling, especially if you have an interest in childbirth/midwifery and what women's lives might have been like in Old Testament times.This is definitely not a retelling of Joseph, Leah, Rachel and Dinah's story that meshes with the Bible. As a Christian, that bothered me to a degree; I feel that Diamant could just as easily have used other names, and this book would have been just as compelling. However, I still enjoyed the book tremendously and don't feel it's an issue for mature Christians as long as they keep in mind that this is a work of fiction, not a historical text."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"First, a warning: this book, though based on Biblical characters, bears almost no resemblance to the Biblical story of Dinah, daughter of the patriarch Jacob. If you will be upset by depictions of the men of the Bible as foolish, the women as idol-worshipers, and Dinah's rape re-written as a love affair, then you should probably skip this book. If, however, you are interested in an account of the daily lives of the women of the Bible, told from a woman's perspective, you may find \\"The Red Tent\\" an enjoyable and thought-provoking read. Dinah tells the story of her four mothers - the wives of Jacob - and continues on to tell of her own coming of age and experiences as a midwife and mother. The \\"Red Tent\\" of the title is where the Israelite women would rest during their menstrual periods; and indeed, as other reviewers have noted, this can be a very \\"bloody\\" story. The author depicts Biblical women's lives as being very closely bound up in the giving and maintaining of life, and reminds us how little separated the blood of childbirth from that of death. I found this to be a life-affirming, woman-affirming tale, but was left wondering to what extent it was based in any historical understanding of women's lives in the ancient Near East."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This book is awesome! A little graphic in parts-but shows life in great detail from a time period so different from us. Women get a whole different perspective of their roles in life from what they are now. The research done for this book was outstanding and very eye opening!I highly recommend it for women who want to understand the Bible more in that time period."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"We don't have to share a husband to understand the complex relationship of women. Mother, aunts, cousins, girlfriends--the trust, the trysts, the pacts, the betrayals only bond us to one another in a strange love-hate relationship that enriches and enrages our lives.Diamant's THE RED TENT is a fascinating read about an age-old practice that is still prevelant in many parts of the world today. Rather than not relating to these women, I found myself longing for my own \\"Red Tent.\\" What I wouldn't give to go hide for seven days a month...What I wouldn't give for such a community of women and girls to grow up with. Even with its entanglements, we long for community, even a flawed one.THE RED TENT is a lucious read that will send you scrambling for your dusty Bible--and a good girlfriend to share this book with."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"By Remy G.I read The Red Tent for a summer school assignment and absolutely loved it. Anita Diamant, The Red Tent's author uses a straight-forward approach in conveying her point of view through the book's main character, Dinah in this historical fiction piece. I suggest this book to all young adults that are interested in exploring religion and the history of women. The writing style is not geared for the beginning reader due to the author's description of mature subject matter. Although some of the described events are very mature for the young mind, it is important to start understanding these topics. However, as a young woman interested in religion and spirituality I found the accounts of Dinah making her transition to womanhood fascinating as this was described from a religiously historical point of view. It is interesting to see the contrast between the woman of the biblical era versus today's culture. Women during those times seemed to take a more nurturing approach to those young women that were transitioning to womanhood. Overall, The Red Tent is a great book that all women should read."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I thought this book gave me insight into the lives of women of the Bible and the life of Jacob....you must read this..."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Diamant is a much better writer than those whose company she keeps on this site. The Red Tent was way, way more engaging and well-written than Memoirs of a Geisha, Girl With a Pearl Earring, etc. Diamant does not shy away from the raw and violent side of the story and doesn't stoop to sentimentalizing, as many contemporary &quot;bookc club&quot; women writers do."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"What an amazing, powerful book. It left me stunned and awed after reading it. It's one of those books that is so emotionally charged you need to stop every once in a while to take a breath. Anita Diamant is one of the best writers of today, and I hope she will write many more novels in the future.If you're already familiar with the Genesis story of Jacob and his sons (or have seen the Andrew Lloyd Webber musical version), be prepared for a surprise. Diamant takes a familiar and oft-told tale and turns it on its ear. Essentially, she takes the male-dominated story of one of the patriarchs of Judaism and tells it through the women's perspective. Though entirely fictional, Diamant explores what it may have been like for the wives and daughter (Dinah, the main character) of Jacob. Her tale harkens back to a time when a woman's life centered around the stages of her reproductive life--menstruation, sex, and childbirth. The red tent symbolizes all of these (the color red is an obvious symbol of the blood of life). This is where the women congregate once a month to have their periods (since during this time they are considered \\"unclean\\" and unable to perform their normal household duties) and to give birth.Some have complained that the male characters are too one-dimentional. I think that's the point. For so long, the women's characters have been one-dimentional, and now Diamant is giving them their due. In \\"The Red Tent\\", they are so much more than \\"the wife of...\\" or \\"the daugher of...\\" They have a unique history, culture, and religion not shared by the men. In fact, many will be surprised that the women worship goddesses and household dieties, not the Judeo-Christian God that the patriarchs worshiped. Diamant is not being sacreligious here--the Bible does say that the women had household gods. She explores their personal religion with great depth. Essentially, Diamant fills in the holes of the women's stories that the Bible left out, but she does so in a historically-accurate way, which gives the story some credibility.The reason why so many women have responded so well to this book is that it reaffirms what makes us women in the first place. Women today often see their periods as a hassle, and childbirth a necessary evil in order to have children. \\"The Red Tent\\" reminds us that women have a sacred place as the \\"life givers\\", and we should celebrate what makes us female. The book has started a movement among women to celebrate their sexuality (much like \\"The Vagina Monologues\\"). This book allowed many women to get in touch with themselves and celebrate being women.Whether you're 14 or 94, every woman should read this book. Besides the thematic elements, it has an emotionally-charged story and strong female characters. And it will make you wonder what other untold stories the Bible holds. An excellent piece of work, and one of the best pieces of modern fiction."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"It is so valuable to have friends and family who will stick with you through the hard times. It was great to read about the sanctuary these women felt. A safe harbor in the midst of their storms and crises. This was great reading, moving and tender, yet powerful in the strength of the women who cared for each other. I would not hesitate to read another book by Anita Diamant."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This is perhaps *the* best book I have ever read. Every single person I have recommend it to has agreed. Forget that it takes its story from the bible, apart from the names you would forget it. You feel as if you are living it. Truth be told! There are parts in here you will both rage at characters and rejoice with them. It is for all intents and purposes GOOD. Do not bother renting it from the library, buy and own this book now before you regret it!I won't bother to sum it up, that takes away the mystery, read and enjoy a book of the ages."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Ms. Diamant has brilliantly brought to life historical men and women of the Bible. Her colorful personification of the characters makes these men and women as interesting as if they were alive in the present day. Once the characters are clarified in the reader's mind and the relationships between them are understood, these men and women come to life and the reader begins to understand the thread that binds them together.Ms. Diamant is accurate in her portrayal of the characters and their stories as told in the Bible. It is a wonderfully written story of Dinah and her history as well as her voyage into womanhood and beyond. It was an interesting read and it was over far too soon."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"What a fascinating read. Not an arresting page-turner, but very compelling, and a great view into what life was like during Ruth's time. I recall it vividly 1-year-later, which is an amazing feat for me -- and I would recommend it to anyone curious about life &quot;back then&quot; or rusty (and interested) in Bible stories."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I read this book and thoroughly enjoyed it. It grabbed me and kept me hooked from start to finish. I even cried a little at the end!I reccommend that every woman who reads this book, once done, pass it on to another woman. This is truly an enriching story of sisterhood and the uniqueness of this bond that forever links all women."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I read this book 2 years ago and after reading thousands of books (at least) in my life so far, this is now my favorite. It is an amazing story about women, family and love. Do not miss out on this one. A must read for EVERY woman."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"When I finished reading this story I felt that there truly is an fragile but important bond between mothers, daughters, sisters, friends, and women all together. It makes you realize that we females are remarkable creatures with all of our flaws and strengths. I'm not sure that I believe the entire story was historically accurate but the author may not have intended it to be. I felt that the style of writing was very unpredictable as well, Anita has a unique way of describing characters, places, and events and this kept my interest throughout the book. No woman could be disappointed after reading it, I think it is one of the most unforgettable stories I've ever encountered."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I thought this was a pretty good book. I was pulled into the story and really enjoyed it. This is a work of fiction ( it says so right on the cover!) so those of you who were so offended by the book...get over yourself.If you are looking for a good \\"story\\" ... this is your book."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I just have to share how much I enjoyed this book. Once it was over, I was so hungry for more of the same type of reading. What a thrill to read a book set back in the pre-Jesus days and the hardships women were faced with. The Red Tent was the place the women went once a month during their periods where they sat on clean straw for their 4 or 5 days. This was the only time they could relax, share stories, laugh and bond without the men and daily work. As I said, I was left so hungry for more reading in that same setting."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Find out and appreciate the story of the red tent and lives of ancient women in this book. It will speak to your soul."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Some fiction should be read for what it it, and not taken too seriously. I enjoyed this book. At the half-way point though, I almost put it down because I saw it heading towards predictable. But then it took a sudden twist and caught me up in it again."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"What a wonderful story based in biblical times. I usually would not read a \\"period piece\\", but this was well worth it! An excellent read that I could not put down!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"One of my favourtie books--ever! Give copies to your girlfriends and they will love it too.I originally thought this was a book about biblical issues--the treatment of women, the brutality of life, the differences in politics--but it is about so much more than that. The core of this story of Dinah is about sisterhood, the bonds between women, and how history often forgets their moving and deeply personal experiences. It's not an Oprah book or a feminist rant, the author is too subtle for that.The Red Tent is engrossing, mesmerizing, and unforgettable. Read it!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"&quot;The Red Tent&quot; is one of the most captivating books I've read in quite awhile. I thoroughly enjoyed this story of the women of the Bible through one young girl's point of view. It's a side of the story I'd never heard before, and it was creative, beautiful and intelligent. The characters were so well developed and fascinating. I devoured this book in a couple of days because I just couldn't stop reading it! I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I am not a Biblical scholar, and did not chose to read this book because it was the &quot;story&quot; of Dinah, Jacob's only daughter. I was drawn to this book more for the way it took a minor character from the bible and used her as a pivot to write a thoroughly engrossing story about the lives of women during the time presented in the Book of Genesis.In this book we follow Dinah as she grows up, entering early the company of women due to her being the only daughter of her mother and aunts (all married to the same man.) We watch as she is initiated into the mysteries of womanhood; menstruation, childbirth, relating to men. With the &quot;red tent&quot; as their center, this society of sisters and other women is revealed as the complex and powerful entity that it is, as the women who make it up struggle with using their power within a male dominated society.This is not a feminist book, per se, but it does examine some feminist issues. Mostly though, I just found it an engrossing read, and was drawn into caring about the protagonist and her life and troubles. All in all this is a wonderful book for anyone, man or woman, from any religious background, although I think it will resonate more for women than it will for men."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Although I read a lot of fiction, I usually stick to reviewing non-fiction since each person can have very different tastes when it comes to storylines and characters. I cannot avoid commenting on this fabulous book, however! Diamant, who is known in the publishing world for her comprehensive and approachable books on Jewish life, has shown us an incredible and untapped side of her talent through this novel.The story of Dinah (and of her &quot;mothers&quot;, Leah, Rachel, Zilpah, and Bilhah, the wives and concubines of Jacob) traverses childhood to womanhood to old age, from Canaan to Egypt and throughout it all, you live and breathe with these characters. Diamant has managed to do an astonishing amount of research for this book as she seamlessly weaves the daily life, religion, and natural world of the women into her prose. Her accounts of Canaanite and Egyptian life appeared extremely accurate on all accounts, yet the book did not for one second ever seem dry or pedantic. I read this work in one day to the exclusion of all else!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"An amazing example of storytelling at its best. This book draws you into the lives of Dinah, the daughter of Jacob, who was the father of the twelve tribes of Israel. Afforded a small mention in the bible, Anita Diamant envisions the life of this biblical woman and breathes life into her. I found myself going back to the Bible, to read the story of Dinah and Jacob, Joseph , Leah and Rachel. To me that is an amazing feat, that the book became so true to me, that I felt compelled to read this part of the Bible again, something I have not done in years. The book also offers the rare opportunity to hear a woman's voice, in biblical times. Rarely do we hear the stories of these women, and although this is undoubtably fiction, it rang true from beginning to end. An absolute must read."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This novel is clearly not for people who believe that the bible is factual and all the events in it literally happened the way they are written.If you are open to exploring the possibilities of what could have happened in biblical times (and yes, to biblical characters) and are dissatisifed with the paltry, shallow biblical accounts of women, I recommend this book.It is a wonderful story of sisterhood, friendship, loyalty, and love. Diamant is an excellent writer, and I was captivated by the book from start to finish (although I agree with other reviewers that the story was strongest before she left her mothers)."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This book moved me deeply. Although - as some reviewers have complained-- it is not always faithful to the biblical accounts -- it is a wonderful STORY. I was amazed that Ms. Diamant could take a footnote and weave such an involved piece of work."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"The story is gripping from the very first page. For anyone who is interested in fleshing out the stories of the Bible, especially regarding the lives of women, this is a great book. Diamant, who clearly is well versed in Jewish facts and traditions, makes Dinah a facinating person to follow in her process of growing up in ancient times. All of the familiar names of the Bible become real people that we can relate to and understand. Surely this isn't a factual account but it does give us the flavor of what life might have been like 5000 years ago. A GREAT read!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Beautifully and poignantly written! I thoroughly enjoyed this book, and going through the range of emotions with the women in this story. I thought the author did a beautiful job depicting the strength of women, the bonds and relationships between them and the differences among them and how they related to men. Those reviewers who criticize the book's departure from Biblical accuracy should keep in mind that this is fiction, and exceptionally well written fiction, at that!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I'm writing in disagreement with a customer review which stated that The Red Tent had too many mentions of paganism practiced by the women. The statement is entirely false - Diamant writes from a historical perspective, not a religious perspective - creating what this world might have been like with real people, not myth. Paganism would have been much more prominant and natural to these women - they practiced a combination of Jacob's worship of El, with the religion engrained in them. There are many instances in the Old Testament where wives are punished for not worshipping the Gods of their husbands, or for worshipping idols - which the author demonstrates very well in this book."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"&quot;The Red Tent&quot; was an amazing re-telling of a classic Bible tale. It is a truly thought-provoking work; forcing the reader to think and rethink the meaning of truth. The story of Dinah in the Bible recalls the events as they were true to Jacob's sons, whereas this text recalls the events as they might have been true to Dinah herself.A masterpiece of historical fiction, Anita Diamant's &quot;The Red Tent&quot; is a must-read for women, religious scholars, and fiction lovers everywhere."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This is a marvelous book. It takes you right into the life of women in ancient biblical times. Ms. Diamant wove a fascinating tale of Dinah, the only daughter of Jacob. We are all familiar with the tale of Joseph, her brother, but I had never read anything on Dinah. The author's description of life in Canaan and Egypt was very vivid. You feel as if you are there. It is a very moving story, and one I would recommend to everyone with an interest in historical/biblical fiction. I look forward to other books by Anita Diamant."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"A look at a little-mentioned figure in the bible sparked my interest! It was one of the most intriguing books I have ever read. The plot, connected with real Biblical-events, was wonderful! I could not put the book down.Having a glimpse into the lives of women of Biblical times was a gift, I had never really been interested in, but after, The Red Tent, it is a subject I won't soon forget, or take advantage of.I thought reading a book about a man with numerous wives would be somewhat difficult to swallow, but the strength of the women in this novel was unimaginable.This is a definite must-read, for both women, and men!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I must say that the cover and subject of the book did not attact me, but the good reviews I kept reading and hearing convinced me to read it. I was surprised at how quickly I became immersed in this story.It is a bible story told from the perspective of the woman, Dinah. The characters come alive as she describes her life growing up in the house of Jacob with Rachel, Leah and all her other 'mothers' and brothers.It is a wonderful piece of historical fiction. Highly enjoyable and easy reading -- not as heavy as it may sound!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"It amazes me how swiftly Diamant drew me into her text. She makes those primitive tribes of biblical times so very real. I am reminded of the skill of Marion Zimmer Bradley in her Mists of Avalon.Dinah relates the mythical existence of those early women in Old Testament times. The nature gods of Jacob's wives and father-in-law reside side by side with El, or Jehovah. (In Zimmer Bradley's work, the nature or pagan gods conflict with the Judeo-Christian teachings.) Incredibly, Jacob holds faithful to his one true God in all practices, including relating the story of his father Isaac, and Abram's commanded offering of Isaac to test Abram's loyalty.It is through the words of Dinah, one gains such a rich and earthy perspective of Leah and Rachel, and the lesser know Zilpah and Bihlah. One realizes that polygamy as these women know it sustains them, as well as their progeny.The respect and communal survival of the tribe of Jacob is dependent on the strength and harmony of his wives. Their time in The Red Tent lends a sacredness to womankind unlike that which many women acknowledge in present times. Life was simpler and more basic then, of course. But the simplicity strongly shouts out to the reader that the practices of these nomadic women is the reason for life.What a beautiful tribute to women Diamant assembles in this novel! Even the harshest of scenes seems to add to the mystic quality of the book. The Red Tent will now serve as another female symbol in my mind. Dinah may have met with singular mention in the Bible, but her story as related in Diamant's fiction makes her memorable along with the women of Arthurian legend, Native American history, and all strong women in general. Dinah's voice deserves Diamant's vivid portrayal as it appears in this magnificent historical novel."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"What a wonderful book! I thoroughly enjoyed this book and to be quite honest, I was so surprised how easily it flowed and I absolutely could not put it down. I put off reading this book because I figured it would be a bit hard to understand, a little like reading the Bible. Do yourself a favor and pick this book up and read it. The fellowship of these women is very interesting to read about. There's jealousy, revenge, and cattiness---believe it or not. There's also love, romance, caring, tenderness and also some of the nastiness in life, such as physical and sexual abuse, abortion, and even neglect of the less than perfect newborns. This book has brought a lot of understanding to me about the biblical and ancient times. What a tremendous role the women played as a &quot;single unit&quot;. GREAT BOOK. It's surely a book that, once it's read, it will never be forgotten. I'd give it better than a 5 star rating if I could. I will read more from this author for sure."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Although you don't have to be familiar with the Old Testament to reap the rich rewards in The Red Tent, it certainly provides an interesting counterpoint to the tale. (The tale can be read from Genesis 25:19 to Genesis 35). What is so rich about The Red Tent is its perspective, precisely, that of Dinah's--a woman before the God of Abraham was the only God around. Indeed, the women of this story have their own gods, their own traditions, their own stories. The power of this book lies in the depth of the storytelling; it is alive, captivating, and rich in the wisdom of women. Take, for instance, this quote where Dinah's mother explains a mysyery to her:&quot;The great mother whom we call Innana gave a gift to women that is not known among men, and this is the secret of blood. The flow at the dark of the moon, the healing blood of the moon's birth--to men, this is flux and distemper, bother and pain. they imagine we suffer and consider themselves lucky. We do not disabuse them. &quot;In the red tent, the truth is known. In the red tent, where days pass like a gentle stream, as the gift of Innana courses through us, cleasning the body of last month's death, preparing the body to receive the new month's life, women give thanks--for repose and restoration, for the knowledge that life comes between our legs, and that life costs blood.&quot; -----page 158I always appreciate a novel that deepens your own perspective, one that calls forth a fuller response to the events of our lives. The Red Tent is such a book. I am certain now that when my own daughters come of age, their will be a ceremony for them that expresses their own connection to the great mother Earth, and her sister the moon. But do not think that this is just a coming of age story for women, because it is not. It is a story woven with the threads of birth and death, love and agony, connectedness and solitude. And its culmination, its last breath, is a glorious sunset of wisdom and words."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"The title of my review may sound overwhelming, but all of the above is true for &quot;The Red Tent&quot;. A girlfriend of mine let me borrow it before letting several of her other friends borrow it as well. It was so interesting to read a story that made another era seem so incredibly realistic. Anita Diamant brings you directly into an era that is virtually unknown to us. It was a motivating book, that brought out the bonds between women. Everything is faced in this book, nothing is ignored, and it boldly goes where no book I've read before goes."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Imagine the Bible stories you were told as a child retold from a woman's point of view. They're actually better retold this way--and it follows the stories in Genesis--only in a more intimate way.This book is beautifully written and captures your attention--right after you get over all the &quot;begets&quot;. Use the genealogy chart at the beginning of the book, find a comfortable chair and read and read--and then cry when it's over!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"If you have a strong interest in the feminine side of Judiasm, or just feminism in general, this book is for you. This was the kind of book that I could not put down. I began it on the plane and read it straight through. It is definately on my top ten list. The author takes a small story from the Hebrew Bible and expands it into a novel from the women's point of view. The story includes characters such as Rebekah, Rachel, Leah. Some more conservative readers might find portions of the book blasphemous (especially the implied Asherah worship), but I think the book accurately reflects the practice of the times. A most compelling read!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I am a very big fan of Christian historical fiction, I love it when authors take the stories of the Bible and make them come alive for all of us. I was so excited to dive into this story and see the whole story of Jacob and his wives from a unique perspective, of his only daughter: Dinah. But I have to give all of you a word of warning that I wish I would have received before spending money on this book: IT IS BIBLICALLY INACCURATE. The disparities start off with small details (ex. Jacob had to work for seven YEARS to win Rachel's hand in marriage, not seven MONTHS.) However, the author begins to spin, manipulate and twist the details of the story in the Bible. I am not sure if she did it for the sake of a good story but I wish that I would have been forewarned, the only reason I finished the book is because I didn't want to waste the money I spent to buy it. But there were several times that I had to close the book in frustration about the misconstrued details and untruthful portrayal of many Biblical characters. I could list example after example of errors but please let me save you the time and tell you NOT to read this book."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Excellent portrayal of the period. Having worked on archaeological sites in Israel for several years, I have been associated with sites where evidence of 'pagen' objects are commonly found right along side of objects associated with judaism...in the same households. This indicates that there was simultaneous worship of idols and &quot;El&quot; contrary to what one reviewer might think. I have also worked on sites rich in matriarchal 'goddess' evidence from pre-hebrew periods. The author did an excellent job of filling in the blanks left by the biblical tale and archaeological evidence. Good book!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I really enjoyed this book-It made me appreciate the way women lived in OT times."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I was guilty of judging this book by its cover, it look like it would be too serious or \\"deep\\", not at all entertaining. Thank goodness I decided to give it a try because it was a really good book! Other reviewers have gone into great detail to give you the plot of the book, etc. so I won't repeat that. I'll just say that the characters in the book were very real and the story speaks to your heart in a way that you don't expect. Of course there's a lot of history thrown in, which thankfully comes along in any book in the historical fiction genre. I love books that make me constantly google things that the characters are doing or talking about so I can paint that picture in my mind. Of course the benefit of this is that I learn something new and obtain a whole new appreciation of a new culture.In short, this book is good, read it!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I read this based on a recommendation from a friend and was a bit skeptical about it. It did not take long for the book to suck me in. It's a great read on how women lived during the biblical years (the book is NOT religious). I could not put this book down. It's a bit long, but well worth the read."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This is a very different perspective of Genesis, all from a woman's point of view. I found it very interesting. I think a lot of people don't even consider that women had a voice back in those days but this author gave the women of that time a voice. Although it is fiction, it seems very realistic!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"From all the hype I thought it would be an awesome book. It was well written, and was good overall. I just didn't enjoy it like I thought I would."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I'm not even sure where to start when talking about The Red Tent. The novel has more births and menstruation references per capita then anything I've ever read so if that bothers you, stay away. If you can stomach it all then you will be rewarded with one of the more fascinating books of recent memory. Simply put, this book \\"is\\" woman which probably makes it all the more important that it be read by men and I enjoyed it's different and unabashed feminine point of view.Diamant's story follows that of the biblical character Dinah, her upbringing in the patriarchal family of Joseph and his four wives. We follow Dinah through her turbulent life as a midwife living in times that are both joyful and brutal. The character of Dinah is a worthy creation in its own right as Diamant has carefully crafted a character that is atypical of your usual heroine. Diamant's Dinah is a memorable literary character; a realistic and engrossing person that learns, loves and lives in three dimensions and this is completely her book. You will sympathize and root for her every step of the way. On top of this Diamant does an excellent job of transporting the reader to biblical times and she had put a lot of thought into the expositional aspects of her world.Having some background knowledge of the Old Testament and specifically that of Joseph and Jacob is important. Part of the appeal of this book for me, was reading Diamant's interpretation of the event as described in Genesis and seeing what changes or liberties she takes. Also noteworthy is the method in which Diamant represents the roles of women in this foreign world. In Jacob's patriarchal family, 4 wives share his love and women exist to birth, cloth and cook. They relish and even bond in this role as is becomes the definition of their womanhood, which is in contrast to the utterly empty female royalty we meet later in the book. Even though lifestyles of biblical times were completely different then those of people today, the emotions of love, jealousy, happiness and loss are still identifiable and will connect you to this novel.Bottom Line: A surprisingly authentic book, a great story, and an overall memorable read."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"The Red Tent is an interesting novel based on the story of Jacob, as told through the eyes of Dinah, his only daughter. Dinah is mentioned in the bible in a single sentence regarding the rape of Dinah. Beyond this, we know nothing about her. Diamant's novel revolves around this passage and about the ensuing destruction of Shechem. The Red Tent is not a simple retelling of the story of Jacob - Diamant creates realistic characters and gives context to the characterizations of Laban, Jacob, Esau, Rachel, Leah, Joseph, and the rest of the patriarchs and matriarchs of the Jewish religion. Further, as I mentioned before, the story is told via female eyes - an entirely different perspective than the normal biblical analysis. While not all will agree with Diamant's characterizations, they seem to fit generally with the text of the bible (except her portrayal of Rebecca as a cult priestess and her portrayal of Laban which seems more negative). There are a few inaccuracies - in the bible, Jacob worked for 7 years before he married Rachel and another 7 years before he married Leah wheras in this book, he worked only for a few months. Diamant's interpretation of the rape of Dinah is novel - but not entirely implausable considering the fact that Shechem indeed asked to married her and agreed to submit to circumcision in order to do so. Indeed, in one passage Rachel hides her father Laban's teraphim (idols) from him by placing them under her while she had her period. This passage is taken directly from the bible! I had no idea about the presence of idols in Genesis and this book creates what I would guess to be an accurate portrayal of the state of religion at the time of Jacob. While the bible does not explicitly discuss the practice of idolatry, it seems very likely to me that Diamant in theorizing that idolatry was commonplace amongst the wives of Jacob is spot on.Diamant creates an interesting discussion of daily life in biblical times. After the destruction of Shechem, we know nothing of what happened to Dinah. I do not want to spoil the book, but the sections that follow are purely of Diamant's imagination and are just as good as the sections derived from the bible. The book discusses menstruation and childbirth quite a bit - Dinah becomes a midwife. While this is purely Diamant's invention, these sections are very interesting and important because menstruation, pregnancy, and childbirth were very important in the daily lives of women of that era. If you take a literal view of the bible, you probably won't like this novel. However, if you enjoy the idea of examining bible stories from a woman's eyes I recommend this novel highly."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I read this book about two years ago, and haven't read it since because it is making the rounds among my friends and their friends, as we all automatically recommend it anytime anyone asks for a good book. Yet, I still think about it often, and can't wait to get my hands on it again.This is a captivating, mesmerizing peek into the lives of women when they relied so heavily on their own strength, and on each other. Despite all the antithetical cultural and mechanical differences between their lives and my own, I still find myself longing for my own Red Tent, with a cadre of women to help myself through my more singular, modern, feminine experience.That, I think, is one of the great appeals of this book. Sure, the writing and character development is superb, and should not be dismissed as unimportant. But the haunting mental images of those characters and their experiences as the reader internalizes their struggles and compares them to her own, makes this book so real and creates such a visceral impact. It affirms that women can surpass their individual or collective pre-conceived limits. In truth, it made me believe I can do it, whatever \\"it\\" is.I will be handing over my dog-eared, well-loved copy to my daughters when they reach an age where they can appreciate all that is described. I hope it will foster many discussions so that, at last, we will have our own Red Tent."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Once I opened this book I could not put it down. I felt transported to a place and time that I had previously experienced only through the eyes of men. The subject matter is intense, the story extremely well told.My taste in books tends to lean more towards \\"novels\\" than \\"literature\\". I enjoy Science Fiction, Crime novels, etc. But contrary to what I would normally pick up to read I could not get enough of this book, what I would call literature in the best sense.I was enthralled and would highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Our Foremothers come to life in this wonderfully evocative story about Dinah. The Torah comes to life here, and the writing seems like poetry."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I first read this book years ago and have returned to it many times.

It is a comfort to see that the unity and sisterhood has survived through so many generations and world events."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This was a great book! It was so interesting to read a different spin on the story. I feel that women are often left out of history, it was great to read about their traditions and stories."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I marvel at how the author took a chapter-long Bible reference into a novel. One meets many familiar names and gets to know these individuals from a viewpoint different from the Bible. It is difficult at times to realize that this work of fiction gives a look at life so many years ago, but was written within the last 2 decades."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I love this story, it made me look at the plight of women in a completely different light. How far we have come as women, but at the same time a true reflection of the past. Its a great read, and a total life changer.(...)"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I originally thought this was going to be a very biblical book and speak of religion heavily. Instead, I got a sensational story which opened my eyes to the beauty and turmoil of life, and the journey through it all. Amazing."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This novel is one of my favorites. I love the character development and the community they created. I do not want to give away any story, so I will just say: I couldn't sleep, I barely ate, and when I finished the book I felt a sense of loss that the story ended."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I imagined what it was like living in biblical times through the vivid description of the author's words. I found myself engrossed in the novel and would recommend the book to others."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Amazing. Women are so seldom mentioned in the Old or New Testament. Here they are three dimensional. We read this in our book group. I've read other books by the author. She has amazing skills of observing and reporting what she sees and feels."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"The Red Tent is beautifully crafted with a vivid description of what life might have been like in biblical times. It gives beautiful insights into women's roles during that time and their interrelationships, especially sisters who had to share a husband -- getting very \\"up front and personal\\" with sibling rivalry in a new and intense way. As the novel progresses you see how society's definitition of family and the intimate relationship begins to evolve. It is a great tribute to the importance of the history of storytelling and of the power of maintaining connection with our ancestors. A worthwhile read!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"The Red Tent is what turned me onto historical fiction. It was one of those books that I couldn't put down once I picked it up."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This book was wonderful.

The insight into the life an time of the characters is amazing. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who enoys historical fiction."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Although this novel is a work of fiction, it truly has you think & believing that the events actually took place. I was mesmerized and could not wait to pick up where I left off after having to put the book down for however long."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Historical novel that I would give 4-1/2 stars.

Couldn't put it down. It is one of the best books I have ever read."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I read this book last year on the recommendation from a friend. Then this book was picked as a quick discussion for our Bible study group over the Christmas holiday. Our group really enjoyed reading and discussing the story of Dinah and her famous family. Even though this is a novel, the historical data was very close to the story related in the Bible and if more had been documented about Dinah's life, this may have been what happened. I do think I got even more out the of book the second time through and would encourage those who like to read about women of the Bible to give this one a try."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I bought this book as a christmas gift after reading it myself. It is a wonderful novel for the person who appreciates womanhood and what it's meant to be a woman throughout the ages. You don't have to be religious to enjoy this author's perspective."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"All I can say is wow. I was recommended this book by a colleague. I took her recommendation and read it, and I don't regret a thing. I'm not very religious, so I didn't understand the biblical references, but I enjoyed the book for the picture of women in biblical times it painted. This book had a very calming effect on me. This may sound cliche, but it reminded me of the things that really matter in life, like building strong relationships that stand the test of time, not only with the opposite sex, but with your own. Some people may not have liked the graphic descriptions of menstruation and childbirth, but I thought these descriptions only added to the earthy and natural feeling of the novel. I'm not going to spoil the end of it for you: you have to read it yourself.happy reading!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This book offers a heartbreaking account of the silencing of the female narrative in the development of the Hebrew tradition."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"As a Man and someone who isnt interested in \\"Religion\\" I found this book to be Enlightening.the Red Tent opened me, made me feel emapathy and gave me an awakening into the secret lives of Women.

I loved this book from beginning to end. I hated for it to end, to have to return to reality. The Red Tent is full of well researched details of life for women in a man's world. The life of Dinah, only daughter of Jacob and his first wife Leah is a life full of sorrow, strength, days of joy and a lifetime of living with her sisters. It is a joy to read and will stay with you."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"The Red Tent is an area in Biblical times where women who were menstruating or who had recently given birth congregated. Diamant told us at least 100 times that the Red Tent is where they shared their stories, yet never once told us what stories were shared there. A basic lesson in writing 1.01 is to show, don't tell.Anyway, for the life of me, I can't imagine wanting to either be with menstruating women, or hearing what they have to say in that condition. Most of us, are not at our best during menses, nor do we just sit around and wax rhapsodic at those times.Several of my friends loved this book, several felt as I. There are many times when i've disagreed with people about writers, but in this case, I was not able to fathom what excited people about this book."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"There are some very positive things and some quite negative things about this book, which average out to a 2-star rating. As for the positives, Anita Diamant is a beautiful writer whose prose almost sounds like poetry at times. Her descriptions of the events and emotions of the women who surrounded Jacob in the Bible are deep and believable. She is a good story-teller and the life of Dinah, Jacob's only daughter is told in an interesting and compelling fashion. As has been noted in many of the other reviews, Diamant does some creative editing to the original story from Genesis. Some may argue that this is a work of fiction and, as such, the author has free reign. However, when you are using the Bible as a source it should be given the respect and accuracy that it deserves. For instance, the author changes the time of 7 years which Jacob worked for each of his first 2 wives to 7 months. This completely denigrates the point that Jacob was a dedicated and determined man who did what it took to meet his goals. Another fabrication is the fact that Rachel asked her sister Leah to step in for her at her wedding ceremony at the last minute. In fact, it was her father Laban who did this and thus showed a weakness in character and an unwillingness to do as he promised, which was to give Rachel to Jacob as his wife. The rape of Dinah is described as a love affair between her and the prince, a point which changed the whole rest of the story. Also the mention of a variety of gods disregards the fact that Jacob, as Isaac and Abraham before him, was loyal to one God. Author Diamant seems unable to accept the fact that women were second-class citizens in those days and she changes the story to accommodate greater power than they really possessed. Hoping that at least most of the background was true, I turned to the author's website and was disappointed to discover that probably the red tent itself did not exist during Dinah's lifetime. Mixing fact and fiction with such a heavy hand is confusing to a reader who hopes to find some truth even in a fictionalized telling of a Bible story. The book starts out on a high note, but begins to fail as the plot twists are fabricated, and the last section, which takes place in Egypt is downright dreary. It's difficult to write a better story than God did."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"While I really did not care for this book, my biggest problem is how they sell it as biblical fiction when it has so little in common with the Bible. As the reviewers before have noted, there is alot of paganism among the women, the &quot;goddess&quot; cult and &quot;girl power&quot; type stuff. The men are generally shown as capable of a few good moments, but mostly as self-serving and uncaring men. Besides the mismarketing, I was just bored by the book. Perhaps because I was expecting something to motivate me spiritually or at least excite me with great storytelling, but this book failed on all accounts. The writing style itself is not so bad, simply done and not overly descriptive but the story is a flop. Pass this one by in favor of The Robe or Quo Vadis or anything with more depth."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Do not let the subject matter scare you- this is not a typical rewrite from the Old Testament! Anita Shreve has done a beautiful job of writing a book on what I would call &quot;Close to Historical Fiction&quot;.Her players are many and familiar, thank goodness for the family tree in the front. The character development takes creative license and gives a depth needed to pull off the story. Shreve weaves the story of Dinah, giving the reader (me) a personal sense of who she is. Dinah's life becomes plausible and realistic. I believed her!The patriarchal society is enough to make you run for the red tent, but Shreve only puts in what is needed for the story. There is the right amount of anger, frustration and obedience coming from the women to make you root for them and to understand their inner strength.The Red Tent blends a good amount of suspense, astonishment at old practices, violence and retribution. It is a great fast read."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Pardon me, I was heavily medicated when I wrote that review. Here is the sober, revised edition:This book is incredibly accurate. I trust an author who writes about Old Testament characters and history when she uses the Bible as one of her sources of research, along with mountains of other sources she spent three years of her life researching. Her book is so closely wed to the Biblical account that this book really can be classified as historical fiction or biblical fiction, in my opinion. She just did tons and tons of research and then developed her on story which complements and enriches our understanding of the Old Testament. The only purpose that I can find in trashing this book (as some have done here) is to promote a conservative agenda. If you are looking for great Biblical Fiction, I recommend The Red Tent because Diamant is a profound author who has done extensive research and consulted the Bible."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This is a story based on people from the Old Testment, and of course it may not be true, but it gives strength and importance to women who are more often than not unappreciated and forgotten in history and especially Christian history. The womens' experiences just represented the kinds of struggles and pain that women in general experienced at the time. It made me appreciate what it means to be a mother and a woman - the caregivers of the earth and of man. I have no doubt that the way Diamant describes daily rituals and processes are extremely accurate. And maybe Dinah wasn't raped and really was in love, but her brothers couldn't handle not being in control of her sexuality as men have been for thousands of years. Read it as a beautiful story, not as sacreligious or evil - otherwise how can you truly enjoy literature and learn anything at all?"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"the most accurate view of this time in history we will ever get!! Finally an author who dared to tell the story from a woman's point of view. Don't let the word biblical scare you away. This book has nothing to do with religion and everything to do with LIFE. This was one of the most enchanting and beautiful stories I have ever read...finished it in 24 hours...I think everyone should read this book."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I'm not sure whether the problem was with the mailing or with my postman (I have a rural mailbox) Upon opening a rather &#34;squished&#34; package , I found that the middle of the binding was broken ( it was paperback) and it was necessary to tie more than 100 pages with scotch tape to make it readable. However, it was readable."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Some one in our book club recommend this for us to read. It just was not my kind of book. It does make you see what women went thru back in that time but I wouldn't recommend it myself for someone else to read."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"An Old Testament story from the female point of view. I read the book few years ago, but bought the Kindle version recently."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This book was an enjoyable and interesting read from start to finish. It presented a great perspective from the viewpoint of a Biblical female, Dinah, who was barely mentioned in the Bible. The characters were brought to life and made human to the point where readers can empathize with them over the tragedies and triumphs that they all go through. The Red Tent is well worth the time."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"The book is in great shape. I Like more Biographical books. This was a lot of fiction."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I was engrossed in this novel from the first page. This is a heart-wrenching story but you will love every second of it. I could not put this down. When I was done reading it, I was sad. I picked up the bible and started reading Genesis to find out more. I wish Anita Diamant would write more biblical fiction. I have not found a book in this genre that I have liked since. This book is one of the best I have read this year."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This is one of those books that make you think even as it entertains you. It takes the Biblical stories (which are written from a male perspective) and views them from a female perspective. I am interested in archeology and I noticed that the author has included some of the more recent interpretations of archeological findings into her story. It is very much like what \\"Mists of Avalon\\" did for the Arthurian tales"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Very good read. My book club discussed it and agreed that it gave an interesting twist to the biblical version.The Red Tent: A Novel"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"It was suggested to me to read this book from a friend. The subject matter did not interest me much, but I figured, why not. I was very surprised on how much I enjoyed it, considering the fact that I've never been into the idea of having children or giving birth. Dinah's story is very compelling and it brings you back to the times of the biblical era to give you a glimpse of life at that time."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Just finished this and thoroughly enjoyed it. I picked it up because of the historical content, but really enjoyed the story."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"The Red Tent is an action packed book.Perhaps, she has taken liberties with history but since it is not recorded she has that opportunity."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"The last book we read for my now defunct book club at work was not one I ever would have picked out. Let me start out by saying that I am in no way biblically driven. The few times I've done more than peruse the bible were in church when the sermons were too dry to focus on. So when someone suggested The Red Tent, which is the story of Dinah who was little more than a footnote in the Book of Genesis, I was hesitant to say the least.Dinah is the sole daughter of Jacob and his wives Leah, Rachel, Bilhah, and Zilpah. Leah gave birth to her but all of the wives felt a special kinship to her. Growing up the only daughter in a family of eleven sons, Dinah is granted special permissions to spend her time in the red tent with her mothers before it is her time to do so. It's there that she learns the special trades of each of her mothers in turn.Her father Jacob fled his family years earlier after he and his mother trick Isaac, his father, into giving Jacob the blessing that his brother Esau's birthright according to Isaac's family traditions. He trekked out to meet his uncle Laban and it was Laban's daughters he ended up marrying. Initially he was to marry Rachel, the most beautiful of Laban's daughters, but it was decided that she was too young and that Jacob would set up home there and wait until Rachel was old enough. When that time came, Zilpah scared Rachel into backing out of the wedding, convincing Leah to marry Jacob in her place.Eventually Rachel married him as well, and as part of the dowry bequeathed to Jacob Zilpah and Bilhah were given to him as Leah and Rachel's handmaids.After years of working and accruing a wealth that Laban perceives as his own since it is his land, Jacob decides that the time has come to try to make amends with his brother Esau and set up a village all his own. So after a bitter settlement is reached between Laban and Jacob and all their wares packed, the family sets off to see Esau and find a place to settle. Around this time, Dinah is growing into the age of maturity and upon settling into their village, she meets the man she loves and marries. But their time together is all too brief.The first part of Anita Diamant's book was interesting but slow. Parts two and three of the book really picked up the pace and had me glued to the book. As I said, this book would not have ever been one that I would have chosen, so I am really glad that someone recommended it. I would have missed out on a great tale otherwise. As soon as I finished this book, I found my bible and read the Book of Genesis to see how the story compared. I was amazed to see that a novel this rich and detail oriented was spun from little more than two paragraphs."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Not only was The Red Tent a wonderful book, it arrive in new condition for an exceptional price and was delivered in a more than reasonable time period."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This is such a wonderful story! I only wish I could find more books like it. I was hoping Anita Diamant would start a series like this on other women from the bible, but no such luck. This book pulls you in from the beginning and makes you feel like your there, part of this family and sharing in all the happiness, joy, heartache, anger and love. Even though it's a fictional account, it opens the door to possibilities and makes you wonder about other stories in the bible where so little is said of the women... and what their real untold story is."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This book is a book that renews the strength of a womans heart. It lets many a female know what she beholds is sacred, an roots book of femininity. Billy bad as I said I'm 24 and have a babe and dig it."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"A really interesting read. I found this story fascinating, entertaining, and well-written. Couldn't put it down."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Though this is fiction, it follows the biblical story of Jacob and his twelve sons quite closely. The central character is Rachel, his only surviving daughter, who tells about her life with all her brothers and Jacob's four wives whom she calls her four mothers. The red tent is the place where all the women meet each month for a few days when they can talk and rest. Because Rachel is the only girl, she is allowed in the tent before she is a woman so she learns much about her mothers and grandmother. This very readable story gives the founders of the twelve tribes of Israel personalities as seen through feminine eyes."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Holy moly...I just finished reading The Red Tent. I bought it on a whim through Amazon. I am honest in saying that I could barely put this book down. It evoked emotion and vivid scenery that intrigued my mind. Just terrific. I can't wait to pass it on to my friends. Tales of midwifery and love, passionate to the core. I would recommend this book to any woman, but especially those that are intrigued by \\"life\\" and the miracle of birth. Just beautifully written and I can't wait to read her other novel about Dogtown. Enjoy this book...It is a true page-turner."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"You know I loved this book, the fact that is was a FICTIONAL turn on a woman who is mentioned only briefly in the Bible. I found the historical undertaking of what was a very matriarchal society among these women was enthralling. The fact that women once upon a time were considered to be the source of life and therefore the source of power is something that I mourn being lost. As I said once to a pastor who touted that women should not preach, that when Jesus rose from the dead, he spoke to a woman before anyone else. I think that when my daughter is older I would let her read this and I would also teach her to cherish the power in her, which is what my parents taught me. I don't find this to be a blasphemousas some reviewers have stated, the Bible was revised, the books that are in the Bible were condensed and the books that were cast out of it, would perhaps shed more light on the characters in it. Anita Diamant at no time asks anyone to abandon their religious belief to read this book, fiction is a work of the imagination not of truth or fact, Anita has a great one. I love the practice of midwifery in this book, because my great grandmother was in this profession at the turn of the century an dI have always found it facinating. Love this book!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"love love love this book my favorite book of all time! one of the few books you could read again and still enjoy!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This book is incredible. Truly. This story really made me want to revisit a more simple lifestyle, and to understand more about this historical culture. I went on a spice and grain heavy kick for awhile after the descriptions of all the food. I really appreciate having the other possible telling of a biblical story. And I LOVED the relationship between the women. This is absolutely a book every woman should read at some point in her life."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Let me begin by stating that I do understand that this book (like all books) is not for everyone. There are a lot of reviewers who found this book distasteful. So, if you're looking for a book which accurately reflects history or the Bible, skip this. Also, if you're religiously sensitive or easily offended by gore or graphic detail or scenes of birth, don't grab this one. (I felt like these scenes were importantly connected to the overall story.)I don't want the reviews to scare you off from this book if you're not in one of the categories above. Everyone is entitled to an opinion, of course, but I think the vast majority of women out there will enjoy this novel.Personally, I love this novel. I found it empowering the way I found The Mists of Avalon empowering (read that book!! It's long but worth the read). The story is engaging and touches upon the important events in a woman's life- and despite being set in Biblical times, I could relate to it very intimately.I tore through this novel in only a few days. Also, it made me cry pretty hard at one point. I laughed and gasped out loud several times. Again, it's a misnomer to call is historical or biblical fiction. But the story is full of female empowerment and mysticism. A wonderful, mythical take from a woman's perspective. You definitely see aspects of life, especially life in biblical times, from a woman's point of view."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This book is a nostalgic sad story of scorn women. It just shows you how hard women had it through out the history. Even though the story is fiction, still feels very real. You can't help feeling sorry for the heroin and sympatize with all the hardship she had in her life. It was much deserved hapiness at the end. It was ironic she suffered and gave up a lot for her son and they just grew apart so much at the end.I am so glad woman has better options in life today. But, in some parts of the world they still live the story of Dinah."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I didn't know what to expect from this book when I started reading it. And not being very knowlegeable on the Old Testament I wasn't very familiar with some of the traditions mentioned in the book. I found myself looking at the family tree at the beginning of the book constantly trying to remember all the characters. It was pretty slow reading and I got tired of reading over and over again about all the births taking place in the red tent. If you got extra time in your hands, read it, it takes you to a very interesting time in the world."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This book is utterly incredible-different from anything I have ever read. I cried at the last page knowing I would miss the characters immensely-go get it!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Diamant's \\"Red Tent\\" is a piece a well-crafted historical fiction based upon the Biblical tale of the only surviving daughter of Exodus' most fertile patriach and polygamist, Jacob. The story of Dinah is little more than a footnote in the Good Book, but here Diamant has fleshed out Dinah's story and the stories of her four mothers Leah, Rachel, Zilpah, and Bilhah as well as her many brothers including Jospeh (of Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat fame). The author has given real faces and believable family conflicts to a well-known Old Testament story. This story spans Dinah's life from before she was born to her death and richly details the mystical powers of womanhood. Dinah travels through the Holy Land, to Egypt, becomes a wife, mother, midwife, daughter, widow, and healer. . Those of you who enjoyed the \\"Mists of Avalon\\" will like the similar epic quailty and message of the book."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This book is one of the absolute best I have ever read. While the context of the book in biblical times was very interesting the story from Dinah's point of view is incredibly powerful. Some of my other favorite books have been A Poisonwood Bible, A Widow for One Year and even Divine Secrets of Ya-Ya Sisterhood. This book was definitely tops - you'll find it hard to put down."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"The story of Joseph and his brothers has always fascinated me. This &quot;telling&quot;of the story of Dinah was so interesting. I have taken classes on &quot;The Red Tent&quot;. Would highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This book is one of the most amazing that I've ever read. I would even dare to put it far and above some of my best-loved classics. The core of the book is really the relationship between the women of Jacob's family. The dynamic between mother, daughter and aunts really describes relationships today. Diamant creates a heart-wrenching and intimate portrait of Dinah that even at its most tragic, sends forth a ray of hope."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"The Red Tent is set in biblical times, narrated by a minor biblical figure named Dinah. However, it is not dominated by an overbearing male God. Rather it pays tribute to the deities held sacred by many &quot;pagans&quot; of the time, and it revolves around women. In that time many women spent their menses in a red tent. The common pretense was that it was for religious reasons, however the word religious does not seem adequate. The time that women spent in the red tent was a time of rest and rejouvination. A time to step away from the everyday toil of life and treasurewhat it means to be a woman and mother and wife. The time in the red tent was sacred. Petty quarrels, and men, were left out and each woman was respected, as an equal, for the thing that are an intrinsic part of being a woman. Dinah's life is marked with great loves and losses, reflecting life in that time. She is hated, loved, respected amd disgraced. And she deals with all of these things on her own terms. She has a keen understanding of who she is, and her own self-worth, and is able to face her losees and accept her gifts."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"As a work of historical fiction, this book is excellent. It's engaging and written in a very conversational tone that was easy to follow. The main characters were also written with a great deal of emotion and depth, and you as a reader see them as the narrarator does. It's paced in a way that makes you really not want to stop and put it down.Besides some of the other things other reviewers have brought up re: the downsides of this book, the one thing I would warn any potential readers about The Red Tent is that it is very, VERY depressing. Do not read this book if you are not in a good mood because it will most certainly NOT cheer you up. It is not by any means a happy, 'feel good' kind of story.Despite the rather depressing story I still got wrapped up in the book, with its descriptiveness and language, and after all, that's why we read in the first place! An excellent choice for adults who love historical fiction."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I loved the history that Anita Diamant shared throught The Red Tent. It gave me a wonderful sense of what the women encountered in their day to day lives and how important the relationships between the women were. It was very moving - I understand now why SO MANY people recommended that I read it."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I read this book at the end of my conversion to Judaism. I think that the author did an excellent job of taking a &quot;well known&quot; female from the Hebrew Bible and allowing her to grow; essentially to the post-feminism/neo feminist time in which we live. We are allowed to think that she went on to greater things than the Bible fortells.Aren't we all curious about characters in the Bible we don't get to know much about? Where does our fictious mind take us at these points? As strong women (and here I will allow for many viewpoints) we want to think of our foremothers as holding &quot;equal positions&quot; with the men of the &quot;tribe.&quot;This book is purely FICTION. Anyone who thinks otherwise is deluding themselves. But, from the characters in the book we can see something of ourselves. Are we so infactuated with a man that we allow him to bed other wives, or even allow him to reach his own death?Beyond the many messages (depending on points of view)this book conveighs, it is an all around good read; especially for women who are constantly attempting to find a place in religion (Judaism in paricular.) The plot moves quickly and tugs at the heartstrings.To prove this, I sent the book to my mother the Lutheran/feminist who has her Ph.D in Biochemisty and she loved it for the growth it allowed for a woman in the Bible. If you like historical/feminist fiction you will appreciate this book for its spin on history. Again, by no strech of the imagination is this factual."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Based on the Old Testament stories of Jacob & his family but filled with details added by using the literary device of search & investigation (called \\"Midrash\\"), Anita Diamant presents a novel of Biblical proportions.She cleverly asks questions like: Why would this happen? Why would someone do that? How would a person feel or act under those conditions? Then, she adds logic, experience, and imagination to fill in the details that round out our Old Testament characters and make them come alive; she makes the Bible stories seem to jump off the page.The Red Tent story unfolds as seen through the eyes of Dinah, Jacob's only daughter, and a woman's perspective forms a backdrop of child bearing, child birthing, herb gathering, midwifery, the lingering pre-Judaic Gods, and the natural monthly cycles that lead to a few days of rest (ladies only) in the Red Tent as the moon goes through its phases.Small details evident in the Bible are brought out and woven through the fabric of the novel to add richness and depth of understanding.I really loved this book; I went back and re-read Genesis with a new sense of wonder and awe. The Red Tent is of course fiction and as such, things do not have to happen exactly for the reasons suggested but since no one really knows all the details these Bible stories are ripped open for us to do some of our own searching and investigating.The possibilities of love, betrayal, and revenge as motivating forces tied to this plot are so well brought out that I found myself losing sight of the fact that I already knew how the story would end; but wait, there's more. Never mind that, telling would be spoiling.A good book changes the reader and now as I read these Old Testament stories I slow down and try to imagine what was left out."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"While I was reading The Red Tent, I was never sure if I really liked it or not. It was so graphic and so honest and portrayed the life of the family of the patriarch Jacob in such a new and eye-opening way. The reason I was never sure whether I liked it or not was because the women of Issac and Jacob's families are portrayed as being pagan, worshipers of the Mother Goddess and practicers of Ashera rituals of fertility. I was quite sure that in the Bible, God didn't allow that of his chosen ones. So I went back to Genesis and read through the passages that were retold in the book, and the author did take some liberties with the stories. In the end, I decided that it didn't really matter, and the story itself didn't need to be accurate to the Scripture. The characters were so well developed that I really understood them better than I could have just by reading the Bible. Dinah is just mentioned in passing in Genesis, but The Red Tent brings her out of just a mere mention, to a real, living and breathing human being that once existed. I have recommended The Red Tent to my grandmother and my sisters because the bond between mothers and daughters portrayed in the book is so strong and exists because of story-telling. I love the portrayal of the ancient women who never recieve the credit they ought."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Having just finished The Da Vinci Code, I have to say that reading a book by someone who can actually write was very refreshing. I saw this book in the bookstore several years ago and thought it looked interesting then, but I only just now read it.I actually started reading this at a co-worker's recommendation, as part of my research for my first novel. Even though she had given it a glowing recommendation on the story alone, I was still pleasantly surprised to find that it was so good. (Then again, \\"Dick and Jane\\" would probably have sounded like James Joyce after The Da Vinci Code. :D ) It is SO well written. Diamant's style of writing is a bit more \\"flowery\\" than mine, for want of a better word, but it suited the subject. She ought to try her hand at poetry. Beautiful.Having read a good many reviews on this book I'm incredulous over the ones where people have said they were offended. I'm a Christian, a rather devout one, I might add, and I see no reason to be offended. One review stated that the reader had picked up the book thinking it was a Christian story, and was outraged to find it wasn't. HEL-LO, the people of the Old Testament times were NOT Christians!!! Many of them had not even heard of God. And for those that had, they didn't have the entire history of God in written form to read as we do, since this story was pulled from the very FIRST book of the Bible. Is it any wonder that they feared what was, at the time, the unknown? The people of that time were primitive and superstitious, and obviously not terribly bright, if they were worshipping things that they made with their own hands. This is a true reflection of the mentalities of that time.I DO admit to almost having a bone to pick over the treatment of Rebeccah, but I didn't feel that way when I got to the end of the book. Why? Because after having the whole picture, I realized that what Diamant states PLAINLY at the beginning of the book--that she created the story mostly out of her own head--is true. All she used were the names and places. It's called \\"poetic license\\". She never meant for this to be an accurate depiction of what we read in the Bible. Hence the disclaimer. I see no harm done in taking a small excerpt from the Old Testament and MAKING UP a story about it. Yes, the thought of Joseph being a bisexual is a revolting one, but we don't have to like it. The reader can keep in kind that this a fictional Joseph, and he doesn't REALLY have to bear any resemblence to the Joseph we have always heard about.I for one feel that reading this book has helped me as a writer. Before reading The Red Tent I hadn't given too much thought just yet as to how to make Bible characters into living, breathing people with personalities. I was thinking that I would get a lot of background information out of it, such as what they ate and wore.The only reason I'm not giving this five stars is because I was more than a little taken aback by some of the more graphic details. I could have done without the passages referring to the practices of bestiality. While I have no doubt that this did go on, I really would have preferred not reading about it. Also, the scene where Dinah has her first period, and something is inserted into her--a frog idol? I wasn't clear on that--to break her hymen. Whether that was an actual practice or not, I don't know and don't care to know. To me that sort of thing is more than a bit too intimate between a mother and daughter, and I found that part of the story repulsive.Someone pointed out that the practice of the red tent didn't happen until long after this point in time, and therefore wasn't historically accurate. When writing a story, it's OKAY to rearrange details like that. Does it make a difference that the red tent didn't come into being for another thousand years (or however long)? No. I, personally, LOVE the idea of the red tent. I love what Anita Diamant did with it. To create a story out of a minor Biblical detail, and marry it to such a strong concept is incredible. Diamant REALLY knows how to write characters. She is excellent in her accuracy concerning people's feelings. The scenes where Rachel chickens out of marrying Jacob and talks Leah into taking her place, then later regrets it and puts all the blame on Jacob--and the descriptions of the subsequent jealous rivalry between her and Leah--WOW. She NAILED it. Incredibly realistic.If you are easily offended for religious reasons, I don't recommend this book. If you are open-minded and enjoy a good, well-written historical story, this one's for you."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I love a comment written on the book's jacket, something about \\"this is what the Bible would have been if it were written by a woman.\\" When my book club chose this book, I was definitely reluctant at first - I'm not at all religious. However, even though this book stars women from the bible, their story is so amazing and interesting. It definitely enriched my understanding of the foremothers of us all. The concept of polygamy makes a lot of sense in this time when there was such a great risk of losing mothers, babies, or both in childbirth.I have a four month old now, and the biggest thing I took away from this book is how grateful I am to live in a time with superior medical care, and that nobody else can lay claim to my boy! I just can't imagine what the lives of these women were like, knowing when they got pregnant how grim their prospects were.And it's sad that the \\"red tent\\" concept fell away. I'd certainly like to take out three days a month to hang out in a tent with my fellow women and pamper ourselves silly!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"\\"The Red Tent\\" is told from the perspective of Dinah, who is only mentioned briefly in the Old Testament. Dinah is Jacob's only daughter, and the reader is treated to fascinating stories about Jacob's four wives: Leah, Rachel, Zilpah, and Bilhah. Anita Diamant does an amazing job or portraying what life was like for women in this biblical society.When Dinah comes of age, she is finally able to enter the \\"red tent,\\" which is the place women gather during their menstrual cycles, childbirth, and illness. Her four mother-aunts initiate her into her new life as a woman in the tribe. Eventually Dinah finds true love which ultimately results in unspeakable tragedy, and she is ripped away from the only home she's ever known and is forced to begin a new life in a foreign land.This book gives us an amazing account of what it was like to be a woman during this point in history. You needn't be familiar with biblical teachings in order to enjoy \\"The Red Tent,\\" but as someone who was brought up in the Lutheran church, I find it especially fascinating. Everyone should read it!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I had seen this book top the list and was curious enough to buy and read it. Its certainly a tale well told. It connects all the different pieces and makes a cohesive picture of the times and the lives. The style of writing is also striking. Dinah definitely does take an important place in the story told, but at the same time, she mingles with the other characters in the book to make a fascinating painting. Thats what struck me, this book makes a painting. I have rarely had that feeling from reading a book, but it singularly comes across as a very vivid and lovely painting of a tale older than the time that we know. If you like this one, I would also recommend 'Book of Rachel' by Joel Gross"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This book is superbly and beautifully written. It brings to life so many biblical stories that I had basically forgotten, and gave new meaning to those passages. Diamant does a great job of showing what could have happened to influence the stories of the Bible. The only drawbacks were the constant barrage of tricky and complicated names, which I kept forgetting."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This powerful book takes the story of Jacob, his four wives, and his many sons from the Bible and tells it from his daughter, Dinah's perspective. Don't be surprised if many of the characters you know from the Bible are not as you remember them in this story. The chain of events remain the same, but the female perspective is very different, and made me wonder how other Biblical stories would be seen through a woman's eyes. This story is also about the sacred relationship between mothers and daughters. Having lost my own mother last year, I cried throughout much of this story, remembering my own mother daughter relationship. This book is strongly recommended."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"If you decide to pick up this book, you have made a wise choice. Entertaining, well-written material presented by a woman with a true gift of storytelling. The writing is well-crafted with just enough description to make a reader feel as if he or she is a close observer. I felt very connected to most of the main characters, and their emotions. I'd love to see this book become a movie."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"\\"The Red Tent\\" is part of a wonderful compilation of books, which cover the lives of the women of the Bible. There is so little written about the women who populate the books of the bible, just a name here or there, which leaves great amounts of room for the story teller to work with.In this case Anita Diamant tells us the story of Dinah, the sister of Joseph. As far as I can remember the only mention of her in the bible is to tell us she was raped, and how her brothers killed the men of Shechemite to avenge her. In this book we find the story of her birth and place within the family of Jacob. We are told of her four Mother's, Jacob wives, Leah [Dinah birth mother], Rachel [the beautiful one], Zilpah, and Bilhah, and how their relationships affect Dinah. With in this book we find that Dinah becomes a strong women, who is respected and loved. She becomes a wife and mother and a midwife of standing, but not among her own family.I loved reading this book, and quite literally could not put it down once I began to read it. Ms. Diamant's writing style is comfortable to read, and flows smoothly. I found that I could relate to the feelings and need of Dinah and her mother's. I mourned the end of the book, as much for Dinah's death as for the ending of a great story."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed The Red Tent. I've not grown up with religion, so my enjoyment of the book was not at all hindered by feeling that it was sacrilege. I thought this novel was a very moving, creative, and empowering attempt to tell the story of what life might have been like for women caught in the fold between pagansim and judaism.This is a great book for people who are interested in learning more about positive female rituals and becoming more comfortable with women's natural bodily rhythms and functions. This book celebrates the beauty of the goddess in every woman, while also appreciating the strong, wise, and competent aspect of our natures.Read this book and create your own Red Tent and celebrate the first moon blood of every girl in your life."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This was one of the best books that I have ever read! I was deeply touched by the story of Dinah and her relationships to her family and friends. It is simply written and wonderfully captivating. You will need a box of tissue toward the end."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Even though there are more then 1000 reviews of this book, I feel the need to add my two cents. Many times, I have read and pondered the tiny portion about Dinah in the bible. It's such a troubling story, and feels incomplete. The idea of taking that and making a novel from it is a great idea. In addition, in the Jewish tradition taking a part of the Bible and expanding it into a story has a long history called midrash.But why write a story where the Jews once again are reviled, cursed, hated, and in this account with good reason. Why? When in the world we live in there are already more than enough forgeries myths and lies spread about us.Such frustration, to see an excellent idea like this turned into a desecration, and for no reason. I am sorry I ever read The Red Tent. I fear the bad taste it left in my mouth will remain for a long time."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I was drawn into this novel at first. I have a reader's, not a scholar's knowledge of the bible and it was compelling to see it from a women's perspective....at first! I am very curious why a woman of Jewish Faith would portray the fathers of her faith with so little grace or loyalty. Even the Mother's of her faith had no connection whatsoever with the God that blessed them. It was so curious to me why she chose these characters to write such a FICTIONAL tale. Yes, it had some historical significance to everyday life but, quite honestly, if Jacob were the man of Diamont's creation; Judaism and Christianity would not exist today. Except for the times he made love to his wives, he was weak and unappealing. The events of his communion with God were surprisingly included, but with little change to Jacob. Just days after he wrestles with the angel, he declares to his whole family that Sarai was visited by an Egyptian Goddess and given Isaac in her old age. This was the beginning of the end for me. I thought maybe Joseph's life might redeem the Hebrew men so I read on. But I was to be sorely disappointed. I finished the novel feeling very disturbed and very curious why people of Jewish Faith weren't up in arms about this novel. It's very dishonoring to the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and of Leah and Rachel who I believe were much better women for knowing Jacob and his God Elohim. I hope those that read it realize that if this had any truth to it, Judaism would have passed away like the religions of Egypt that Diamont so favors in this book."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This book has left me disturbed. I like the concept of fleshing out a character that we know so little about from the Bible. There is so much there to work with and the writer did a good job with many parts of the story. With all of that in mind, I take issue with the negativity with which she portrays Joseph, a hero of the Bible. She twists the fact that Jacob at the end of his days was visited happily by Joseph. Why? If Dinah has a bitter and tough life I don't believe these alterations were necessary to the success of the story. There are also mentions of homosexuality and beastiality that are, again, not needed to tell a good story or mentioned in this scriptural based story. I also believe this novel has a strong feminist (borderline man bashing) vibe that I did not enjoy.There are books out there for everyone and this one was just not for me. I can accept a work of fiction, but would just not recommend it for those who might have the same concerns as I did."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"When you write a novel everybody knows it's a novel. When you write a true story is the same. The problem begins when someone wants to write a novel from a true story and here everybody knows the Jacob's story as is written in the Bible so here are the flaws:You don't have to explain every little detail as it is written in the Bible and then explain the same as you wish it were. You can give a general description and then write something of your own but without changing the main story.You can't change what happened so why trying to do it by writing a different thing?You can write an unbias or funny or sad explanation of a true story depending in your point of view, but to change the core of what really happened?Of course nobody knows for sure what exactly happened 5,000 years ago but no one have found the Bible as untrue."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Story OverviewMy name means nothing to you. My memory is dust.This is not your fault, or mine. The chain connecting mother to daughter was broken and the word passed to the keeping of men, who had no way of knowing. That is why I became a footnote, my story a brief detour between the well-known history of my father, Jacob, and the celebrated chronicle of Joseph, my brother. On those rare occasions when I was remembered, it was as a victim. Near the beginning of your holy book, there is a passage that seems to say I was raped and continues with the bloody tale of how my honor was avenged.It's a wonder that any mother ever called a daughter Dinah again. But some did. Maybe you guessed that there was more to me than the voiceless cipher in the text. Maybe you heard it in the music of my name: the first vowel high and clear, as when a mother calls to her child at dusk; the second sound soft, for whispering secrets on pillows. Dee-nah.So begins the The Red Tent -- the fictionalized story of Dinah (whose only mention in the Bible is in Genesis 34). Anita Diamant imagines an entire life for Dinah -- from her birth as the only daughter of Jacob to her life as a woman in the ancient world of the Old Testament.From her childhood among her four \\"mothers\\" -- Leah, Rachel, Zilpah and Bilhah (each were married to Jacob and doted on Dinah as the only girl born among the four women) to the private world of the red tent (where menstruating women gather during \\"that\\" time), Dinah's story provides an insider's view of what it was like to be a woman in biblical times -- including the hazards and politics of sharing a husband. Eventually, the family leaves the land where Dinah was born and to travels to Canaan so that Jacob can reconcile with his brother Esau. It is here where the story of Dinah in the Bible takes place. Her \\"rape\\" triggers the slaughter of an entire town by some of her brothers -- leading to the family's disbanding. Although she doesn't appear again in the Bible, Diamant's story has her fleeing her family and moving to Egypt, where she lives out her life as a midwife -- eventually finding happiness and peace with her family's history.My ThoughtsI read this book as part of my Summer Vacation Reading Challenge. I chose it because I've had this book for years and never read it (thought it would be boring but had gotten it based on my mother's repeated recommendations). Plus I thought it would be interesting to travel to another time and place. I'm so glad I finally broke down and read it because this book was anything but boring. In fact, it was downright fascinating. I love that Diamant had the courage to take a minor figure in the Bible and imagine an entire life for her. At the end of my book, there is a short reading guide in which Diamant talks about some of the choices she made for the book. I think it is worth quoting:Aiding her [Diamant's] work was \\"midrash,\\" the ancient and still vital literary form, which means \\"search\\" or \\"investigation.\\"\\"Historically, the rabbis used this highly imaginative form of storytelling to make sense of the elliptical nature of the Bible -- to explain, for example, why Cain killed Abel. The compressed stories and images in the Bible are rather like photographs. They don't tell us everything we want or need to know. Midrash is the story about what happened before and after the photographic flash.\\"She points out that \\"The Red Tent is not a translation but a work of fiction, its perspective and focus -- by and about the female characters -- distinguishes it from the biblical account in which women are usually peripheral and often totally silent. By giving Dinah a voice and by providing texture and content to the sketchy biblical description, my books is a radical departure from the historical text.\\"I think Diamant did a brilliant job of imagining an entire life for Dinah while still working in the biblical story that many are familiar with. (Sadly, it has been years since I've read the Bible and I mostly remembered the story of her brother Joseph from the musical Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat. My old CCD teachers must be proud!!!) Actually, I was surprised how many names and stories did jog my memory. If nothing else, I wanted to read Genesis over again to fill in the gaps of my knowledge (and I plan on doing so).The book has a definite feminist slant to it. In Diamant's story, the women are kept on the sidelines but manage to exert their will by well-placed whispers, hints and using their feminine wiles. But make no mistake, this was a man's world and a woman had to be smart and strong to survive. The red tent is where the woman's society hums and buzzes -- where they celebrate being a woman, make plans and build community. In a time when many women shared a husband, it was critical to work out these relationships. And in a time when childbirth could be incredibly dangerous, women might need to rely on their \\"sisters\\" to raise their children or save their lives.Diamant chose to make Dinah a midwife, which I think was a fruitful (pun intended!) choice. Imagine living in the ancient world and facing childbirth without a sterile hospital, trained physician or medicine? The stories of the various births throughout the book were both horrifying and fascinating. Dinah and her fellow midwives use a variety of herbs, massages, songs and common-sense techniques to get women through births of all kinds. It made me wonder if any of these techniques are still in use today.Another thing I liked about this book was the whole \\"red tent\\" business. For Dinah and her fellow women, this was a time of togetherness, rest and celebration -- not a solitary almost shameful thing like it is today. I thought that was kind of nice. However, the actual concept of having that \\"time of the month\\" on a bed of straw for three days is rather unappealing when viewed through my modern eyes. In fact, it started me thinking about how bad I would have it if I lived \\"back then.\\" (In fact, I probably wouldn't have survived anyway because I was a \\"breech\\" baby and that kind of birth was usually fatal to both child and mother.) But suppose I had lived. With my bad eyes, I would have barely been able to see anything clearly. And no air conditioning and living in the desert? And having to grow my own food and make my own clothes? And being a bit of property to either my husband or father to be married off or even sold if needed? Nothing like a little view of how our sisters in the past had it to make you appreciate the conveniences of modern life a little more!In short, The Red Tent is a thought-provoking read that brings to life an entire \\"hidden\\" world of the women of the Bible. Diamant has a poetic writing style that suits the material well, and there is a sense of mysticism throughout the book that lends it an almost fanciful, mystical feel at times. Yet the book is firmly rooted in the real world as well -- the hot, dusty world of women who lived in an ancient time and who didn't really have a voice of their own. How lovely of Anita Diamant to come along and give a voice to Dinah -- to help us modern beings learn and think more about those who came before us and the struggles and hardships they faced -- as well as their joys and triumphs.My Final RecommendationI would highly recommend this book as it is thought-provoking, well-written and offers a fully imagined glimpse into what it might have been like to be a woman in Biblical times. Don't make the mistake I did at first and think the subject matter might be dry, boring and staid. I think you'd be surprised at how bawdy (yes, bawdy!), earthy and graphic the lives of these ancient women are. But if the topic of menstruation and other womanly things gives you pause, this might not be the best book for you. Also, if the idea of an author reimagining Biblical stories gets your blood pressure up, this might not be a good choice for you either."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I was unable to enjoy this novel for reasons other than religious.I find the idea quite good but the result is far from satisfactory.Some chapters are literally \\"bloody\\",to find yourself in an \\"Harlequin\\" novel a little further,only violins and champagne missing,the moon is present for obvious reasons.Then there is the Egyptian part of the novel, with too many inaccuracies. Ancient Egypt is not an every-day thema,but if you are using it in your novel,do some research and get the facts rightSome examples:-Jacob is placed by Biblical Scholars between 2000 and 1800 B.C.,this corresponds to the Middle Kingdom (11-12th Dynasties)-Southern Kings on the throne in Thebes.Dinah goes to live with Benia in the Valley of the Kings-wrong -the Western shore was used as Royal Burial ground only from the New Kingdom onwards(1540-1070). This is like having Henri XIII visiting President Roosevelt.The name Valley of Kings was invented in the 20th Century, its old name being 'The great Field\\".The same time-line applies to the occupation of the workers village at Deir al Madinah.Dinah's son becomes Vizier of Kush:There was only one Vizier during this period and Kush(part of Upper-Sudan) became Egyptian 350 Years later.Dinah is called urgently to deliver a baby in \\"On\\"(today's Heliopolis-Cairo) exactly 680 Kms North of Thebes(Luxor).Hopefully the baby was not in a hurry.The children's hairdo called \\"sidelock\\" only applies to Princes and God-Children nobody else.Dinah's mother-in-law is the daughter of a King's-Scribe,this is a very exalted position,she could not have been allowed to marry a petty King of Shechem,if at all only another \\"Great King\\"(Hittite)would have been permitted. Egyptians were very xenophobic and would not even eat with foreigners.From this period date the 1st 'Execration Texts\\"- pots were ritually broken with the names of foreign Cities or Kings on it- thus magically annihilating their power.These are some of the most flagrant mistakes.As an Egyptologist and Archeologist I was unable to oversee these errors,They are fundamental-knowledge and not far-fetched.The novel could have been good but the writer fell short of making it so."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Diamant actually had me until she started cribbing way too much from Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat for this re-imagining of the Biblical rape of Dinah in the Book of Genesis. She ravages Jewish history in order to play on the cuddly notion that menstruation (I'm sorry, \\"our moon time\\") is a spiritual event that binds all women together - making Diamant a perennial book club favorite among women to whom I do not wish to be bound (shared biological functions notwithstanding). It doesn't help that Diamant keeps forgetting Dinah is telling her story in the first person, which she continues to do even when Dinah is not, technically, in the scene. The fourth wall breaks most painfully when Dinah describes her own death."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This is a book every woman should read.

I teach an adult Bible study group and we are just completing a 6-month study of the book of Genesis. While we were reading the story of Jacob and his twelve sons and one daughter, I decided to buy this book.As a Christian, I have great interest in our Judeo heritage; and, as a tolerant person, I had no problem at all with the embellishment of a story that is barely touched upon in the Bible. Gaining a glimpse inside the red tent moved me in ways that surprise me.I was absolutely mesmerized. The Dinah Ms. Daimant introduced me to is a woman of compassion, curiosity, passion and determination. From the tragedies of her life emerges a person of tremendous grit. Merely surviving was a great feat for women in early Biblical times...to survive and triumph over adversity was almost unheard of for women. I can only hope that the &quot;real&quot; Dinah found some kind of happiness in her life.Don't read this if you can't tolerate &quot;perspective&quot; of a Bible story. I still want to weep when I remember passages in Daimant's story of Dinah and her mothers. I can't begin to describe the emotional response I had to this book. I hated to see it end.Dinah's message to her readers at the end is gripping! Read for yourself as quickly as you can find the book."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This novel blew me away, and I think that most people would react that way. However, if a very loose interpretation of the Bible, or someone taking liberties with Biblical history will offend you, do not read this book. Otherwise, read on. The Red Tent is the story of Dinah, Jacob's daughter. She narrates in a beautiful poetic voice that is all at once a familiar friend. Her story, while heartbreaking, is also a celebration of what it is to be female. She begins telling us about what happened before she was born, how Jacob came to have four wives, how his sons were born. Her focus is on the wives and their tradition of abiding in the red tent during menses. While they are there, the woman bond and after she, the only surviving daughter of Jacob, is born, she spends much time there with her mothers, learning female traditions of midwifery. Her story is familiar, yet not the same as in the good book. Diamante's story is breathtakingly imaginative. Leah and her sisters come alive in this novel. While reading it, you are in the red tent. The characters are completely believable, the story utterly compelling. We follow Dinah throughout her life. Her pain and her pleasures come alive. I highly recommend this book. Don't be intimidated by the Biblical history aspect of it. This novel comes alive from the first page and you won't be able to put it down."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This book appealed to me on several levels. First, it is a great story- well written and engaging. It chronicles the life of the family of Jacob, focusing on the women of the family and told through the voice and eyes of Dinah, the one daughter amoung Jacob's ten sons. She tells of her life's story as well as the story of her four mothers, Jacob's wives. There is tragedy as well as hapiness, and even though I finished reading the book several days ago I can't stop thinking about it.On the next level, I enjoyed this book because it made me rethink and evaluate the biblical stories that I grew up with. Here is a case where I though I knew the story, and yet The Red Tent made me question the old tale. Were these men really heros? Were they really righteous men? Was there more to the story?The passage in the bible that mentions Dinah is very small, and yet now she is a character that is more vivid in my mind than her famous brothers and father.I recommend this book to anyone looking for a wonderful book. I recommend this book to all women, and I recommend this book to anyone who might want to see a different view on the bibilical stories."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Clearly this is not a book for Bible literalists. From a brief chapter in Genesis, Ms. Diamant constructs a story about the life of Dinah, the only daughter of Jacob (son of Isaac and grandson of Abraham) that is much more rich and detailed than its biblical telling. She approaches her subject much like a historian intent on finding a new perspective to a much told tale, in this case it's a much more feminine viewpoint that gives this particular novel its vibrancy. The title refers to the tent used by the women of biblical times during their monthly cycles, a place forbidden to men where the lines of status are blurred and the conversation more personal.If Dinah receives short shrift in the Bible (which she does) it is likely due to the fact that the original writings (and subsequent translations) were masculine in their orientation; call it a gender-based variation on the &quot;history is written by the conquerors&quot; theory. If you relate the individual events or milestones here in simplistic terms, the story is in basic point by point agreement with the Bible -- Jacob takes four wives, they give him 12 sons and a daughter, the daughter is the catalyst for a violent incident, son Joseph is sold to the Egyptians and ultimately becomes a man of power. Here, Anita Diamant moves the focus from the men to the women, with Dinah becoming the first person narrator. The descriptions of people and events then are filtered through her perceptions and related to the reader accordingly. For example, Joseph is not the son who is horribly wronged and with the help of God rebuilds his life to a position of great power. Here he is the younger brother of Dinah, whose estrangement from her family occurs well before his. When she encounters him again, much later in life, she's completely unware of the trials that have formed him and perceives him as perhaps more arrogant and aloof.Some might be inclined to dismiss The Red Tent as a &quot;biblical chick book.&quot; First and foremost, this is a very well written novel. Under the pen of a Rabbi this might have taken the form of midrash (a homily on a scriptural passage that serves as an embellishment of the scriptural narrative) a more conclusive interpretation of its lessons; but I think that Ms. Diamant's purpose is more to make us think and discuss rather than to instruct. If that's true, she succeeds admirably!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"The book is written from the voice of Dinah who was the daughter of Jacob and Leah and it tells her history and the relationships and stories of the women in the bible, adding flesh and voice to the names we all know. It is a captivating story because it is both familiar from the standpoint of being a woman and current in terms of the difficulties of family relationships, but mainly because it gives life to a whole other story often lost in most bible stories which center on the men and are often limited to the major accomplishments and miracles that occurred. The Red Tent, in essence, reads between the lines of the bible and weaves a story of day to day life for the individuals that we know of - Abraham, Jacob, Rachel, Issac, Leah - a story that is wrought with love, deception, sexuality, murder, betrayl, empowerment, mystery, miracles, history and triumph. Given these universal themes and the timelessness of the stories, The Red Tent is a book that is equally written for men as it is for women. The title comes from the name of the tent where women go when they are menstruating for three days, away from the men. The time in the red tent was a sacred, empowering and beautiful time for the women where they would discuss matters including husbands and lovers, rivalries, sex, family history, gods and goddesses, gossip and where girls entering womanhood would learn how to be a woman. It is beautiful to see a book that elevates what is often discussed in biblical history or in history in general as a taboo to the status of sacredness. This is a trmendous book recommended to all."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I ordered this book based on the reviews and I found it to be an excellent novel. It takes you back in time where women shared their stories, where mothers taught their daughters the reality of life. The story was told by Dinah Jacob's only daughter among ten sons by four mothers. Her tales were filled with laughter and sadness, I actually wept as I shared her tragedy. Although this novel was fiction, it was well written I never wanted the story to finish. Anita Diamant work is outstanding."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I began this book - our book club's next book - with hesitation. It's set in biblical times and revolves around biblical characters (one in particular) and my knowledge of the bible is microscopic. Yet, as Dinah's story (and the story of her &quot;mothers&quot;) unfolded, I found I could not put this book down. I am sure there are historical inaccuracies, but the story, which was set 2000+ years ago, seemed REAL to me. Her story, and the stories of her mothers, cousins, friends and lovers transcended time and touched my heart. What a wonderful novel; a story of our time and of our past."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This is one of the best books I have ever read! Technically, it's the story of Dinah, the daughter of Jacob and Leah. The story is based on the old Testament, but it's fictionalized, told from Dinah's perspective. It's a fascinating story about families, love, and life, and it's completely relevant to the present as well. I can't describe how much I enjoyed reading this book, and how I hated to reach the end!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I read about this book on a review board and decided to pick it up. I am very happy that I did.Being raised in a &quot;bible thumping,cultist atmosphere&quot; I had heard all of these Old Testament stories before. I was so pleasantly surprised to read a fictional story like Diamant's told from a female perspective as opposed to the male dominated fiction of the Bible. The strength that the women in the Red Tent gathered from each other and the bonding that took place was truly inspiring. It's also nice to read about some of the other religions/beliefs that were celebrated during this time in history that were not all Jewish/Christian. Whether religious zealots believe it or not, the worship of the goddess was in full swing in parallel with Judaism and worshipping different deities also was commonplace. This book gives us a window into how things might have been during this time in history and does a beautiful job of leaving out all of the &quot;Jacobs Ladder and wrestling with an angel&quot; mumbo jumbo.I do not agree with a reviewers comment intimating that Diamant had studied/stolen the ideas of midwifery from Laurel Thatcher Ulrich. Any person who studies women's &quot;place/role&quot; in history knows that a midwife played a very intricate part in society and that childbirth has always been a major factor in the bonding of women. I doubt that Diamant had to get this information from &quot;Midwives Tale&quot;. She could have gotten it in any social history book that concentrated on Women in Society.Kudos to Diamant for having the guts to tell a &quot;bible&quot; story in a different light. My only hope is that she might tell us about Bathsheba, Delilah or Esther next. What about Deborah? I will be looking forward to it!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Having a Christian background, I was well versed in the biblical narrative that is the background for this book. I have read much in the reviews about how anti-Christian this book is. I did not find it to be so. It is FICTION, and pretends to be nothing else. It was not written to replace the biblical account. I found that knowing the characters from the Bible made this more enjoyable. It gave me a reference point for what may have been incorrect, as well as some never-before-considered insight into what might have been. For instance, it is not safe to assume that when Jacob appeared on the scene, that Leah, Rachel and their families immediately gave up their pagan gods. Even the Bible includes the account of Rachel stealing her father's household Gods when they parted company. They may or may not have changed their devotion as life went on, but they certainly must have had a different point of reference than someone who was raised knowing the God of Abraham.The women in this story do come off as second-class citizens in society. This may offend modern sensibilities, but face it - that was the way it was in that time period. The book brought the Biblical story to life - not in every detail, but in general terms of living as one of several wives in a nomadic culture; of life spent as a family usually quite separate from the rest of society.The author has woven a wonderful tale, giving life to names that are only mentioned in the Bible in relation to their husband Jacob.I have loaned this book to 3 different friends, who all loved it."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This is an amazing book. I was skeptical at first, expecting the sweet lulling quality of the first hundred pages or so to set the tone for a colorful if not quite worthwhile read. In fact, I was halfway through the book before the action kicked in. When it finally did it was nonstop. Anita Diamant proves herself a skilled story teller indeed, carrying the reader along from a dusty desert caravan to the smooth cool stones of an ancient Egyptian street. Along the way we learn about Dinah, the life she led, the people she meets, the way love in the end shaped the very mosaic of her life. I appreciate the complexity of emotions and character this book explores and the way that it veers off the beaten path of predictable romance and into the world of literature worth reading. Very satisfying, indeed."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This is an amazing book.

It is so beautifully written, I felt the earth and smelled the straw as I was transported to Canaan and Egypt. I just cannot give enough praise for this book, I would have chosen more stars if there was an option to! I whole-heartedly recommend this to anyone, female and male alike."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This book was incredibly easy to read. It takes a character of little note in the Bible - Dinah - and imagines what her life would have been like. It is an imaginative book in a number of ways. First, it is a great story. It traces Dinah's life from before she was born until her death. I got very involved in her life and was anxious to follow her through her journey. Second, it takes the bare-bones recitation of the events in her life and the life of her family and weaves them into a tale. The book does what few others have tried to do - present the world of biblical times through the eyes of a woman. If you are super-sensitive about the Bible, you may not want to read this book. Some of the great characters of the Bible - Jacob, Isaac, Rebecca, Levi - come out looking less like the heros we know and more like, well, human beings.An easy, enjoyable read. Ultimately, this is the story of a woman. We learn with her, grow with her, mourn with her, and miss her when she leaves us."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Even though it took too much concentrating to keep the names straight sometimes, this was a great read. I can't believe it took me 2 years to discover this book!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"There are truly no words to describe this book. I was moved to tears almost daily, and I refused to read more than one chapter a day for the fear of finishing too quickly. The book brings you inside its pages like none I have ever encountered before. From beginning to end, you feel as though Dinah is right there next to you, feet in the river, telling you her life's story. Diamant is able to make her readers feel as though they have made a new friend, a cherished friend, in her main character. Like Dinah herself, I think that this book will have a very important place in history."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"It was an easy read for most of it, but got slow at the end when they went to Egypt. I enjoyed keeping up with the story of Jacob and Laban and referred to the Bible to examine the differences. I did get tired of the constant references to bleeding as reviewer Marguerite Salen stated. Maybe I am off base there. For the most part this was a book written by a woman for women."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This book quickly became tiresome as one realized that the main action in the book revolved around the bodily functions of the tribal women - bleeding, breeding and birthing. In the first half of the book all of the men, with the exception of one lone husband who didn't last long, were cruel beasts who had no use for their women (other than sex and food) and no interest in their female children. Is one to draw the conclusion from this book that the men of the old testament were self-centered brutes who treated women as chattel? I think so."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I judge a book by how much I care for the characters. Although the first chapter was difficult for me to get into, I stuck with it, and really ended up caring about the Diana. The things she experienced, I could relate to her feelings as they occurred. I felt that every event was within the realm of possibility, and could have really happened. As the book takes us thru all the wives and concubines and minor characters, I even cared about what happened with some of them. This book didnt have a lot of melodrama, but it was a book about Diana's life, and her growth as a person. I liked that Diana was a person with some brains, and that she had a perspective that was authentic. I like that everything in her life wasn't roses, nor hellacious. Even months after reading this book, and reading other books, I still can remember Diana quite well."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I am not a spiritual person. I received this book as a present. i started reading it and couldn't put it down. It really gives you a good description of women in Biblical times without getting all caught up in the &quot;history&quot; of the actual Bible. Every turn of events was surprising and shocking. I did not want it to end. I wanted to continue the story of Dinah. I then gave it to a friend and she called me to tell me she is totally completely caught up in this story and she cannot work but to read this book! Thanks for a great read."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I absolutely loved this book! This tale spoke to the woman inside of me that longs for the intimate relationship of a close circle of women. I loved the characters of the book - Leah, Rachel, Zilpah, Bilhah, and Meryt. And I disagree with the reader that stated that Dinah herself is a minor character in relation to the others. She is the others. They all were mother to her and therefore helped to create the strong woman that she was. I love the prologue which is imparted by Dinah and gives her motivation for telling her story. Just from reading the prologue I fell in love with Dinah and wanted to know her story.Diamant tells a wonderful tale. Though fiction, the story is well grounded and so rich in detail the reader willingly reads it as gospel. This book is a wonderful journey for a woman. In this transient society of ours, it is difficult, if not impossible, to form and nurture such intimate relationships with other women. Diamant describes a time when women bonded together in ceremony and sympathy during those events that only women can understand. The onset of a girl's first menses was celebrated and served as the reckoning of womanhood. Each month during the time of their blood, the women congregated together in the red tent for three days and doted on one another. They shared stories and goddesses and dreams while they oiled and massaged each other. Diamant brings the reader to this tent and to a time when sisterhood prevailed in the face of many obstacles. It is reasonable that the story was lost for as Dinah says in the prologue &quot;The chain connecting mother to daughter was broken and the word passed to the keeping of men, who had no way of knowing.&quot;Whether the reader simply wants to feel revivified as a woman or is on a quest (such as myself) for her own spirituality, this book is a must read. It is an elixir for the feminine soul."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"The Red Tent is one of the best historical novels I've read in something like 10 years. I don't think its as good as Mists of Avalon, by MZB: Actually, I think its much better, because it is more daring in the revisionist, feminist stance it takes. And yet, it does what only the best novels in any genre do, it draws the reader deftly into a different reality, a 'dream' making that dream live and breathe. If I were going to make a positive comparisons it would be to the fictional explorations of ancient Greek life, myth,and legend by Mary Renault and to the more recent fantasy works of Guy Gavriel Kay, because of the clear, vividly painted prose images all three of these novelists evoke. I have recommended this book to many of my friends, and would to almost any lover of historical fiction, especially those who are open to seeing a 'familiar' story in a new way. Ms Diamant draws us into an understanding of the 'foremothers' of Judaism, of how women's lives were both separate from men's in that culture,and of how deeply they were interwoven. I am in her debt for that understanding, and for the very enjoyable read she gave me in the process."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I must admit, this book is not for everyone. However, if you enjoy reading about women's life-stories, coming-of-age tales, or the bible from a &quot;real-person's&quot; point of view...this is an excellent saga of one fairly mysterious figure mentioned only briefly in the old testament as a person of tragedy. We know so little of Dinah from the OT...but Anita Diamant brings her flesh, blood, and soul in a believable manner. I don't believe that the average male would enjoy this book, though, since its main focus is the cycle of women's lives involving the red tent, the place women reside when subject to the consequences of being the sex responsible for bringing forth life. Usually deemed unclean in OT translations, this book shows a special significance and sisterhood that likely bound women together to survive such a gratifying, and often dangerous, existence. However the message is not tedious...the book also follows Dinah's long life after the red tent and her tragedy in the OT."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"The Red Tent takes an interesting look at a real story from the Bible, and weaves threads of fiction into it, to give a possible woman's perspective into the life of Biblical figure, Dinah. You don't have to know the Bible inside and out, or really at all, to appreciate this novel. While the story is based on information from the Bible, the novel tells a bigger story about what it was like to live as a woman during this era. Like a balancing scale, the life of a woman seems to be a blend of subserviance as well as a celebration of one's gender. While women were responsible for catering to the men's needs, they also rejoiced in The Red Tent, a place they would go to during their monthly cycle, to bond and dote on one another.I was struck with how strong these women were and had an appreciation for how much easier it is to be a woman in today's world. The physical experience of childbirth during these times was so intense..without modern medicine death more prominent. The spirit that existed in this community of women was amazing in how they cared for and supported one another.The novel was not action packed or fast moving, but what it does offer is a look at not only what it was like to live during this time and the obstacles that these women faced, but also explores the depths of mother/daughter relationships. It reminds us of the legacy that we can all leave behind and the mark we can leave here on earth long after we are gone."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This was one of those books that I absolutely could not put down -- literally. My copy is permanently stained with fabric softner, toothpaste, and Diet Coke, as I carried it around with me all day Sunday.As other reviewers have mentioned, this is a biblical fiction based on the life of Dinah, daughter of the legendary Jacob. Written from the perspective of Dinah, it details the lives of the women (specifically her mother, aunts, and friends) who shaped her life. The &quot;Red Tent&quot; refers to the structure women would retire to during their menstruation in which they would rest, recouperate, share stories, and celebrate life/birth/death. This structure was considered sacred, as only women of child-rearing age were permitted to enter. In this novel, this red tent becomes the center of Dinah's life and her source of joy and strength.This is a rare book. Never have I read such a dazzling portrayal of biblical woman. Additionally, it is equally rare to read such a celebration of birth and the cycle of life in a beautifully-crafted piece such as this.Admittedly, my knowledge of religious history is somewhat limited. Therefore, I am taking it for granted that the facts cited by Diamant (the author) are true. However, it appeared to me that she was incredibly knowledgeable about the subject matter. Regardless, Diamant is an incredible storyteller and should be lauded as such. I can't wait to add more of her volumes to my collection."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"_The Red Tent_ is a captivating portrait of life in the ancient Middle East, before the advent of Judaism, Christianity and Islam. It's not &quot;the women's Bible,&quot; but it is an interesting counter-story. The characters in _The Red Tent_ are drawn from Bible stories but Diamant's retelling of the story of Dinah and the rest of Jacob's family breathes life into all the characters (especially the women). Diamant also dramatically fleshes out and occasionally contradicts the biblical version of the story. Sacrilege? Maybe, but absolutely fascinating, inspiring, entertaining sacrilege. The exoticness of Dinah's culture is compelling of itself; the strict division of men's labor from women's, the celebration of the menses, the observance of religion in daily life, but _The Red Tent_ is not all atmosphere; the story is full of deception, greed, betrayal, and all sorts of action. I'm not sure men would enjoy this book; in fact, one of my first thoughts on finishing it was &quot;what a shame I can't share this with my male friends.&quot; Am I wrong? Let me know, gentlemen. I'd love to hear from a guy who really liked this extraordinary book."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"this book is for you! Even though the plot is inspired from the old testiment I can imagine that the reading would go past the comfort level of most conservative, religious types. I work at a University Library so I read a lot of books and I usually don't buy books. However, I will buy this book! It is a &quot;must have&quot; in my opinion. My 15 year old daughter and I both read it and loved it. As I said, I'm not too sure that people who are attached to their religious doctrine would be able to handle this book. However those of you who have a deep respect for women, the mystery traditions, midwifery and consider themselves open-minded, you will really love this! It is one of the most well written books I have ever read. I only wish there were more books written about biblical women with this kind of care and progressive thinking. I think it would heal so many of us. I was very surprised by the people who wrote that the book was too politically correct. I can only say that this opinion may come from fairly conservative types who aren't yet comfortable with the topics that arise through the reading. If you do end up buying this book I do hope you enjoy it as much as I have!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Putting my thoughts about this book into words is quite difficult, but suffice to say that this a riveting, beautifully written story that I did not want to stop reading. Her prose is very compelling, and amazingly economical - I don't know if she normally writes this way, but I found the economy of words to also help transport me to the barreness of the desert in whcih the story takes place. As a book this is just plain wonderful writing that anyone would greatly enjoy experiencing.However, since this is a story of Dinah, a Biblical character, one must also rate this book as a part of the religious tradition, and in that regard, I feel that it works beautifully. Dinah is mentioned but once in the long story of Jacob in Genesis, and her story deserves to be told. Obviously, this is a work of fiction, and is not to be taken as canonical. Dinah's story comes so alive, though, and fills in so much of what is missing from the Bible story (and what is missing in the Bible is the story of the women - interesting how their stories seemingly disappeared over time...). Obviously, also, the religious zealots out there will take issue with this book because they tend to take issue with anything that might challenge their thoughts and cause them to think differently about what might have happened 3500 years ago. While I am sure the Bible is a fairly accurate record of many things that happened, I am sure that in the small details, it has been embellished (or changed through copying errors) in the 3500 years this story has been passed on. Diamant's representation of Jacob and his sons as very human with very human needs/foibles was a welcome take on the typical superman-like representations of these guys. I don' think that Diamant has re-written the Biblical story, but she has taken all those holes and unsaid things, and filled them in with narrative of what might have been, and certainly could have been.What is so compelling for me in the story, besides my absolute fascination with lives in Canaanite and pre-Canaanite times, is the story of women - not just of the women in the story, but this really becomes a story of what it was like to be a woman in that era, when countless gods were worshiped, when nature was something to pay attention to, when childbirth was more dangerous and natural, in a fairly nomadic and earth-based style of living. In the red tent, the gathering place of Rachel and Leah and the other women for the three days every month, the stories of the women were passed from one generation to the next; the women were free to be truly female, and to talk about their own fears and joys as they celebrate together the constant ebb and flow of life/death/rebirth. Dinah becomes a mid-wife, and a darn good one, and Diamant has gorgeous writing about the delivering of babies - the pain, the mess, the screaming, the joy of new babies, and the sorrow of babies delivered dead, and of mothers who die in childbirth. And yet life goes on, as it always does, and people move on. The red tent, in the book, becomes of the symbol (for us) of what can happen if women have a place to share and be safe, and celebrate their bodies with one another - directly opposed to what we have today, I believe, in which women don't have chance or or not allowed or simply don't feel like sharing, caring, and celebrating the gift of life-giving which they carry in them. I hope this book will serve to drive a new direction, perhaps especially within the chruch, in which women can be free to truly talk about and celebrate and not have to be ashamed about their menstruation, and in which, perhaps, the lives of girls can be celebrated as they enter into womanhood.I also love all the twists and turns that the plot takes - the book concentrates on Dinah, of course, but after she leaves Jacob's tribe, her life comes into contact with the tribe or peolpe she knew before. So we get Dniah's story for a while, and then a retelling of a situation that is in the Biblical story. I hope that we will have more books about the lives of the women in the Bible. Certainly their stories were told at one time - Phyllis Trible taught us that in seminary - and it would be nice to reclaim them from the male-dominated society that slowly wiped those stories out, or didn't feel them sufficiently important to include."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This is a brilliant book that celebrates the power and fulfillment that can be realized through the qualities and skills traditionally ascribed to women and therefore dismissed as having little or no impact in history or on the advancement of the world's societies. Qualities like the willingness to serve and the desire to nurture. Skills like the myriad &quot;home arts&quot; from the food and textile sciences to agriculture and architecture. Mid-wifery as well as the study and application of herbs - the foundation of all medicine - were almost exclusively the crafts of women. Yet &quot;history&quot; has been defined and chronicled by men. The early scriptures were written by men while women were chattel and then edited and censored quite extensively by men centuries later - while women were still chattel - to create the King James Bible. This is not to say that the stories of the Bible are untrue or unworthy, but that often they are told from a limited perspective offering one dimensional characters learning and teaching anglicized lessons.Diamant's research, which is extensive and credible, is conveyed in a story that is enjoyable, educational, and inspiring. Read The Red Tent to learn about an ancient culture with its fascinating customs and superstitions that gave birth to Judaism and Christianity; read it to realize the power of sisterhood and the immortality of motherhood; and read it for this: All popularly accepted history should be taken with a grain - if not a great big chunk - of salt."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This was an excellent book. It was interesting to read this book in conjunction with the text of the bible. While the author seemed to embelish some parts of the true story concerning Jacob and his wives, the embelishments really brought this story to life. I cried all the way through the ending and read the last paragraph at least five times. In some ways I really identify with Dinah's story.I hope the author writes more stories like this. This book really re-ignited my love for reading and my abhorrence for television.

Dinah's story is told with the honesty of women who have suffered and triumphed.

I hope Ms. Diamant continues to write these stories for women of all time."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Anita Diamant's novel, a retelling of parts of the book of Genesis, evokes the world of ancient Canaan and Egypt in realistic terms. In the course of the biography, narrator Dinah tells of the hearts and life-cycles of women with undying resonance. This book has something for any interest - the studies of history, religion, relations between the sexes, or even just finely crafted sentences and stories - but more than this, the book helped me to understand the life of a woman in a way I never did before. I am going to share this book with all the women in my life, certain that my mother will cry over Dinah's fortunes and misfortunes. This work should be on everyone's bookshelf, revisited often and often, and well worn."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This is a story about a minor character from the book of Genesis in the Old Testament, Dinah, the only daughter of Jacob. BORING is what I initially thought. However, I couldn't be more mistaken! From the first page, the author drew me in, with stories about Dinah's four mothers and twelve brothers. Let's face it, any situation where a man is married to two sisters (and their handmaids) is going to be interesting!One aspect of this novel which struck me most, is the depth of characters. When one hears biblical stories, people are depicted as extremely simple, hardened, tough, insensitive, very callous. Here, the author beautifully humanizes many of the characters, giving them so much depth and complexity, which makes the relationships so touching. There's joy, warmth, desire, anger, heartbreaking despair, throughout this story. Diamant brings alive the relationships between Jacob and his wives, Dinah and her aunties, brothers and her friends in particular.Most of all, I was very surprised to see how powerful the women are in this novel. They're very close, helping each other, supporting each other through all of the major rites of passages in their lives; birth, first menstruation, marriage, motherhood, death. What's more is that each of these passages are celebrated in ritual, and highly regarded as a most important part of life. It's inspiring to see that women supported each other this way.The way Diamant weaves her story into characters' lives as we know them in the Bible is fascinating. The Red Tent gives its own insights and histories into the major events from the Bible, such Joseph's falling into slavery and imprisonment, the reasons why Jacob changed his name to Israel, and of course, the slaughter of the men of Shechem, among other incidents. Again, I'm amazed at what research and imagination this author drew upon to tell such a captivating story.It seems as though this novel was really written for women, or that women would probably get the most enjoyment out of it. However, I think that it would be an insightful read for men as well. And although it moves a little more slowly than other historical fiction, I still highly recommend this novel...it's a wonderful, exciting and tearful story."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I recently finished Anita Diamant's &quot;The Red Tent&quot;, and I found the book extremely fascinating. It's the story of Dinah and her mothers, the wives of Jacob in the Old Testament. The book's premise is basically that the lives of these women were all but ignored in the Bible, and so Diamant relates the biblical stories from their point of view.The first half of the book deals primarily with descriptions of what daily life was like for women during those times. This was by far the most interesting part of the book for me. I was totally engrossed in learning about the roles that were available for women at that time, and the ways in which each of the main characters managed to find an appropriate role for herself. I also really loved the depictions of female strength and wisdom, and the way women treated their bodies as sacred and really seemed to love and worship the functions of their bodies, not merely for reproduction but also for pleasure. The idea of all the women retiring to the red tent to separate themselves from the men and celebrate their menstruation together resonated very strongly with me, and seemed like such a powerful alternative to the way that our society insists that the body and eveything associated with it is disgusting and should be kept hidden.Unfortunately, the second half of the book was not as enjoyable as the first. In the second half of the book, Diamant moved away from the depiction of day to day events, and began relating Dinah's own story. Dinah's life is full of drama--love, hate, betrayal, violence... It made for interesting reading, but for the most part it was drama that I could have done without. I would have preferred to go on reading reading forever about the five women who were central to the story; their individual stories, their relationships with each other, their time in the red tent together, their various pregnancies and births... I really responded very deeply to the traditions of their lives, and didn't like all the upheaval that occurred in the later part of the narrative.But even if I didn't like the second half, it's still a very good book. It's not an extremely feminist book, although it may sound that way. Nonetheless, it's probably a book that every woman should read, just because it presents such a wonderful notion of women supporting each other, learning from each other, and valuing each other's wisdom. I wish that we still had something like the red tent nowadays, and could more publicly acknowledge the significance of women's relationships with each other and with our bodies."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I first heard of this book when I heard that the Rabbi at our synagogue would be conducting a discussion on Ms. Diamante's novel. My first thought was to mentally prepare myself of some dry account of Biblical times. Boy was I ever wrong!This was a totally entertaining first-person narrative of the life of Dinah, Jacob's only and basically forgotten daughter - she is only mentioned in the Bible in terms of being a victim. Her story, as much influenced by her mother(s)and the women of the red tent as it was by her famous brothers and father, begins when Jacob first entered the world of Laban and his daughters and follows Dinah through her life, through her joys and tribulations. This sudden interest in women in the Bible in literature is refreshing since women are generally absent from the Bible!I have to admit that this was one of the best books I had read in a long time and I found that I didn't want it to end! A must read for all (except if you are pregnant with your first child, in which case you may want to wait - a part of the narrative describes Dinah's experiences in midwifery and therefore there are many graphic descriptions of childbirth during Biblical times)"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"THE RED TENT is a wonderfully rich and imaginative novel, set firmly in the ancient culture of Canaan where Jacob, the son of Isaac, took up residence with his four wives during his exile. Narrated by Dinah, the daughter of Jacob and Leah, this story is not a re-telling of the tales so familiar to Jews and Christians, but rather it explores what is not told: the story of the women. As the only daughter raised by Jacob's wives, Dinah is the heir to her mothers' stories and knowledge. The sequestering of women, both in daily chores and during their menses, gives rise to a sisterhood and a subculture unknown to the men, and the intimacy shared in the red tent is what shapes and sustains Dinah, even after a tragic event rips her from it. Both wistful and celebratory in tone, this novel has real literary magic.Diamant uses a dreamy, spiritual language that draws the reader into the heart of the story. Jacob's wives are clearly drawn, as individuals and as sisters, rivals and friends. The male characters, while distinct, are not as fully realized, mostly because they reside outside the realm of women. Although I cannot attest to the accuracy of ancient cultural detail, Diamant has convinced me that she has researched her subject matter well, supplying details that root her story in its time.Readers should not expect to find confirmation of Judaic-Christian beliefs: the religion here is one of multiple gods and goddesses, the beliefs of the women Jacob married but not his own. Some might even find it sacrilegious in its re-interpretation and expansion of Biblical events, which form only the framework around which this novel is built. Unless you are easily offended by such approaches, don't turn away from the book because of this. Diamant has painted an entire world that should not be missed.Like the red tent, this book might drive away men, but women will find its riches rewarding. I highly recommend it for serious and casual readers alike."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I was at the library and picked this up off the new books shelf along with about 4 other books - I had some time to kill before the bus came. At the table I began to read the jackets again. The word 'biblical' jumped out at me and I was about to close it. I would say I know the bare minimum of the contents in the bible - or rather it was limited to the things we have seen movies made of, but I won't go there. I had the cover just about closed and I pondered a bit at the cover. It reminded me of the numerous painting of Jesus on the cross looking up, except there is no cross....the red tent, the red robe she was wearing, the expression on the face... I was judging the book by the cover...and I began to read the first chapter. I missed my bus and had to wait another hour, but that was alright. Told from the female point of view, it made me smile and cry but most of all it made me admire and respect the women, the mothers I know all the more. To my mother, my grandmother, and all the mothers who have come before...Thank you."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I genuinely liked this book. Although some of it felt like a 1990's woman version of what might have happened in Biblical times and not entirely in keeping with the era, the story was well-told and kept my interest. It did make me want to learn more about the Bible, though, which was important."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I thought that the primary innovation of this book - telling the &quot;inversion&quot; of the story of the sons of Jacob by focusing on the role of the women left out of the Biblical account - was fascinating and well-done. However, Dinah and her four mothers were characterized only through the situations they found themselves in and their reactions to them. It reminded me of a newpaper account as opposed to a novel - I had hoped for more lavish characterization. I realize that this was an intentional style adopted by the author to echo the biblical account, however, it ended up being rather dry as a result. Disappointing only in so far as it failed to meet its potential. The basic premise of the book and execution of the plot were fabulous."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I have been enjoying bookclub membership for over 5 years in MD, DC and now OH. For author Anita Diamant, this is the book selection for your group. Guaranteed to spark conversation!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I often take books from my mother's book shelf. She's an avid reader and has superb taste in books. I over looked this book on her shelf for years. It just didn't seem to be my kind of book. I was finally talked into giving it a try and boy am I glad! This book is beautiful! You have to pay some attention to all the names. It's not the easiest read I've ever had, but it's not the hardest either, and well worth it! There is a family tree of all the names you need to know in the front of the book so don't let that keep you from reading this wonderful book. I highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This was my favorite book when I finished it more than two years ago, and it remains my favorite book to this day. I carry a copy of it in my car and I frequently re-read it. It has been a constant inspiration to me.\\"The Red Tent\\" contains some of the most beautiful language I've ever read. It turns Rachel, Leah, Bilhah, Zilpah, and Dinah into living, breathing people, with real passions and desires that were left out of the Biblical telling of this story."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Anita Diamant is a great story teller, but she doesn't just tell a story in this book, she recreates a world. I love to read Scripture, but there is very little, if anything, in the entire Bible that is told from a woman's point of view. The Red Tent gives a voice to Dinah, who is absolutely voiceless in the Bible, where her story is told by others. The author draws compelling, flawed characters who are a joy to get to know. And her take on the competition between Leah and Rachel, and the different roles they fill in Jacob's life, is totally believable.Her depiction of the events in Dinah's life are vastly different from the Biblical version. That's why they call it fiction."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I just finished reading the Red Tent and I can't stop talking about it. I savoured every page and as I came to the end I was sad to part with the richness of life that existed so many years ago. I don't think I have ever read a book where I was so connected to women who lived such different lives from my own. I recommend this to any woman or man who want a glimpse into women's lives from biblical times and understanding in to women today."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This is a truly masterful book that embodies the role that women might have played in biblical times. The story of Dinah and her aunts is absolutely magical. It show that true bonds that women can have with eachother through childbirth and sisterhood. When reading The Red Tent, one really feels like the characters come alive and you have known them their entire lives. Anita Diamant has done an excellent job capturing the reader and taking them on a marvelous journey with Dinah. A must read for women!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I really did not think I was going to like this book but, I was very pleasantly surprised. I finished it in three sittings in two days and I would have finished in one if I had that much time at once. I don't think this is a book many men would enjoy but, I wouldn't classify it strictly a romance novel. I think it it important to know that this is fiction as some of the Christian readers were offended and thought they were getting something Biblically accurate. It is a beautiful story, well written that left me with happy and sad tears."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This book was recommended to me by a book club friend, and I purchased it right away. However, it took me some months to actually sit down and read it, because I to begin with, felt that the story did not sound like anything I would like to read. How wrong I was!The story about Laban's 4 daughters and Dinah, \\"their\\" daughter, is an amazing story about growing up, becoming a woman, about love and hate, about men and women, about sex, child births, triupmhs and tragedies. This book has it all, and even though it is build on biblical characters, it doesn't become \\"too biblical\\" in any way. The story is well developed and the characters easy to associate with, even though the story takes place more than 1000 years ago.It is definitely a woman-book, and I am not sure all men will enjoy it as much as the women will.I would have rated this 5 if the last part of the book had moved just a bit quicker and if the editors had cut maybe 20 or 30 pages out, but all in all this is a hughly recommendable book."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I appreciate a work that reflects a solid understanding of the time in which it is set, as well as a reliable familiarity with the daily life and culture of the subject. Such is The Red Tent. But it's not a history book, it's fiction - and as such, it successfully weaves a fantastic and engaging tale into its historical backdrop. It's a captivating epic with an authentic woman's voice. Although this piece is set during a biblical time, do not expect religious dogma or a &quot;bible story&quot; - it is meaty historical fiction, both plausible and gripping. I was thoroughly engrossed from the first paragraph to the last. If you're looking for something to lose yourself in, read the Red Tent."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"One of the most compelling books I have ever read. I could hardly put it down!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Great book. I'm a fan of historical fiction and this was no disappointment. Kinda reminds me of _The Mists of Avalon_ in its feminist retelling of an old tale."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I LOVED this book. I don't know when I enjoyed a book more. For someone who is NOT religious this is just terrifis storytelling. I enjoyed the fact that the book as a good pace to it, it doesn't rush at the end to &quot;tidy&quot; up the ending. Dinah is a fascinating character, as is her whole family. If you enjoy a good tale, read The Red Tent!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This is a wonderful book that everyone who loves to read should enjoy! My advice is to buy and read it without any pretense. It is masterfully written and takes the reader into a time unknown to us all. I felt I was there and could feel the pain,joy, struggle and suffering of the main character. Unlike so many novels today it does not keep you going in circles to find the story. It is one of the best books I have ever read."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Before I knew it...100 pages had gone by. Definately in my top 10 list of favorites!!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"LOVED IT! As soon as I read the last page I wanted to read it all over agian. Can you say GIRL POWER!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This book was enchanting, full of stories about people we know and yet we don't. Dinah, who was a footnote, is a complete person, yet there is something missing. In her attempt to tell Dinah's story, Anita Diamant told the story she wished for Dinah. Though Dinah deserves a happy ending, the fact that she gets it in this book makes it hard to digest. Then there is Dinah herself, we get to know her, but not too well. She keeps her secrets, even more from us, and as she does that it ceases to be her story, but Anita Diamant's story. However, this book should be read because it is bold and beautifully written. It is a woman's book, because a man will never be able to understand, just like the men in the story didn't, how women while having a period can bond in the red tent."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"The Red Tent by Anita Diamant is one authors retelling of the story of Dinah from the Old Testament. For those of us who have studied this protion of the Bible, this account is worthwhile since there is one or two references as to what happened to Dinah, Jacob's only daughter. And I would imagine that many can't even recall this woman or how she fits into any Biblical story.I enjoyed this book immensely despite the criticism that the auhtor didn't always hold perfectly true to the retelling of other parts of this story. What I also found interesting about this book was that the majority of readers found out about it from word of mouth. I also know that today it is being read by many book group as well as women's studies groups. It is a wonderful guide to see what womens lives were all about at that time and even if this is only a fictionalized account based on the author's research.While I found many parts of thsi book both compelling and poignant, what I found most fascinating was Dinah's relationships with her birth mother and aunts and their relationship with Jacob. The writing at these times and the views expressed are almost modern in feeling. Especially worthwhile reading is when Dina, who serves as the narrator, says that in order to learn about a person, one must first listen to the story of their mother.When I first heard about this book from a friend, I didn't expect to read it. After all hadn't I studied enough about the Old Testament while attending religious school and in my house of worship. But then as I read more and more recomemndations for this book or heard about it from other readers, I decided I had to at least try it. I am so glad that I did and know that this book will always be among my very favorite titles."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"A friend read this book, and suggested that I read it. I found it very well written and very interesting. I liked hearing about all the familiar characters throughout the book, but I especially liked how the author made the story more of a love story. Not just the love between husband and wife, but the love of a mother and daughter. I have always been curious as to what happened to Dinah, the only daughter of Leah, and this story (though false) is better than I ever could have imagined it."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"The story embraces the life of every woman, from birth to the celebration when becoming a woman at the age of menstration, to partnership and love, and of course finally to death.Anita Diamant opens the heart of the reader and rekindles the need for all women to honour themselves in the present day, to embrace and celebrate the feminine spirit.THIS BOOK IS A TRUE CELEBRATION TO ALL WOMEN!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Dinah's voice brought these ancient characters to life. I felt as if I was one of the bondswomen inside the tents. The details about the customs and rules of that time were wonderfully vivid. It is a beautiful story of women and the power they posses.I hope Anita will contiue to provide the kind of entertainment this book contained."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"A wonderfully different historical fiction novel from a woman's perspective in biblical times. Fascinating and engrossing. Will not disappoint. Jacob is the man!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"In my opinion this is the best book written about us \\"women.\\" I believe every daughter should read this book, perhaps then mothers would be appreciated."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"The Red Tent is a work of fiction based on the Biblical Dina, the only daughter of Jacob and a sister to twelve brothers, sons of Leah, Rachel, Bilha and Zilpa. It is a beautifully told story about the women of the Bible, how they lived, how they raised their children, of their joys and sorrows. And as all good stories that challenge faith, the Red Tent invokes emotion and creates controversy."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I loved the Red Tent! First, it is a historical novel and second, it goes into so much detail about the lives of women in ancient times. No one who reads the Red Tent will view the Biblical Jacob in the same way as he is portrayed in the Bible. Written from the perspective of Jacob's only daughter, Dinah, the Red Tent tells the story of a young girl molded by the women around her, specifically, her father's four wives who all adore her, and are anxious to make her into the best woman she can be. The characters as described by the author are vivid and sometimes larger than life. I had a hard time putting this book down. Its a great read."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This book may be seen as controversial by many as Anita Diamant has taken a character from the Bible and extended her story. Some say it is blasphemous, in the way that the Abraham's God is mentioned, however, so many people had their own gods at the time of the story, and were still worshipping idols, that the comments of disbilieving characters towards Abraham's god should not be taken as blasphemy or anything serious as they are simply ways the author shows how people lived during that time period.Anita Diamant beautifully captures life as it is shown to have been during Dinah's lifetime, if one is to believe she did exist. The novel is so down to earth and yet Diamant somehow manages to bring the reader in close to the story. There is always a light shining somewhere above Dinah that gves her hope even in the darkest of times. This book is not about a religious path, but about a woman managing to survive on her own and healing others with her own common sense. It is a great story of human success."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"My all time favorite book! Creative, vivid, and an absolute joy to read!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"While I found the writing compelling in parts, it took me a long time to \\"get into the book\\", and not until the last third of the book, could I honestly say \\"I was hooked\\". The writing never seemed to rest anywhere and felt ungrounded, and I didn't feel drawn into the complexities of the characters. The author talked \\"about\\" the characters and their qualities, but I never developed a real sense of them. All in all, I found Rebecca Kohn's the \\"Gilded Chamber\\" a better and more enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I truly enjoyed reading this book; I found it so interesting and such a wonderful point of view to the times they were in. I find that after reading this book and then reading Genesis where it talks about Jacob, Leah, Rachel and the others mentioned in The Red Tent; I cannot help but see this story in the background. Where it so briefly discusses Dinah in the bible and how she was \\"violated\\" I think about the love that she had actually found and how the murder committed by her brothers so deeply affected her. I also love reading about the bond formed by women in this time; how they would all sit together in the tent and share secrets and stories. I have read this book three times now and each time I just enjoy it more and more. I would recommend this for any woman to read!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"The Red Tent was a very interesting historical fiction. The author took us on a journey into the past, and we experienced a life on a day to day basis of a young girl at the turn of history. She was the last of her family to take part in the women's mysterious of The Red Tent. The women of her family retired for three days of rest during their menstruation at the time of the new moon. In the tent they bonded and shared each others lives, stories and myths. The bonding was something the world has sorely missed, they shared everything including their husbands and children. An excellent read of a time long ago."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I have just ordered the Last Days of Dog Town and was recalling how much I loved the Red Tent. My first copy was passed along and reccommended to my many friends that are avid readers like me. I am ready to read it again and especially the last page which made me cry everytime I read it. Okay, I'm a sentimentalist, but also a woman. Our times are different, but I know we are all connected by those deep inner feelings.I am looking forward to receiving both of these books.Thank you Anita."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Absolutely was caught up in the story immediately! I cannot imagine these women not saying the words expressed by Anita Diamant on their behalf. The lives they led, the hardships they endured, their strength and the faith they had makes me proud to be a woman but grateful that I didn't live then! However, I believe in reincarnation - was I living at that time? How did I respond to those same instances of life then? Would I have survived?Thank you Anita Diamant for such a moving novel expressing how life could have been lived in those times."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This book is on my lifetime favorite list! My girls suggested it to me and it is one of those that make you sad to have reached the last page!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Anita Diamant blurs the line between fact and fiction so well that you forget what is true and what isn't!You will not be disappointed when you read the first couple of pages. These characters come to life before your eyes. Every page is full of so much culture, history, and just beautiful writings that you will find yourself immersed and unable to escape.The stories of Issac and Rebekah, Jacob and Rachel, Leah. Every character is so alive! Amazing and so beautiful."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Wonderful book--though I cannot imagine a man reading it.A few things stand out as extraordinary.First, without ever being pedantic or lecturing, the narrator completely enveloped me in her world. The prose--which were delicate and passionate at the same time--showed me what was normal, what was a given, what she accepted without question. I could just relax and let her guide me through the story.Second, the story line. If you know the story of Jacob and his 12 sons, you'll be surprised at what is mentioned and what isn't. Dinah does not experience the famine that drove Jacob's sons to Egypt, for example, because of the . . . well, 'protected isolation' she lives in at that time. Because of things like that, the book is not predictable; it can surprise.Third, the pacing. OK, everybody's different when it comes to how fast or slow they want their novels to move, but this book was perfect for me. A slow but never boring beginning in which I got to know everyone, see them change, and then blast me with some action that rearranges everything.Highly recommended for any female who enjoys historical fiction."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I'm a big fan of historical fiction. And this book did not disappoint. It is so well written and imaginative. It doesn't exactly follow the words of the bible and several times I prayed that God would not strike her down for inventing false parts of the story. It drew me back to the bible just to verify facts that I thought I knew. I learned a tremendous amount about that era. She is bold, in fact very bold in her subject matter because I imagine a lot of Christians would be interested in this book just to discover that although it is about biblical times it is not a morally decent book. Nonetheless the character development and description of the setting is superb. Read with caution and keep your bible handy for reference."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"If you liked the tone of the Mists of Avalon, you'll like this. It's about a minor female character from the Old Testament and her story is expanded a great deal."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I am reading this as part of a study group of Jewish and Christian women. We are having a wonderful time examining various viewpoints and imagining how it might have been from the women's point of view, thanks to the excellent writing of Anita Diamant. An intriguing novel and a good read. Be prepared for some graphic scenes of childbirth, murder, abuse, but also a fascinating picture of life at a blooming time in the world of Isaac, Rebecca, Jacob and Esau, told through a daughter of one of the several wives of Jacob. I meant to read this sooner and I see this is the book's 10th anniversary. Better late than never. As a Christian, I think we see Biblical history through a certain lens. For instance, it's easy to forget that there was still strong belief in multiple gods during this period. A very worthwhile and rich reading experience."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"The Red Tent was recommended to me by a friend whose tastes and opinions I highly value, and when I told her I was looking for a \\"pleasure read\\" with a strong female character to break up my MA studies she quickly suggested it. Diamant's tale though labeled an \\"historical fiction\\" is more fiction than historical, and though well researched she skimps on details of Bronze Age technologies and historical context. I am not particularly bothered by this lack of historiography though, and it is obvious that the Bible is her main source. She makes it very clear at the beginning that her novel is loosely based on it and that it is a woman's perception of the events of Dinah, a perception that is not included in the texts that we find now. I found such a prospect intriguing, as I study women authors in Medieval English literature... of which there are very few. The female perspective is often over looked, neglected, and often times written out of history. Our language, our culture and our morals have been dominated by male authority. Is this a bad thing? I don't know, but what it does do is make the female narrative sound alien when it is voiced.Diamant's novel is about a possible version of history, of the time and place in which the story of Dinah occurs. This version is Dinah's, and just like any tale, it changes from person to person in the retelling, therefore, it has no responsibility to be a verbatim version of the Bible. The focus on the female body, the the various gods and goddess of the women, the relationships among the women are fascinating and they illuminate a possible culture that the masculine narrative of the Bible omits. The illumination is fascinating, and it is fiction. A stunning fiction that gives women more power, individuality and culture than the Bible gives them."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This book is not Biblical whatsoever, so it has to be read for the story only so as to not confuse it with fact. However the story is great in that it kept me turning pages anxiously to know what happens next."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"If you love to read this! Biblical or non biblical, interesting but who cares. It is a great read! It is a novel one has to let go and be transported and learn and grow through the story with the main character. The author does such a beautiful job of telling the story it is a work of art. The language she uses, her perspective as a child and as she grows into a woman so accurate it makes the book magical. It starts out slow full of detail about the life of a woman in a very different culture, in a very different time. Details hard to digest in today's world, in today's culture, but there is beauty in it. Perhaps a beauty lost. A secret world of females who are brought together by life and gather as sisters and support and love each other. And as life goes there is greed, and betrayal, and even murder. She shares her suffering so you suffer along with her. She shares her journey to forgiveness so you feel her peace. She speaks to you. She speaks to your heart. She stays with you. What a beautiful story."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I did not think that I would like &quot;The Red Tent&quot; until I found a copy at a used book store and opened it up. It started off with keeping me mesmerised from page one!The bond that Dinah had with her four mothers in the red tent was absolutely wonderful............There were some areas in the book that I thought barbaric, but life was brutal back then, and women were the property of their man..............ewwwwww!This was a very nice story, one worth keeping on my bookshelf for my daughters to read. I just wish there were more good stories like this one out there."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"It gives you an idea of what life may have been like at that time. I identified with Dinah &amp; felt her losses and victories in a difficult time for women (and men it seems). I see that some reviewers called this book a romance, but I personally didn't see this book as a romance at all - not even close. Maybe &quot;Historical Fiction&quot;? Either way, it was wonderful!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"When I first picked up the novel &quot;The Red Tent&quot; by Anita Diamant, I was hesitant: Could I be interested in a book about the bible? The answer: Yes. This book was so beautifully written.The story of Dinah is compelling in nature and truly brings a new view to what the bible may have left out or a theory about the lives of women during that time era. I don't think that it is anti-male at all, and anyone who is looking to correct biblical &quot;facts&quot; should not read this novel.It is a book that stays with you. People who are in the online group book club that I'm in loved it and feel moved by it like I do. It is not a book of facts. It is a book for people with imagination, a heart, and an open soul."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This book was awsome. If you have ever studied the bible, then you truly do wonder what happened to Dinah. The story was wonderfully told and keeps you coming back for more. The story of her mothers was told in a way that should make every woman proud of who they are and where they came from. &quot;If you want to understand any woman you must first ask about her mother and then listen carefully. Stories about food show a strong connection. Wistful silences demonstrate unfinished business. The more a daughter knows the details of her mother's life-without flinching or whining-the stronger the daughter.&quot; taken from the book, The Red Tent by Anita Diamant.Mothers and daughters have a special bond and we never really know how special that bond is until it has been taken from us.Read this book. Understand the female presence in your life."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This book is rare. It is rare in that it is always uplifting while also being simultaniously heartbreaking. Rachel narrates the story of her family and her life from beginning to end. She weaves a story simply stated but beautifully relayed. Happiness and love are felt through the pages as is saddness and heatbreak. Although the story ends happily from the eyes of the character the reader is left feeling satisfied for her, but, at the same time sad still for her losses and injustices suffered. This is a beautifully written novel, a wonderful story, and a completely worthwhile read."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I just finished the red tent and I am still in tears.This book moved me in ways I can't explain.Though definatly not for everyone,this is a book that will live forever on my shelves!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I'm writing this review in response to other discouraging reviews, because I consider this book to be one of the best I have ever read. I read about 3 or 4 books a week, so I have a pretty broad base to compare this book to others, and there truly is no comparison. It took me a week and a half to finish this book, only because I forced myself to put it down, because I never wanted it to end."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"While I read this as fiction, I loved the historic references as well. The last few pages are the best, as Dinah sums up her life and death....So good! Sorry critics!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Written in the voice of Dinah (pronounced Dee-nah), in the Book of Genesis, she was Jacob and Leah's only daughter. Anita Diamant describes of how the women in biblical times must have lived. The red tent held many functions for the women in the clans;it provided warmth and comfort for the women as they endured their menses, childbirth, nursing and illness. Many secrets were told in the red tent and were passed on from generation to generation. The women provided care and abundant love to one another while in the red tent. This book is a celebration of women of their birth, life, weaving, gardening, foraging and death. Dinah had four mothers, each of them unique, and had her own gifts to offer and to teach. Through her life, Dinah has kept with her a part of all of her mothers gifts. Near the end of the book, Dinah finds love and peace after her long years of pain and grief. This book moved me to multitudes of emotions; tears, sadness, anger and happiness. It was well written and I found myself involved as though I was a character in the book. The Red Tent is sensual and sexual; mesmerizing and embracing. I can't wait to read the book again so that I may savor all the words!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"At the time I was reading The Red Tent, I was also awaiting the home birth of my granddaughter. I was very moved by this book and have recommended it to all my women friends, young and old."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Ms. Diamant has a way with words. She created a masterpiece in formulating the character, Dinah (pronounced Dee-nah), based on the biblical story, giving voice to the woman. Like her other fictional works, such as Good Harbor and Last Days of Dogtown, Ms. Diamant is very talented in creating strong, believable bonds between women in her books. I've read The Red Tent at least six times and never tire of the way the story flows. The women in her stories are fascinating and so full of love and life. I recommend this book to any one person that loves reading a good story with great characters. I recommend getting a hard cover (if you can find one), because like the lays potato chips, you won't be able to \\"read\\" this just once."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This follows the Biblical story of Dinah enough that it is did not offend me as a Christian. But I like how Diamant enhanced the story to make it a story about love, God, and womanly bonding. At a time in society where women were 2nd class citizens, this story tells of their strengths -- both individual and as a group. I highly recommend this to any female reader. Also a great gift for a Christian friend."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This book's hard to put down when you are reading it and haunting afterwards.Part of what made this read so interesting to me was the striking contrast between the fictional stories Diamante weaved out and the knowlege I already had on the old testiment. Sure I didn't agree with every big or little events upon which the author took her great libery to describe of, but regardless it's just nice to hear at last some multi-dimensional, personal voices from the women who I heard known for so long but never really knew.This book gave me an opportunity to have an alternative view, even though I don't agree with a lot of Diamonte's perspective on the Bible I still enjoyed it so much to recommend it anyone who's looking for a good read."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This is a wonderful book to listen to if you are on a long road trip or a long flight."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This is informative, powerful, interesting, and riveting. I could not put it down. I will read it over again. I think every student of history, religion, or psychology should read it. It was recommended to me, and I will recommend it to many in my family. I won't lend it. It will stay on my library shelf for reference and future read-overs."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"There are few books I read more than once, but I've read The Red Tent at least 5 times... and counting!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This book is excellent and I have bought it many times over to give to girlfriends as a gift. Definitely worth reading."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I liked the fact that it was an interesting take on a familiar work of fiction (the Bible). I have no idea how much it strayed from it and didn't care. It was a good book.Interestingly, the taking of many wives reminded me of Mormon religion (read \\"Under the Banner of Heaven\\" for an eye opening read). But luckily, you do not need to be religious to enjoy this book.Some compared this book to \\"Snowflower and the Secret Fan\\". I found that book to be much better. This one wasn't bad... just not as good."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"In the Bible we never get all the details about the people. In The Red Tent, the reader is invited into the possibilities of the life of Dinah. This is a rich book filled with the human side of ancient Israelites."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"It was wonderful, I felt as if I were apart of the story seeing these women, their lives and the special bond they shared in that red tent. A truly great take on a biblical story."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"As a fan of Anita Diamant's non-fiction, I was intrigued by this novel from the outset, but was unprepared for the epiphanal experience it brought me. Diamant's &quot;interpretation&quot; of this story of Genesis makes the reader reread and rethink Genesis, searching for new meaning in the old text. Although the author is quick to name this a work of fiction, I prefer to think of it as modern midrash. The Red Tent provides an opportunity to find female empowerment in a frustratingly patriarchal yet vital text (the Bible)."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This book was very interesting and well worth it. I thought it was well written and even though it does have focus on becoming a woman and childbearing it still is more than that. It tells the story of the women on how families were in those times and also has a bit of romance to it also. This will be the book my book club will be reading this month. That is how much I truly enjoyed reading it."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I've always loved historical fiction, and found this Biblical fiction just as compelling. I had no idea that religion was so diverse, during these times, and that the concept of the goddess was alive and kicking amongst Hebrew women. This book kept me up at night and almost made me miss my train stop twice (the true measure of a really good book). What a great idea, telling the story of a minor Biblical character. The only thing that was a bit of a let-down, is that after the pivotal event, the pace slows down greatly."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This book encouraged me to explore my own ties to the women who have come before me. What it means to be woman. The rituals that tie us together. I do not often read &quot;religious&quot; writing because I find as a woman I am not represented, but this book is a gift. No matter your background or beliefs this book is well written, provokes thought, and had the power to connect me to women everywhere."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"The only thing that I can say about this book, is WOW! This is one of the best books I have read in a long time. When I initially read what it was about I was a bit tentative about it, thinking that it would be a bit more 'religious' than I wanted to read. Now having read it I think it to be a brilliant story! Anita Diamant is a wonderful writer and this book kept me wanting more, as a matter of fact I was sad when it ended! I highly recommend this book!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I originally learned of this book through a short interview with Julia Roberts in the Oprah &quot;O&quot; magazine. My sister has repeatedly encouraged me to read the &quot;Three from Galilee&quot; trilogy, but I haven't yet succumbed; religious storylines haven't grabbed my attention-yet. Although a fictionalized account of Dinah's life, the historical references and language give this novel authenticity. &quot;The Red Tent&quot; is a warm, inviting read with plenty of suspense, symbolism and historical reference. The author's storytelling invites the reader into Dinah's life and reiterates the importance of sharing stories with younger generations. Pay close attention to the Prologue (especially the speaker's dialect and message) and the conclusion of the novel. Once finished, I reread both and they brought me to tears.You'll enjoy this book if historical family and marital dynamics and life/religious customs are of interest. My sister is now reading &quot;The Red Tent&quot; due to my recommendation. I'll be curious to learn whether she still recommends the Galilee trilogy once she's finished with Diamant's novel."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This book was a wonderful journey! It was empowering and showed women in a strong and realistic light. I applaude Ms. Diamant in her first novel. Her character development created an envirnoment in which the reader felt a part of this story. It is important to remember that this is just that, a story. You will not get a mere retelling of the corresponding Biblical story by a woman (Dinah), and if that is what you are looking for (as was karinsb), you will probably not like this book. If, however, you want to read an emotionally charged account of what it might have been like to live as a woman in those times, this is a treasure!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I have been waiting for the library to call me when this book came in. Finally I got the call and have been unable to put it down. I was a little uncomfortable with the topic because it was biblically based, and there were some liberties taken. But it was such a good read!!! I do have to remind myself that it is really a work of fiction - a fine work of fiction."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This is a wonderful story about the often overlooked women of Biblical times. It's told from the women's perspective and has a very different slant than the 'traditional' story of Joseph and his many brothers. This is a beautiful story of Dinah and her life from beloved daughter of many mothers to aged midwife. Very enjoyable and not 'religiously' slanted. If you don't want contradictions to the traditional story, you probably won't like this. Along the lines of 'Mists of Avalon'."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Excellent book that bring the Old Testament to life. It especially address the life of the women of the time in a light that is rarely talked about. The Red Tent is fast moving, well written and gripping. I really enjoyed reading this age old Biblical story from a new angle."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This book was given to me and I could not put the book down. I was sobbing when finishing the book and sad it ended."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Holy cow, I loved this book. When my Professor told me I should read this book, because my names Rachel,wife of Jacob, I thought OK. I bought the book, and there it sat for 2 months.Then I read it. In one night no less, I couldn't put it down.I knew some of the stories, Jacob and Esu, Simon and Levi, Joseph and his brothers, so I kinda knew what was there, But I never thought of looking through a womens point of view. I loved this book, it was different from what I normally read, Nora Roberts and Danielle Steele, but some how the same. If you read the book you'll understand. the book, it's a good thing."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Extrapolating an entire, colorful life's story from one brief mention in the Old Testament poses a big challenge. Meeting the challenge with an engaging, well-researched novel is an even bigger accomplishment.My book group read this recently and gave it a big &quot;thumbs up&quot;. Each reader responded to different aspects of the book, but they all enjoyed it because it really is a great read: well-rounded characters, interesting plot, finely told details. Consensus of the group: &quot;It took us to a time and place where we'd never been.&quot;If you've got a biblical bent, the story of Rachel and Leah (as it might have been) will be fleshed out for you, and you'll get a new look at the relationship Joseph (coat of many colors) might have really had with his brothers.Even if you're not up on the Old Testament, you can enjoy this sprawling story of a family just as it is."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This book is a fast read. It is not particularly remarkable in terms of its intellectual or philosophical content. It does, however, raise a number of interesting issues re: women's role in society, the bible/religion both in the past and currently and is likely to provoke good discussion/conversation among women-oriented book clubs. Good for the beach, too."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I loved this book and never wanted it to end. The story of relationships between strong women, women who have faced sorrow, joy, grief, motherhood and barreness together was deeply moving. I have recommended it to women friends, my sisters and my mother. I will read it aloud with my daughters as they become women. Thi book has found its way to the top of my list of books I'll never forget."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This book explains what the women in the time of Jacob' daughter, Dinah. There lives were enforced by their religion and the women were certainly subservent to the men. Jacob had many sons but only one living daughter. This book tells of her coming on age and being able to go to the Red Tent at the time of the full moon. I founf this book captivating and when I finished it thr first time I read it again and will probably do so again. I sincerely hope that Anita Diament will write many more wonderful books"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Anita Diamant takes one story from the Bible and turns it into an amazing work of art. In the Bible, Dinah is mentioned only when she is raped. Diamant takes this and other stories and tells them from Dinah's point of view. I suggest reading the later parts of Genesis before reading this book, as the story will make more sense and you will undoubtably appreciate this book even more. Not only a celebration of what it is to be a woman, but this book celebrates being a wife, sister, mother, lover and child. The characters are believable and sincere and the plot is intricate and developed. What more can you ask for from a novel? Not only is this book entertaining, but it develops an intellectual theme. Fabulous."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Anita Diamant writes a wonderful book with compelling characters and a spellbinding story. Anita captures the history, culture, and most importantly, the humanity of her characters. I wanted this book to keep going indefinately. Very enjoyable. Sylvia"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I have been a fan of Diamant's non-fiction wedding and baby books for a while, but when my sister-in-law gave this to me with the instructions &quot;You HAVE to read this,&quot; I fell in love with her fiction.This is a glorious story giving a possible voice to female characters of the Bible where before we have heard almost exclusively from the men. From the opening &quot;We have been lost to each other, you and I...&quot; to the end where we must say good bye, I was captivated by the spell of this story. It is a woman's story filled with all the joys and pains of growing up and going from maiden to mother to crone. It is all of our story.I have recommended this book to countless girlfriends (who have continued to recommend it!)and even strangers in bookstores. And now to you I also recommend you take the opportunity to get lost in the luciousness of Diamant's and Dinah's world."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"IN the book of Genesis we read a brief paragraph that denotes the life of one of Joseph's one and only sister. Anita Diamant has breathed life into her as well as her mothers, children, and life as it had been known in ancient Mesopotamia and later, Egypt. As a mother and a daughter, this book enthralled me with universal truths. A must read for mothers; a must read for daughters."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This novel is not a gripping, intense, fast-paced book. It's the story of one woman's life, and as such it encompasses periods of great change and periods of stasis, upheaval and peace, passion, contentment, and anguish. If you're looking for a book about monumental events with a larger-than-life heroine, this book is not for you. If you're looking to be utterly captivated by how one woman can change history and be changed by it, you'll love &quot;The Red Tent&quot;.The title of the book underscores its greatest theme: that of the sisterhood of women that transcends generations, religions, and cultures. Dinah grows up secure of her place within this sisterhood, only to find herself cast adrift from it in one moment of savagery and violence. Her journey from her childhood home in Canaan to the home she makes for herself in Egypt parallels her search to once again find a place where she belongs as much as she did with her mothers in the tent.Leah, Zilpah, Rachel, and Bilhah, the wives of Jacob and the mothers of the twelve tribes of Israel, are also central characters. Anyone who gets riled up by any suggestion that the Bible is not 100%, verbatim, word-for-word truth from the mouth of God should also avoid this book. Not that Diamant drastically alters the story - far from it. But she introduces crucial details that are lacking in the original, as well as resolving several inconsistencies and contradictions. (For example, Jacob working 7 months instead of 7 years each for Leah and Rachel. If he had worked 14 years before marrying Rachel, she would have been almost 30 and completely unmarriagable. Diamant's scenario only makes sense.) If an author doesn't add or alter any details from her source, than what's the point in writing a book at all? In addition, the women of Jacob's family are not Jewish - Judaism didn't exist yet. I've read several reviews that take offense to this aspect of the book and claim that it's pagan propaganda. Far from it. Think about it: Early Christians considered themselves a faction of Judaism for several generations after the death of Jesus. Likewise, the exclusive worship of El was simply a sect of the polytheistic Canaanite religion for years, until the followers of El wiped out the followers of every other god and goddess in the region hundreds (if not thousands) of years later.Dinah's story is one of an ordinary woman caught up in events beyond her comprehension, who escapes from a life where she is pulled back and forth between the whims and desires of men, only to find that greed, like love, exists everywhere. Dinah's courage, like Leah's pride, Zilpah's spirituality, Rachel's beauty, and Bilhah's compassion, overcomes the boundaries of time and culture and underlines the universal nature of womanhood in a lovely, rich, and epic tale."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This is one of my all-time favorite books - a must read for every woman. It is one of those books that when you're done, you want it to keep going and going and going. Every woman should have a copy in her collection."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I was reluctant to start reading this book--but I'm glad I did. As I read the introduction I found myself being drawn into the book. The author has a great, poetic way with words. I could also tell quite a bit of research went into the book. I loved the main character, Dinah, and wished that I too could be in the red tent and share stories, cakes, and laughter. The author starts the book by telling the story of Dinah's 4 mothers and how they met Jacob and fell in love with him. Then the author tells Dinah's story. Dinah was the last child of Leah and Jacob. She was also the only girl of Jacob's seed, so all of her mothers tell her their stories. Despite the happy beginning, Dinah's story isn't happy. Very excellent read!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"The Red Tent is an excellent novel that breathes new life into the ancient heroes and heroines of the Book of Genesis. An outstanding companion to the Red Tent is the well-written and less known, The Genius of Genesis: A Psychoanalyst and Rabbi Examines the First Book of the Bible (nonfiction) by Dennis G. Shulman. Read these books together, as I just did, and you'll certainly see things in the Genesis text and yourself that you have never seen before."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I had great hopes for this book after being enchanted by the very promising beginning and Anita Diamant's lyrical, poetic language. Unfortunately the book didn't really live up, even though it's been a fairly entertaining, enjoyable read. I always like reading a fresh spin on an old story and rarely have problems with authors mucking around with facts, so I didn't have problems with whatever historical inaccuracies there were.My problems were more with the way Diamant treats the characters: men are mostly reduced to shallow caricatures and Dinah's two romances come straight from your average bodice-ripper. The rituals and daily life of Dinah's four mothers were interesting to read, although I felt like I might overdose on the celebration of oh-so-harmonious-glorious sisterhood that the book is drenched with at times. I mean, I'm proud to be a woman and all but there was just too much hair-braiding and feet-rubbing for my liking. Also, the story runs out of steam somewhat after the climatic event in Dinah's life: her life in Egypt is simply not that terribly interesting, and the new characters she meets there lack the strength of Leah and Rachel.I would still recommend the book, but just don't expect too much."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I enjoyed this book immensely. I literally could not put it down. It was so affirming to hear this story told from a woman's perspective. The comraderie and true connectedness of the ancient sisterhood leaves a lot to be desired in our modern-day isolated liberation. I found myself not wanting the story to end!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"In a word, this book is &quot;controversial.&quot; Why? Because it has some basis in religious history, and religion is always a controversial subject. I enjoyed this book emmensely because I never stopped thinking of it as a work of fiction. As a novel, it has no obligation to be biblically or historically accurate. The fact that some of the characters ARE based on persons in the bible, definately enhances the story. However, I would have given The Red Tent four stars if all of the characters been entirely fictional. It's a well-written and compelling read that unfortunately slows down in the final 1/3 of the book. Still, I have and will continue to recommend it."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I picked up this book on a whim. I am not a Christian however was raised in the Christian church. Thus I am familiar with the tales of Joseph, Jacob and his wives, ect. However, I have a renewed appreciation for these characters. What a rich book on the strength and sisterhood of women. Where the bible many times neglects herstory, this book offers an unique look at complex bonds and friendships between women, sisters and mothers/daughters. It also honors women spirit. The strong theme of birth, menstruation, coming of age are incredible. I highly recommend this book. What a unique take on both Jacob and Joseph also."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This book is excellent because it brings to light a civilization that few of us know very well, and characters that many of us know VERY well. I don't often read retellings of the Bible, but this one was captivating--especially the first part about Dinah's mothers. A very nice snapshot of the area around Israel and Egypt. Dinah is also an excellent narrator. Her ordeals and triumphs are very real, as childbirth, motherhood, and death have not changed much from then to now, regardless how advanced we think we are.The book begins telling the stories of Leah, Rachel, Zilpah, and Bilbah, and their marriage(s) to Jacob, their cousin. It is through the eyes of a child--Dinah, the only daughter of Jacob's clan, tells the story of her mothers' marriages to Jacob as she heard it--but still mature, still accurate. Uncovered is Leah and Rachel's constant feud over Jacob's affections; Zilpah's disdain for childbearing and priestess-like behavior; Rachel's troubles in having a child; the feuds between the many brothers, and a perspective on Jacob and Joseph seen through the eyes of a very different narrator. As Dinah grows up the story begins to focus on her and her maturation into a woman; and there I won't let the story spill, but the course of her life takes her to Egypt and beyond.I suggest it to everyone, but I think women would appreciate this story more. It's just that women are most likely to make a stronger connection to the many women in the novel."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"The Red Tent is a wonderful benchmark book for anyone wanting towrite about, study or simply enjoy historical fiction. Diamantused her obviously strong knowledge of ancient tradition andanthropology to present material in a very convincing way.As a gender statement, The Red Tent reinforces the fact that alldomestic responsibility and community is essentially the resultof 'women's work'. Viewed politically, it is a sad reminder ofhow much matriarchal tradition has been lost over the milleniaand replaced by testosterone worship.I would recommend The Red Tent to anyone who enjoysanthropology and culture, all women's studies,theological study, and the study of archeology of theancient near and middle east."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I found that this delicious novel was infinitely more meaningful, when read along with Listen to Her Voice, Women of the Hebrew Bible by Miki Raver."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"A wonderful book and a deeply interesting story. Diamant does an outstanding job transporting the reader into the life of Dinah and her experiences as a woman in ancient times. I could not put the book down and was sad to turn the last page - I just didn't want it to end!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"How many of us have heard the story of Jacob's daughter, Dinah and not really paid much attention? This book is a fascinating description of Dinah's story and live in these ancient times. A terrific women's book and also great for book club discussions. I have given this book all of my women friends and the reaction has been most enthusiastic."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"The best book I've read in a long time--if not ever. As someone who was raised Catholic and who's always struggled with the difficulty in applying the Bible to modern day female life, this was especially meaningful. A beautiful story and absolute gift for the imagination."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I have read several novels over the last year and I thought all of them were o.k., but I ussually felt like I was forcing myself to finish them. I finished The Red Tent in just three days and could not put the book down. The characters are well developed, the historical and religious aspects are well researched and it is a truely well written story. I am sure all women will love it. Men could enjoy it if they can get passed all of the talk about menstration and childbirth."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I found this story fascinating. I grew up knowing the stories of the Bible and this was a whole new spin on it from a woman's perspective. A must read!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This book is captivating and a real bargain! You will be glad you gave it a chance. I would recommend it for women who have had a child or two..."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This book, written like one of her songs, filled me with such a sense of comtentment and connection. Much too short, I hated to see it end."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I would echo the thoughts of many other Amazon reviewers: finished it hungrily, want more from Diamant, want to tell other people to read it... I am unchurched, though familiar with basic outline of judeo=christian bible. For me, this story brings us back to pre-church, pre-synagogue and makes the link to the women who shaped culture. The book leaves you wanting more. Story fizzles near the end, but well worth the slow points. The story also left me wanting to delve more into new/very old religions based on lunar cycles and pre-christian worship."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I didn't think I would ever get through this book, a selection of my book discussion group. I started off really interested in the story, partly because it was initially intriguing and also because there was so much hype surrounding the book. The author attempts to weave a tapestry of Dinah's life but dwells too long on details extrinsic to her own existence. For example, there was great detail given to descriptions of birthing. I failed to see where this affected Dinah's life...especially those births that occured before her own. At any rate, the book was enjoyable to a certain extent. The first half wore on like something I was forced to read against my will in grade school. The last statement in the book, as it turns out, is the most powerful literarily speaking. Too bad you have to wade through so much muck to get the reward..."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I loved this book so much that even now, three books later, I find myself still thinking about Dinah, and missing her so. Like a good film, this novel is so rich and real that I found myself lost in the world of Genesis. Loved it, loved it, loved it........and wished it never ended. Read it immediately."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I wanted to love this book, but I can honestly say that I only &quot;liked&quot; it. An interesting concept, well-written in general, but I personally didn't find it that compelling. I understand that it has been lauded as a must-read for women. I may read it again because I'm wondering what all the fuss is about - maybe I missed something???"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I expected to struggle with this book, but was very much surprised by the ease of the writing/reading and the powerful story. I loved this book. I read about 24 books a year and this is the best book I've read this year. I've never read Biblical Fiction before. My other favorites of the past few years have been Stones from the River and Memoirs of a Geisha."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This novel is a taught and poetic piece of historical fiction that fleshes a brief but gory incident in Genesis: the murder of the lover of Jacob's daughter and all the males in his family, when their guard is down because they have just circumcised themselves to please Dinah's father and brothers. The Red Tent clearly shows how Judaism could have emerged from the pagan and animistic soup of the Fertile Crescent 4000 years ago. Diamant walks in giant footprints; Thomas Mann spent the 1930s writing a 4 volume saga based on the story of Jacob and his many sons. The Red Tent is a powerful meditation on Jewish feminism, on the misty patriarchal origins or Judaism, and on Jewish women's growing willingness to speak to their unease about ritual circumcision (circumcision is the only link between the world imagined by Diamant and the world of her readers). I would argue that this book gives aid and comfort to Jews who are embarrassed by ritual circumcision, and to Gentiles who want to abandon routine infant circumcision."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"IF THE DEPTH OF LIFE CAPTIVATES YOU.

One of the best books that I ever read in all my life. I give it ten stars!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"In the Bible, the character Dinah appears as a brief detour in the story of her father Jacob and his sons. In The Red Tent, Dinah is the narrator, telling the story behind the myth, what actually happened to her mothers and to herself (as imagined by Diamant) both before and after her marriage and the murder of her husband and his family. The novel intends to tell the story of the women in the Bible, but--while Diamant conceives Dinah's story in realistic detail--Dinah has no agency, and the plot stops and starts not with the actions and lives of women, but rather by their husbands, sons, and other male influences. The novel also suffers from unimpressive writing, but it was the male-directed action that disappointed me most and which prevented the novel from fulfilling its intentions. I found this book frustrating and limited, and while it has some potential, I do not recommend it.The first section of the book (\\"My Mother's Stories\\") begins, \\"Their stories began the day my father appeared\\" (pg 7). Although not indicative of its entirety, this sentence does set the tone for the rest of the book. The novel intends to be the story of Biblical women, and does delve into women's practices and their time spent in the menstrual hut (the red tent of the title), but the women's characterizations and purpose, the arcs of the plot, and even the female-specific occupations and locations, are all centered around male influence. Jacob's wives are introduced when Jacob appears, and described largely in reference to how they interacted with and appealed to him. Dinah's story begins with her mothers as wives and moves into herself as wife, herself as widow, herself as mother, and then herself as wife and sister (to her brother). In periods where she cannot be categorized by a male relation (for example, after her son goes to school and before she remarries), Dinah does literally nothing, and entire years of inactivity pass in a few paragraphs. Finally, even the female center, the Red Tent (which is forbidden to men, and the home of birth, menstruation, and femininity) focuses energy on being able to produce, conceiving, and producing children by men, in particular male heirs.To a certain extent, this masculine focus is necessary and unavoidable. The roles of women and men in this era were both structured and limited, and writing a book in which women were social equals to men would be more fallacy than fiction. However, while I expected and accepted differences in gender status and equality, Diamant could have written a book about women within that world--perhaps by decreasing the story's scope, she could have written more about their interpersonal relationships or other struggles and stories that wouldn't latter appear in the Bible. By any number of means, she could have given her characters lives and interests outside of or not strictly defined by masculine influence; she could have given Dinah a sense of agency and self-direction, rather than allowing men, or failing men older women, or failing older women absolutely nothing at all, direct the course of her life. Dinah only does one thing by herself, for herself, with her own power--and when this event occurs, it is so out of place in contrast to the rest of the book that it feels like a different character takes her place--and leaves just as quickly.Diamant's writing style lacks vivacity and is largely unremarkable; the cast of characters is so numerous that many character descriptions seem no more detailed than the genealogies of the Bible. Conversely, the plot is detailed and differs enough from the Bible myth that it does indeed seem to be the real story behind the story we know. These various strengths and weaknesses effectually annul each other, and my final impression of this book was merely frustration and dissatisfaction: Diamant promised the story of Biblical women, and instead delivered the story of Biblical women as conceived, influenced, and determined by men. While The Red Tent has the potential to be good, it fails to deliver, and instead left me feeling cheated. It would be lovely to see the lives of women, women with personalties, with desires, living under the circumstances and restrictions of their time while still maintaining their own character. That would have been a great book. But this wasn't that book, and the book that this is I don't recommend."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I avoided reading \\"The Red Tent\\" for a long time because I didn't see how a retelling of an Old Testament story could be good. \\"The Red Tent\\" is beyond good - it is amazing. I learned so much about the lives of Jewish women in Biblical times. The book is a first-person narrative of Dinah, daughter of Jacob and sister of Joseph. The book primarily focuses on Chapter 34 of the book of Genesis. Dinah, rather than being the victim of rape as told in the Bible, is a talented midwife and feminist. The rape that occurred in the Bible is really the story of Dinah having sexual relations with a man she loves, but who is not Hebrew. The book's title refers to the tent in which women stay while menstruating or giving birth. The tent is also a place of sisterhood.This is truly an amazing novel. It is long and very detailed. I cried at numerous points. I learned so much. This book renewed my interest in women's history, women's health, and escaping from our patriarchal society."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This book does not claim to be fact, nor does it try to pass as a historical account of what happend during bibilical times. If your faith in the bible and in God are shaken or mislead by this book, then let that be a challenge to your beliefs. I'm frustrated by reviewers who plaster a one-star rating on their reviews based on the fact that the story isn't true. The story is beautifully written and tells the tale of strong courageous women during a time when women's voices often struggled to be heard. I say, read it and enjoy it. And if you happen to be a person to whom the bible is throroughly true, refuse to be \\"threatend\\" by this creative and imaginative story of strength and love."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This is the best book I have read in a long time.

However even at the first page of the book you realize this story is somewhat captivating. I love how the story starts out of the generation of Dinah's mother and her sisters. The details of the land and rituals. Their daily lives. Soon you go finally go into the life of Dinah, as a small child to her path of womanhood and beyond. The truth is, the writing it self is perfect and descriptive enough to fuel your imagination but not encumber it. You actually get to know every woman of the book and feel what they feel. I loved this book even though it was supposedly had biblical roots and inspiring. Religious or not it's a beautiful and intense story."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Well developed characters and highly interesting plotline.It is hard to believe that Diamant created this whole story from just a short mention of Dinah in the Old Testament.

Dinah narrates the story for us and recounts not only her own story, but that of her mothers (Leah, Rachel, Zilpah and Bilhah), her brothers, and her father.I cannot express what a wonderful novel this is. Diamant is an extremely talented author. She managed to take a few simple lines of text from the Old Testament/Hebrew Bible and spin those sparse lines into the most engaging and touching story of a young girl and her family. Diamant brings Dinah to life and makes the reader love Dinah. I cried at parts of this novel and I laughed in others. It's a genuine work of art and Diamant is to be applauded for her work. Simply beautiful and captivating."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Each woman was graced with depth and personality and her own voice. Even the lessor characters were unique and memorable.

A book that you could spend an entire afternoon reading and still be hungry for more."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This is the first &quot;fiction&quot; book that I have read in a very long time. It has more than lived up to my expectations. Almost every woman in my family has read this book, and with good reason. It is a wonderful story, with touching and vivid descriptions of what it is like to be wife, mother, daughter and friend. I was sad to have the story end."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I enjoyed for the most part this work of historical fiction as it was well written and revealed some interesting insights of the biblical story taken from the last half of Genesis. The account of Dinah takes only one chapter almost as a footnote and what happens to her after her unhappy incident that we can only imagine, which is what Anita Diament does most creatively.What I found disappointing was the book taking leave of the theme of the original story and adding themes that are not there. For instance in Genesis Joseph starts as a spoiled child and becomes a man of great moral character who forgives his brothers but the book makes him to be a nice child but becomes a bitter calloused old man who can barely tolerate his family anymore. Also the original account has Joseph resisting the advances of Potifar's wife and being falsely accused and imprisoned though the book would have us believe that Joseph was jailed because he did have an affair with her. Underlying the original account and conspicuously absent from the book is the providence of God in directing the lives of Jacob and his children. The theme of this family (and ultimately a nation) being led by God through numerous hardships but finally being saved from certain starvation is the most interesting one. As Joseph tells his brothers in Egypt near the end of Genesis referring to them selling him into slavery, &quot;You ment it for evil but God ment it for good.&quot;"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"That's exactly what the book is--a journey. It is a timeless one that each and every woman makes, no matter what the culture or the time. Understanding traditions that are different from our own was difficult, even back in Bible times. Share Dinah's journey from girl to grown woman, loved family member to outcast, and back to loved family member once again. This is a book to treasure and a book to share with everyone you know."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This novel is based on the story of Jacob in the Bible, but it is written from a woman's point of view. The story is told by Dinah, daughter of Jacob and his four wives. The Red Tent is where the women go when having their periods or giving birth, so five days out of the month they are in the tent. Not a bad idea if you get bad PMS! Maybe we should bring it back!Anyway, if you are not familiar with the Old Testament of the Bible, you may want to read the story of Jacob first before you read this novel as it will help to make more sense to you. If you are familiar with the Old testament, you will probably enjoy the story more than your typical religious lesson would allow. It is a good way to learn more about the Bible if you find reading the Bible too dry. The author tends to personalize the characters very well which makes them easier to identify with--she makes them more human and realistic. I enjoyed this book!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"A wonderful book overall and a nice job at a very popular theme --giving voice to minor characters. I was surprised that this was not a particularly biblical book. The seed of Judaism is only a small part of the story, and the God of the Bible has no real presence. This is why I do not agree with some reviewers who are upset with the book as \\"not historical fiction,\\" or somehow lacking true biblical knowledge. While I believe Ms Diamant is very familiar with the stories on which this is based, I also believe she was writing fiction - a story from the perspective of a woman at the turn of the 21st century. I found the story compelling and extremely readable."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I was intrigued by this book, especially since I am an archaeology student currently studying Ashara and goddess relgions in the middle east at the moment. Diamant's exploration of the practice of goddess worship is fascinating, since some archaeologists argue that this did indeed take place at the time, and Ashara was seen as a consort of Yahweh (although other scholars argue that Venus statues found at ancient settlements are simply fetish items or household protectors symbolizing feminitiy or fertility, and not goddesses: if you don't know about this interesting research, I suggest you look into it to help make the book clearer! :) ) However, as a story, I was disappointed in the last third, the section that takes place in Egypt. After reading the stories of the men and women in the first two sections, they seemed real and alive (except perhaps for her whirl wind romance with the prince) but when she hit Egypt, the world seemed to become very flat. All the women became kind goddesses (even the nasty ones!) and the men evil villains who thought only of themselves (save her gracious and kind husband.) Likewise, Dinah at the end became very modern and urban, and so did the other women of Egypt. Evidence would suggest that they were still very confined by gender roles, something that didn't come out in the book. Egypt seemed like a women's paradise, which seemed to fall flat. Unfortuante. But I did enjoy the book for the most part."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Friends recommended this story for quite a while before I picked it up. This is a book worth owning in hardcover. I can't believe I didn't &quot;discover&quot; it sooner. This is another book that both thrilled and haunted me. Dinah stays in my heart, long after finishing the book. Bible-reader or not, I highly recommend this story. Its literary value is far beyond simply &quot;Dinah from the Bible.&quot;"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I got this book as a present from my mother-in-law, which surprised me because early on, I saw how open the book was about sexuality, menstruation, womanhood, etc. But I really appreciated the book for the relationships between the female characters and for weaving together what little knowledge is available about the era when goddesses were still venerated. I had already read some books describing what is known and to see that dramatized in such vibrant characters made it a satisfying read. Diamant's writing style is also very fluid and I read the book in 2 nights."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Ms. Diamant left me wanting more. She is a gifted writer. My hope is that she will continue to give us more of the beautiful written word, which she provided in THE RED TENT.

I was disappointed and even occasionally horrified to see the author's treatment of these characters. What surprised me was that I would have expected her to have treated these people--her spiritual forefathers--with the reverence they deserve. (Do we really need to hear about Jacob's wedding nights?)I threw my copy away."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"The author gives the pretense that she is weaving together a tale based upon the little we know of these Biblical women...yet in reality Anita Diamant attempts to rip to shreds any of the facts we do know about these characters. For this reason I find it hard to appreciate much of anything about this book! It would seem the author had an almost malicious pleasure in twisting accounts, for example: the account of Dinah being made a victim through violation by Shechem has been changed by the author into Dinah, instead, falling in love and having consensual sex and being made a victim by her brothers instead! (As they killed Shechem and the men of the land.) Furthermore in the Biblical account Jacob rebukes Simeon and Levi for their actions whereas in this story the author makes him party to their deeds. Not only this but she then writes that afterward Jacob changed his name to Israel to protect himself from being made known as a murderer...which basically spits on the account as Jews and Christians know it.Regardless of what you think about Judaism/Christianity (having seen the tantrums thrown by some reviewers that anyone who has issues with this book is a Bible thumping, narrow minded Christian, and so forth...) I think it should be clear why there are people who do have a problem with this book just based on literary quality. After all, I think most anyone would find it hard to respect an author maligning, twisting and inventing things about *any* person(s) that you know and believe otherwise about.One more note: the overabundance of descriptions on bodily functions and sexual acts gets old very quickly! The author appears to have a rather adolescent obsession with all things sexual, in my opinion."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This book is what we call fiction. It is a reinterpretation.

I can't imagine any Wombon of any faith that would fail to be deeply moved by this WONDERFUL Mistresswork.My favorite parts are the times when they are in the Red Tent and sharing Wombonlore and Goddesslore.

It truely rejoices and celebrates the relationships between women in a family.I recommend it!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Stories about women written in the Bible do not have great detail about their lives. The Red Tent is a detailed story written about what it means to be female during biblical time, primarily in Egypt. The subject of being female is described through generations of a family. The author of The Red Tent is Anita Diamant.The Red Tent is about various generations of women within a family. The story begins with the grandmother's life, which then goes on to the life of the mother, and then describes the meaning of being female with the main character from being a baby to old age. Significant events are described in each woman's life that are meaningful to her as a female, such as marriage and birthing children.Young girls anticipate the beginning of their menstrual period because it is an important time of maturity. In this time period girls are honored and celebrated when they reach puberty, signifying that they have become a woman. When women have their menstrual period they go to the red tent and remain there for several days. Women also go to the red tent to have their baby. Within the red tent, women share emotions, stories, and support to one another. This time in a woman's life is very important and special because it is only women. Having children is highly valued during this time. During the biblical time period men were married to one woman, but fathered children with other women also. In The Red Tent there was a major conflict between two sisters. Leah was married to Jacob, but Rachel was also in love with Jacob. Leah had eight children with Jacob, while Rachel always remained jealous of Leah because she was only able to bear two children with Jacob. Inna was the old wise woman who was the midwife and helped women deliver their babies. Inna knew early on that Dinah (Leah's last child) had potential to be a good midwife. As a young child, Dinah accompanied Inna to births and eventually mentored Dinah to be a well -known midwife. Dinah encountered many life crises as a woman, facing the death of her husband killed by her brothers, and forbidden to reveal her identity as the mother of her own son.The detail and explanation in The Red Tent is very good. The ideas are very well written. Even though the story takes place during the biblical time the words and language are easy to understand. Realism of the characters was pretty good except for the fact that there are so many different characters. With all these characters in the book, it was confusing in the beginning. It was also hard to follow because each character was related to one another in some way. The writer's attitude toward the subject was good. My attention throughout the book wasn't held very well because I had to work hard at keeping track of who the characters were. I liked the subject and theme of the book, but I didn't really like the time period very much. In order to write this book it had to be during the biblical times.The theme of The Red Tent was the development of becoming a woman. Different stages within the lives of women were told through generations. The major theme relates to me because I am becoming a young woman. I am learning about who I am and thinking about what is my purpose in life. I think that a parallel to the purpose of the red tent is the woman's restroom in today's society. Girls go the restroom in pairs or small groups and usually talk about special feelings or secrets during this time. A major difference is that the sharing of wisdom from older generations doesn't happen. There are two events that happen in my family where there is a sharing between the generations of women. One is the ritual of the Sperstad women spending the day after Thanksgiving shopping together. It begins early evening of Thanksgiving with reviewing the advertisements, making lists and planning out the stops for the next day- with a special site for lunch. Another significant event was when my mom held a ceremony for me when I turned sixteen. She invited significant women of many generations (my grandma, my mom, my godmother, my mom's close friend and my best friend). All the members at the ceremony did activities to honor me- for who I am and for being a woman."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"From the moment I picked up this book I was hooked! The Red Tent is superior in it's portrayel of women in that time. I am a Midwife and a Childbirth educator. I give this book to all my clients. I think every woman should read it!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I have never read a piece of fiction with such a vivid description of one's lineage. The chronology, the geneology was so graphic. At times, I was so caught up in the emotions, it was as if I were a member of Dinah's family, and, I suppose, I probebly am. I was initally taken aback by the prologue in which Dinah addresses the reader in a rather sarcastic, chip on the shoulder manner. She ends her story with thanks and blessings in a way that is unfamiliar to me, but then most of what her life was about is unfamialiar to me.The concept and richness of having many mothers to raise her left me feeling as if I had missed out on something valuable in my childhood, not to have such a diversity of maternal guidance.I was moved to tears more than once while reading her story:* When Leah and Jacob's relationship began and was consumated, regardless of her \\"strange\\" eyes and unusually tall physique.* When Leah showed extraordinary compassion toward Ruti and despite all of that, Ruti's horrible death.* As Dinah and Shalem fell in love and their subsequent suffering.* The fierce, loyal bond between Dinah and Meryt, and the loss when Meryt died.* Dinahs' pain of having to let her son go out into the world.I was held captive as she carefully gave me intimate knowledge of each of Laban's daughters. Their features, characteristics, and their relationships are well described, such as Zilhpah's devilsh side, Bilhhah's kind, sensitive, soulful traits, Leah, the practicle one, and Rachel the narcissist.The importance and prestige of a midwife was conveyed throughout the book in various ways.* How each woman related to the others in the Red Tent.* The importance of all the ceremonies within it and the celebrations of womanhood.* The sense of loss when we learn that the rituals will end because of the intermarriages with the \\"foreigners\\".It was interesting also, to learn about the way the men of that time related to each other.* Their custom of heated negotiation and how they deferred to each other with words of flattery and praise.I was amazed at the amount of undeclared power many of the women possessed in the Canaanite society despite their lowly social ranking, and the contrast to the Egyptian social status of women.I was mystified by Dinahs ability to predict the future and curse those who she despised and caused her misery.Diamant created and maintained tension throughout the book made it a compelling read.* The prediction of Dinah's finding her future near the water, the first journey of her family when her father, Jacob was attached in the night by a \\"phantom creature\\".* When Jacob was to meet his brother, Esua for the first time after so many years.* When Dinah is ordered to stay with the grandmother, Rebecca.It was interesting to watch the drasitic change of Jacob's original honest, forthright, noble character to one of a selfish, cruel, and rather eccentric patricarch just before Dinah and Shalem were to be married. It almost seemed as if he was going senile...I'm impressed with amount of research that Diamant must have put into this book. She is a gifted writer who was able to engage me from the first chapter of this book."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"... I would like to make a few comments. I understand you are likely a traditionalist and have great faith, which I respect wholeheartedly. However, I believe you give this book the kind of review that speaks of prejudice and a closed mind that fears others' perspectives. You must acknowledge that biblical stories, whether in the Holy Bible or the Torah, severely lack a female point of view. No matter how far off-base you believe these interpretations are, don't you understand the pure value of different readings of an ancient story? We are all left with many stories untold from our past and it's only human nature to imagine what it might have been like to be a man or a woman from that time. Even if you don't agree with an interpretation, it is only an ungrateful scholar who calls a story teller's literary work \\"trash\\", misspells the crucial character's name, and laments the idea of donating the book \\"lest someone else be inspired by such desecration\\".I loved the book. I released all my faith-based learning and allowed myself to be told a story, as if I were a child. I loved and heard and cried with Dinah. It was a masterfully told story. Yes, it was from the point of view of a woman, surrounded by other women, who were not often in the presence of men in those days except to serve at table and in bed. Yes, some men in the story commit sins and allow fear, jealousy, and hunger for power lead them to do so. But not all the men in the story are hated as you claim. In fact, Dinah is so loving towards her fathers and brothers for the majority of the book that it is even more troubling for the reader in the end to scorn their actions which lead to Dinah's separation from her adored family. But you feel sadness too. You know this family. Even in our own families, we witness bad deeds. To ignore them is unwise; to accept and try to understand them is called love.Have you considered that women reading the Torah or the Bible have felt a similar alienation that you felt reading this work as a man? That we had a limited role in the most revered literary works of the world, that we were shamed easily and could be sold as slaves for the sins of our parents, that we were fully dependent on men for our quality of life? This book at least attempts to fill a gap where women contribute more to the stories of old, where we hear detailed stories instead of vague and cruel descriptions. I dare say it is closer to the truth than the Bible passages that mention Dinah (and acknowledge the wrong-doing of her brothers). Knowing your place in things and knowing the stories of your ancestors reminds you of how the generations have formed one another.No faithful and intelligent person is going to read this story and take it for fact. It's a journey that stands alone, in addition to being a perspective on our past. Your offense to the book saddens me; we are past the age of burning books and lashing out at so-called evil 'feminist' texts.A feminist only means a person who believes women should have equal opportunity to men. That's all. Anything additional is just the belief of that individual. It's not about hating men. It's not about changing everything that's traditional and distorting any truths. In fact, I found joy in celebrating womanhood with the characters in the book and it made me reflect on how insecure most people still are about things that happen often in the lives of women.We are not all the same, and I do not agree with you. And that's okay. Thanks for reading my comments. I hope you take them without defense in your heart, but instead acceptance for the thoughts of others. ..."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Diamant does a remarkable job of portraying the story of Dinah and her four mothers - all married to the same man. I can't verify the historical accuracy of all aspects of the book. However, for me the point was more to learn about the bonding and fellowship of women. While women today enjoy much more freedom and independance, I fear many have lost the closeness shared by these women. Diamant makes the characters so real the reader is able to identify with at least one of them, if not with aspects of each."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"After reading this book, it made me very proud of being a woman. I lent my copy to my mother-in-law and she called me back to tell me how much she loved it. She said it really captured the heart of the mother-daughter relationship.If you know of any woman that is expecting a child and it's a girl, give this book as a gift. Also, don't read it too quickly- savor every word in it."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Anita Diamant's The Red Tent is based on a name just briefly mentioned in Genesis. Her name is Dinah, and her story is told in first-person narrative. Much of the beginning is her mothers' tales, and its purpose is to set the scene and tone of the novel. About halfway through an event occurs that sets this novel rolling. It is an absolutely fascinating departure from other novels out there. Diamant's choice to tell the female viewpoint from a minor character is brilliant. I am no biblical scholar, either. You don't even have to be familiar with any of the names in order to enjoy this historical yarn. I Can't wait to see what else Diamant might have in the works."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This book was hard to put down, I wish I could find more that discuss the bible from a woman's perspective...any suggestions?"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Woke up at 5:30 am just to have more time to read! I really loved this book."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This book was absolutely the most wonderful book ever written. I think Ms. Diamante should re-write the ENTIRE BIBLE ! Dinah's story was magnificent, sad, joyous, humorous, it took you back the ways of these ancient tribes. This book takes you to the very last days of the matriarchal rule. The days when the Goddess entered the &quot;dark moon phase&quot; of her cycle, and Patriarchal Monotheism began to run amuck. It shows how women dealt with the coming of monotheism. I am glad that Dinah and the other women never embraced the &quot;new god of jacob&quot;. I also liked the idea that Jacob and the other men were shown for the true human beings that they were, not the &quot;pious, faultless&quot; people they are made-up to be in the Bible.Take Heart Pagans ! Our NEW AGE has dawned ! The Goddess is back ! and Magick is afoot !"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I have read hundreds of books. I have started, but not finished, thousands. Almost always it's because I lose interest in the book for one reason or another. This is the first book ever that I have thrown down in disgust and refused to read any more.It wasn't because it's a &quot;woman's book.&quot; Most of my favorite authors are women. I can see the value in the repeated awe-filled descriptions of birth and menstruation. I can see how these are mystic experiences, though by the third or fourth or fifth birth, I admit I grew a little weary of the repetition. It did perturb me a bit that, while the women were colorful, complex, well-rendered characters, the men were cardboard brutes. But men have written women in the same manner for centuries, so even if it's an intentional feminist choice instead of the author's weakness, it's understandable, forgiveable. No, that's not why I quit reading.It wasn't the Biblical inaccuracies. Though they are so plentiful and obvious it seems like it would have just been simpler for Ms. Diamant to change her characters' names and written about a contemporary of Dinah, Leah and Rachel. I don't know enough to judge the accuracy of Ms. Diamant's rendering of the time period, but it is convincing and captivating. Eventually, I stopped thinking, &quot;wait a minute...that's not the way it happened,&quot; and just let the author tell her story her way. Actually, I'm kind of glad she did as she did; the people in Genesis are mean and nasty to each other, and wouldn't be much fun to read about. With a few changes, Ms. Diamant takes Rachel and Leah and their horrible rivalry and changes it into something respectable, even admirable.It wasn't the worshipful adoration of paganism, though it's true that bugged me almost to the point of quitting. I know it's true that Rachel and Leah et al probably worshipped gods other than the God of Jacob. But while Ms. Diamant may have the freedom to change the details of the Genesis account to fit her story, but surely she owes some thematic debt to the original telling - whether you consider it simple literature or a sacred text. If there's one major theme you take away from the history of the people of Israel that's called the Bible, it's that pagan gods are their bane, their major weakness. When they get rid of them, they prosper. When they bring them back, they suffer. To treat this bane with such reverence, awe, and admiration is to mock the original work itself. But while this irked me, I lived with it; perhaps she worships pagan gods herself, and desires to rewrite their role in the history of her people (From the titles of her nonfiction books, I'm pretty sure she's Jewish.) OK, understandable. I'll disagree, but I'll keep reading.No, what caused me to throw the book down in disgust was this line in particular:&quot;...'You serve the God of Jacob' was one of the worst insults one man could hurl at another for many generations.&quot;After making Jacob into a weak, violent coward, after (through her narrator) cursing him and all his children and all their children, after taking every major interaction Jacob has with his God and making it ugly and base, she makes the name of God a vile curse in the mouth of the people of the land.What if I were to sit down and write a fictional account of Gandhi and make him a murderer, a liar, a coward, make all his actions not motivated by a higher ideal, but by lust, or greed? Would it matter that this book was fiction and didn't claim to be anything else, or would it still be offensive? Would it even be worth reading, or would you write it off as propaganda and reactionism? I have no illusions about Jacob or his sons -- even the Biblical account of them is far from flattering, and they are not my heroes -- but through this telling, Ms. Diamant has managed not only to spit on their names, but also on the name of the God of Jacob whom they serve.I, too, serve the God of Jacob. And, Ms. Diamant, if you were intending to insult me and my people with this book, you have done so.I'm just astounded so few have noticed."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Can Ms. Diamant write well? Absolutely! Is the story compelling? Yes. But given that she has written a half dozen books on Jewish life I was expecting a story about the richness of Jewish history--something that would be fitting of the patriarchs and their women. I realize that they were far from perfect, but nonetheless, they grasped their faith well enough to hand it down the generations to reach to the twenty first century. Yes, Jacob's wives worshiped the Mesopotamian gods of the time, but I think that he had to have explained his own developing faith in his God to his wives and children, and that didn't come through in this story. Furthermore, I expected that Diamant would describe what to me is the crux of Dinah's life story; the struggle children have with adopting their parent's faith versus finding their own faith. She missed out by not elaborating this timeless dilemma--thus creating an interesting, but rather superficial story."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I was drawn in by the premise of the book, about the little-known Dinah from the bible. It is fascinating how the author takes this sentence and produces a whole novel and life for Dinah----it reminded me alot of how the book Ahabs Wife was written about a woman mentioned in about two sentences in Moby Dick. Like Ahabs wife,this added a new dimension to the original story. This book is fairly fast-paced and easy to read, and spoken in the first person which I am partial to.However, I must say I was disgusted by the detail in the graphic parts......I can see once or twice, but the descriptions of bodily functions got downright redundant. I agree with the readers who compared this to a romance novel.Be prepared for this if you should choose to pick this book up.All I have last to say is to the reader \\"Moon\\" below me----maybe you need to take a dictionary and memorize the word \\"opinion\\"......and realize that people JUST MIGHT have a different one from yours."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"After years of hearing about this book, I had great anticipation of literature at its finest. While the story is compelling, it is written like a romance novel. If you are expecting great spiritual insight with little physical indulgence, you will be disappointed. It has little spiritual insight, and a lot of \\"earthiness.\\""},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Too sexually disrespectful to me towards women. I do love the Bible story, however, I did not like how the author added so much sex into this book...to me, it was very sacrilegious the wonderful Bible story."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"An excellent account from an important Biblical woman's presumed point of view -- her story, left out of his story. Bring your open mind and plan to be very engaged."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"It was so good, I was sad that I had to finish it. Please, write another book like this."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Although you don't have to be familiar with the Old Testament to reap the rich rewards in The Red Tent, it certainly provides an interesting counterpoint to the tale. (The tale can be read from Genesis 25:19 to Genesis 35). What is so rich about The Red Tent is its perspective, precisely, that of Dinah's--a woman before the God of Abraham was the only God around. Indeed, the women of this story have their own gods, their own traditions, their own stories. The power of this book lies in the depth of the storytelling; it is alive, captivating, and rich in the wisdom of women. Take, for instance, this quote where Dinah's mother explains a mysyery to her:&quot;The great mother whom we call Innana gave a gift to women that is not known among men, and this is the secret of blood. The flow at the dark of the moon, the healing blood of the moon's birth--to men, this is flux and distemper, bother and pain. they imagine we suffer and consider themselves lucky. We do not disabuse them. &quot;In the red tent, the truth is known. In the red tent, where days pass like a gentle stream, as the gift of Innana courses through us, cleasning the body of last month's death, preparing the body to receive the new month's life, women give thanks--for repose and restoration, for the knowledge that life comes between our legs, and that life costs blood.&quot; -----page 158I always appreciate a novel that deepens your own perspective, one that calls forth a fuller response to the events of our lives. The Red Tent is such a book. I am certain now that when my own daughters come of age, their will be a ceremony for them that expresses their own connection to the great mother Earth, and her sister the moon. But do not think that this is just a coming of age story for women, because it is not. It is a story woven with the threads of birth and death, love and agony, connectedness and solitude. And its culmination, its last breath, is a glorious sunset of wisdom and words."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Fabulously engrossing book. I was drawn in from the first sentence and could put it down only with extreme difficulty. I was reading at stoplights!The story, told through the perspective of Dinah, daughter of Jacob, gives you the first-hand 'feeling' of what it must have been like to be a woman in biblical times. Dinah tells of her mothers, the men in her life, and the heartache and joy that accompanied her life's direction. People who had, to me, previously only been characters in a book, came alive. Richly drawn, they grew and changed before my very eyes.This is a book that will bear re-reading. Give it as a gift to yourself or someone you love."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This selection of my monthly Book Club was a pleasant surprise. The author has a real gift for prose and the pacing of the story was perfect in keeping the momentum going. I wept and cried with Dinah through each of her heartbreaks. This is a book that will be understood by women at many different levels. It is the story of a being a daughter, a wife, a mother, a lover, and a friend. Dinah is the kind of woman that any modern day woman would want in her life."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"A wonderful, wonderful story! It's readability and strength of its women kept me reading while chores waited, family waited and a beautiful day outside went by. I felt I had been on a journey when I closed the book."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This book was a wonderful interpretation of the Bible Story of Jacob and his family. Anita Diamant reads between the lines of some of the questionable bible stories, and fills in what others may have suspected. It is a modern interpretation of bibical stories, which I suspect is exactly the way that the bible was interpreted throughout the ages. We will never know the truth about what really happened, but this view seems much more likely than the one we are led to believe in the Bible. It's hard to believe that the Bible in its present form is the divine word of God, with all the horendous crimes that were justified in it. Anita tells it the way we would assume the story of Dinah must have happened in her affair with Shalem at Shechem."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Reading this book became as tortuous and unfruitful as the many births within its chapters, and the plot was as lightweight and lifeless as the newborns that appeared on practically each page. Diamant's LANGUAGE (a burst of similes and metaphors in the opening pages) is refreshing at first (&quot;they traded secrets like bracelets&quot; and &quot;her words spilling out like water into sand&quot; and &quot;her cheeks...were high and tight on her face, like figs&quot;), and I fairly salivated in anticipation of the remaining text. By the end of the book, her writing had deteriorated to: &quot;One of his tears fell in my mouth, where it became a blue sapphire, source of strength and eternal hope.&quot;) By this time, Diamant had also gotten her POV (point of view) mixed up, and the reader was suddenly learning the thoughts of other characters, not just Dinah's.I have other problems with this book. CHARACTERS (particularly Tabea) appeared and disappeared suddenly without much point. Based on Joseph's CHARACTERIZATION, we never would have known he was his parents' favorite had not the narrator, Dinah, flat-out declared it was so. For that matter, most of the characters and their relationships were not rounded out. DIALOGUE read more like an endless history lecture of past events and ancestors. PLOTS (particularly the back-plot of how Jacob deceived Esau of his birthright) were referred to without revealing details. O.K., O.K., maybe the point was for the reader to look it up in the Bible (I was already familiar with most of the story, but I kept a pile of five books nearby to refe to while reading The Red Tent to check on accuracy and historical detail)Most troubling was the fact that the author focused more on the small details of the women's lives rather than allow the reader to experience first-hand the cause-and-effect of the story (e.g., the killings in Shecham). How more effective the long-delayed PLOT might have been had not most of it happened &quot;off stage.&quot;That being said, I stuck with the book, found some interesting parts to enjoy, and--most of all--had fun using The Red Tent as a catalyst to dig into my other books to re-read about the origin of patriarchy, ancient female goddesses, scientific creationism, and familiar Bible stories. I know enough not to be smug that I live in post-feminist modern times--we'll always have our badly dysfunctional families."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I think there's no greater accomplishment as a writer than to be able to combine history with fiction. Especially when the book involves history from a long, long time ago, incorporates biblical references and emerges a masterpiece.The Red Tent introduces Dinah as the book's protagonist. If you've read the Bible from beginning to end (I did that when I was 8 and again, have no idea why), you'll recall that Dinah is only mentioned briefly. Using Dinah as the narrator, Diamont crafts a story around Dinah's large family, bringing to life her relationships with her mothers, father, brothers and true love.In my top ten of all time.See my full review and others at: http://laurareviews.blogspot.com"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I had often picked up this book but never read it until it was given to me as a Christmas gift. As an agnostic, I was completely turned off by its biblical theme. However, I was completely wrong! This is an amazing, female-affirming read that, if anything, offers a serious critique of the patriarchy read about in the Bible. Anyone who is interested in reading a thoughtful, poweful book about the feminine and how it manages to survive in the face of patriarchy, this is the book for you!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"After many years, this has remained one of my favourite books to date. It is beautifully written with such delicacy that makes it touching and unforgettable. Essentially, it is a love story, but with emphasis on family, tradition, and faith. While at first, it was a little off-putting to have to read Dinah's mothers' story, any doubt was quickly dispelled due to the captivating lives of these women (though their names are biblical, they are ultimately fictional). It is admirable how the author can take a few obscure passages from the Bible and weave a story such as this.You are made aware, right from the start, that it will all end in tragedy yet by the time it happens, the book has more than familiarised you with Dinah's family - each individual quirks and characteristic and memory - that you can not help but hope for a happy-ending for them all nonetheless. It is not all doom and gloom, however. You are occasionally treated to some humour, and a stunning portrayal of a time and way of life that is not taught in history lessons, with profound insights into the nature of the human spirit. Inspiring and breathtaking."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"The Red Tent was captivating. It reminds me of the quote that a fire that burns quick, quickly burns out. This book was a slow fire that grew into a wild fire. It is unlike any recently written novel. The story was so unusual and it took you to places that you could not even imagine. The book is addicting and I can hardley wait to read it again!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"The highly distilled accounts from the Bible often leave the reader wanting much more, and Diamant's novel told from a female perspective satisfies that desire. What is lacking from the biblical version are details, characterization, and the feminine voice. We get all three in &quot;The Red Tent,&quot; providing plenty of fodder for discussion.Some of the enigmas in the original text include the relationship between Jacob and Leah. How did Jacob react to his first wife after being duped by Laban? What possessed Rachel to steal her father's images? Those and others are answered by Diamant.While some of the characters rang true to their biblical personas in my mind, such as Laban (right on!), others seemed so divergent as to be almost unrecognizable. I particularly had trouble with Rebecca. A complex character, to be sure, who used subterfuge to see that Jacob received Isaac's blessing over Esau, she is portrayed as a charismatic prima donna with the power to heal. She is all but unapproachable by the other female members of her clan. It was hard to imagine the warm and gracious young maiden portrayed in the Bible could become such an aloof matriarch. I look forward to reading Orson Scott Card's &quot;Rebecca,&quot; (Women of Genesis series) for a comparison.The weaknesses of the male characters are emphasized in &quot;The Red Tent,&quot; which should not come as a surprise, since the focus is female. The virtues of the prophets, Isaac, Jacob and Joseph, are challenged by Diamant. It was disheartening (and in direct contradiction to the Bible) to think of their characters being so flawed.It is interesting to compare this book with Orson Scott Card's &quot;Sarah.&quot; Idolatry and pagan rites played such a significant role in each of these novels, particularly for the women. Surely both of these authors researched the period, and their agreement on the pervasiveness and practice of idolatry is confirming. Card points out that Asherath, the mother goddess, was a corruption of Mother Eve. It appears that there was a struggle for monotheism even within the tents of the Hebrew prophets."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Ok, I know this sounds a little corny, but I must say that this book really is like a tapestry. The female characters are so multi faceted and realistic that I became immediatly engrossed in the story and found that I had a very difficult time putting it down. However, I would really not reccomend this book to a man simply because I feel that it is more geared toward women; I don't think men would be able to relate to Dinah in a way that would help them feel the story.I'm not a religious woman, so I actually debated whether or not I wanted to read this novel because I was afraid that it would be too religious for my taste. I am VERY glad that I decided to read it as it was wonderful. The book does mention religion, but it isn't crammed down your throat as I feared.A wonderful read!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This is a fabulous book. So much so, you do not want it to end. It puts you right alongside Dinah throughout the events in her life. It enlightens you to the way of life in the biblical days.You feel like you are there.I have recommended it to all my friends! Thank you Ms Diamant for such an entrancing story!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This book is a lovely portrayal of the oldest story. Dinah, the only daughter of Jacob, was heretofore referred to in the Bible in only one chapter, which tells the story of her trip to Shechem and subsequent affair with Shalem, one of its nobles. It is a brutal, violent passage (Genesis 24, I think) and not very pleasent. This book is an imaginative retelling of Dinah's story, from a what-might-have-happened perspective.It begins with the story of her four mothers: Leah, her biological mother; Rachel, her aunt, who trains her for midwifery; Zilpah, referred to the in Bible as Rachel's handmaid; and Bilhah, referred to as Leah's handmaid. In this book, however, Zilpah and Bilhah are the biological sisters of Leah and Rachel, unacknowledged by their pig of a father, Laban. All these women are the wives of Jacob. It tells of their lives before Jacob, after Jacob, and up to Dinah's birth. At that point, the story shifts to her.She is the only daughter of four women, the mothers of a combined eleven sons: Reuben, Simon, Levi, Naphtali, Issachar, Judah, Zebulun, Gad, Asher, Dan, Joseph, and Benjamin, although the last of the boys Dinah never knew. In a world so populated by men, Dinah's mothers pass their histories to her, including things she was too young to know. This book contains all that history in accompaniment and counterpoint to Dinah's own. When her history separates from theirs, however, it contains solely hers; it does not presume to know theirs. This book tells the &quot;true&quot; story of the events in Shechem. It is not much different from the Biblical account, but it tells the human story, with the true human emotinons so often lacking in the Bible.That is one thing that is of note in this book: it never really deviates from scripture. That is, it doesn't alter what is written there. It exacerbates it, adds on to it, makes it more interesting, adds what it may have &quot;left out&quot; but never changes what is there. This is an excellent, very interesting, well-written book."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Anita Diamant does a great job of retelling the story of Dinah from the book of Genesis. The story is told in Dinah's voice and from the point of view of the women around her. This is a story about mothers, daughters, husbands, and sons. I specifically liked the details about the food and farming, social organization, and medical practices of the time. I was able to easily imagine the caravans, midwives, artisans, and slaves.This would be a difficult read for those who take the bible literally -- but for me, it makes me wonder what the bible would read like if it were written by women.This is a clever idea -- I like it when a author retells a story from a different perspective. I recommend Sena Jeter Naslund's, &quot;Ahab's Wife&quot; and Jeanne Rhy's, &quot;Wide Sargasso Sea&quot; if you are interested in a different perspective from either of the classic tales: &quot;Moby Dick&quot; or &quot;Jane Eyre.&quot;"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I loved this book because being raised in Catholic school I never learned about woman in those times. It made me feel great to learn that in those times woman were strong and wise, not that I ever had a doubt about that."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Books that recreate worlds that are largely lost to us can be hard to read. Many people find history to be a rather dull subject. But, in fact, Ms. Diamant has created not only an extremely readable tale but she has actually done it so well that I have found myself refering back to this book as if it is a history book rather than fiction. An excellent rendering of and old testament story."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"We don't know much about the women in the Torah, since it is mostly told from the viewpoint of men. This fictional account of Dinah and her mothers may not be historical fact, but since it relies heavily on facts in the Torah up until the murder of Dinah's &quot;husband&quot;, it can almost be taken as history.The Red Tent also had a couple of passages that actually made me cry, not an easy thing to do with words."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I read the book a few months ago, and realize now that it has done something more for me than just take up a week's worth of my night reading time. It has made me think. Thoughts such as &quot;yes, the bible does tell a very, very short rape story about Dinah. Why?&quot;...on to &quot;how much of history has been told by men?&quot; uh-huh...and then on to &quot;how the lucky conqueror get's to keep his stories from being burned or being omitted from libraries&quot;...yup. &quot;is there something to the rise and recognition of women's voices today in every area of media?&quot; and so on...More than just an enjoyable piece of fiction, The Red Tent is also excellent herstory literary work that gives voice to women's healing, compassionate and nurturing purposes in society and the world. All other readings of apocrypha, philosophy, spirituality, world religions, scifi, historical fiction, and non-fiction are put into new contexts---what would would be the women's point of view? This angle in analyzing reading materials or even in a real-life problem solving situation is a new way of finding the balance or making the balance in the case at hand."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I LOVED The Red Tent. I was concerned that it would read like the King James Version of the Bible (so-and-so begot who, and so-and-so begot who-else), but instead of being cryptic and difficult to follow, it flowed so easily. The pictures Diamante painted where truly poetic. She added so many more nuances to everyday exchanges and occurances than I ever would have attributed to them. The commonplace became profound. - And that's just the language used to tell the story.The story itself was riveting. I wanted it to go on and on. This is the kind of book that makes most other things I read very ordinary."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Like many of the other reviewers, I too trashed the book out of complete frustration with Diamant's inaccuracy as well as her complete disregard, even blasphemy, for the God of the Jews. Yes, I said Jews, for do they not worship the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob? Is not Diamant a Jew? I highly question her beliefs as being anything but self-conjured thoughts fitting of her own feminist agenda, having nothing to do with the actual God of the Bible and his love of the nation Israel. In The Red Tent, Diamant treats the name of God as a CURSE. Is this a sign of a true follower of God the Almighty, who was and is and is to come? My heart hurt when I read her continual disregard, criticism and blasphemy of the Creator, giving more respect to the rituals of female menstruation and idol-worship than to the mighty, yet merciful, characteristics of God our Father. Does she not know how the nation of Israel began? With a covenant, a promise, from the Almighty God to an undeserving, sinful people, that he would protect them and make them a great nation. And God has kept his covenant with Israel, even when they so often turned from him and worshipped other gods. He brought them out of Egypt to the promised land. And He promises to come again to rescue his people and triumph once and for all over the nations of the world. To this God, the God of the Jews, Ms. Diamant offers her work of condescension and blasphemy. In stereotypical feminist fashion, she attributes one-dimensional patriarchal chauvinism to Jacob and his sons. What is much worse, she goes so far as to attribute the same earthly characteristics of Jacob to the Almighty God, Who is not human, nor was He made from human hands (as were the idols she glorifies in her book). If I wrote such powerfully blasphemous words, I would fear the great judgment of the Creator who demands glory and abhors man's prideful nature. But instead, may the God of heaven show her as much mercy as He has shown the nation of Israel, and me. And may Ms. Diamant come to truly know the forgiveness, grace, and love of the King of kings and Lord of lords."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This book does a horrible diservice to the Word of God. Among other things, it had quite a few significant Biblical inaccuracies in it. Dinah was raped, not fell in love and had premarital sex. The Bible doesn't depict Joseph as bisexual. The book portrays God as cruel, glorifies pagan goddesses, and describes bestiality by the shepherds. The author didn't even try to base the book on the Bible (but felt it was okay to \\"borrow\\" their characters). When I looked at Anita Diamant reader's notes for the book, she states \\"My research focused on the everyday life of women in this period of history, in the ancient Near East. I did not study the Bible or rabbinic sources, but concentrated instead on the food, clothing, social organisation, architecture, and medicine of the era (c. 1500 BCE).\\" The sad thing is some people will read the book and mistakenly think it is Biblically accurate."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"While this book is beautifully written and presents a unique persona-point-of-view, it does not fit into the category of Christian Fiction by definition. Most Christian fiction presents a person in situations that lead him into a more intimate relationship of God and Christ. While this book portrays interesting facts about cultural practices of societies in Biblical times, it does not do as I described above. It also greatly deviates from the Biblical descriptions of Jacob and his family. Rebecca was not a pagan prophetess and Joseph was not a petty man full of himself and his power while a vizier of Egypt. I don't believe this book should be listed under the category of Christian fiction. It is misleading."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"It went on and on until I could not take much more and stopped at page 136, lord knows I tried to get through it.

If you like girl movies this book is for you."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"The ONLY reason I read this is because a post-menopausal lady I worked with at the time said, \\"Hey this book is great you'll love it! You have to read it and tell me what you think - my book club is reading it!

Last time I ever made that mistake.Can we all say \\"depressing novel worse than Clan of the Cave Bear\\"? I thought Clan was depressing because Ula (or whatever her name was)had a totally crummy cavewoman lifestyle and she was shunned by her cave people etc. etc. - but I guess things probably didn't change TOO much by the time of Jacob's technicolor dreamcoat. (There's a reason that Dinah is only mentioned ONCE in the Old Testament - let's not hype her up like she's Judith m'kay?) Not only does this book involve a whole lotta biblical time raping and loved-ones dying left and right, but it even ends depressing. And every \\"time of the month\\", during the \\"red wave\\", all the women get sent to a \\"red tent\\" to bleed together in and bathe in. that's about it.If you want a really good novel about women growing up or whatever . . . read Maya Angelou's I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings. Way better than Red Tent! - and the heroine of Caged Bird is obviously more believeable with real life experiences we can relate to more than Dinah's \\"story\\"."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"The author has written a fascinating novel. However, it is extremely important to realize that it is only a novel. She has taken the stories of the Bible and using her own words and thoughts has created an extremely distorted version of the lives of our Patriarchs and Matriarchs. In many places she directly contradicts the Bible and its commentaries. It is important to note that these people were extremely holy and G-D fearing people whose lives were dedicated to serving their creator NOT random gods and goddesses as the author depicts. It is audacity to try and bring their lives down to our level and to try and portray how their lives were. G-D only wrote the stories that would teach us how to live our lives, not a word more not a word less. Furthermore, in no Biblical source do we learn about their personal inner physical relationships and it is an embarrassment to them to make it up.

After finding this book at my grandma's house I was shocked by the bestiality, adult men going for prepubescent girls, and other disgusting uses of sex in a book with such a classy cover and biblical bent. I think my family has successfully snuck the book out of grandma's house so she wouldn't read it--what a shocker that would have been! She must have thought it was a Christian book because of the Biblical context. How completely wrong that presumption is.I love books that introduce sex and romance in a way that makes it beautiful and, well, actually a turn on--but the sexual acts described in this book are disgusting. I'd list them...but why completely disgust you in a review? Besides, I put it down after the first few chapters. Ultimately I was the most sickened by the weak female characters that were hampered by society and completely incapable of shaking off the limitations placed on them by men. I know that part might be accurate (if you overlook the women heroes of the bible, like Judith and Ruth and her mother), but I want a higher class of hero in my reading."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"The story was interesting but the writing lacked depth and creativity. A predictable list of Dinah's life events."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I agree with the voices who are displeased with this book. WHile Ms. D. is a talented writer, she did not research this book accurately at all. The book has a huge anti-male bias. In fact, the only men who are portrayed positively are Shechem (the rapist), Esav (a murderer she describes as a &quot;baby-faced cutie&quot;) and Dina's eventual Egyptian lover. It is interesting to note that Ms. Diamant is married to a convert. Maybe she does't like Jewish men? (In her book they are all stupid, spaced-out, smelly, sexually selfish, and self-centered). I wish she would have read Genesis before writing this. It is completely fictional, and not at all reflective of what occurred, namely the rape of a CHILD! (Dina was 8 at the time)"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I started this book but never finished it, after being greatly bothered by the biblical discrepancies in this book. It's one thing for the author to \\"fill in the gaps\\" and provide a work of fiction based on biblical fact, but it's a whole other deal for the author to change biblical fact to fit her work of fiction. Dangerous!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Let me admit first that I did not finish the book. I lost interest in the author's style of writing.I commend the author for her seemingly accurate and exact portrayal of biblical customs and cultures. It was quite interesting to read of the basic yet complicated tasks the women had to perform on a daily basis. The women of that day put our high-powered career women to shame.There were two things I strongly disliked about the authors writing. First, the entire tone of the book (including the title) and the style in which it's written carries with it an overpowering feminist tone. I get the impression the author wrote the book with the intent to show how powerful women are, and how much power they carry even though men strut around pretending to be in charge. The message of \\"sisterhood\\" becomes sickening eventually and that's one element that made me stop reading. I love being a woman. But we need men. We compliment men and they compliment us. Without men the world would be one flighty, silly catfight of a red tent.The second reason I stopped reading (and the most offensive to me) is that Ms. Diamant attributes the birth of Isaac to Rebecca to a false goddess. She (Ms. Diamant) has complete freedom to write any way she chooses. I fully expect her to change and embellish in any way she wants. But for a Jewish woman to take a biblical event as important and prominent in the bible as God's promise to Abraham to bear him a son through the aging Rebecca and attribute it to a figment of her imagination she calls a \\"goddess\\" is highly offensive to me and should be to her. Certainly it's her right to do that but it makes me wonder WHY someone would do that. What would the motivation be behind wanting such a significant event in biblical history that's an act of the One and Only True God to be attributed not only to a false god but a \\"godDESS\\"? My only conclusion is that Ms. Diamant suffers from thinking of her sex more highly than she ought and not thinking enough of the Father God that made her."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I chose to read this book, because I usually love fictional stories that elaborate on Bible stories. I like to imagine what it must have been like had I actually lived at that time. However, I was disappointed with this book, because the known Biblical facts were altered--several of them. The only known Biblical fact concerning Dinah, the main character of the book, is that she was raped. This is not the story line. Another reason that I did not like this book was that the father of the nation of Israel, Jacob, is not presented in a light that I would say was respectable. If you are considering this book for a \\"Christian\\" read, think again. The facts are altered, even perverted at times, and the One True God is overshadowed in this book by other gods and idols worshipped by the women of the Red Tent."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"In sophomoric prose, the author attempts to recreate what life was like for women in Biblical times. For example, the phrase she uses to describe women nursing their children is \\"giving suck.\\" It describes the story of Dinah who had sexual relations with Sechem outside of marriage. Later Sechem and his father Hamar try to make reparations offering both the traditional bride price for Dinah and a marriage between Dinah and Sechem. Jacob, Dinah's father agrees. Later, Dinah's brothers renege and kill Hamor's male relatives and steal their worldly possessions. This does not portray the Israelites in a very good light by modern sensibilities. But it does open an interesting anthropological window on the times. This is a far more interesting story to google than to get out of this dreary chick-lit attempt at historical fiction."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"To all religious Jews and conservative Christians who are considering reading \\"The Red Tent\\", I issue a warning: you will find the premise of this book deeply offensive, as I have. It takes the biblical narratives of the Patriarchs and Matriarchs of the Jewish people and twists them so that Jacob, Rebecca, Rachel, and Leah are portrayed as idolaters who worship Mesopotamian gods and have only the basest possible morality. It is a feminist \\"retelling\\" of one of the chief stories of Genesis, presenting biblical men in the worst possible light, with Jacob as a greedy, lustful, misogynistic self-seeking weakling. The historical accuracy of this book is also practically non-existant; Rachel is made a blonde, which is obsurd considering that she lived in ancient Mesopotamia, which is today modern Iraq. One of the few saving graces of this book is that the writing is superb; but it is not enough to convince you to wade through this river of lies."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"What do you call an author who turns a rape into a love story, idealizes pagan goddesses, and calls Jacob and his sons \\"barbarians\\"? \\"Jewish feminist\\"? Hardly!! Anita Diamant's story mocks and distorts the Torah (and therefore Judaism). Furthermore, if it's now considered \\"feminist\\" to say of Dinah (or any rape victim) that \\"she wasn't raped, she wanted it,\\" then something is very, very wrong indeed."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I absolutely loved it!I recommend &quot;Queenmaker&quot; by India Edgehill as another great biblical fiction work."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This is one of the best books I've found for triggering a desire to look further into the historical stories presented in the Bible. While Ms. Diamant's story may be fiction, it does get one's creative ideas flowing when it comes to those women mentioned only in passing in the Bible. Her take on the story of Dinah (pronounced Dee-nah) from her parents beginnings (Leah and Jacob as well as Rachel and their two handmaidens) to her own beginnings throughout her life to the end of her days is one of passion, commitment, betrayal, and reconciliation. It takes one small passage of scripture and illuminates the &quot;could have beens&quot; for us in today's world. It once again shows that one of the best books in which to find stories of human drama is the Bible. A great read!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"maybe dinah falls to the backround like Jephtha's daughter in the Torah, but here in Diamant's novel, Dinah is very much in the fore ground, narrating the story of Jacob from her point of view. If you have ever wondered about the women of the bible, who are merely glazed over, you will thouroughly enjoy this book. (an extra star if you ever went to Hebrew school, attend Shul on Pesach, or could name the 12 tribes in your sleep)"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I laughed,I cried, and I marveled at the life and loves of Dinah. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to transport herself to the world of long ago, and learn about the women who lived and loved there."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"The Red Tent left me with ambivalent feelings.All in all, I found this an intriguing story.However, as a student of the bible, I was sad to see God left out of this story. Was it a sacrilege to use the revered characters of the bible to spin a tale the likes of &quot;Clan of the Cavebear&quot;? Or: was this an example for us that the characters of the bible were ordinary people struggling through life just like us? Was the &quot;worldliness&quot; of this story representative of what a challenge lay before the sons of Abraham in developing faith in the God of their father?Overall, a thought-provoking and entertaining story."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Men you may not be ready for this. Women you will love reading of DInah and a new role for women. Did it happen? We don't know. Just like we don't know if women had a role in the Knight Templars (defenders of the Holy Grail). If you enjoy women of power, read this book. You will also enjoy Defenders, as it has a Crusader heroine and a modern divorced heroine."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Told in the first person, but with a objective voice, this unique story gives a very thought-provoking view of a Biblical story. A very refreshing read."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I first read this when i was 13- my aunt suggested it. I think it's GREAT! I understand why religious people have objections- biblical characters are &quot;pagans&quot; and practise idolitry. I, not being religious, have no objections to this and think that people should get oer it. When the first read the book, they should have noticed &quot;Biblical Fiction&quot; written somewhere. They read it and should not complain for their own misgivings. Here's some tips-Don't read it if you have religious objections to biblical characters being interpreted differently.-Don't read if you have issuse about blood and birth.Another thing is, I liked the Red Tent because of the actual red tent. Wwomen need a private place now, and they did then as well. They also needed secrets- the only female secrets then were birth and menses. I am a women reader, and I appreciate the consideration given to women's monthly trouble.All in all, the book is great, but people with problems about their religion being rejected sghouldn't read it. I loved it."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I really enjoyed reading this book. It has a great story, and the writing is very good. The vivid descriptions really make you feel that you were there. When &quot;Deena&quot; spends years in isolation, you actually feel the boredom and time slipping away. I'm not sure why I don't rate this 5 stars--it doesn't quite make my list of the very best books I've ever read. Maybe because of the ending--it seemed a bit lackluster and not in pace with the rest of the book."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"i thought this book was inspiring. it amazed me how Diamant could have included Dina as part of genesis story and tell the biblical version in her point of view. i have read the bible and believe that this is a great novel for both believers and non-believers. it is long but totally worth the time to read. may God bless and keep you always."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Technically, The Red Tent is a biblical tale, but in truth, it is much more. While Anita Diamant took the character names and their basic situation from the Book of Genesis, she manages to transcend that simple story, adding flesh and vitality, breathing life into it. And who better than a female author to bring the story of daughters and mothers to life?In fact, the very title is evocative of this life-giving role, for it was here, within the red tents, that women separated to during menstruation and childbirth. Although Diamant is re-imagining a story originally told by men, she liberates the characters, allowing each woman her own flaws, gifts and story.\\"I had four mothers, each of them...giving me different gifts, cursing me with different fears.\\" So begins the complex tale of not only Dinah, Jacob's only surviving daughter, but also of all the women in her life, including the four sisters who are Jacob's wives - Leah, Rachel, Zilpah and Bilhah. Diamant begins with the stories of Dinah's mothers, sharing her fascination over sisters who love, admire, tolerate, counsel, resent and share the same husband. Because Diamant gives each woman such a distinct personality, Dinah's relationship with each is equally unique.Through their stories, a veritable oral history in writing, we learn of the sisters' complex relationships with each other and with Jacob. At times, and perhaps rightly so, Jacob seems to serve merely as a catalyst for the development of the relationships between his wives, and eventually Dinah herself. The female inter-relations transcend even his role as patriarch of this extensive family. When Bilhah offers to bear a son for Jacob on Rachel's behalf, \\"she was lonely walking into her husband's tent alone, without sisters\\".Through Dinah's own story, which comprises the remainder of the novel, the story becomes more personal, transmitting the poignancy of loss, the complexity of love and the strength of forgiveness. Whereas previously this story was about jealousy, wrath and punishment, through Dinah's voice, it becomes one of love, understanding and growth.The Red Tent is Diamant's answer to the question: \\"What if a woman told this biblical story?\\" Her answer is a story lyrical in prose, compelling in the telling and visceral for its scenery and emotion. As Dinah explains at the close of her tale, \\"there is no magic to immortality.\\" Readers will discover, however, that there is magic in the story."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"There has been a recent jump in the number of fictional accounts of the Patriarch Jacob, his ancestors and his progeny. Diamant's \\"The Red Tent\\" is one of these though told through a female voice. The voice is that of Dinah and her story here is far different from the one you'll encounter in the Biblical text. This could be offensive for some readers so if you personally believe the Bible to be the unerring word of God, don't get this book because you will not like it. However, if you like conflict between peoples, power struggles between the sexes, some fair historical speculation, and a good deal of sorrow, then you may enjoy this book. Dinah herself is an engaging character and her recounting of generations of females memories was an intriguing way to tell this story."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I put off reading this book for a long time, because I was put off by thinking it was just a &quot;Bible&quot; story. Finally I had nothing else to read, and picked it up (and never put it down!)It was a wonderful story of women, through the eyes of women, in biblical times, and it put a whole new slant on old stories that came back to me from Sunday School. The characters were so real that I hated many of them immensely, and loved others even more. I cried at the end, both for the characters and for the simple reason that it was over.At 1 AM on the night I finished, I found myself in the crawlspace under our house, finding my long packed away Bible. Comparing the two versions of the same story just added more to Anita Diamant's wonderful story."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Diamant has used the 34th chapter of Genesis as the setting for her story &quot;The Red Tent.&quot; That the story is based upon characters in the Bible may distress some readers. Much of the story is drawn from the short description of Dinah and her family, in the book of Genesis, but the work is decidedly fictional. She does a wonderful job of breathing life into her characters and provides intricate detail about the sights, smells, and daily routines of a time and place so remote to most of our experiences, that they cannot help but be fictional. Many of the details that she provides are what brings the story to life and gives dimensionality to the characters. Whether they are historically accurate is unknowable, and for many readers, irrelevant. Her characterizations of the males in the story are shallow, but perhaps she does so because it is a story about the lives of women in a time when they had little contact with the realities of men. Through her inattention to their characterological development, she illustrates what she apparently feels are the complexities and values of a society of women whose lives occur only tangentially to those of men. Her attention to the small details of these womens' lives gives her characters dignity and a voice that is rarely heard in a literary tradition that values accomplishment and independence in women. Her writing style is quiet. She is gentle and nonjudgemental in her descriptions of people and events, and portrays her characters and situations with a complexity that reveals much emotional and psychological depth. I found the story to be touching and honest, and I was truly sad when it was over. This book would not be a good choice, however, for people who might be offended by her scriptural or historical liberties."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Anita Diamant's fiction tale of Dinah, sole daughter of Jacob is so empowering to women. I found myself never putting it down, I finished it in several days. I am not of the Christian denomination, but the way in which she portrays the strength and comaraderie of women and the ancient rituals of celebrating one's woman-ness, made me want to raise my daughter with a sense of female pride that I never had. As Dinah and her large family of Jacobites wander the desert in search of camp and spirit and independence from her unsavory grandfather, she and her four mothers weave spiritual beauty out of their mundane and dusty daily lives. I highly recommend that every woman read this and get reacquainted with the ancient female role as wife, mother, daughter and midwife and discover the enchanting escape in this wonderfully spun tale. It is very easy to read and follow. Thank to Ms. Diamant for being brave and branching outside of her normal scope of writing to bring this piece of joy to my library!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I was kind of turned off on the concept of the book before I actually started reading it. I thought being a biblical fictionalized story it might be preachy and force the author's values onto the reader. Boy was I wrong. This is a class-A, top notch story told with such deep character development that it was so easy to picture what life was like in the Genesis-times and to picture each of the many characters. I laughed, I cried, I got angry...this book takes you through so many wonderful powerful emotions.I could not put this book down and I am so glad that I read it. We read it in our book club and it was unanimous that it is an excellent novel. I highly recommend it for every female out there who likes to read. You will not be disappointed in the slightest."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"After reading a brief description of this work in O magazine, I purchased the book and could not put it down! Fictionally narrated by Dinah, Jacob's only daughter, the author not only reveals intimate details of Dinah's life, but also provides readers with a glimpse of what life might have been like for females in biblical times. Although I am not a regularly practicing Jew, the book did leave me with a strong desire to know more about my religion and explore my roots! I definitely recommend this wonderfully engaging book to any woman, regardless of religious orientation. After finishing the work I hope all women are left with the same strong,feminine feeling and bond with this biblical figure that I experienced!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I lead a bookclub of women and was so glad to have heard of The Red Tent and shared it with them. This book provided us some of the most enjoyable discussion of the last year and a half. Unlike reviewer Margaret, I found the detail of the daily lives of the women fascinating and an integral part of the book, helping me picture a nomadic, patriarchal, desert life of thousands of years ago (something very different, and yet very much the same as ours today). I think Anita Diamant did an excellent job of expanding a series of Biblical events into a work of fiction from the viewpoint of one minor character. Her characters were rich and multi-dimensional for the most part, and the viewpoint created was unique. While much liberty was taken in describing the events, it never strayed to the point of contradicting the events as they appeared in the Bible. Several of our group members, myself included, were compelled to reread Genesis in order to refresh our memories. This was just the book I needed to read at this point in my life. The births were not tedious, but the central events in the life of a midwife (and indeed in a part of the Bible where &quot;begats&quot; are such a huge part of the story). While there are tragic events in Dinah's life that left me feeling disturbed and bleak, the book mirrors real life and winds to a satisfying and uplifting conclusion. I enjoyed every bit of it and couldn't wait to pick it up each night until I was finished."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I did not know what to think about this book at first. I had heard many good things, but I am not generally a fan of historical fiction, so I almost passed it up. Thank goodness I did not!This novel showed so many biblical events and people from a very &quot;real&quot; perspective. It fascinated me to see things from the eyes of Dinah and feel things from her point of view. What an incredible job Diamant did of making the characters come alive! I was sad when the book ended--I hope she writes more!Some people may find that Diamant's interpretations of biblical events and people do not agree with their own. Hooray, I say! What better way to learn and think and grow? As I read this novel, I kept referring back to my bible to check things out and compare. It was a wonderful reading experience. I enjoyed every moment of this book."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I evaluate so much of what I read by Atticus Finch's standards--I want what I read to help me step into another [person's] shoes and walk around in them. The Red Tent allows a reader to do just that. We plunge into a world of remarkable sensuality and unrelenting activity. We live and breathe what it means to be a woman in Biblical times, and in so doing we think long and hard about what it is to be a woman at any time. Right now. In addition, this novel is compulsively readable. Evocative and clear, Diamant's prose does what good writing should do. It takes us into the hearts and minds of its character, and it takes us to places both foriegn and familiar. We breathe sighs of recognition and of awe."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I liked the point of view of this book, and the very rich description, but did not find it so compelling that I couldn't put it down. I was less concerned with what would happen than with the narrator's perspective. I liked the lesser (female) characters of these age-old tales being given center stage, and look forward to Diamant's next book."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I loved this book. It is a fabulous account of &quot;realism&quot; within the bible. I have studied many forms of religion and it all seems to point toward some form of Judaism. Anita Diamant has hit home with this novel. It is a wonderful account of Women within the religous world of Men. I hope she writes another."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Diamant paints an elaborate word picture of the world of the patriarchs. Many of her characters are simultaneously captivating and sympathetic. Nonetheless, anyone remotely familiar with the Genesis text can't help but compare the two and find Diamant's story lacking. What makes other historical/biblical works of fiction successful is the writer's ability to transport imaginary characters into an historically accurate setting. Diamant places her imaginary characters into a psuedo biblical setting that completely conflicts with the Genesis text. Hers is a whimpy, whiny Joseph whose rise to power can only be described as serendipitous. Gone is the beauty of forgiveness, \\"What you meant for evil, God meant for good.\\" In its place we are given an old man suffering from Alzheimer's and a son who can't get away quick enough. A story about the life and world of the otherwise little known Dinah was indeed a compelling idea. Too bad, Diamant fell short in her delivery."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I had seen \\"The Red Tent\\" gracing the bestseller pages for a number of weeks before I eagerly opened the book -then struggled through my boredom to finish it.\\"The Red Tent\\" is a historical fiction which tells the story of Dinah, Jacob's daughter who is briefly mentioned in the Bible. The novel details everyday life for women of Biblical times, filled with love, religion and harsh lessons, and spans many generations.So what's wrong with it? Plenty.It appears Diamant has tried to create an epic novel as well as a novel that provides a female perspective from traditionally patriarchal subject matter, and has failed to do either. The first two thirds of the book are repetitive in recounting the everyday lives of Jacob's wives, from the women's rituals during menstruation to bedding Jacob and cooking meals. None of the characters are fully explored, so the reader always feels separate from the story.What's right with it?The last third of the novel becomes interesting, as the setting and characters change. With these changes it appears that Diamant isn't so overwhelmed with trying to create a mystical \\"woman's\\" story that she finally can relax and write something enjoyable.Do not read this novel expecting a great historical fiction that fills the silences in the Bible with an interesting female perspective that turns your perception of Biblical times on its head. Diamant tries too hard to be a historical fiction and ends up sounding forced and dull. If you want to read great historical fiction, try any of the books by Marion Zimmer-Bradley such as \\"The Firebrand\\" or \\"Mists of Avalon\\"."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"As a film writer/director who has adapted a number of biblical narratives for television, I can attest to the fact that the most difficult aspect of &quot;humanizing&quot; biblical figures is to remain true to the deepest spirit of their stories. This spirit is vital, because it facilitates self knowledge and awareness of the Divine. It is a spirit of informed compassion, and it is not easily accessible to those who have not come to terms with their own psychological and sociological issues.This novel is entrancing, but the spirit of the work is embarassingly bitter. For one thing, the heroine's relationship to God is almost completely ignored. For another, the author's selective omission of information supplied in the oral tradition belies that she has definitely got an agenda, no matter what the facts.The author has chosen, in an exquisitely subtle way, to sensationalize history and, like an enraged child, spit in the face of her ancestors. After all, any anti-semite can brand Levi and Shimon as &quot;barbaric&quot;. A question more to the point: what was their humanity? The novel is bloated with irreverence and what, ultimately, can be satisfying about witnessing a tantrum, albeit an elegant one?The expression of one's creative genius must certainly be lots of fun, and receiving critical acclaim while making a pile of money isn't bad, either. But is any of that worth the risk of betraying the spirit of the Bible, even under the disclaimer that one is presenting &quot;fiction&quot;?Despite all of her (no doubt) good intentions, the author's words captivate but do not enlighten, heal or transform, which is the intent of the Original Author. Of course fictional characters must be &quot;flesh and blood&quot;, we can't relate to superhumans; but biblical figures are not fictional characters, they were real people who lived real lives. In order to invite them into the twenty-first century, must they be rendered luscious vamps and heartless thugs?I sincerely regret that I bought this book and warn others not to waste their money. Perhaps it's mean of me to reduce the &quot;stars&quot; the book is earning, but if a person is searching for an uplifting experience, they won't find it here. If they want to understand biblical heroes, they can access a wealth of midrashic lore which is becoming increasingly available in English.I wonder if the author has ever read anything by Amy Tan, who presents ancestral traditions with wisdom, grace and, yes, reverence."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"If you like New Age, low-brow Feminist, pseudo-anthropological claptrap, you'll love this book. Otherwise, you will find it a shamelessly romantic hodgepodge of hearsay and mythologies (inexplicably heavy on the Egyptian), inaccuracies and wishful thinking.It does vividly illustrate the wisdom, beauty, and necessity of coming-of-age and birthing rituals for women (the &quot;red tent&quot;) and for female community alongside the male brotherhood--although the women who long for this are the first to insist on women in the workplace and mixed seating in the synagogue.In any case, the book is replete with baseless pernicious slander against my ancestors--the Jewish patriarchs and matriarchs of the [Jewish] Bible. It would take 100 other books to correct the errors, omissions, exaggerations, and outrages committed in this one. But who would read them?Ms Diamant has done our people a terrible wrong for the sake of a fad for folk feminism. The high rating this book has gotten by so many readers simply confirms my own opinion that a dangerously anti-intellectual bias is afoot in our own culture."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I started reading this book thinking it would give a visual of the Bible brought to life through the eyes of women. However, I could not get into it as after several chapters I felt it was soft porn for women. This is the second time I attempted this book. I tried several years ago after it was recommended to me and put it down within a few chapters. I now remember why I did not finish the book.The author does a great job from what I read of giving the characters personality, so this is not an opinion on the authors skills, but I just personally did not enjoy the details of the sexual aspects and truly felt it could be rated as soft porn for women."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I have heard so many great things about this book and am impressed with the movement that it sparked.

The timeline changes from paragraph to paragraph, though the perspective doesn't, making it difficult to put down and mid chapter."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"\\"The Red Tent\\" is at once fascinating but also disturbing. I found the depiction of everyday life in Biblical times intriguing. I had never really thought about what life was like for the men and women of that time and so I enjoyed learning about it. What I found disturbing was that none of the male characters were ever developed beyond just basic information about them. You never got to know any of them as people so they were one dimensional, autocratic and shown as totally disregarding the feelings or thoughts of the women in the camp beyond wanting them for sex and baby production. You were never given any insight to why they believed in the one God of Abraham or that they ever taught or shared with the women about it. That seemed totally unrealistic to me and made me feel the book was not very authentic. In all, great portrayal of some of the aspects of life in those times, but very incomplete because it was so one-sided. I really felt it portrayed men unfairly."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I read this book several years ago, and was delighted it is now available as an audiobook. This is a wonderful story, based on a great deal of fact, about the life of a girl and then a woman in the days pre-Christ. It tells of the wonderful gifts a woman has, and how she shares them with those around her. It gives a lovely perspective on the role of women in culture, in the family. The beauty of the audio book is that the reader is really gifted, and makes the story even more alive because of her voice and her talent. When a character in the story laughs, you can see it clearly through her reading - and when there is strife, you feel it. It's much better than a film, because when you combine an amazing tale and a gifted reader - it gives your imagination wings that Hollywood could never duplicate. Enjoy it!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I know that I'm in the minority for not liking this book, but here goes... My dislike for this novel did not come from the in/accuracy of the story compared to the Bible, as others have expressed. Instead, I was very turned off by the anti-male tone. Why do we always have to support the battle of the sexes by glorifying one gender over another? I wish Diamant hadn't fallen into this trap. You can say that the male characters were made more human, but I think Diamant went too much to the extreme in making them so dislikable.The main aspect I disliked, however, (and which I'm sure will anger some people) was the amount of detail spent on the recurring pregnancies and births. As a woman, I thoroughly understand that childbearing is a major part of the female identity. I also understand that it was central to the lives of women in Biblical times. Yet, no matter how important it is, I find any story to be dull which spends as many pages as the 'Red Tent' solely on this point.The novel did provoke my thoughts at some points, which was good. However, the story ultimately left me feeling empty. I wish it had been otherwise."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"If you are a daughter, sister, or mother of a daughter, you need to read this book. This book about the life of Dinah, Jacob and Leah's daughter- the only daughter of Jacob's brood-- made me appreciate being a woman in all respects. I also understand the bonds of women even more than I ever have. I am excited about being a mother to my daughter and the incredible responsibility that I have. I hope that I can be as close to her as Dinah was to her &quot;mothers&quot;.This book grabbed me in the prologue and for the few days that it took me to read this beautiful book, I slept, ate, and lived with Dinah. I cried when I finished because I missed the characters and I missed being a part of their lives. There has never been another book that touched me quite like this one. When my daughter is old enough, I will give it to her."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Two words: historical fiction!!!Anita Diamant did an absolutely beautiful job portraying the world of women during Old Testament times. Because of the patriarchal nature of that society, the Old Testament has very few details about the women, this book merely provides a possible and probable scenario.As far as any discrepancies between biblical accounts and those in the Red Tent, one need only remember that very rarely will two witnesses to the same event have identical recollections of the event. Every one has his or her own unique perspective.As to the reviewer who claimed that the biblical account describes Joseph as spoiled; read Genesis again. Joseph was his father's favorite, he was hated by his brothers because of this, not because of his attitude. Also, in Genesis, Abram's named is changed to Abraham by God when God promises that Sarah will have a child, and that Abraham's descendant's will be as numerous as the stars in the sky. Therefore, the use of the Abram name by Diamant is perfectly acceptable.There are some differences between the biblical account and the Red Tent, however, they seem to be related to the particular narrator's point of view rather than anything that will drastically shake the foundations of Judaism or Christianity.One must also remember that many so-called Christian symbols and rituals have their roots in the fertility religions of the same regions. When early Judeo-Christians married into other tribes and other religions, or came to this new religion from an old one,they brought some of the symbols and gave them slightly new meanings. Hate to break the news folks, but the evangelical Christianity of today is a far, far cry from the brand of religion that Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Jesus, Peter, and even Paulknew.The Red Tent: Two thumbs up!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"The Red Tent is a beautifully written novel showing biblical life from a womans viewpoint. Dinah is barely mentioned in the bible, yet she tells her tale with exquisite detail in this novel. It makes you think about the wisdom of women and the secrecy with which they kept that wisdom hidden for generations. The stories and situations are very believeable and you are instantly transported into this ancient world. A must read."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Diamant did a great job researching the life of women in biblical times and presenting it to us in this novel. In spite of the time and place being so far away from our contemporary existence, the human condition and in this case, the sense and concerns of women are the same now as they were then. I enjoyed this book very much, had a hard time putting it down and I imagine all women who've had children, who've left their parents country and/or who have strong relationships with other women will enjoy this tale. I will never think of Jacob the same way. Too bad there were no women writters in biblical times, we would have had much richer and detail stories of those times, such as The Red Tent. Bravo for Diamant. Waiting for your next book."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I highly recommend this book. It captivated me and inspired me. I read it until all hours of the night. Possibly one of the best books I've ever read. Diamant's Dinah is a couragous, strong, passionate woman. A daughter, sister, mother &amp; midwife. The &quot;Red Tent&quot; is a book I will cherish and remember for a long time - and pass it along to all of my friends!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This novel blew me away, and I think that most people would react that way. However, don't read this book if it offends you when someone takes liberties with Biblical history. The Red Tent is the story of Dinah, Jacob's daughter. She narrates in a beautiful voice that is all at once lyrical and poetic. Her story, while heartbreaking, is also a celebration of what it is to be female. She begins telling us about what happened before she was born, how Jacob came to have four wives, how his sons were born. Her focus is on the wives and their tradition of abiding in the red tent during menses. While they are there, the woman bond and after she, the only surviving daughter of Jacob, is born, she spends much time there with her mothers, learning female traditions of midwifery. Her story is familiar, yet not the same as in the good book. Diamante's story is breathtakingly imaginative. Leah and her sisters come alive in this novel. While reading it, you are in the red tent. The characters are believable, the story compelling. We follow Dinah throughout her life and experiences. Her pain and her pleasures come alive. This novel comes alive from the first page and you won't be able to put it down. Highly recommended..."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I love books in which one doesn't notice the actual *writing*, because the story is so well told. This is such a book. The narrative is seamless, despite the fact that the story is told in three parts. When I'd finished the novel, I felt as if I'd just heard the story from a living person's mouth.In addition, I absolutely loved the way Diamant acknowedges that the Hebrew people were not, originally, a completely monotheistic culture. We tend to obscure this fact, mostly because our religious texts only mention one deity, but most evidence shows that the early Hebrews were just as polytheistic as every other civilization."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I want to say that I loved this book. I bought it to read for a book club that I belong to. Although I am not a fan of historical fiction or religious books, I could not put this book down. I'm ashamed to admit that I went into this book thinking it would be filled with biblical references and perhaps sound &quot;preachy&quot; because of the characters. It was none of these things. Yes, there are biblical characters, but the author grabs your attention from the beginning and you've but no choice other than to hang on for the ride. Dinah is likable if for no other reason than the fact that she's a survivor.I highly recommend this book. It's full of action, suspense, romance and history."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This was one of the best books I've read in a long time. Diamant's female characters are fully realized,beautiful and flawed. Neither are they secondary to the men-- they have their own tales and culture that in many ways is completely distinct from their husbands and brothers.This book artfully renders the mother-daughter relationship in a time when no one paid much attentions to daughter or mothers."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"The beginning was little slow for me, even though it was interesting to get a glimpse of the daily lives of the ancient biblical time women. It got really interesting in the middle of the book 'til the end. But I was offended about the portrait of Joseph in the book. Joseph is my favorite biblical character and the author portrayed him as a bisexual and illiterate person who got lucky to be a high rank governor in Egypt. Also, she distorted the Bible story about the main character, Dinah, who was raped in the Bible but not in this book. That totally changes the whole story and makes the biblical charaters barbarian and cruel. This is like Da Vinci Code which makes you wonder about the originality of the Bible. Like the author mentioned, it's only a novel, a fiction, far from the truth. We could make up any story and that's what the author did. It was entertaining but unbelievable."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"i must have been the last woman in the world to read it. all i heard from women (whose literary opinions i usually respect and agree with) was &quot;RED TENT IS THE BEST BOOK!&quot; even when i was reading it-- carrying it around visibly, strangers would stop me on the city streets of chicago and say &quot;RED TENT IS THE BEST BOOK!&quot; and now that i've read it, i can't agree. with everyone going on and on about it, i expected a &quot;Lovely Bones&quot; experience -- one of those rare gift reads when all you think about is the book, and you can't wait to get back to it. not so. *sigh* i just didn't get it."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I am unaware as to exactly what research Ms. Diament did before writing this book. Very little of it is reflected inside it. Every ritual described, including the red tent itself, is pagan. Jewish women at no time were obligated to live in a seperate residence from their husbands; the only restriction being against marital relations. There is no evidence, in the Bible or elsewhere, that Jacob's wives worshipped pagan gods. Aside from the fact that the entire premise of the book is false, the characters depicted bear no resemblence to the biblical personalities. If Ms. Diament was interested in writing a book about ancient Canaanite society, then she should have done so. Giving these Canaanite women the names of Jacob's wives and children insults not only those righteous people, but also all those who believe in the Bible as an authentic source, not merely a malleable history subject to anyone's interpretation. If you want to read a book about the matriarchs, read Orson Scott Card's &quot;Sarah&quot; (the first of three; &quot;Rebekah&quot; was just released). He gives a version which is based on Biblical facts, but expands the story."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I found the book both disturbing and compelling. Though the story is a fictional account, it is built around fact. The writer tends to blur the line between fact and fiction. This raises an alarm for me, and should for any biblical scholar. I am a questionning and analytical reader, and often attempt to interpret the writers intent, and look for subtle and not so subtle themes in a work. Diamant thoroughly misrepresented the character of Bilhah, and so distored the picture, it gives me cause as to why. First in the lineage chart in the front of the book she shows Bilhah as only having one son when it is reported in the book of Genesis, chapter 30 that she had two, Dan and Napthali. She also lessened this character's place in the group, when it was Zilpah(Leah's maid) who went into to Jacob last to conceive. Bilhah was the third and not fourth &quot;wife&quot;. As a Christian and bible scholar I am aware that the events in biblical times happened in and during everyday occurances, however the writing was without and divineness. Many of the characters were conniving, malicious, self-serving, and mean spirited. Beauty is again reprsented as golden (Rachel). I would suspose one reason pagan rituals (worshipping other gods) were not discussed in depth in the Bible is because they were frowned upon and not encouraged. Some parts of the book were repetitive and slow, however to develop an everyday account around a character is compelling. Diamant does have a gift of building a fantasy. I would always preface these issues when/if I recommend it as a read."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I remarked to my husband and others after I read this book that I felt enriched having read it. My husband asked me how it had changed my life and my only response was that it was such a great piece of literature that it enveloped me and compelled me to share it with others. This is a truly amazing book. At first it bothered me that I needed to constantly refer to the family hierarchy Anita Diamant so thoughtfully included with the book. By the fourth chapter I was totally enveloped; the characters were so richly developed that I no longer needed the reference. These characters were so real to me; I felt their pain and their joy. Have I mentioned that this is the very best book I have ever read? I compel you to read it and enjoy it. This is literature at its' very best (and this comes from a well-read person)!!!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"It was enjoyable to read but can be misleading to someone having little background on the ancient near east and biblical history. The author attempted the impossible: to put a story that was written about mythical characters into historical context! It is amusing to me as a student of womens' issues in ancient Israel that this book is being publicized as a feminist retelling of the Jacob tale. It is very true that much of the matarial in the Tanach (the Hebrew Bible) was written and edited from a male perspective and I suspect that the lack of attention to the Dinah character before and after the events at Shechem may be the result of the doings of one or more male redactors. However, the story of Dinah is part of the J source of the Torah, the very work that scholars have suspected to be the work of a woman -Richard Elliot Friedman thinks *maybe* while Harold Bloom thinks the writer was definately a she, without question. I also think it was a woman and I strongly suspect that she wrote more on Dinah, material that was later cut by a redactor. In fact the incident at Shechem may have been the only reason for the exile to Egypt in J's original story (ironic punishment for the massacre committed by Shimon and Levi). But whatever material had been there before, the story of Dinah and Shechem and the bloody acts of Dinah's brothers along with the rest of the J text is full of anachronistic details which can really tell us something about the world in which this woman lived and wrote, probably the eighth century BCE, possibly a little earlier. Yet Diamant seems to have gone out of her way to replace J's cute anachronisms with details inserted to show the reader that Dinah is living in the Late Bronze Age, roughly 1,000 years before the time of the writer who should not be condemned for knowing nothing about that time period. On the positive side, the book was well-written and an easy and relaxing read and included a family tree which helped for keeping track of the characters. But if you are looking for a liberal or feminist version of the biblical narrative, this is not it. The Red Tent is not well informed on literary and source criticism of the Tanach and I would recommend reading it only with extreme caution. And before reading it, I would recommend getting some background on woman of the bible and the Dinah story and related narratives (like the narrative about the \\"rape\\" of Tamar by Amnon and the aftermath) through reading \\"The Harlot by the Side of the Road\\" by Jonathan Kirsch, \\"The Book of J\\" by Harold Bloom, and \\"The Hidden Book in the Bible\\" by Richard Elliot Friedman."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I should have liked this book. Judaism, feminism, it was narrated in the lilting manner of a fairy tale. By all accounts, a very appealing book. But though fairy tales are often told to children, they are also often deceptively complex. This was not the case here. The book lacked depth, very flat."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"It is the most beautiful story that I have ever read."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I enjoyed this book very much. The very essence of the 'red tent' was something new to me. Apparently the women spent time in the red tent during menstruation and childbirth.There were a few things that I did not understand ie: why did the brothers attack and kill all the men in the village and their sisters' husband, even though they all agreed to have all men circumcised. I found this portion disturbing and confusing. Jacob seemed like such an honest man and he kept his word. Is it possible that he did not know of the attack?-doubtfulAside from a couple of areas which I found hard to understand, the book was great.In particular, I liked how Dinah told the story through her own eyes, in her own words.Very enjoyable."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I stopped reading after a few chapters. I understand women were for sex but too much and too graphic. Maybe it got better later."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"&quot;The Red Tent&quot; is a very entertaining book, delightful to read. I could not put it down. The story of Dinah and life with ther four mothers was wonderful. Many people didn't like this book because its depiction of respected Biblical characters is not pleasant. Well, to them I say if you want to read the Bible, read the Bible. &quot;The Red Tent&quot; is a novel, for goodness sake. Just read it and enjoy!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This book is a fictional book based on actual people in the bible. It was extremely interesting and entertaining. I loved the story line and it was probably one of the most unique books that I have read in a long time. I found myself wanting to open up the bible along side the book to see where the bible ended and the fictional story began. This was a great concept!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This is a book about the struggle for survival of women living in a patriarchal society, set in the frame work of familiar biblical stories. Diamant's flowing prose makes it an easy read and her exploration on pre-Christian/Jewish beliefs is both refreshing and interesting. It is also filled with an acute sense of loss - the book covers the lives of three generations of women, during which time the last of the great matriachs passes and women become as nameless and powerless as the 'Deborahs' that serve her.It surprises me that the main criticism from some reviewers below are 1) the book does not strictly stick to the stories told in the bible and therefore must not be historically accurate and 2) the pre-Christian/Jewish practises described are... well... un-Christian.I would like to gently remind these readers that 1) the book of Genesis came from the Jewish Torah, which borrowed heavily (for this section anyway) from ancient, pagan myths of the mesopotamian cultures of the fertile cresent, especially the Epic of Gilgamesh. Although some of the figures in the book of Genesis may be based partly on actual people, it is far from actualy history. 2) If the people and practices strike you as un-Christian - that is because they WERE. The book is set before the advent of Christianity or even Judaism. Historically, the practises described (by the Bible, such as one man marrying sisters) identifies Jacob and his tribe as Aramean. This is certainly pagan. Even in the bible itself, the word Israel does not come into being until AFTER the events described (Gen 35;10).All in all, an interesting book worth reading."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This book touched me more than any other book has. The characters are haunting and very human. It speaks to all women, even those who are not mothers--it is about sisters and aunts as well as mothers and daughters. It is about love and sacrifice and loss. It fills a void and gives a voice to those women who came before us--whose voices have never been heard or have been drowned out by men throughout history. Whether or not you believe in the Bible as literal fact, you have to admit that the Bible is written from a male perspective and women's lives are generally ignored with a couple of exceptions.This book is for those with an open mind. Anybody who knows anything about ancient history and the little we do know about women's lives during this time will find this book to have a vivid, believable interpretation on what their lives could have been like (yes, even with some of the facts being stretched or distorted). However, someone who is fundamentalist in their Christian beliefs will have issues with this book and would probably be better off not reading it if they are easily offended by differing ideas.Yes, this is a fictional story and, yes, the author has taken certain poetic license with some of the details in the Bible or changed them to better fit her story--we need to keep that in mind and not berrate her for doing that. It is all to be expected in a fictional work. I do take exception to certain problems that some reviewers had, however. For example, some have suggested that the author is \\"audacious\\" to portray the women as pagans when they clearly,in the mind of some reviewers, were not. Men and women were very seperate in many ancient societies and many paid tribute to different dieties. It states in the Bible (Genesis ch 35, vs 2), \\"So Jacob said to his household and to all who were with him, \\"Put away the foreign gods that are among you, and purify yourselves...\\" So, it is not unthinkable that these women may have worshipped pagan dieties. To insist that they absolutely could not have because their husbands worshipped the one God is ridiculous. Additionally, some reviewers have been bothered by Dinah's seduction by the prince in the book, suggesting that the author is wrong to gloss over what was actually a rape. Well, if one reads the text closely, it states (Genesis ch 34, vs 2), \\"...the prince of the land, saw her, he seized her and lay with her and humbled her...\\" There really is nothing in this passage or in later passages that says that Dinah was raped. \\"Seized\\" does not necessarily mean by force and \\"humbled\\" could simply mean \\"defiled\\" (which is a word used in later verses describing the incident). \\"Defiled\\" does not, nor has it ever, meant \\"raped.\\" Remember that during this time period a woman who has had sex before marriage or with a man who was not her husband was damaged goods--she was no longer pure and was now tainted and dishonored...the very meaning of the word \\"defiled.\\" Therefore, the author's interpretation of Dinah as being seduced instead of raped is a valid interpretation of the text and does not warrant attacks.The bottom line is that our foremothers deserve to have their voices heard and their lives remembered...even if we have to make their stories up. This book does a wonderful job and it will touch your soul."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This was a great novel! I wasn't judging the book to be accurate to the bible, but read it as a fictional story of history. I truly enjoyed the content and it gave a different view of what women may have went through at that time. I read this in a weekend."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I liked this book -- for the most part. I liked the stories Ms. Diamant writes about Dinah's four mothers. I liked Ms. Diamant's writing style. I liked the glimpses she gaves readers of what life may have been like in those days. I agree with her perspective on what women may have thought, loved and feared in those ancient times. I don't have a problem with the liberties she may have taken with the men of the story. As a matter of fact, I glad that their biblical, historical presence did not stop her from viewing them as the ordinary men that they were in their time. I liked the humanity -- and all the good and the bad that comes with it, that she dresses her characters with.So why the 3 star rating? Because Ms. Diamant runs out of inspiration after Dinah leaves her family and journeys to Egypt, which is about 2/3 into the story. After the climatic event, Dinah's story is not one of great interest. There are no other insights into what her life may have been like in that country, other than living in the garden or helping in childbirth.The other aspect that bothers me about the Red Tent, is that Dinah finds love at the end of the story. I think Ms. Diamant has the same problem most women have. We criticize men for their emotional insentitivity but harbor the hope of finding the one exception to the rule.This is why I don't read romance novels -- don't like them, so I have a real problem when a historical novel ends up being a romance novel."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"The Red Tent is the most beautiful book I have ever read. Every woman needs to read this book to know the goddess they are. An unusual insight to a well - known biblical story, this book will make you think about what you've been taught was the truth. If you need a good pick -me- up or are a man wanting to understand women a little better, please do yourself a favor and read this. And to honor the other goddesses in your life, you will want all of them to have a copy too. Especially your mother."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Anita Diamant has written an elegant novel. If you have children, if you have siblings, if you are in the midst of family dynamics--this is a must read. Although the story takes place in a setting over 3000 years ago, it is a humble reminder that the dialogue around &quot;what it means to be human&quot; is timeless. We may have indoor plumbing, instant information gathering through the internet, and know how to clone sheep, but the essential issues we have not yet gotten clarity on. Those issues include: What does it mean to be a woman? What is your duty as a man? How do you incorporate family rituals in your own traditons once you marry and start of new family? How do you know if you are fulfilling your destiny? You won't find answers to these questions but you will realize the questions that keep you up at night are historical, mythical, and community questions. You determine the answers by how you individually live your life. This is a beautiful story--especially for mothers and daughters as there is much about the rites from girlhood--to womanhood. And with books like: Secrets your mother never told you. It raises questions around the bonds between mothers and daughters. Enjoy the collective memory, and the story. After all, it is not merely a novel . . . it is YOUR story!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"The only way to describe this book is awesome. I almost started rereading this book as soon as I finished it; I didn't want it to end. It is a retelling of the Biblical story of Jacob from the perspective of the women, most notably his daughter. This book gives a real insight into what women's lives may have been like at this time, something that is overlooked in most sources. This story remains true to the Biblical narrative, but with a slightly different interpretation of the events that shaped one young woman's life. I cried through the last pages of this toucing story, and have recommend it to most of my friends."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Before reading The Red Tent, I knew very little about the Bible, aside from a few names and stories. The description and reviews that I'd read compelled me to give it a shot anyway, and I am incredibly glad that I did. The Red Tent is definitely one of the best - well-written, fascinating, creative, etc. - novels that I've read in the past few years.Little is mentioned in the Bible about Dinah, Jacob's only daughter - this much I know - and The Red Tent is a fictionalized account of her life from her own perspective. The result is magical, from Dinah's relationship with her own mother and her father's other wives, to her marriage, role as mother; all is depicted so realistically and lovingly that it is easy to get lost in the story. Dinah's life is not an easy one but Diamant so easily balances all that happens to her to prevent the book from becoming too maudlin or tragic - somehow, Dinah transcends it all. In addition to this wonderful female character, Diamant has recreated the vibrant environment and times in which she exists - obviously, a great deal of research went into this book and the details provide a sense of what life could have been like lo those many years ago. Diamant incorporates all of the information she gathered in such a way that it complements the story naturally without seeming forced or without too much emphasis placed on the historical context, as can sometimes be the case.As I read this book on the subway to and from work, many women approached me to let me know how much they had loved the book and how much it meant to them, something that has never happened before. As I got deeper into the book and became more entranced I began to understand its power. This simply is not a book to be missed. It provides a window into the lives of women in biblical times and into the soul of one courageous, gentle woman. I cannot recommend it more highly and hope that this book will continue to find the audience it deserves."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"While not a Biblical scholar, I am quite amused by comments like *breathing life into a woman character in a book written by and for men;* as if Judith, Ester, Abigail, Mary Magdeline and the Virgin Mary didn't count. If Dinah was important, more would have been written about her. Somewhat less amusing is the ignorance displayed regarding the Bible, a book that many consider to be the best ever written. Is no one offended that Ms. Diamont has plagiarized a story handed down for thousands of years? Is our crop of writers so devoid of talent that they stoop to plagiarizing and re-inventing fiction as fact? It is not uncommon for writers to take stories of old and recreate them. Writers as different as Shakespeare and Mishima were inspired by the Bible and its themes. They didn't plagiarize. The Danielle Steele-ing of the story of Jacob is deplorable; moments like Jacob masturbating among the sheep is an example of tawdry moments. Is that good writing or *breathing life* into a character? It makes me ashamed."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"The arrival time was awesome! But half way through book/disc's they began to skip. So I am bummed to have to fast forward threw parts and miss chunks of the book."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Didn't know what I was getting myself into. Not my cup of tea. Made several attempts to read and just coudn't do it.

But nope, not even a little bit. Did not finish."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"this was the best book i read last summer- it deserves Five Stars"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I was interested to read this book after I read the blurb on the back, but was appalled at the writer's ignorance after just the first chapter. I don't think she has ever actually read the Torah, and clearly she is not a practicing Jew, or she would know that we never, EVER, cook a lamb in milk. She would know, too, that none of the matriarchs or patriarchs would ever do this either, since they followed halacha (Jewish law) even before Moses received the Torah. Her storyline was so far gone from anything rooted in Torah (Dinah clearly was raped, so I doubt she could love the rapist), it makes me embarassed that she calls herself a Jew. Don't waste your time with this trash."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I loved this book. It was gripping fiction, but also insightful and well researched. Most importantly, though, this book gave me a tremendous appreciation for what the life of women was like back in the biblical era, and a tremendous longing for the intimacy that women back then had with each other. In some sense, the modern so-called equalization of the sexes and striving for independence have taken away our bonds with nature and our connection to our bodies and our biology. This book awakens a longing to reconnect to our traditional roles, which are presented as natural and beautiful instead of restrictive and limiting."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I was told this is an excellent book but did not find it to be that great. The second half was more interesting than the first half. I think what I liked least about it was the author's writing style. To me it seemed plain and boring. I have read so many books that I could not put down but this was not one of them. It was not a bad book - I was able to finish it with no problem - but it certainly was not great in my opinion."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I had high expectations for this book, but it was flat and insipid. The author rearranged historical fact to suit her story and in the end, it just wasn't interesting at all."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"this book had many good ideas, but some of the information is completely inaccurate.

I honestly cannot pinpoint why I dislike it, but I deeply know that I do dislike it with a passion. I do not like the fictional liberties author Anita Diamant took, and felt she toyed with Biblical matters. And even though she is Jewish and holds many degrees pertaining to the religion, I felt she didn't tell the Jewish side of the story well. I'm disappointed - I do not recommend."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I had to read this for my book club otherwise I would not have read it. It just was too New Age religion for me."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I could only read 40 pages of this book. It started out to be interesting, yet the vivid description of sexual encounters left me feeling disheartened and dirty. Why do authors feel that such elaboration is necessary? I am a Christian and love the Bible. I felt that I was reading a vile, slanderous report about people I believe lived and I hope to meet in Heaven one day. The author takes great liberties with the Biblical account. Liberties that I find disgusting. The Lord orchestrated the facts in a far more interesting manner than is portrayed in 'The Red Tent'. I could not continue reading this book and then say 'the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob' without blushing. I hope the best for the author but it is best not to even start this book."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I know that everyone raves about this book, but I just thought it was incredibly hard to stomach. For starters, it is poorly written and, at many points, seems contrived. The language is very basic, dull and uninteresting. At some points, she even attempts to throw in some old English to make it feel like Biblical times. Also, the plot line is really difficult to fathom. I am not saying that I disagree with anything she is saying, but, again, the book seems really commercial. It's almost as if an editor came up with the idea, put someone else to work and then forgot to pick someone literate enough to make a lucid point. She is clearly not someone who experienced college and the incredible torrents of college professors beating her essays and general writings to a pulp. Can anyone write a book these days? Maybe I should get started on my novel!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Oh stop it. A pathetic book about a time when women were viewed as less than real people, and accommodated the male world to their own personal detriment. It was awful."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I bought this book with the preconception that it was &quot;christian fiction&quot;. I was disappointed to find that the storyline does not keep the integrity of the Bible and I would consider it secular fiction. If you are a true Christian fiction reader, I would not reccommend this book."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This book was slooooooooooooooow! It is 321 pages long and it took to page 205 to even get slighltly interesting. It was very difficult to read this book as a christian. It departs so far from the Bible. If you don't know the characters in the story from the Bible well, you will be very misled! I understood that the book was fictional but why change Bible facts around? It was fine for the author to write about Dinah anything she wanted because she really isn't expounded upon in the Bible but for the author to make Rebecca into some high priestess was going abit far.Aside from changing the Bible truths all around the story was rather sad. The main character Dinah lives a miserable life and in the end she isn't even remembered by her father or brothers which she grew up with.I don't think I'll read anymore books based loosely on the Bible."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I found this book to be boring, annoying, two dimentional, and frequently disgusting. I realize that the old customs are important for the story's telling, but every simile (and believe me there are a lot) compares the setting, the person, or the object to blood, the moon, or something an 'auntie' did.The story drags on and the characters are no more than stereotyes. The action occurs only in what one person said to another. Every sentence is either in past tense, passive, or a descriptive metaphor.If you want a good version of this story, go for the Bible or Joseph and the Amazing Technicolored Dreamcoat. If you want a story about women and religion, read The Mists of Avalon."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Just because the Old Testament is rarely approached from a woman's point of view does not, in itself, provide enough reason to recommend this book. It came highly recommended, and understandably so, given Diamant's ability to turn a phrase. The repeated descents into bestiality, vulgarity and abuse took the place of a plot, and ruined what might have otherwise been a remarkable book."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"First, I apologize for giving this book one star...but that is the lowest rating allowed. I add my voice to the very valid responses in the other \\"one star reviews.\\".....I wish I had read them before I purchased this book. The book is so anti-Semitic that I was shocked to find it was written by a Jewish woman. I don't know how she can love the Torah, and write this book. After reading 76 pages, which is the source of my review, I felt my G-d and His people had been attack. This is the first book I have read were I was suspicious that some of the author's resource material came from old dirty jokes. This book has no redeeming value. For anyone who loves the G-d of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, it borders on blasphemy."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Where is that Red Tent, anyway:) I enjoyed this book so much that it is hard to put into words. There is just so much here, but I think that most of all, I enjoyed the celebration of womanhood. How nice it would be to treat our daughters and ourselves the way these women did. I enjoyed the characters and the story, and the biblical lessons. I have passed in on to my 18 year old daughter, and I hope she passes it on also. A great read about life, women, even God. I reccomend this book highly to every woman! Debbi"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I realize that Diamant's work may not be entirely biblically accurate. However, The Red Tent really brought that age and its characters to life for me. I thoroughly enjoyed this book - the writing is beautiful, the story captivating and unpredictable, the events both heartbreaking and inspiring. I finished it feeling fulfilled. Please read it!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Our book group raved about this book -- even very busy mothers found time to finish it before our meeting. We decided to eat foods that Dinah may have also eaten to fit the theme when we met to discuss the book. Anita sat next to me in Adult Ed French class ( a few years ago) and I am delighted to say she is a very nice person in real life. Glad that she has found time to write a book that will endure."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I recommend this book to all women. It was wonderful. Dinah was such a strong women,(just like her mothers) and went through so much before she finally found love. A great twist on the biblical story. I'm glad I know Dinah now."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Having read a few reviews on this book I thought it was going to be a wonderfully edifying book, based on the Dinah of the Bible.It is not.The author seems fixated on sex, in various forms: bestiality, incest, you name it, she included it. The book is not in the least biblically accurate, and the liberties the author takes with the characters, events and timeline is sickening."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Despite being well written and having a very interesting premise, this book was a disappointment overall. Considering how the bible, especially in Genesis, covers hundreds of years within a handful of pages - there is a lot of room for exploration, and even some creative license with such fiction. However, to take figures beloved by the Jewish and Christian communities, and to add things contrary to their known characteristics, is apt to upset some as it did me. Jacob was portrayed as an idolatrous and cowardly man. Sure, he wasn't perfect in real life, but I do wish the author had stayed a bit more true to the Jacob of the Hebrew Scriptures. There was plenty else she could've, and in some cases, did do - to be interesting."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I just finished the book yesterday-bawling my eyes out. (in a good way :) ). I immediately wrote my mother and mother in-law to GET this book!I do believe that women are forgotten-left out of the Bible-and this book offers a very real/believable account of what may have happened to Dinah and her mothers, father, brothers. Her family is REAL in this novel. Her father and brothers are REAL people, with real strengths and flaws-not the mind-numbingly amazing people they are in the Bible.The novel is an excellent fictional account of a the end of Paganism and the beginning of Christianity. The novel doesn't shun the God of Jacob-as some on here have suggested-but Dinah does shun Jacob and his sons for some of their actions and behavior that they did in the name of their God.The objections to this novel are from a purely conservative Christian perspective-not from a literary perspective.The Red Tent is the perfect length. It's sad and happy and fullfilling. This novel is a classic."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This is a wonderful, fictitious story. The Red Tent is a very compelling read. Anita Diamant does a great job with her character development, keeping the reader interested throughout the book. If this was meant to be taken as gospel, it would not be listed as a work of FICTION. Avid book lovers know the difference between Fiction and Non-Fiction. Enjoy this book and get caught up in the story of some amazing women."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"beautifully written, creative, engaging, descriptive, honest....This novel made me proud to be a woman and while reading it, I was more aware of my senses and the world around me. I do not consider this to be \\"truth\\" as many reviewers who hated the book seem to think Diamant advertised it as so. What a joy to read this book. What a celebration of womanhood."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Dinah, only daughter of Old Testament Jacob, narrates this story of her mother Leah's meeting her father, Leah's feelings of inferiority towards Rachel, the foolishness of Laban and the growth of her family. Once Dinah is born, the story switches to her life and in particular, and her relationship with her mothers (father's wives) during their time of month in the Red Tent, her brothers, and even her grandmother Rebecca. I enjoyed the author's colorful characterizations of these familiar names and the way she made it easy to visualize the arid environment where they lived and traveled. Though Dinah was only mentioned twice in Genesis, this book does a marvelous job of building a whole personality and story about this woman who endures such terrible hardship but promptly disappears from the pages of history."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This book has changed my view of women in bibical times and given me a connection to my jewishness. The ideas and story told in this book give me connections to very special women... a sisterhood that is strong and bonded with an incredible respect for nature.A sense of community that is held together in the most harsh of realities.The strength of the group and the committment gave me heart and faith that I come from a rich and powerful female heritage.(One that is not mentioned or given much history in ancient accounts.)The connections to my jewish side come from Jacob's influence on religion. The women gave the gift of life. This book touched me deeply.I will share this with my daughter and my son . To read this is to believe and connect with the ancient past."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This book revolves around a little discussed woman in the Bible, Dinah. She was the sister to Joseph, the guy with the amazing coat, and almost a dozen other brothers.I've always struggled with many biblical stories as female voices are absent. The Bible, for me as a woman, has always been a silent place, so discovering this book was a delight. Finally, a voice, a story, behind the name!This is a book about the power of women during this time, a time when women were viewed as little more than livestock. Everything in this book revolves around the wives of Jacob, which is a much truer story than the ones traditionally told in Sunday school classes. Dinah's story, her voice, is so strong. It was amazing to get a glimpse into her world---and that's when you know a book has crossed over, has truly come alive--when the voice and the words and the world within in becomes real. This character, Dinah, must have existed JUST AS the book said. It was too real not to be true.I loved the tradition of the Red Tent and wonder why we ever abandoned it! Women who are menstruating shut themselves away in this red tent until their menses is over. Honestly, that sounds heavenly to me. Sometimes, I wonder what we lost when we burned our bras in protest. Most of the book takes place in the tent as each of Jacob' wives shares her story with Dinah.I loved this book. It so very clearly shows the importance of women in a patriarchal society, and strong women at that! The four mother characters were so very interesting and I particularly loved Leah, who won her husband's love through the strength of her devotion. This is a book to love for both Christians and non-Christians, for all who are in the Sisterhood. Which means 'sorry guys, you probably won't like it.'"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"The first half of the book esentially describes how daily live probably was 3000 years ago. I am not familiar with the stories of these biblical characters, so had no expectations on where the story would go. The first half of the book celebrates womanhood and our magic in creating life. This book has really made me change my view towards the monthly mensus most woman go through and has made the realize that I will celebrate the day my daughter gets her period. I will emphasize the power and responsibility she now holds.That being said, the first half was hard to get through because not much happens. Having finished the book now I understand that it was critical in setting the stage for the second half and how Dinha's story unfolds. Her relationship with he son was heart-breaking ... and her life in Egypt difficult. This made me appreciate so many woman I have met over the years who have lived silent lives after tragedy. The book really picks up in the second half and has a great ending. I also loved how this book emphasized woman's intuation ... today many of us ignore this within us ... its time to start listening to our intuation again. A great read."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"A great tale, imagining the women's story that is hidden behind the Biblical stories of Jacob and Joseph. This work contains some wonderful moments, and the second and third major sections are very good indeed.But, I have two complaints that drop this work down to a 3-star rating. First, the first major section, in which Dinah relates the stories she has heard from and about her 'mothers' is necessary for character development and contains some good stories as well, but it just seems too long and too detailed. I almost stopped before getting past this part.Second, Diamant seems to be determined to marginalize or demonize the male characters; especially those that are primarily the protagonists in the Biblical tales. Yes, the Bible is male-centered and the women in the Biblical stories are mostly marginalized. But the whole book would have seemed more real if Diamant had made a few of the male characters 3-dimensional (or at least 2-dimensional).Her apparent purpose - to show that the women in these stories probably had a lot to do with events and that they and most of the men probably believed in many gods and godesses - could have been accomplished with the book still being female-centered, but without making nearly every male either brutal, clueless, and/or irrelevent.I guess I'm still looking for balance in painting this ancient world."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I found this a very interesting concept and hoped it would give me insight into a woman's life and role in Biblical times. I found the beginning of the book very interesting but as I got further into it, I had several issues with it and was conflicted with my opinion of the book overall. My issues included:1. Although I don't consider myself a Bible scholar, I am familiar with most of the incidents referenced in this book. At first, when the author varied from the Biblical account, it was slight enough to accept. But as the book went on this got more dramatic. I understand this is a work of fiction, but if you are going to base it on existing stories you should stay pretty true to the story. Asside from the Bible references, some reviews indicate the story correctly reflects the times from an historical perspective, other reviews say it does not. The fact that the author completely reinvented the Bible stories left me doubting that anything in the book was authentic. Thus I did not feel that I really got an accurate view of a woman's life at that time. Had the author just set the story in biblical times, but created a different family instead of rewriting the Bible, I would have found it more believable.2. The book started out very strong but then started to drag in the middle. By the end of the book, I almost had to force myself to finish it.3. It seemed to me the author had some ulterior motive. Between the rewriting of the Bible stories so that the characters are portrayed in a negative manner and her negative portrayal of men in general, I question if she was putting her own spin on life at that time. I know life was very different for women then, but I'm not convinced her portrayal of it was accurate."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I donated my first copy of The Red Tent to the Goodwill without having read a single page. Because I'm not one to give much thought to the bond I share with other women just because we're women, and because I don't have sisters or share a deep connection with many women in my family, I assumed this book was not for me. Years later, however, I decided to give the The Red Tent a shot; and it turned out to be a page-turner.The Red Tent offers a thought-provoking emotional read . . . An amazing story of strength, love, survival, loyalty, and betrayal. I cared about the characters from beginning to end (regardless of whether I could relate my own experiences to theirs) and found myself so full of sorrow at one point I actually put the book aside and sobbed. Colorful images, beautiful descriptive language, realistic fiction . . . a inarguably well-written novel with immense depth. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This book was a huge disappointment. If you're looking for a book using fiction to fill in the gaps of the scriptural account of Dinah, this book fails miserably. It, in many instances, contradicts scripture and adds some strange ideas of what may have happened (for example; insinuating that Joseph and Potiphar had a sexual relationship)as if the biblical account wasn't interesting enough without adding to it. This book IS well written in style, plot and character development, but it painted all of the men mentioned in scripture in a very negative light while remaining sympathetic to every woman. The Red Tent was not at all what I had hoped for. My advice to the reader is to get it at your local library if you must read it and save yourself a few dollars."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Life in the time of the Old Testament was difficult. Without modern conveniences, people were always scrambling--to gain land, to increase their flocks, to gain the necessary wealth to get their children married off to the best possible mates. Life as a woman was especially difficult. Women were treated as property, traded and bartered for their family's advantage, given little or no choice about what path their lives would follow.Dinah's mothers are lucky. They are four sisters, all married to the same man, who treats them fairly well. They all bear him children but only Leah, the oldest, bears him a daughter, Dinah. Because of the patriarchal society of the time that makes women into the servants of their husbands and sons, mothers are always closer to their daughters, with whom they will live and work side-by-side long after the boys have gone off to participate in men's work in the fields. When Dinah is born, her mother and three aunts dote on her and grant her liberties she may not have had in a tribe with more girls.Once a month during their time of menstruation, the adult women isolate themselves in the red tent, where they eat cakes and drink wine, exchange stories and revel in womanhood. Dinah is allowed to join them, and long before she is officially a woman she feels a closeness and admiration for these women who are so different yet who each shape her into the strong woman she eventually becomes.I found this an interesting story of the hardships women faced in this Biblical time. I found the thought of following their path in life--looking forward to the start of menstruation, then marriage, then children, and nothing else--to be nearly suffocating, and I was in awe at their ability not only to withstand their lot in life, but to thrive and find joy in it.I also enjoyed the insight into the closeness that tribal women must have had. In a society in which they were little valued, it makes sense that these women would bond with each other and form their own subset of society, separate from men and satisfied with their isolation. I liked the idea that women were not as completely suppressed or depressed as I would have thought."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I picked this book up for the first time many years ago, read the first chapter, and could not finish (due to boredom). Repeat two years later. A friend told me \\"Keep reading.\\" I did not, and gave up a second time (due to boredom). This summer, I was determined to finish, and I am SOOOO glad I finally did. This is an enduring, lovely story, and I highly recommend it - given the second half.The first half was difficult to read because, honestly, NOTHING HAPPENS. OK, SOME things happen - alot of babies are born,the clan moves up river, and all the characters are introduced, but other than that, it is very slow reading. However, after finishing the novel, I can appreciate how the first half paints a necessary picture for a powerful second half.You will like the first half if you are into biblical geneology or ancient feminine religions. The book does do an excellent job of describing life as an early pagan woman. Oddly enough, it had not occurred to me before that the wives of Jacob were pagan - duh! I thank this book for opening my eyes to this. Just because Jacob was one of the founding fathers of monotheism, doesn't mean his wives necessarily agreed. (Well, in actuality, maybe they did - maybe they didn't. It is fiction ;)The second half is far more entertaining and paints a beautiful picture of the main character, Dinah. It gives unique perspective into the lives of women and family, and it left me longing for something similiar that we have somehow missed or forgotten in our modern world - the feminine face of God."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I first read this book in my senior year of highschool and have reread it a few times since. The story is a powerful rendition of motherhood and life. I won't rewrite the plot as so many before have done, but it is a fictional take on the biblical story of Dinah. For all you who are interested in the origins, Dinah is Joseph's sister and Jacob's daughter. In the bible she is supposedly avenged for her rape, but this novel takes a new look at the story, from Dinah's perspective of \\"what really happened\\". If you buy the book you will notice that the first chapter is difficult to get through. WIth all the names mentioned, it is hard to keep track. My suggestion is to tear out (or copy) the chart provided of everyone's lineage and glance at it when need be. Trust me, it is well worth it to get through and the rest of the book is significantly easier.It is a quick read for me, as I cannot put it down once I start. Diamant's ability to draw you into the story, to feel as though you too are experiencing the world of Dinah is fantastic. You will feel for these women, and hopefully, as I did, feel as greater sense of how far women have come. This book is a treasure that I reccommend to all my friends. No, I demand they read it. As I put in the title of this review, it is quite simply, amazing."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This is one of the most extraordinary novels I have ever had the pleasure to read. Anita Diamant brilliantly captures the texture of Biblical times through the eyes of the wives and daughter of the founding father of the nation of Israel: Jacob. Dinah, the forgotten daughter of Jacob who narrates this extraordinary tale, grows up in the shadow of her famous brothers, but as the only daughter of the clan, she becomes the repository for her female kin's stories, carrying their legacy forward into a future that is at once horrifying, and uplifting.I have rarely been as moved by a book as I was by THE RED TENT; I have never felt any connection to my Jewish heritage until I read this book. My father's family are descendants of the Levite tribe of Israel, and as I read Dinah's extraordinary story, I felt as if I were reading about my own ancestors. And this is where Diamant really shines - beyond the mere historical facts of this tale lies a deeper, more profound truth: we are all the sum total of our ancestors, and each of us is responsible for carrying their stories and spirit into the future. Or as Diamant more eloquently puts it, &quot;There is no magic to immortality...Egypt loved the lotus because it never dies. It is the same for people who are loved. Thus can something as insignificant as a name - two syllables, one high, one sweet - summon up the innumerable smiles and tears, sighs and dreams of a human life.&quot;THE RED TENT is the ineffably moving tale of an extraordinary life."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I looked at this book many times in books stores and here on Amazon and each time, although I was very drawn to the book, I didn't purchase it because it was \\"biblical fiction\\". . .I was afraid I wouldn't relate to the content to well. . .well, I couldn't have been more wrong. This is an awesome book for women walking all spiritual paths. I actually found this to be very \\"pagan\\" oriented in it's flavor and I recommend this book to all women, young and old alike. I felt so encouraged by the bond these women shared, the way life was for them, the way sexuality was taught and learned in those ancient times, and well, I've now got my 16 year old daughter (also pagan) reading it, and have recommended it to several other woman. A very fast read. I highly recommend it and only wished it was lasted longer!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This book is the imagining of the life of Dinah, met in passing in the book of Genesis from the Old Testament. There she is barely mentioned, one of thirteen children and the only daughter of Jacob, by one of his four wives, Leah. The story is told from Dinah's perspective, as she has learned it from her father Jacob's wives, who all serve in different ways as Dinah's mothers. The book is engaging, since the reader feels privy to the secrets from the red tent. The tent is so named, because it is where the women gather during both their menses and for childbirth. This is a wonderful story of sisterhood, describing the conflicts of jealousy and cooperation between women. The story takes the reader from the time that Jacob met his first love, through the time of his death. The focus however, is Dinah. We love her, from her birth to death, and through all the varied stages and changes of her life.The reader comes to understand more of the culture of Biblical times. However, here is where the difficulty of the book comes in. Diamant has chosen a Biblical character, and yet she changes or ignores factual information as presented in the Bible. Unfortunately, this serves to discredit her storytelling. Old Testament readers are those likely to be drawn to this book, yet may be offended by Diamant's lapses in Biblical accuracy.On the other hand, no one said The Red Tent was a factual account. It is a fascinating read, and those who remember that it is fiction will not be disapointed."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Yes, this book may not be exactly in alignment with the Bible-but the author states this upfront. It is an amazing book about women of a different time, their sisterhood and their hardships. One of the best books I have ever read. It might have been better if the author hadn't connected this book to any characters in the Bible-then some of the reveiwers of this text just just RELAX! They worshipped idols because the majority of people did not know about the Christian God and this is extremely early in the Bible (Genesis when it would have taken place) It is an amazing book about women-a voice almost completely left out of the Bible and a refeshing look about &quot;what was really going on&quot; in those times. A MUST READ!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"The Red Tent is the story of the conflict between the old matriarchal worship of the body and the moon and the new patriarchal monotheism that Jacob brought with him to Laban's house. Despite the fact that the book is only vaguely related to the biblical text, it breathes life into the old story in a way that I have never before experienced. I stayed up into the night to finish it and found myself crying when it was over. It reached me in a place that not much in our plastic world can. I can't wait to have a daughter of my own so I can raise her the way Diamant imagines the four mothers raising Dinah."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Wow. I am left breathless and awed. I never expected to enjoy a biblical fiction story this much. Full of beautiful language and imagery; reads like a poem or lyrics to a song.This is the story of Dinah, the only sister of 12 brothers born to Jacob and his four wifes -- Leah, Rachel, Zilpah and Bilhah. We only hear of Dinah briefly in the bible; here in The Red Tent, Anita Diamant has given life to Dinah before and after the passages that we know. Told in Dinah's voice, readers will delight in her mothers' stories that are shared within the walls of the red tent. We become witnesses to many births and the sorority of women who gather there. And best of all, Dinah leads us on her journey through life as her traveling companion and dearest friend.The Red Tent is a grand, sweeping story that spans an entire lifetime. Dinah may be the only character I've ever read about that I feel I know completely. Ms. Diamant has created a glorious tale about the strong bonds of motherhood and the power and tenderness of women. Dinah comes full circle in this novel, which is always a pleasure, especially for a character who you care for so desperately."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Can't stop thinking and talking about this book. I have never been pulled into a story as I was with this one. I feel as if I knew these woman personally and I will carry them in my heart for a very long time. Bravo Ms. Diamant...Bravo."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"The Red Tent was thoroughly enjoyed by our entire readership and provoked fun discussion about women in the bible and women in general. The details about daily life in biblical times were especially interesting to me. The cooking, farming and family traditions were fascinating. It was a great read."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Diamant has produced an excellent historical novel. This book adds insight into the forgotten world of pre-Christian womanhood. The characters vary from diabolical to sympathetic as the author traces the life of Dinah.The menstrual tent is a mostly-forgotten and usually misunderstood source of sisterhood. As I read I wished I could be part of such a close group of women."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"The major plot points in the book do come directly from the Old Testemant, but that's not what the book is about; it's about the relationships among four women - basically, the equivilent of sisters - who grew up together and who married the same man and who all raised their children together - the rivalries, jealousies and interpersonal relationships they have with each other. Yes, it makes Jacob and Issac look pretty bad - and of course, Jacob's sons never have come off looking like good guys, given the whole Joseph story, but the failings of the men and women in these ancient times makes them more human. Judaism does not have saints, and I have never expected any of the Patriarchs or Matriarchs to be holy in every minute of their lives - which may be why I was willing and able to suspend disbelief."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This was a compelling read--easy, interesting, and thought provoking. Historically, it's plausible and that means that the &quot;willing suspension of disbelief&quot; is effortless. As I went through the Bible reading about Jacob and family and compared that with what Diamant wrote, it raised more questions. How much more could we understand if only we had a better perspective on what the distaff side of the equation experienced?Want food for thought? This is THE book."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This is a wonderful book for those of us who want to read a great story and not for people who are looking to read a bible story. I dont think this book should be placed in a religious category because this book is more about women and history. It made me think about being a woman today and given birth in a sterile hospital room and the dangers of birthing babies throughout history. I also loved the relationship of women as sisters, daughters, mothers, wives and midwives. I can't wait for more from Anita Diamant."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Take a minor Biblical Character and give her life. Her name is Dinah, daughter of Jacob and Leah, sister to Joseph. The Bible tells us she was raped and that her brothers murdered the men of Shechem in revenge. Anita Diamant tells us the rest. \\"We have been lost to each other for so long,\\" begins Dinah. \\"The chain connecting mother to daughter was broken and the word passed to the keeping of men, who had no way of knowing.\\" Dinah tells us her story and of her mothers: Leah, Rachel, Bilhah and Zilpah. The men of the Bible are there but they are supporting characters. The Red Tent is one of the most compelling narratives I have ever experienced. I laughed and, yes, cried with Dinah. I stretched the last twenty pages over three days, not wanting to say good-bye. In the end, I felt that I had met a woman who blessed me with her story; who told me things usually reserved for a woman's ears."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"The Red Tent is an incredibly moving novel. If you grew up in Sunday School and were told again and again the sketchy, mysterious, beautiful, terrifying stories from Genesis, you will delight in the way Diamant explores these characters and events (Abraham nearly murdering Isaac, Jacob wrestling with God, Jacob being &quot;swindled&quot; by Laban and being made to marry Leah before he could marry Rachel whom he loved...) This novel explores what daily life was like for these people, what Dinah's brothers (Reuben, Judah, and all who will be the 12 tribes of Israel)were like, what it might be like to be one wife among many. Additionally, her exploration of the way women experience their bodies (their sexuality, their reproductive lives) is deep and true. After reading the novel, I went back and read through the parts of Genesis that her novel explores with new eyes. For me, those stories will be all the richer now that I can imagine in such detail the lentil stews and all the details of the lives of these semi-nomadic people. It's truly a stunning novel."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I found this book fascinating. The cultural details were wonderful--I found the lack of any clear dividing line between our traditional understanding of early Hebrew peoples and what a religious person might call pagan roots very thought-provoking. My book club rushed to the Bible to see what was said there about these characters. The power and mystery of these women was amazing--it made me think about how much women lost by being in a nuclear family in the Western sense in the last couple of hundred years, rather than part of large extended groups of mothers, cousins, daughters, servants--something only partly regained as women have fought for eqality in the modern age."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This book is a great read. I had a hard time getting into the characters in the beginning, especially given the husband sharing that goes on. After I finished it, however, I couldn't stop thinking about it and went back to reread passages! It is beautifully written and one of the best I have read in a long time."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"While I finished this book several months ago, it is still with me in many ways. I think of the traditions that bonded women in the biblical era described and I wish our current society had similar ways to bring young women and older women together for a week every month to sing and talk and just bond. Anita Diamant's story will grab you at so many levels you will want to read the book again and share it with all your female friends all at the same time. Dinah's story is a sad and tragic tale. Grab the tissue and be prepared to feel sad, angry and astonished all at once. I would highly recommend this book!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I began this tentatively, not believe a friend who said I'd like it; however, I more than liked it, I became glued to it until I rabidly got through it in three days, becoming increasingly absorbed in the characters. What a great read!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I didn't expect as wonderful a story as I found in The Red Tent. I always wondered how women lived during early biblical times, and Diamant presented a plausible story of how these tribal women lived and relied on each other. The characters are well developed and their stories sweep you into their lives and experiences. The reader must remember that the book is fiction, and not meant to be taken as a literal interpretation of the Bible."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"WOW.... I wept at the end. I was enraptured by this book from the first page to the last. Diamant skillfully weaves a tale of women, from triumph to tragedy and back again. Like &quot;Mists of Avalon,&quot; this book dares to suggest that women have had (and continue to have) a powerful role in society. &quot;The Red Tent&quot; brings that heritage to light.. a radiant light.Dinah, the central character, is only given a brief mention in the bible, but here, she shines! For me, its just another example of how women have been sublimated by a religious society that sought power, land, and money. I am not a christian, I do not believe that the bible is the end-all and be-all, and I applaud authors who dare to suggest that another view point is possible.Blessings to Ms Diamant for her courage and wisdom. The prose is delicious, the imagery lush, and the winds of the desert can be felt in our hearts!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This book was beautiful and entirely engrossing. It is a book for all womankind."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"It is one of the first books in ages, which I found difficult to put down. The book takes place back in biblical times and although fictional in content, it helps the reader see what the daily life of the woman went through back then; from marriage to child-bearing and than death. The reason I gave it 4 out of five stars is because the first 40-50 pgs, seemed to drag. Yet, once to get past that, you get to know and feel for all the characters in the book. It was definetly a rollar coaster ride."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I was totally captured by this beautifully compelling story. It was powerfully scripted, with characters(of which there were many) and situations so very fully, warmly and vividly presented. I miss Dinah. This is a book I will read again and there are very few books I would say that about. I was grateful for the geneology chart in the beginning of the book; I referred to it often"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Hands down, the best book I have ever read. This is the wonderful story of the lives of family and of women. I was shocked at times in the book and brought to tears often. I can't recommend this book enough. You will not be able to put this book down once you start and it only gets better and better the more you read!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I just finished this book, and it was wonderful! However, I also feel a sense of loss. Loss of modern women's sense of community with other women, especially during childbirth. We have advanced technologically since the &quot;primitive&quot; biblical era of this novel. However, the relationships of the women and children described in The Red Tent are sadly lacking in our modern times. I wish that all of us as new mothers had the support system that these ancient women experienced."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I recommend this book to friends by telling them that it reveals the essential nature of the true relationships between women. We are a certain way with each other today, and we were the same with each other over two thousand years ago. That is the real beauty of this book for me. I think Anita Diamant did a remarkable job in capturing the essence of life for women B.C. She made me contemplate what it would have been like to not only know the story of Abraham and Issac, but to know both men as family members. To have known Rebecca as a grandmother! My goodness. I am not a Biblical scholar, but she brought this era to life for me. In short, it's a wonderful book and I recommend it highly."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I had heard from a friend that this was an excellent book...and it is! If you like to imagine the Bible from a woman's perspective, you will fall in love with this book. I felt like I was transported in time...and it was tough to come back. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"After reading several of these reviews. I decided to put in my own review especially after reading the first one that completely trashed the book. I read this book upon my mother's recommendation and found it to be a fascinating and quick read. Since much of the bible is protested and indeed people have argued that the bible has not one but many authors and is based on an oral tradition, then it can be very likely that this story could of been just as true as any other telling of the stories of the bible. The book indeed seems to put many of the male figures in the bible into a more crude light, but the history of the women who were briefly mentioned in the bible itself is illuminating. The mythological references in the book are also true to the mythology that existed in Mesopotamia during the days of Abraham and Isaac. I think this book is an essential read to many young women who look for more realistic heroines and real life struggles. It is defenitely worth putting on your summer reading list."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Anita Diamant has given to me through the writing of this book a connection to all generations of women that have come before me. Never before have I understood in a way such as presented in her writings the loyalty among woman. I will forever be greatful for the way she allowed this understanding! Bravo! I am going to recommend this beautiful book to all of the special people in my life"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"What a beautiful story. I can't say enough about how much I enjoyed it. If you liked Memoirs of a Geisha, then you will certainly enjoy this book."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I had to chuckle at all the reviewers who are upset that the Old Testment patriarchs are poorly portrayed in this book. I think that is the point. I challenge you to find one Old Testament woman (besides Deborah) who is portrayed in the Bible as anything but a doormat, villain or whore.Ruth? Beautiful story, but major doormat.Rahab? My favorite OT woman but, face it, she's a whore.Esther? Sure, she rescued her people, but hid her faith to do so and only admitted being Jewish when threatened by her uncle.Jezebel? Oh, please!I understand the culture in which these stories were written, but when you are trying to raise a teenaged daughter in the faith, it is hard to find Biblical female role models. Diamant offers an alternative viewpoint."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"When a friend recommended this book to me, I thought oh yeah, another Biblical book that goes nowhere and preaches at you. Well, after reading the first paragraph, I must say, I was wrong. The words and stories of each of Jacob's women weave together into a beautiful tale. And Anita brought the past to life ~~ with its dusty reality, not this purified pretty version that the Bible gives out. (How can you really span a life story of one man and his family and not use up more than a thousand pages?) Anita writes about all points of views and shows the reality of life back then. She also writes about the enduring relationships women have with one another. This is one book I am planning to buy for my closest girlfriends as it celebrates friendship, love and family. And when I finished the book, I felt as if I lost a new set of friends. This book is well-written and embraces the reader into Dinah's life. And leaves the reader with haunting images from time past."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I read this for our church's book club, and I was not disappointed. This is a beautifully told tale of how women learn, love, laugh, and live together. At the center of it all is Dinah, the only surviving daughter Jacob and his four wives. She becomes not only the repository of the saga of her four mothers, but becomes the bearer of her own story, as her brothers twists the love of her life into an awful rape (the story as we get in our Bible) and leave behind a massacre so awful, it forces Dinah to flee her family and start a new life as a midwife in Egypt. The rich detail, the descriptions, the dialog, the portrayal of feelings, are all what the Bible truly might have been like, if it has been written by women.Some have criticized the deviations from the Bible in this work. First of all, this is fiction, and should be treated as such. Secondly, those who are offended by the way God and the men who follow God are portrayed, let me offer this: Look at how the men of God behave in Genesis! Jacob and his sons are hardly role models in their Biblical portrayals. Why should Anita Diamant give them any better treatment? Whatever your religious inclinations are, \\"The Red Tent\\" brings alive an ancient time, and is beautifully written. Definitely highly recommended."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"For a long time, I passed by The Red Tent on the store bookshelves, since I tend to like contemporary fiction, and also since I don't have a thorough knowledge of the Bible. Finally, though, I heard enough positive reviews that I read it.It was engaging on many levels. The language was lyrical, and the stories told by Dinah were captivating, thought provoking, and sometimes quite humorous. That these were historical stories only added to the richness of the book.Despite the undeniable difficulty of their lives, the care that the women took toward each other, and their rejoicing in the cycles of women's bodies (and lives) is something to embrace in the present day.The Red Tent can be read, enjoyed and remembered regardless of your religious affiliation or what you remember from Sunday School."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"The Red Tent by Anita Diamant is a compelling tale with a biblical setting. The heroine Dinah is a little mention character in the Bible. Dinah is Jacob's daughter and Joseph's sister. In Diamant's version she is greatly valued as the only daughter of Jacob's four wives who are all sisters. Dinah shares the red tent with her mothers and is cocooned in their loving protection. They each give her valuable lessons and gifts of life as they see it. As it turns out she will have need all of their gifts to pursue her life as a woman of these times and the unexpected tragedies which overtake her.An excellent read with much depth and meaning. Those that take the Bible completely literally may not appreciate it."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This book was highly recommended by a Christian friend of mine, so I purchased it. I was under the mistaken impression that this was a Christian book before I read it. After reading it, I am fairly certain that Diamant had no intention of this being a Christian novel at all. If you are looking for a book about the strength and bonding of women, then this is a good book. If you are looking for a book that will appeal to you in a literary sense (you know, one of those books you are proud to tell people you read, because it's DEEP) then you will probably enjoy it. It is well written. I did not enjoy it, however, because I was expecting something else; I know that is the fault of my own ignorance.From a general standpoint, I don't really know that it was necessary to describe everything quite as graphically as Diamant did in every situation. There were a few things that should have been left out altogether, in my opinion. Not everything -- I'm not so idealistic as to think that people were somehow perfect back then. But Diamant should have been confident enough in her own writing to know that certain things weren't necessary. It is interesting that the things I found the most graphic and inappropriate were actions that only involved men; this made me feel disgusted with these male characters. As with many of the flawed male characters in this book, Diamant's writing subtly encourages the reader to become annoyed or angry with the male characters because of their choices or their character flaws. While this irritation is certainly understandable, Diamant doesn't treat the female characters equally. They too are flawed, but these flaws are glorified and excused, as they add to the \\"colorful\\" nature of the characters. I don't know if this was intentional or not, but if we're going to forgive/sympathize with the women, then we ought to give the men a second chance as well, and not make them out to be so terribly two-dimensional and unredeemable. But I do believe Diamant has some personal issues with Judaism, Christianity, and the male gender, so we'll just let it go.What bothered me the most about this book was the fact that Diamant makes a clear distinction that Yahweh is the God of Jacob and the men -- not of the women. This is no small matter; it changes the entire message of Judaism and Christianity, and belittles Yahweh as well. This distinction permeates the book, and overshadows what I did like about the book: the relationships between the women, the different personalities of the wives.This was an interesting read, but Diamant has changed the essence of the story and the characters so much that she probably would have been better off to just make up some other names rather than using the Bible characters. However, I guess unknown, made-up character names don't sell books.If you are looking for a wonderful historical fiction retelling/expansion of Dinah's story, please read Grace in Thine Eyes by Liz Curtis Higgs. It isn't preachy or predictable, and things aren't necessarily wrapped up neatly at the end like most Christian fiction. I appreciate how Liz Curtis Higgs makes it simple to \\"put on the skin\\" of each character -- you can easily see how YOU could have made the same choices that would have led to the same wonderful or terrible outcome. Higgs makes you see how individual choices and individual personalities can create the atmosphere for sin and tragedy.I am sure that if you loved this book, you are playing the \\"conservative Christian\\" label game right now, and are offended by my review. I'm sorry that you feel that way; I wasn't offended by your review. Have a blessed day!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Having completed an intensive year long study of the book of Genesis, I was intrigued by Ms. Diamant's desire to tell the story of Dinah from a woman's point of view. I did approach the book with an open mind but was initially disturbed by the fact that she was creating a fictional account for some very powerful Biblical stories. However, I soon overlooked this as Ms. Diamant is a gifted story teller and I couldn't put the book down.I can accept the fact that this is &quot;Biblical fiction&quot; and that she did create most of the story to fill in the &quot;blanks&quot; of the Bible. However, I found it extremely disturbing that she chose to change some of the facts. This was especially evident during her portrayal of Joseph. For example, Joseph DID NOT sleep with Potiphar's wife as Ms. Diamant wrote. This is an extremely powerful Biblical story and it was included in the Bible to allow us to have the insight into Joseph's character.If you are not familar with the Bible, PLEASE take the time to read the stories of Jacob and Joseph for yourself. They are wonderful and the lessons from them are timeless.All in all, I did enjoy the story but would have preferred if Ms. Diamant had just chosen to write about a completely fictional family who lived during Old Testament times. I found the use of the names of Jacob, Joseph, Rachel, Leah, etc. distracting and I couldn't help but to make a comparison to the actual Biblical stories."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I'll be frank: I don't know the Christian story of Joseph. So I have no idea how this does or does not relate to or fill in the blanks of that!Overall, this book is a fantastic read for women who enjoy reading historical fiction that, whether true or not, plays heavily on a sense of sisterhood, kinship and wonder about the female condition that is lost in our modern societies of today.I live in a workaday world where people barely touch one another... having friends and family who could retreat together for three days a month and lounge around, telling stories and massaging feet... sounds like heaven to me! Where do I sign up?Anyway, the book is richly written; the prose is very descriptive and sensuous. The first 2/3 of the book really draws one in, and immerses you in Dinah's life, feelings, experiences.I did find that somewhere after that point, something changed... whether the writer realized they could not finish the book in under a thousand pages using the same depth of detail, or whether it's a mechanism employed for a purpose that I just don't understand, the fast forwarding and sparse depictions that typify the last part of the book really left me cold; I didn't feel the book had a strong finish, at least not the one promised by the beginning.The beautiful, peaceful ending still left me crying like a baby, though."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I have recommended this book to many people, especially women, and those friends who have already read it recommend it just as enthusiastically as I do. This book, although fictional, made me see just what we're missing in all those Biblical stories told through the eyes and voices of men. What a wonderful world of women we've missed out on all throughout history! This book made me want to ponder many other historical events through different eyes. Not only is it a wonderful story, but Diamante is a gifted, lyrical writer. You will not be disappointed if you buy this book!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"There are books that pick you up and take you into another world, another life. For a short while you walk, talk and breathe the story. The book enters your very soul. \\"The Red Tent\\" by Anita Diamond is such a book. The life of Dinah and her family becomes your life and family and you feel wiser and richer for the experience."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I've been reading through the responses and it seems most people loved the book. Most who didn't love the book seemed to be offended that it strayed too much from the original biblical stories/characters. All I keep thinking while reading their criticism is that the book is meant to be LOOSELY based on the bible. It even states it in the description! If you are looking for a completely accurate biblical story or are very religious and may take offense, then this book probably isn't for you.Peronsally, I loved it. I borrow books from the library rather than purchase because I'm such an avid reader (2 books weekly at least), but this is definitely going to be added to my book collection. There are a lot of characters to remember, which was the only thing I found slightly confusing. Otherwise, I couldn't put it down!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I truly enjoyed this book. Dinah's story in the bible is told not in her words. It only hints at what happened, and Diamant takes Dinah's life and writes it as it may have been. Dinah's life is truly a &quot;soap opera&quot;, and I was compelled by her strengh to survive the things she experienced.The women in the red tent shared, cried, laughed, loved and learned from each other. It was their world away from the men that led them. Their secrets, knowledge and lives carried on generation to generation from daughter to daughter, and reading about this sisterhood enraptured me. A story worthy of 5 stars."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"From first recommendation I was hesitant about this book, but I am glad to say that Ms. Diamant delivered far more than I expected. I highly recommend this book. It was a very easy, interesting read as well as one of the most beautifully and most colorful stories that I have ever read. It will leave you wanting nothing more. Well Done!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Not surprisingly, the male characters in this novel are woefully underdeveloped leaving the reader with a rather lopsided story. I longed to know more about what motivated Jacob, but never got more than a one-dimensional look at him. And his God...barely even gets a mention...rather surprsing given the source material the author was using. Nevertheless, I found this an interesting read that certainly gave me a whole new perspective on the culture and mores of the women in the Bible."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This was the first book that has not disappointed me in a very long time. I was worried that the biblical setting would be boring but boy was I wrong. It was full of scandal, love, family, heartbreak and drama. It ended leaving nothing unsaid like so many other books. The portrayal of a strong, brazen woman was inspiring and made me grateful for my modern day luxuries. The readers who are hung up on the fact that this book does not follow bible facts are missing the point of the story. Diamante never claims to stick to the facts but instead, tells an interesting story of a strong woman we all can relate to despite the time gap. Every woman should read this!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This is such a beautifully-written book! I've never read Biblically-based fiction, and, happily, it was NOTHING like I expected. Though the circumstances of Dinah's life are anything but calm, Diamant's elegant words yield a tapestry of a life filled with serenity, love, and a sisterhood rarely found today. The look back to the time of Dinah is so vividly formed, I found reading the actual Biblical passages, from which this story comes, easily accessible; whereas, reading it in the past, I felt lost in the sea of names. Now I feel as if I know all of those people and understand the life they lived so many years ago. Nothing I write can do justice to this book. Just buy it, read it, and savor it. The beauty of it will live in your heart forever."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This novel was a great read. I always hated the thought of men having more than one wife, but now I have an understanding of why and how women could make it work years ago. The Red Tent was hard to put down and I couldn't wait to discuss it with a friend. Superior writing with an excellent story to tell."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Our book club of seven young women just loved this book! We loved the sisterly, motherly, femaleness of the story, and the female-bonding that took place each month in the Red Tent. Some realized that we have no similar &quot;rights of passage&quot; for our young girls. Others are getting interested in the Bible for the first time in their lives. It's cool. We eat really great food too!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This book brought me back to my Judaism. Thank you Anita Diamant. I read this book three times and sobbed each time. It is truly amazing."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"As many others, I was expecting a historical fiction story and was excited to read it.I was shocked and disappointed at the graphic and needless descriptions of the sexual activities and such.I am a Bible-believing follower of Jesus Christ and was feeling quite ashamed and disgusted as I read on, hoping it would get better.Needless to say, this is obviously not a book I will be finishing."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This was a fabulous book, and goes down as one of my favorites of all time. I did not expect to love it as much as I did, and was sceptical that the content would be too religion oriented. However, the characters and the story are so fascinating. In fact, the stories inspired me to actually pick up my dusty bible to find the story of Dinah, just to make sure Anita Diamante wasn't making it all up!It's important to understand, however, that this is a novel, gleaned from a very short reference to the biblical Dinah. I think it can be enjoyed by those who have conservative religous beliefs, as well as by those with very liberal leanings. All you need is a love of a good book and story. It's very well written, and I didn't want it to end."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I was amazed with this book. Knowing the Bible well, it tied in with it but in a different way and made the characters very real and very human. Relgion was not emphasized but touched upon. The times came to life with sights and sounds. The author was able to evoke all of those sensations so smoothly and effortlessly. I felt like I was there and knew the characters. That's how great the book is. I highly recommend it. Read it."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I read some of the other reviews and I think there is no reason why this book should be loathed by so many! I think the way the story was told is wonderful and although there were some Paganistic tendencies we must remember that this IS a work of FICTION! Its not completely true to the bible story, which I personally think made it a lot better, and how can you expect it to be so? If you would like a book that holds your interest well, this one's great! I loved it!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"A brilliant, brilliant book. You feel like you are part of these peoples lives from start to finish. The characters are so vivid, you get a real sense of how they lived. And Dinah, the central character is an inspiration to all women. I think the Red Tent concept is a good one, somewhere we can go to bond with our fellow women, where we won't be disturbed by the hurlyburly of everyday life, husbands and children included...I say bring it back. I loved this book, enough to read it a second time."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Interesting story, but the writing was disappointing. I didn't get a sense of being there, of feeling for or caring about the characters. I felt like a distant observer, and never felt involved. The story had potential, Diamant missed it..."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I read it in two days as I was fascinated by this culture of &quot;the red tent&quot;. This story is earthy and sensual, as I'm sure it was intended to be. And it truly celebrates women as lifebearers and healers and mothers rather than workaholics who have no more ambition that getting paid the same to do a man's job. In a time where women disdain being mothers or they choose to work instead of raise their children and run their home in a healthy way, this book is an inspiring detour into the old world.The story, however much it deviates from the true Biblical account, (and I'll get to that in a minute), captivated me. The Bible uplifts women and gives them a higher place in its story that any other literature of its time, but not much is said about Dinah because her story is not the primary reason that Moses recounts the tale of Jacob and his sons.And here is where I have a little beef with Diamant. Her bio says she's written plenty of books on Judaism, but you'd never know she was Jewish by her emphasis on the absolutely pagan practices of Jacob's family in this book. On this level, Diamant's story is wholly untrue for Jacob and his sons never worshipped any God but the one true God, &quot;El&quot; as he is referred to in this novel. Jacob's wives, at least once they left Laban's care, also worshipped this God and all that stuff about sacrificing to the Queen of Heaven and what not is pure fiction. I did not mind that, at many points in the story, Diamant deviates from the Biblical account (i.e. Dinah's in Shechem or the switch LABAN pulled on Jacob when he was supposed to be marrying Rachel). Its dramatic license and she does not claim to be writing new Scripture or anything... but when it comes to their pagan practices, I was really disturbed. I don't know what my point it... I just wish, on this point, she had stuck with the true story. Its ironic because I enjoyed the first section of this book most of all and that was the most pagan! I just threw off the fact that Diamant was retelling a Bible story and pretended it was entirely fiction.In short, I highly recommend this book to every woman, especially if anyone feels the need to feel uplifted in her femininity. Feminists need to read this book- hopefully they will come to realize that there is equal value in being a housewife and a mother than there is in being a CEO or a lawyer (and having the homelife be the center of your life)- you might not get paid, but the spiritual significance, the absolutely vital importance of these roles in the life of the world cannot be matched by any job. I believe this may be what Diamant is saying, in the end. This is what I got out of it, at least."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book.

While important to remember that it is fiction based on some biblical data, it nonetheless provides an interesting glimpse into what life may have been like for women so long ago. I found it a little slow at the start, but it becomes so engrossing later that it was impossible to put the book down."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I enjoyed the book immensely. Have not read anything this interesting since &quot;Pope Joan.&quot; I had to keep reminding myself that the book is fiction based on some facts from the Bible. Being somewhat familiar with the Book of Genesis, I knew things that were going happen before I read them, but loved how the author intertwined fiction and facts from the Bible. It made reading this book that much more exciting. If you remember that this is a novel and not biblical truths, then you can't help but enjoy the book. My only criticism is that &quot;The Red Tent&quot; does not come in large print and I really would like my mother-in-law to read it. Perhaps you can get word to the publisher regarding large print editions. I am anxiously awaiting Anita Diamant's next novel!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This book just blew me away. I was very skeptical about the topic at first, but Diamant's writing sucks you into the story immediately. The bond between the women in this story is completely compelling and believable, and this book puts a fascinating spin on the relationships only hinted at in the Bible. Dinah is an incredible protagonist whose desire to love and be loved is at once her undoing and her salvation. Her survival is inspiring. The end of this book had me in tears. Beyond Biblical and beyond purely historical, this book is a moving testament of one family and the things that bind them together and tear them apart. A must read, in my opinion."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Subtly moving, with both elegance and simplicity in depicting the strong bonds of mother- and womanhood.(After finishing this novel, I wondered at the delay I had in selecting this from my tottering pile of to-be-reads. I should have consumed this story eons ago.Oh, right. I forgot. I...read...slow...)...I had the unsavory and gratifyingly dreamlike past of being an eight-year student in a religious school (pause for snickers). Besides trawling through after-lunch periods of having to do the rosary in front of a sleepy class, twice-a-week school celebrations of some obscure saint, and weekly anxiety-ridden posturings of donning our \`Sunday-best' sparkly-white gala uniforms for the Friday masses, being a student of a religious school means having our own copies of the Bible. Not only is a possession of it judiciously marked by our class prefects, but its condition is also meticulously kept.(I think I remember asking God then why it should be a matter of supreme divinely business whether my \`good book' was covered in a two or four point gauge plastic wrap.)And so it is that it had been during those years where I had a semblance of a familiarity with some figures in the Bible. Jacob and his sons may have been one of them.I can only profess to a measure of thanks that I have forgotten those Bible lessons (pause this time for indignation), else my reading of Anita Diamant's The Red Tent would have been constantly distracted by past lessons on Joseph the dreamer, searching for clues of a familiar subplot that would not be found. By approaching Dinah's narrative as one who has heard of Jacob, Esau, Isaac, and Joseph...but not much more, I think I was able to enjoy more this fictional spin on the life of Jacob's daughter.And it is an enjoyable account.It sometimes threatens to verge on the biblical without ever trespassing that divide into sentimental moralistic contention that would have made me uncomfortable. There are allusions to inexplicable supernatural events, but not to the extent that \`God' as an entity is made to become the focal point.Dinah's voice is clear and uncompromising, wistful and eager. Her descriptions of her mothers and some of her brothers are laden with love, but there also exists clear-cut honesty, revealing her exasperation, confusion, and notice of their failings.Diamant's weaving of the intangible threads of womanhood among Jacob's women and that one daughter is, for want of a word, heartwarming. The comfort that Dinah found in the laps of Rachel and Bilhah balances securely with the life lessons taught from the hands of Leah. The world-within-a-world for women inside the red tent is one of harmony and peace, a joyous celebration of sisterhood heralded by laughter and shared secrets. I confess to being envious of their kind of life where there is contentment in the simplicity of day-to-day chores, where hardships are compensated for by the warmth of strong familial relations.Even Dinah's childlike halcyon days with Joseph and her younger brothers were a wonder to read.Thus it was all the more saddening to encounter the third part of the novel, where Dinah grew up as a young woman festering hate and bitterness for her father and brothers (and even her mother) for the crime over her beloved. But her strength of character is always there on the surface. And the wisdom gleaned from her mothers guiding her throughout her adult life. The bond she formed with Meryt is also one deserving of envy, a bond that cannot be accounted for by any material standard, and one that grew strong as if forged in blood.All in all, The Red Tent is rich, touching story - it could have been the life of any woman nowadays who has enjoyed much in life and perhaps suffered the same measure. A woman who discovered, in subtle degrees, the real things in life that should matter, and for that, found peace till the end of her days."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This book tells the fictional life story of Dinah, the daughter of Jacob and Leah of the book of Genesis from the Bible. History does not tell us much about Dinah so the author uses this freedom to weave an interesting, beautifully written tale of life in this time and place.Through Dinah's eyes we see what women's role is in this society. A woman's self esteem comes from bearing children, especially boys. It is common for men to have multiple wives and there is an entire pecking order within the wives - the first wife, the maids of the wives (who are used to deliver more children for the husband), etc. All of the superstitions, fears and rituals that seem so strange to us are vividly described.Even though the women's lives are cruel and difficult at times, they stand strong with each other via their traditions and provide a haven for each other from the turbulence of their lives. Although it was not always easy to read I enjoyed this book and I believe it gave a glimpse of what life was like thousands of years ago."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I bought the Kindle version on a whim -- I'd been searching for low-priced books and stumbled on this, having never heard about it before. The blurb sounded intriguing but I was a little nervous that it was a 'religious' book. It was anything but. The Red Tent is reminiscent ofThe Mists of Avalon-- well-known stories told from the female perspective -- andThe Handmaid's Tale: A Novel. I found the 'religious' aspect intriguing, as it shows how the one-god belief system sprouted from the many-god belief system. Dinah's is a beautiful, tragic, violent, dark and inspiring story. Highly recommended if you enjoy women's (not chick) lit.A note on the Kindle formatting: I found to be relatively free of typos and formatting was very readable.If this review gave you information that was helpful, please feel free to click the YES button below!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I haven't been able to put my kindle down. Last night I started THE RED TENT. It focuses on the womens/wives/sisters relationships under their tent, where they went during cycles, childbirth, nursing, & sickness. It tells of their early marriage rituals. Of course, it is filled with complete fiction and different stories, but it is what the author imagins was going on as she read the bible. I had to put it down at 2:15 this morning because I knew I had a long day. So far, I think it's one of the best, most grabbing books I've read in years. it brings to life the characters in a way you feel you are there, WAY back then. And it is facsinating."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This book is a reminder to every woman, the difficulties we have overcome and the strength we all have.This book was inspiring, sad, thrilling,and brought me both to tears and laughter.I could not put this book down once I got it."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This book was a great story of times that are unimaginable. When women were in tents during their cycle, seriously! That just seems crazy and watching the decisions that are made and how it all turns around in full circle, it was an amazing journey. I definitely recommend this book!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Wow, this is an amazing book. the characters are so enthralling that I was really sad once I finished reading it because I would no longer spend time with them! It is a must read for all women. It definitely is on my top ten of all times."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This novel reminds us that those mentioned in the Bible are real people, with hopes, fears, struggles, and dreams. It's hard enough to pronounce many of the names, even harder to relate to them as people. A novel such as this takes us back to the time and place, where the people who lived these stories again come alive to tell their stories.I very much enjoyed this book."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I'm the type of person who REALLY enjoyed the film \\"The Last Temptation of Christ\\" because Christ was humanized for me in a way that I never felt through a childhood of church.And, after all, Christ was meant to experience the life of man.This said, I really enjoyed this story of Dinah. I actually went back into my bible and researched her online as well to see how much of this tale was pulled from the tales before it.Regardless of its accuracy (it's FICTION folks), the writing was engaging and the voice of Dinah (pre-birth through post-death) was griping from beginning to end.I had just given birth to my son and read this during the hours spent in the rocker during the first couple weeks of his life. It was a delightful reading the 'historical' hardships and realities of a woman's life (especially the child bearing years)...I could truly step into their shoes.The way Ms. Diamant explored the contrasting worlds of established Egypt and Canaan as well as the early days of the Judeo-Christian legacy was thought provoking, for me at least.I don't claim to be a biblical scholar of any sort, but I have a healthy respect for my religious upbringing and family religious traditions.This book refreshed some of the more dormant parts of my religious interests along with a healthy respect for the roles of women in it."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I had a hard time putting this book down. The characters were believable and it was easy to identify with them as it was to have empathy towards them. Dinahs character was well developed and as the story went on my heart ached for her. Very well written and descriptive creating a setting that my imagination walked into."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I had read this book before a while ago. it was chosen for our Book club discussion so I downloaded it. It was as interesting as the first time I read it. I especially liked the narrative of the times from a woman's perspective. I would recommend this to every woman to read."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"this book was a great story. i love reading stories from this time in history and i finished it in a day and a half"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"What a well written book that tells a fictional story during biblical times from a strong females perspective. I really enjoyed the story. The ending was phenomenally written. Much emotion felt through the entire story."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This was a quite interesting look at a woman's life in biblical times. I kept wondering how realistic it might actually be. Do we really have any idea? It certainly kept my interest though."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I really enjoyed reading about this Old Testament character that is only mentioned briefly in it's original story. The artistic liberty taken in this story is done well."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This book is a wonderful book that really gives you a first hand experience of life during Dinah's time and the roles of woman. I was very touched by the trials, triumphs, the joys and the tears. I actually cried in the end of the novel for I felt as if I had lost a best friend as much as I have gotten to know her throughout her life."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Do not be put off by the religious undertones of this novel. They are there for mere reference. The book itself does not contain any direct references to religion, or are subtle enough to be ignored. This is not for Jews but for everyone, especially women as it sheds light on a way of life that has long been forgotten and should be remembered and revered."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This is the first novel I have ready by this author and it came highly recommended by a friend. The Red Tent lived up to and surpassed my expectations. The story is as beautifully woven as I imagine Jacob's coat was colorfully woven. The author so artfully integrates the reader that at times I felt like I was part of the story, not just an invisible onlooker. Anyone who enjoyed reading I Am Forbidden or The Kite Runner will love The Red Tent."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This is a wonderfully crafted, brilliant work of art. I recommend this novel to women of all ages. This Biblical telling of Dinah, daughter of Jacob and Leah, brought history to life in a way I could never have imagined. Bravo, Anita Diamant, for this masterpiece!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This was a great book that I could not put down. It was great to get the historical and cultural background of life at that time. It gave me such insight into women's history. We women need to stick together : )"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I do LOVE historical fiction, but wasn't sure about the Biblical ties to this tale. I was not disappointed, especially from chapter seven to the very end of the book. Dinah, the teller of the tale, was a true survivor of a life filled with amazing and ordinary experiences. To live as a woman in her day was so stricly defined. I'm glad that I could meet her in my heart and mind, but was happy to return to my own very comfortable life."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I loved this book. That's all I can say. I was ready to read it again after finishing the first paragraph. I DO NOT read books more than once....until this one. I think I could read it a thousand times and never get tired of it! The story is beautifully told and quite engaging. I felt connected to Dinah and her aunts and finished the last page feeling brand new. How many stories can do that? I could go on forever, but I think you need to read it yourself to get the full effect. This is definately an amazing book and I highly reccomend it to everyone!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This book is a fine read. Though rather long, it is based on the best known plot in the world. I like the historical/biblical skeleton with a sister filling in the spots. I felt I was learning much about the times and customs of these people, and I enjoyed the unique point of view. Diamont will be on my list of authors to read."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This was such a great read that I've told all my girlfriends to run out and buy it. It's a heartwarming story of a woman's life. I was disappointed when the story had to end."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I loved this book. Having attended an all girls orthodox yeshiva, this brought our forefathers and foremothers to light. I also have a daughter named Dina, so I found this book very real and personal."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"The Red Tent is one of the most memorable books I've read in a very long time. As a Catholic, growing up in the 60's - 70's, I never really read the Bible. While reading this book I felt so many emotions: 1. Maybe I should read the Bible, 2. Women are most definately the superior race, and 3. I must let my 13 year old daughter read this book, it will empower her.The Red Tent is a beautifully written book. As much as I know The Red Tent will be enjoyed by mostly women, I hope men will read it too."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"The poetic power of Diamant's language creates a world in which the bonds between women as mother/sister/daughter are a life line. She has &quot;remembered&quot; through her fiction much of what has been lost to us about an ancient community of women. I could not put this book down. I could have read it if it were three times as long. It should become a &quot;classic&quot; that we pass on to our daughters. Share it with your friends and your mother and your mother's friends. Then talk about it!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Anita Diamant has managed to create a fascinating character with a fascinating life. Of great interest are the rituals of &quot;the red tent&quot;. Dinah is a woman with an amazing story to tell. The women are intelligent and witty. Romance, revenge, deceit, this book has it all. I could not put it down."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This was a book that captured my heart as the Dove Keepers did. The period is right up my alley and I enjoyed it greatly. I do not go into what the story is about as you can find that out on the website so I just say that I enjoyed it and recommend it to you."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This is an amazing story! Everyone who would like to know a bit more about the Old Testament times will find this book a real eye-opener."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Great read...keep in mind that it's just a historical fiction novel, just Anita Diamant's attempt to fill in the blanks with a possible story, but in no way a claim to truth. Very entertaining, I thoroughly enjoyed it."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I really enjoyed this story and was fascinated by \\"a different way to look at it\\" or a different perspective on an age old story. I wanted the relationship between Joseph and Dinah to be different at the end...I think I would have enjoyed the book more, had that been the case. I was a little disheartened by his (Joseph's) portrayal in the later part of this book, and I had some difficulty in believing Dinah's anger toward him at the end. After all, he too had been treated badly by the Brothers. Anyway, all in all, it was a very enjoyable story. The audio version is narrated very well."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I'm not an enormous fan of fiction. The story must almost have a gravitational force to pull me in. The Kite Runner, Water for Elephant's, The Time Traveler's Wife, The Lovely Bones, I tried them all and ended up putting them aside as not enough. This book was amazing. I was so engaged."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I first read this book about 5 years ago. Have been captivated by it ever since. So captivated by it that I sort of read it like I do my Bible. I'll pick it up and begin to read where it falls open. I'm always up to date with exactly where I start and like my children's favorite books, there are sections that I almost know by heart. I try to encourage all my 'reader' friends to expose themselves to this extraordinary work. I'd love to spend an evening with this author. She has got to be one of GOD's favorite people."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I enjoyed this book. The richness of the story, the characters, the feeling of being there."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Delightful reading. View of the past I have never seen before, from Women's perspective, in lieu of mens. I have read the story of Jacob many times but this presents an entirely different picture. Learned a lot and I want to read more. I delighted in the fact that the men of the time saw the Red Tent as a place of woe and exclusion for the women HOWEVER the women let the men think that --keeping for themselves the fact it was a place of refuge and love and relief from the day to day drugery of tending the house, husband and children.The reading made me proud of woman's ability to bend and survive and thrive. The same feelings of pride that was aroused by my reading ofTwo Old Women, by Velma Wallis."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I loved this book! I had been looking for a good casual read, and this was perfect. It may not be historically accurate (I can't say I'm a bible expert), but who cares! It's still a really good book."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"My neighbor, a midwife, recommended this book to me. It is amazing that the name Jacob (or Levi or Simon) is still popular. Ms. Diamant made the biblical story come to life in her novel. It is a bit more graphic than any Sunday School teacher explained, but still a good read. The sociological look at women was fascinating. If there were still Red Tents, women might be healthier and less stressed."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I thought that this book was thought provoking while showing me the way life might have been in ancient times.I found it interesting that the people of those times had such a great sisterhood. I for one could never share the man I love with a sister or a friend. I find they must have been such giving women to share one man. I found Jacob to be self absorbed and thoughtless about those he should have cherished."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"To me, The Red Tent was on the same level of excellence as The Kite Runner and A Thousand Splendid Suns. It was just a little slow getting started, but I soon found it hard to put down. I would definitely recommend this book, especially if you enjoyed books like The Kite Runner."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I'm super picky (at least it seems that way the last few years) and I've been reaching back for old books I've never read. Just finished Lonesome Dove and now The Red Tent. Really enjoyed this book, poetic in an unassuming way...does that make sence? Also a quick enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I found this fictional rendition of an old Bible history interesting. I was not cought up in its accuracy as much as how the author imagined the people would feel, react, and behave at that time. To that end, the book added also to my insight. While I thought the preoccupation with sex was excessive, perhaps tribal people who were concerned about their very survival and existance were more focused on procreation. The author portrays the times as brutal, fairly lawless, and very sad - an interesting insight. The treatment of the God of Jacob (EL) was also enlightening. Sometimes the Biblical accounts abbreviate the process leading to devotion and worship of Jahweh. Noting that the god of the people was the one who promised the most and made good on that promise seemed to be a realistic development. The people were not focused on El but, at that time, working on developing an identity in the world whcih eventually lead to Judiasm."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I avoided reading this book because it didn't sound like anything I'd ever want to read, but I ended up buying in on CD and listening to it in the car. I found myself fascinated by the tale and have to give kudos to the author for pulling me into the story. It kept me listening, even when I pulled into the garage!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This was another book I picked up for a road trip and listened to it in the car. I wasn't certain I'd like the book, but I found myself looking forward to driving as I listened to the story. Others have mentioned the story line, so I won't go into it, but I can't say enough about it. Loved it!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This was one of the first books our book club read several days ago. It remains one of our favorites."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Although it took me several chapters to really get interested, it was definitely worth the read. At the end, I was wiping tears away almost every chapter. It was a very intriguing look at biblical life because there were startling differences and startling similarities with life today."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I read this as a selection for my book club and I really enjoyed it. The story was captivating whether you are familiar with the bible story it is based on or not. I found it interesting to read about the lives of women at that time as well as the way the women bonded as a group which is universal."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"From page 1.... You are drawn into a world that suddenly becomes your own...as a woman, you fall into the \\"sisterhood\\" without even realizing it. You feel for and with these women like you 've known them all your life! You literally feel it in your heart....it 's not about religion it's about strong women in a time when all they had was each other and their faith. I couldn't put it down ut when I did....I wept( and I'm not a crier!). I've lost track of the number of times I've gone to this book for a personal lift. And after each time I seem to come away having learned something new and feeling like a better person for it. Hold tight to your family sisters, friend \\"sisters \\". ,,,,,we are the glue! Share this with your daughters if you have any. We women are a constant source of what is good, loyal, and are able to accept faults with the most beautiful sense of understanding! Read this book....again......and again and you won't be disappointed but will feel wrapped in love and sisterhood...past and future. I just love,love,love this book!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I deeply appreciate this book! as a menstrual activist, I enjoyed the reverence to womanhood, menstruation, the moon and childbirth. Anita did a great job!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"amazingly written novel. i am by no means a christian/jew but i still lve the stories of religions for their story-value. she weaves an amazing tale out of a character that apparently wasnt really mentioned more than 1x in the bible. the story is filled with flavors and scents and the old-wrld caravan feel. a mid-wife's life of births and deaths and sex. i lved it. you'll learn alot about birthing and the old world. i love the idea of the red tent - minus the bleeding on the straws - the bonding of women on their cycle is a wonderful thing."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This is a beautiful book to share with other women. It captures the overwhelming beauty of sisterhood and the mystic of being a woman. It makes you think about how history would have been written if women were given the chance to have a voice."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This is a book I never would have picked up. I was in a book club and we were reading it! I couldn't put it down! It gives you a good look at history!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This is one of the best books I have ever read, and women will love it. The old world will come alive for you."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I adore this book -- I have read it a few times now and highly recommend it to my friends. As a lover of historical fiction, this book is one of the best. I really enjoyed this story from Dina's point of view. Can't say enough good things about it."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"THE RED TENT is a fabulous biblical fiction novel that provides a full life to a footnote character in the Old Testament. Purists will take exception to Anita Diamant's liberties with other persona such as Joseph and Leah (even if her description makes them seem more real and complete). However, that aside, strict believers need simply pass on this fictional account that provides an intriguing look at the role of the Ancient Jewish woman. Anyone who enjoyed the QUEENMAKER by India Edghill will fully relish Ms. Diamont's loose, but seemingly feasible, intelligent and entertaining interpretation of the role of a minor biblical player."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"A book you can read over again!!! I really enjoyed everything about this book. If you are familiar with the Bible, it was nice to read a different perspective to life in ancient times."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Hooked from the beginning...such an interesting story...the story is narrated clearly and cleanly...one voice....easy read...great story. Reading it for a book club, wasn't sure about the choice, but it's proved to be a great read! Such an inspirational book on the power of being a woman. Also interesting it brings up the question of how many stories in the bible are only told from the male perspective...very thought provoking!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This is the first book that I've read that was based on the Bible. I had my doubts, but being an avid reader of historical fiction I decided to try it. I was not disappointed. Glad I bought it and read it!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This book had been recommended by many for quite some time. I do not know why I hesitated to pick this one up. I absolutely enjoyed this story. The community of the women and their bonds and their stories were fascinating. This is story reads true to the phrase \\"it takes a village\\"."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I've read The Rent Tent twice. Once, before knowing anything about the bible story behind the characters, and once recently, after having taken an Old Testament class. I found it very enjoyable both times! But especially enjoyed the second reading of it because I felt more connected to characters and understand the basis of the background for the time period. I thought each of the women were done extremely well, and although they were all very different, I liked all of them. Some reviewers have said the book is anti-male but I don't believe this. I think is portrayed much nicer here than he was in the bible. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone, but women especially."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I enjoyed reading this book and liked the author's take on Dinah's life, as well as Leah and Rachel. I really enjoyed reading about the culture and life during that period in history. After reading the book, I reread parts of the Old Testament that chronicled Joseph's life. This is a work of fiction and should be read as such. For the Christian readers it should encourage them to reread the Old Testament. For others that would like more books based on Biblical characters, check out authors Francine Rivers or Angela Hunt."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This book was selected for my book club and I am so glad it was. I'll admit - it is a bit of a slow read at first (and in the middle), but the ending is so good. The details in the first half of the book are appreciated even more when you get to the second half. The Red Tent is our inspiration to always, always finish a book."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"The Red Tent is an amazing book - it reflexes the connection between women of all ages (but mostly of \\"child bearing age\\"). This book would be one that I would highly recommend that perhaps a mother and a daughter, or friends would definitely share."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"\\"The Red Tent\\" is an excellent book. It takes the reader back to Biblical times with a unique female perspective. The author guides us through the tale while helping us see life through the customs and beliefs of their time. I'll never see the Biblical Jacob in the same way again."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This is such an interesting novel. The similarities between customs from all different corners of the world are amazing. This is definetely a \\"cant put it down\\" book. I highly reccomend it to readers of all kinds of novels."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This was truly a beautiful book. I found myself crying at certain points and there have been maybe 2 other books that have made me do so. The story is thoroughly engrossing but the book teaches so many important lessons about life's struggles as well. I was not familiar with the Biblical story of Jacob but have since sought out information on that chapter of Genesis. I would highly recommend this book to anyone, religious or not."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"\\"The Red Tent\\" is historical fiction at its best. It takes place four thousand years ago in the fertile crescent of the Middle East during the Bronze Age. This novel is set among characters that are historically significant in three major religions: Judaism, Christianity, and Islam.This is the story of Dinah, daughter of Jacob and Leah, granddaughter of Isaac and Rebecca, half-sister of Joseph. Stories readers may already know about these characters from religious texts serve as barely recognizable backdrops. Be forewarned: this is not a religions book. The focus is on Dinah--her story, from her point of view. The historically significant religious characters who populate Dinah's world are imagined by the author as complete, three-dimensional human beings who possess failings and habits that some believers may find highly objectionable.The historical setting of \\"The Red Tent\\" is overwhelmingly patriarchal. Women are essential for taking care of the everyday needs of men and for the bearing of sons. In this period, they exist almost fully apart from their men folk. They have their own society, their own traditions, and their own protective, favored gods and goddesses.This book is about the power of women to create meaning in a male-dominated society that all around conspires to make their lives irrelevant. They do this through building and maintaining a community of supporting female kinship.The novel begins with Dinah telling the reader the stories that have been handed down to her from her mother, Leah (Jacob's first wife), her aunt Rachel (Jacob's second wife), and Bilhah and Zilpah (handmaids and lesser wives of Jacob). These stories include tales of her grandmother, Rebecca (wife of Isaac, the son of Abraham). There are also tales of many other women of their tribe, women who have passed away from the history of men, but not from the memory of the women of \\"The Red Tent\\".If you take the time to read the more than 1,300 reviews that now exist for this book on Amazon, you will find that many readers found it difficult to get through this first section. I, too, almost stopped reading the book at this early stage. It was not until the second section, when Dinah begins her own story, that my interest piqued and held steady. After that, I could hardly put this book down, and was thoroughly sore-at-heart when the book ended.This book gets my unquestioned highest rating: first, because of its well-crafted storytelling; second, because of its great humanity; and third, because it conveys a deep, visceral understanding of the common roots of Christianity, Judaism, and Islam."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I really loved the perspective of a woman in this book, expecially when it comes down to a biblical figure. It really got me thinking of what really could have happened back in the day. I would recommend this book to any woman. and perhaps any man in hopes to enlighten them..."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Taking place in patriarchal times, the story of the red tent is of a literal and figurative \\"woman's place.\\" Yet instead of being banishment, the red tent becomes a place of solidarity and empowerment, a place where traditions and stories, healings and heartaches, real life and death are experienced. The women are forced to find spheres in which they can achieve, and they grow to a place of prominence entirely by their own making. While they may not receive public recognition, they shape the course of history by glueing their community together, passing on tradition and knowledge and raising boys into men who will change the world. The women of The Red Tent leave a rich legacy.What resonated most with me in The Red Tent is that strength and power of women. Having read the novel shortly after having my daughter, I felt ushered into a sisterhood of mothers and women, reaching back through generations and thousands of years. It was invigorating to contemplate the long line of women before me, who, though we may have little in common, shared the mutual bond of womanhood and motherhood. The Red Tent caused me to ponder my own legacy and what I might leave for future generations. It inspired me to see with fresh eyes my own heritage and to reconsider some of my choices, decisions and priorities. There is no greater compliment to literature than that.The Red Tent also caused me to question some of the Western ideas of womanhood. Today the Middle East and the Western world are interacting on levels never seen before. And we are making judgments about their way of life. We Western women look at Middle Eastern women and see them as oppressed and disadvantaged. I wonder how they see themselves and how they see us. Don't get me wrong, I would never give up what freedoms I have to don a burkha, but we view these women through a Western filter. Do they experience closer community, more fulfilled relationships with other women than we do? I don't really know. But The Red Tent gives me pause in my judgment of these women and their traditions. Any book that can get you thinking and questioning tradition, heritage and international relations, deserves some credit."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I was totally blown away by this book. I couldn't put it down. I didn't start reading it when I first got it but boy, it took my me sometime to realize what the women of the Bible had to do. It was emotional, funny and dramatic too. a mixture of alot of emotions in this book. After your done, this book will stay with you and I'll bet at one point in your life you will want to read it again."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I thought the book was good in that it was well written. As to being accurate, it was not. I dont read books to pick them apart and be critical but there were some gross inaccuracies and as a Bible reader, they were blaring. Jacob worshipped one God and so did his wives Rachel and Leah, thats why he married them. They were his only wives. If you want an interesting book to read and arnt concerned with Biblical accuracy, this is a good book."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"The first sentence of the book gave me goosebumps and I knew that this book would be one that I kept for myself and gave to the people that I loved........The Red Tent depicts Dinah's life, the only daughter of Jacob and her biological mother as well as her aunts, whom she viewed as mother's as well. Even though the author does not concentrate on Jacob and his son's or his extended family, I still found it to be one of the best books that I have read in a long time and it breathes a breath of fresh air to all readers that are interested in what could have happened in times where women were viewed as an adquisition and as someone inferior, furthermore, how in some ways it has influenced even how we live today.I have given this book as presents for female friends for as long as I can remember. It is a book that shows the suffering, the joy and the life that women lived in times where men were the masters and rulers and although times have changed, you clearly can see yourself reflected in at least one of the female characters and identify with their struggles on love, men and personal tribulations.This book was so great, inspiring and fulfilling that I found that I could not put it down and finished it in two nights. It is rare that I re-read a book and I find myself coming back to this book and reading it all over again and the thing is, that everytime I read it, I get something new out of it, I learn and understand something else, and I get wrapped up in it all over again.Praise to Anita Diamant for writing such a beautiful and exquisite book!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"What a well-written book! From the moment I picked the book up, I couldn't put it down! Although I get the impression that this book is geared towards an older audience, I am 22 and was really moved by the book. As far as the religious critisms go, while the book may be biased and not 100% accurate, I feel that it is worth putting these views aside to enjoy this touching story of Dinah's journey. I am Catholic and was not at all bothered by the book."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I found that this book, while hardly the miracle of fiction my friends told me it was, was a satisfying and educational read, with a gratifying ending and excellent consistency of voice. The characters are solid, and it is an interesting and rich historical snapshot. The narrator is a fascinating character who puts us very close to the story. The Red Tent is a beautiful and detailed read, and the author manages to keep just on the good side of New-Ageiness without sacrificing the spiritual qualities of the book."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"It doesn't matter if people say it isn't historically accurate: it is a beautiful story that helped me better define what it means to be woman and a mother. I think it would make a great movie if they kept close to the text. I recommend to anyone- male/female, any religion."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I loved this book. Granted, there is some deviation from the Bible but I think the author does a relatively good job of telling a beautiful story. Also, the author does a wonderful job of creating details and personalities while staying with most of the framework read in the Bible. Bottom line - great read."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Didn't think I would like this book because of the religious aspect. However, I couldn't put it down once I started it. Excellent read. Highly recommend."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Historical accuracy is not an essential ingredient in a midrash or any other fictional work, so while I am a biblically based person, I am not at all inclined to use the term 'blasphemy,' as several in my book club have. I was, however, disappointed in the amount of vulgarity. Diamant had the choice to write of sunsets or birthing bricks. Sure, they were a shepherding family - common folk in simple times - but their acts with sheep could have been a bit more inspirational. While I appreciated the topic and enjoyed some of the story line, I found Diamant's negativism disappointing. Perhaps one should read her before Kingsolver or Angelou - in my opinion, they are supberb storytellers, Diamant is not. Still, worth the read."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Excellent Read! This book demonstrates the closeness of women during a time when women were relegated to &quot;The Red Tent&quot;, for a perfectly natural happening. However, during this time they were in control, the tent was their's alone and men were forbidden to enter. It is here they share their secrets, dreams and desires. There are also pitfalls, they must, and do work through. It is about love, hate, lust, desire and the ultimate friendships between women. I recommend this book for everyone, men and women."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"The 1st 200 out of 300 pages were so hard to get through. It was mostly about their everyday life. I told myself when I was 1/2 way through the book if the next 50 pages dont get any better I was going to lay it down. It did get much better. But the book could have been written in 150 pages."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This book is an excellent historical perspective from a female point of view who lived at that time. It gives insight into treatment and status of women during the beginning of the history of Jewish people. The book is fiction but I highly recommend reading this book.These are comments from my wife who read this book."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Firstly, although this book draws characters from the bible it is not christian fiction. This fact is important as I nearly did not read this being aetheist myself! The story is based around the character of Dinah, an only daughter amongst many brothers. She grows up in an almost exclusively female world as as a girl she bears little interest from her father and brothers. The book is well enough written to enjoy a glimpse into a period of time I knew nothing about. It is earthy and does not spare the reader some graphic details of life in those times. It is written from a woman's perspective and the men do not fare well in it. I found it difficult to understand how Jacob, who seemed a fairly sympathetic character for the first part of the book, turned into a monster condoning if not conspiring in a massacre that leads Dinah to flee to Eygpt with her motherinlaw. There are quite a few deadends too, which have been already pointed out by others and so I will skip past them here. In a strange way this, this story ended up unsatisfying as it ended , as our stories do I suppose if we are lucky, in an uneventful old age and death. It also gives too much family detail. As it is fiction and not history it could quite easily have skipped who married whom and how many children they all had in a lot of cases. I gave this four because it is a good and interesting read despite a few faults. It is also an unusual historical setting. I would recommend you read this."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This book is a fictional memoir of Dinah, daughter of Jacob. I wouldn't really call it Biblical, other than it refers to people from her family and uses some of the events described in the Bible as a framework for weaving the story. Beyond that, it is simply a beautifully-told story about a woman growing up in an ancient civilization, with all the different superstitions, religions, and gender role expectations you would expect from that time period. The Red Tent is the refuge the women escape to during their menses. It symbolizes sisterhood, tradition, and rest. She tells stories about growing up with four mothers (Jacob's four wives) and about entering womanhood. She tells about her experiences as a midwife, and as a wife and mother herself. Many of her anecdotes are humorous and ring true today (eg, Having to stop what you're doing every few minutes to feed yet another hungry son, or finding subtle ways to suggest a task to your husband without coming right out and telling him to do so.) She gives vivid descriptions of her experiences, which span the spectrum of love, laughter, pain, grief, and horror. There are some parts which are heart-wrenching, and I admit I shed a few tears, but mainly it's just a touching novel focused on women's relationships with each other and their men in an ancient and rapidly-changing world.For parents: This book discusses many mature topics in a frank and often explicit way: menstruation, masturbation, sex, rape, giving birth, infanticide, circumcision, ancient womanhood rites, bestiality. A parent should probably review this book before handing it to a younger teenager. Some people also found this book to be sacrilegious. Personally, I wasn't bothered by the liberties taken by the author because it was clearly fiction, but those with strong Biblical beliefs might find it upsetting."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This book took me right to the sand. I could see it moving when I closed my eyes. The women, mothers really. That is all they were, but the sorrow and joy made it all worth it. This book changed me how I look at my children and what I would do for them. Anything and everything. The individual strength, determination. I would recommend this book to all women of today."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Let me begin this by stating my problem with this novel has nothing whatsoever to do with the content. I realize there are a number of individuals out there (both men and women) who feel this is a woman's book. This notion in and of itself is ridiculous to me; I do not believe novels to be objects that can or should define gender. My problem lies within the execution of the novel.As this novel was recommended to me by someone whose opinions and tastes I respect, I was fairly eager to read it. In fact, I hurried to finish what I had currently been reading in order to dive into this one. Whereas I had read some mixed reviews about \\"The Red Tent,\\" the plot sounded quite fascinating.Beginning novel, the Prologue and Part One both attracted and repelled me. The idea of the plot itself and what was to come was holding my interest; however, the manner in which the story was being told was making it extremely different for me to plow through. Dinah's voice is extremely passive. Instead of showing what was going on, I felt as though Dinah was telling (and in some cases, even spoon feeding) me everything. Rather than getting to experience what was going on inside the red tent, paragraphs were handed over simply summarizing events and dialogues; thus, making it impossible for me to feel as though I were a part of the story. About two-thirds through Part Two of the novel, \\"The Red Tent\\" became the equivalent of a tedious telephone conversation with a friend who moves her story forward by repeating \\"and then...and then...and then.\\" As with those and similar conversations, I realized I had simply just stopped listening, or in this case, reading.Failing to a finish novels is a crime I rarely commit, but in this case, I simply could not go a sentence further. Does Anita Diamant actually use \\"and then\\" as transitions in her novel? Of course not! However, many composition instructors probably would have encouraged Diamant to try writing her next draft in a more active voice that allows the reader to experience the words instead of simply being handed them. I am sure there is a wonderful and beautiful story within the pages of this book, and I do sincerely regret that my issues with execution of the writing kept me from discovering that story. Maybe I will give it another shot in a year or so!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"There were too many characters and the author insisted on telling you exactly what every one of them was doing on every given moment of the day. I really wanted this book to be good and wanted to see where it was going to go, but I couldn't keep up with all the characters. Most of them seemed pointless. I put it down about half way through."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"i thought...ok....i'll try it! i like to read women's stories...i like the bible...but i'm not overly religious! and i like spice! hard to believe this book gives you everything....even the unexpected sexual tidbit that has you reading the same line a couple times for the sensualness of it! i absolutely loved...loved this book! i hated it to end! buy it! human sexuality in it's most basic form is riveting! they had a good thing going back then sans the present day games we play today for sex and love. i think i'll read it again until something better comes along!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"The Red Tent is absolutely amazing. It was an assigned reading for my Women Studies class and something I would normally cast aside and not read. I am so happy that I did because it is now one of my favorite books. I promise you will read nothing else like it! Days and days after reading it, I still think of Dinah and her biblical life and how real she feels to me although she lived centuries and centuries ago. Just read it and you'll understand."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Biblical days told from the women's viewpoint ... compassionate, understanding, thorough, sexy and the strength and comradery of women sharing feelings and dreams openly together in the red tent."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"\\"The Red Tent\\" is an imaginative re-telling of the story of the Biblical Dinah, daughter of Leah and Jacob and sister of Joseph. It is a novel told from the point of view of Dinah and the women of her family. Anita Diamant gives rich details of the sights, sounds and smells of the ancient \\"Near East\\" as they might have been experienced by nomads, by city dwellers in present-day Israel, and by wealthy urbanites in Egypt. It is a hard book to put down. Read it!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"In the regular Bible, Dinah is rarely ever heard from or talked about. We are taught that she is the quiet overly protected daughter of Jacob and Leah. This was the assumption I brought to my mind as I began to read this bestseller. I thought well, she will just be the narrorator to her brothers' lives and I thought that the red tent was just one of the colors of the tents they used. After about the 4th page I fell in love with this book. History which as a child had bored me stiff was now fascinating and intriguing. I couldn't believe (although fiction) the life of our ancestors could be so thrilling. This book is nearly the best book I have ever read because of its truthfulness yet originality. And I would like to point out that since I am a little young to be reading this, most of my friends have stated that only their mothers have read it, but this is for any woman at any age who comprehends the hardships of being a woman."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I had read everything else that the airport bookstore had to offer and so finally broke down and bought The Red Tent. What a delicious, wonderful, historical, emotional and passionate novel!! The reader is introduced to the many wives of Jacob (Book of Genesis) and their proficiencies and charms each by Dinah, Jacob's only daughter (and as the only woman in her generation - left to continue to hand down the tales, traditions, foods, etc.). The Red Tent is the place where women go to \`be women\\": pass their menstruations, give birth, prepare for marriage, and when they are ill. This wonderful place becomes the \\"women's room\\", the place for the younger ones to learn and the older ones to teach, and place to go if one is ill and need of comfort.The first half of this book, filled with the sweet remembrances of the women in the red tent; their stories and their skills (midwifery, cooking, gardening, herbs, sewing) is the dearest - it is amongst these mothers that Dinah learns to become a midwife. There is something powerful and beautiful about women celebrating what they are all about. The novel changes somewhat when Dinah tells us the tale of Jacob's family's move into the land of Canaan. What happens to Dinah in this book is more satisfying that as it is suggested in the bible. While not a happy event, it is more satisfying, obviously, to believe that Dinah experienced true love. This is a wonderful novel about the value and continuity of the women in history and one I am sorry I waited so long to pick up and read."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Anita Diamont's extraordinary novel, The Red Tent, is the most powerful book I have ever read. Dinah's many voices, as daughter, sister, mother, wife, and friend, reach far into the center of a woman's being, causing an emotional reaction that defies description. While reading Dinah's story, I mourned for the loss of ritualized womanhood and celebratory practices. I mourned for silence in our present day culture, and I renewed my vow to learn and tell the stories of the women in my own family.Diamont has taken the skeletal words of the Book of Genesis and breathed life into most of the stories. Each name is given a full-fledged personality. The mothers of Dinah however; Leah, Rachel, Zilpah, and Bilhah, are given so very much more. The reader grows to know and love them in all of their unique idiosyncratic ways.As a reader, I am in awe of Diamont's story telling capacities. I wonder about her inspiration, her ability to discover these wonderful facts about ancient times, and her flawless attempt at capturing the world of women.Indeed, there appears a timeless thread of female love and devotion that runs through the novel from beginning to end. Dinah's voice, silenced in the book of Genesis, reaches out to the reader from the Prologue to beyond the grave. Diamont's beautiful and poetic language demonstrate that &quot;remembering&quot; is truly &quot;a holy thing.&quot; Let us all pay homage to Dinah, the forgotten one, by choosing to remember, and by choosing to tell, our own mother's stories. Thank you Anita Diamont for opening a door that hopefully will never close again."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I loved this book for all the same reasons everyone else did, but I must add that it was very refreshing to read a book with such a unique format. The format of most stories and novels goes: 1. introduction 2. rising action 3. climax 4. falling action 5. resolutionHowever, \\"The Red Tent\\" has no rising action, so the climax hits you like a ton of bricks making for a very unpredictable story. Then, the story continues to rise and fall in very atypical undulations. I love this completely unpredictable format.One last remark I must make is that I appreciate how Diamant makes no bones about this book being \\"based on\\" or having a direct correlation to the stories in the bible. On the very first page of the book she cautions the reader that the stories and names in \\"The Red Tent\\" may be similar to those of the Bible, but she is in no way implying that they are true or should be believed."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This is a beautiful, sensual book. I would love to believe that this was a more \\"true\\" version of Dinah's story--it makes women much more powerful, much more human than the biblical version.Looking at some of the other reviews, I think that if you have been raised with the histories of Jacob's family that this book is best separated from that history. I don't believe it is blasphemous to consider the possibility that Rebecca's family, for that's who Jacob's wives were, had their own religion and traditions prior to marrying him. I also don't think that it's easy to give up your traditions, and it is probably pretty accurate to assume that although they worshiped Jacob's God with him, they probably also continued their own traditions and rituals. And remember, these traditions were mentioned in the biblical account--Rachel takes Laban's \\"gods\\" from him.Beyond the debate about the religious implications of this book, this is a beautiful story of the strength of women that is told in a way that makes you believe that women have always been powerful in some manner or another."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Really loved this book. The story is fictional with just enough familiarity to make it comfortable. The world of women is believable and certainly will give some (patriarchal?) pause for the celebration of womanhood and motherhood, as well as how connected to the land and life women are in the story. The main character is one of the best female characters I have come across in a while. She becomes a friend to the reader and before the end of the book you will wish there were more like her around. While her life is a result of her circumstances, in many ways - she is self actualized and individual. I loved so much about this story - characters, language, setting and the continuation of a story sadly neglected in other forms of literature. Please read this - you won't be sorry."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I just finished reading The Red Tent and was captivated from the beginning to the end. The Red Tent is an engrossing read, giving us a peak at what life might have been like for women in biblical days. Expecting to be at a loss with the biblical references, I was pleased to discover that this was not neccessarily a historical novel but a love story about women and their bonds. This book is about motherhood, midwifery, sisterhood and family. As a mother, this book tugged at my heart strings, reminding me about the precious nature of children and further solidified my respect for those women engaged in the profession of midwifery. As a woman it reminded me of the amazing support that can found in the company of women. The story of the Red Tent will remain with the reader long after the last page."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"The Red Tent, like Girl With A Pearl Earring, is an example of historical fiction that the reader wishes really were true. In my mind, the story of Dinah and her mothers (Jacob's wives) is how it really happened.Anita Diamant lovingly unwraps the lives of generations of Biblical women in a way that reaffirms the fundamental truths of womanhood. Community, suffering, loving, childrearing - all are painted accurately and beautifully in this book.Don't be fooled into thinking this story is from a solidly Jewish or Christian perspective. While the story's roots are from the Old Testament, Dinah's chidhood is filled with mystical beliefs and only a vague understanding of her father's God. As an older woman, she lives in Egypt and that's the end of Biblical lore as we know it.I would love to hear a male perspective of this book. I would be hard-pressed to recommend it to a man, simply because the story depends so much on the reader's intimate understanding of femininity."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"What an interesting character Dinah becomes as she ages. When the reader first meets Dinah she is a child &amp; looks on her four mothers with a child's accepting eye, as she enters puberty the meaning of THE RED TENT becomes ever more clear to her. As with all teen girls there is angst in dealing with the mothers, but soon Dinah falls in love, &quot;marries&quot; and the rest of her life begins. Despite all she endures through her family, her travel to Egypt, difficult circumstances, Dinah survives to her end as a strong, graceful woman.Anita Diamant takes great liberties with this Biblical story. (The reader should keep in mind that this is FICTION based on the Bible.) The story is engrossing. A fast read. The characters are not deeply developed, yet the reader feels as though she knows them. After finishing THE RED TENT I re-read the Bible story &amp; researched &quot;Dinah's&quot; words in THE FIVE BOOKS OF MIRIAM. THE RED TENT was a place to begin studying this story. I hope the author provides more Midrash as a jumping off point for study.I am glad I got to know Dinah--she has remained with me in spirit. It is easy to recommend this book. As with Anita Diamant's other writings, THE RED TENT will enhance your life."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I really enjoyed the author's writing style, but I felt after a while that the story became a little too interior, almost claustrophobic--I wish that she had described more scenes that really transported you to the places in the novel. I also thought that the strongest past of the book was the best; after Dinah left the company of her mothers the book became curiously weak, and trailed off. Not surprisingly, I didn't find any of Diamant's male characters very engaging. I loved reading about an exclusively woman's culture (perhaps I should say Womyn's Culture!) but I can see where conservative readers who are far more familiar with the Bible than I am would not appreciate the liberties taken with the holy scripture."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"It may or maynot have been a good representation of life for women at that time, but it just did not appeal to me."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"it was a read for my woman's bookclub. it was okay but would not be enthusiastic about recommending it to be read."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Received the book quickly and was in new condition. I have purchased several books from Amazon and all were sent on time and in good condition. This book was purchased for a book club reading and review."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This book is the perfect choice for any woman who wants to feel powerful. Beautifully written and well-researched."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Great book, quick shipping, will definitely do business again!! This book took you on a journey of mind stimulation and spiritual enrichment. Some of the events were not exactly inline with the bible's records but yet an awesome read. Love the vantage point of a women as women, in the bible are not given as much attention as men so it was refreshing!!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I'm one that does not happen to believe the bible is an historical book. It is rather legend with lessons set in a time long forgotten. I enjoyed the author's imagination as much as I enjoy the imaginations of authors of the bible. It was a fun read and tickled up wonderful pictures and possibilities. If you're stuck on biblical accuracy, you'll have a problem. If you enjoy a good story that flows with artistic grace, you'll love this book."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"The book was shipped in a timely manner and I am looking foward to reading it. It was suggested by a friend and it seems like it is going to be very interesting."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This is an absolutely awesome book written as a fictional memoir of Diana, the grand daughter of Isaac and daughter of Jacob. I re-read this book about once a year, after stumbling on it in 2000. I can't say enough good things about it, or about the author, Ms Diamant. Read the book; you won't be sorry.I did take issue with her decision to take prominent biblical character and make them bisexual, when this is not indicated anywhere in the bible. (I won't reveal which character... read the book! LOL)I contacted Ms Diamant in 2001 and offered this small criticism in an email otherwise praising her work. She was very gracious to take the time to respond to me, a fan, and explained the wrinkle added to the character's sexuality was a creative choice made by her as an author in an attempt to make the story more interesting.Fair enough! I can't believe she was so sweet in the way she answered my criticism personally. It is so rare for a writer of her stature to even take time to answer any fan mail, let alone to respond to some thing negative in a very constructive and charming way.I rate her among my favorite fiction authors, and heartily recommend any of her work."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Yes, THE RED TENT needs to become a film SOON.Who will do this?"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"The book club just finished The Red Tent, a fictional account of Jacob's wives, their handmaids, and Dinah, his daughter by Leah. My primary feeling after reading it is, \\"HUH?\\" It's true that Jacob had 12 sons and that his wives were Leah and Rachel. It's also true that Bilhah and Zilpah, handmaids to his wives, bore him sons. We know also that he had a daughter named Dinah who was \\"defiled\\" by Shechem, a prince. It stands to reason that a household as large as Jacob's would have its share of drama and its issues dealing with relationships, but I somehow feel a bit uncomfortable with this version of events.Reading the novel prompted me to go to the scriptures to read the actual account as recorded in the King James Version. We all know that certain things were lost, added, or modified through the various translations. While I'm admittedly no Biblical scholar, I couldn't find enough information in these passages to substantiate the author's version of events. I'd like to think that Dinah went on to have a handsome son and to find love later in her life, but there's no indication that she did.Still, the novel was well-written and captivating, and if you want to know more about the life and times of this era and perhaps get a \\"first hand\\" look at how things might have been in the red tent, it's definitely worth your time to read this book."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"THE RED TENT is a wonderfully evocative novel set in an underused period of history. Diamant's story of Dinah (a Biblical character who gets very little 'screen' time in the Bible itself) recalls the engrossing historical extrapolations of Mary Renault and Miranda Seymour. I give it a 9 rather than a 10 only because as an Extremely Fussy Person, I quibbled at a Biblical-period character's use of the word 'petite' to describe someone. Let's all hope Ms. Diamant continues working her way through female biblical characters; I'd love to see her novel about Queen Esther!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Every person I knew praised this book. I thought to myself, why not, and give it a try. I felt that the idea behind it was good, but the literature read like reading a women's trash novel. I actually listened to this book on tape and at times I felt I had a soap opera on. If trash novels and soap operas aren't for you, skip this one."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This is a beautifully written book. The minute I finished it, I sat down and re-read Genesis. Fabulous!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"What a compelling view of the women in the Old Testament! I was really impressed by Dinah's tenacity. Diamant intertwined reverence for our mothers, beautiful love stories, invincible friendships and difficult journeys in this novel. Keep a box of tissues nearby, and let yourself become entranced by Dinah's magical world."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I started THE RED TENT a few months ago and really couldn't get into it. When I found that my local library was going to have a discussion of it and after several friends raved about the book I gave it another try. It does take a little to get into it but after that I enjoyed it.As I turned the pages of THE RED TENT all of a sudden I felt that Martha Ballard, the midwife made famous by Laurel Thatcher Ulrich in MIDWIFE'S TALE was coming out of the pages. Now this is not to say that Diamant plagerized someone else's story. However, I would be willing to bet that Diamant studied Ulrich's work. Both Dinah and Martha were midwives. Both books show the importance of midwives in their respective cultures. Both books how how women contributed to the economy of thier families through their weaving and other tasks. Both books show how women bonded together during the birthing process, although Diamant shows that there was a bonding during the three days in the red tent each month. In both books you can see that there was not place for single women in the society.In Martha Ballard's life there is the story of a rape. Although the woman is raped, her husband is the &quot;victim&quot; becuase his rights have been violated. Much the same happens with Dinah. However, I didn't think that the author made it clear when Dinah's brothers killed her husband. At first I thought that I was the only one that missed that point but several other people had the same problem.I was also confused as to how all of the women had their periods at the same time, however, I'm told that that happens when women live together - it's news to me. However, a footnote or a forward by the author about that and other historical points in the book would have helped. Also, someone in my book club mentioned that a map would have also helped.All in all, it was a good read. It gives a depiction of women in bibical times that has not previously been shown."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"At the challenge posed to me by many of the previous comment authors, I will do my best to maintain an \\"open mind.\\" There are some who say this book sucked because it erred from what is portrayed in the Bible itself. Some say it is a fabulous work of art.Where do I start? I too have felt that there was something missing from Dinah's story in the Bible. But this is definitely not it.This book was so incredibly well written. I could feel myself walking in Dinah's shoes through ancient Israel; I was so angry with Rebecca, the \\"grandmother,\\" in Mamre; I could see the mountains in the distance and watch Jacob's flocks coming in; I burned with emotions in Shechem. I could smell the smells of spices and dirty people in the market places of Egypt. I felt a bit confined in the close neighborhood of Goshen. I felt a breathe of cool air when Benia noticed Dinah. Anita Diamant is an incredible storyteller.But I too almost put the book down in the middle of it. I don't know if I would recommend it. It strayed so far from the Bible. I am a believer in the Bible. I was very offended by the pagan practices of the women. The coming-of-age, frog goddess greatly disturbed me. The portrayal of Rebecca reminded me more of Jezebel. The fact that none of the characters intimate with the reader accepted the God of Jacob was burdensome to me. Of course, even being a believer in Him does not cause me to assume that every book I read will acknowledge Him, but in an area as sensitive as this story, I expected a more biblical account.A great deal of work and research went into the making of this book, and I learned a lot from it. I valued the closeness to one another that the characters felt and I would aim to model that. The prose was unbelievable it was so believable.But in the end, I found myself mentally revoking the \\"blessing\\" of Dinah. I do not want her and all of these creepy women with me always. Their \\"spirits\\" do not comfort me. The psuedo-peaceful monologue with which the author ends was unsettling to me, and so I felt it had a bitter aftertaste.There you have my two cents on Anita Diamant's wildly popular book, The Red Tent. I feel that I can safely warn interested readers to read at their own risk."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Though I did like the author's writing style I was disappointed to see my &quot;heroes in the faith&quot; from the bible trivialized and in most cases even distorted. The people who praised Ms. Diamante's insight into biblical events appear to me as not having read the &quot;original&quot;. If she was trying to just write another story, she did a well enough job, but I don't think that this book will inspire women out there about God or his word - if anything, it will make them more cynical about the roots of judaism and christianity... I would not recommend the book to christian believers out there - some sexual parts are too graphic, and again, are trivializing people we admire...too bad, this story could have really made an impact!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I was loving this book almost all the way through until, in her dramatic interpretation of the Biblical story of Rachel and Leah, the author COMPLETELY departed from Scripture!! Beware. She not only portrays Joseph as a homosexual, she has him actually succumb to Potiphar's wife- which is direct contradiction of the truth. Literary license is one thing, but changing the Word of God is dangerously another."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Could not finish it. Too many men having sex with the goats/sheep. Blaaack! And totally not according to the Biblical account."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I enjoyed this book because of the relationships of the women and their experiences together. The book makes a minor associated reference to the biblical story of Dinah, but Anita Diamant did a wonderful job of writing a fictional story. I enjoyed it!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I kept repeating that phrase to myself over and over as I read this book! Some books I've read because I got caught up in the story and just had to see what happened next. Some books I've read because I was just determined to finish it. This book was just wonderful! I not only enjoyed the story line; I enjoyed just reading the book. Picking it up and moving my eyes across the pages was sheer pleasure. It is a definite re-read for me.The Red Tent presents a fictionalized account of Dinah's life. If that word &quot;fictionalized&quot; bothers you, don't read it. However, I found the book to be believable and quite realistic. I didn't see such a big leap from the Old Testament to this fiction. This book really humanized the Bible personas for me and caused me to relate to their stories in a different way. But the main thrust of the book is about women. Celebrating womanhood and our rites of passage and cycles of life with ritual, something that has largely been lost in today's society. The Red Tent shows the power of history (or rather herstory). Reading how the women lived and interacted together was fascinating and dare I say empowering. This book was about sisterhood without shame.I loved the words the author used. She was very descriptive without being too drawn out.I could picture everything and hear everything. I felt such emphathy for the characters. I really got something from this book. It is the best book that I have read in a long time. I highly recommend it. It was a refreshing change for me from dumb selections that I kept encountering.By the way, if people think The Red Tent was just about bleeding, then I say they just don't get it. The Red Tent was a war room, a boudior, a salon, a birthing chamber, a confessional, a school room, a nursery, and a sanctuary. Read it for yourself!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Diamant is a writer of great skill and has woven a book both poignant and powerful, with beautifully crafted characters I could see easily as I read. As I woman, I wept at some of the loving descriptions of the beautiful mysteries shared by women of all time. But the inescapable fact, glaring throughout the book, is that it is a work of slander and defamation of historical and, to many around the world, heroic figures who are not around to defend themselves.The previous reviewer with the most apt and concise description of the book has said that it is &quot;profoundly anti-Judeo-Christian&quot;. The foremost theme of this fiction is worship of the mother goddess, frowned upon then as now by the first of the ten commandments.Abram(never Abraham) is not the father of a great nation of promise, but a countrified oaf; Jacob a crass, insensitive tyrant; and Joseph, no longer the moral giant who perseveres through faith over rejection and crushing prejudice, is now a whiny, spoiled opportunist. The women and their numerous pagan dieties hold the only moral high ground available here.The most telling indictment of Biblical patriarchical structure comes from Dinah's own mouth as she shrieks thunderous curses at Jacob, Joseph and all his brothers, whereupon they, of course, tremble and begin loss of health, wealth and influence right away. Her wrath seems entirely justified by the sensational slasher story preceding it, which, unfortunately, many people will take as truth.An artful wordsmith evokes our deepest gut-level response, and Ms. Diamant has done this well."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"It is said that the story told in The Red Tent is like it would have been if the Bible were written by women.The main character in the book is Dinah. She is the daughter of Jacob and the sister of his 12 sons from the book of Genesis. We only get a tiny little hint on Dinah in the Bibel story, here in the book we meet first a little girl, deeply loved and spoiled by her mothers, the four wives of Jacob, later she is growing up to be a strong woman, living in a remarkable period of early history.The Red Tent tells a story of bounds between women, strong women in a society where the most important is to be a man, a strong man. Anita Diamant tells us a story it is easy to believe in. It could all have happend this way. Her pen make this period of history glow, the storytelling is so rich and the people come alive even in our world of 2001.Thank you Anita Diamant for giving me this story, reading the first books in the Bibel will never be the same for me after this. You have helped me to start using my imagination to read the story behind the story.Britt Arnhild Lindland"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Half way through this book, I discarded it. I was sick of reading about the menstrual cycle and birth details of the women in Jacob's tribe. However, I always finish a book, so I picked it up again some weeks later. Taking a fresh view, I became transported to the biblical world of women and was surprised at the richness of their lives. Not being a biblical scholar, I knew nothing of the story of Dinah and was horrified. I checked the bible - the authors story relates to valid passages. I am impressed at the author's skill in using her knowledge of biblical lifestyles to tell Dinah's life story."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This could have been a 5 star story, given Anita Diamant's research about the intimate details of the lives of both Jewish and gentile women and the private female rites of passage, had she not chosen a well known and beloved biblcial story upon which to base it.However, she took what is, in my opinion, one of the most beautiful stories of familial unconditional love and forgiveness in history and sullies it.The great story of Jacob and his beloved Rachel as well as the heart-rending pain of Leah as the \\"other\\" wife yearning to be loved, which is revealed by the biblical story in the names she gives her boys is lost.Rebecca is reduced to a sharp tongued, selfish fortune-telling oracle with nothing but disdain for her husband. This is an unimaginable description of her when one knows the story of her generous, loving and giving nature based on why she was chosen as the wife of Issac.The story of Joseph which illustrates his great ethical and moral choices amidst his trials and tribulations and the eventual revelation of God's great plan of mercy and love bringng out the real purpose behind it, is full of wonderful lessons. Diamant's imagined insights into these persons inner thoughts and reasoning seems diametrcally opposed to the story as told in the bible.What is, in effect a moving story of a family's loving reunion and Joseph's unforgettable statement to his brothers as he sets their fears at ease in scripture when he tells them \\"What you meant for evil, God meant for good.\\" is negated in a blatant reworking. She leaves out Joseph's request to his brothers to take his bones back to Canaan and describes a father's prophectic farewell as the ravings of an old man who is neither loved nor respected.Diamant's story is filled with resentment, bitterness and unforgiveness to the end. Her character development reveals little of the depth of the sacrificial love of the real people in the true story."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Anita Diamant's book purports to show the Biblical story of Jacob and his sons through the eyes of Dinah, who is shown exclusively as a victim in Scripture itself. I am very taken with the idea of telling the story from a new point of view, and I find the notion of female bonding in a \\"red tent\\" appealing in some ways.Unfortunately, Diamant shows that sometimes knowing a little is far worse than knowing nothing at all. Diamant is aware that the Jewish tradition of midrash has allowed Biblical stories to be reinterpreted through the ages. However,this should not be interpreted as a license that anything goes. I am shocked that Diamant has made a rapist (Shalem=Shechem) into a hero, that she is openly scornful of the worship of El (i.e.,the Jewish G-d) throughout the book (idolatry is treated with great respect,however), and that she imputes to our ancestor Jacob a dalliance in beastiality. I'm no prude, mind you, but surely there must be some limits indicating respect for the Biblical text. Indeed, the hallmark of midrash is that it ties interpretation to the text, even as it alters the meaning. Diamant never really shows how her reading could be remotely plausible.The other problem is that Diamant's work just doesn't ring true historically. In Red Tent, the idolatrous wives are scornful of Jacob's G-d. In fact, it is monotheists who are scornful of idolatry - idolaters have great respect for the gods of others, especially those of their husbands. Thus Jacob would have been scornful of the women's idolatry, but they would not have had a problem with his worship of El. Though we can't know for sure, it is likely that women spent time apart from their husband during their menstrual cycles. These had nothing, however, to do with the lunar cycle, and it is inconceivable that it was an opportunity for fun and relaxation, as Diamant imagines. And by the way, shortening Naphtali to Tali is clearly wrong as it destroys the sense of the name (Tali is,in fact, a short form of Avital).Diamant's book would be fine, I suppose, if you read it without knowing or caring about the Bible story. However, as Diamant herself has put the story front and center, it must ultimatley judged against it. I would love to see a creative, feminist reading of the Dinah story. Sadly, Diamant's work falls far short of this worthy goal."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I owe a lot to Anita Diamant. I have used her very insightful books on Judaism as part of a personal spiritual journey, and found her to be a wise, funny and relatable advisor. However, I must admit that her excursion into fiction sadly disappointed me.It's not that she takes liberties with the foundational text--as other reviewers have noted, that is simply creative license, and is available to any author working in \\"historical\\" times. Nor was I too put off by her ignorance of real Bronze Age customs; while accuracy in historical research is valuable, Ms. Diamant at no point claimed to be writing a documentary. Like others, I was distracted by the overt paganism, but could understand that Diamant was trying to show the background against which the stories of the Patriarchs take place. I saw no justification whatsoever for the kinky sex, the ritual defloration (which almost made me gag) or the hints of bestiality, but I will admit that they do add a new and thought-provoking dimension to the text.Rather, from a storytelling point of view, Ms. Diamant lets down her audience in a spectacular way. The turning point of this book is the destruction of Shechem. Everything in Dinah's life in the first part of the book leads up to it; it affects every element of her life, and changes the course of her life forever. Nor does the attack on Shechem affect only Dinah; the aftermath leaves Jacob a hated man in that part of the world, and undermines his moral authority for the rest of his life. It reshapes the politics of the world Diamant has drawn, and rearranges the family dynamics among the women and their children. Yet this pivotal scene, which should echo with blood and terror and war and ACTION, is so underwritten I actually wondered if pages had been accidentally left out of my printing of the book. Dinah literally sleeps through the most emotionally devastating moment of her life. The emotional focus, temperature and dynamics of the novel change 180 degrees in the blink of an eye--and that eye is closed. We do not see it, only its aftereffects. I was profoundly disappointed when I realized that Diamant had simply not written the most important scene in this book. This has nothing to do with feminism or biblical critique or historical accuracy: it's just bad writing."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Forget the biblical references, and I beg you to read this book regardless of them if you find them offensive. This is a fantastic, historical fiction novel. It moved me in ways I cannot explain and I actually shed tears when it was over because I wanted more. It was given to me by a friend and I never would have picked it up myself based soley on the descirptions on the inside flap and back cover. DO NOT judge this book by its cover. I am an avid reader and rank this novel as my all time favorite. It should be required reading for all women to help them feel connected to their past and present as well as to each other. It is both powerful and uplifting. 5 stars is not enough."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Since it is a rare genre, biblical fiction, it can definitely rub people the wrong way, as it retells the story of Dinah (daughter of Jacob and Leah) from her perspective and that of the women of the House of Israel. It does portray some revered Biblical characters, most notably Jacob in a less than favorable light, so it isn't a book for everyone. I must admit that I have a special place in my heart for Joseph of Egypt, and consequently bristled at her portrayal of one of my heroes, who I feel was virtuous and honorable.I didn't think this was a feminist book per se, as much as it was feminine (as many of my associates typically define feminism rather narrowly to mean women pointing out the oppression that men impose women and the negatives that are connected with a patriarchal society, but that is another story). The story's purpose isn't to chronicle the historical injustices in biblical societies, but to show the traditions and customs of women that were passed from mother to daughter, but not written down, therefore, quite to be dismissed or forgotten.Although it does fictionalize historical characters, making the particulars fiction, this book just radiates a sense of truth. Most likely, many of the events of the Bible didn't happen exactly as portrayed in this novel (admittedly it is a novel, not revisionist biblical historical research), but it shows the life of women in biblical times with a greater vibrancy than anything I've seen. It's a great read, to be read with a grain of salt, but NOT to be completely discounted either.I liked that she change the temporal scale on some of the events compared to that of the Bible, most notable that of her mothers. Jacob waited 7 years for Rachel, only to find Leah, and then wait another 7 for Rachel? In ancient times that makes her an old, over-the-hill spinster before their honeymoon. Seeing that 7 (along with 3, 12, 40 and 70) is an important symbolic number in the Bible, the accuracy of the number as a literal number is dubious at best. Much like the 40 days and 40 nights, it was probably an expression that would be understood by their contemporaries. Making it 7 months for Leah and another 7 for Rachel seemed a good way to tell the story.I've always assumed from my readings of the Bible that Dinah was never raped in the way that we consider it today. From the sounds of it her fianc&eacute;e was smitten, implying that the feelings were probably mutual. She wasn't raped anymore that most \\"shotgun weddings\\" that involved premarital relations.I also feel that Dinah was most likely NOT the only daughter of Jacob, she's just the only one specifically mentioned in the Bible because of the disaster surrounding her engagement. IF that never happened, we wouldn't know about her, since most ancient Middle Eastern religious texts avoid mentioning the women involved. Part of me wishes that Diament wrote several \\"sister\\" characters, but it would probably detract from the emphasis being on Dinah."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This book was given as a gift to my mother, but I snatched it up and read it first. I was blown away by this novel. I couldn't put it down. I read it over two nights and I loved it. As I child I was familiar with Dinah's tale in my bible stories. There she was portrayed as a wild girl who spent time with the \\"wrong\\" crowd and ended up in \\"sin\\". This Dinah and all the women in this book are not colourless creatures but warm, wonderful characters rich in traditions and rituals. They give voice to the feminine and touched a deep chord in me. Their sisterhood gives them strength. I read it and was proud to be a female and heir to their wisdom. I have a 14 month old daughter and this book as made me ponder what wisdom do I as a mother have to pass on to her. As soon as she is old enought I'll give her this book to read.

One of the best books ive read in a very long time. Gives a very interesting look into the lives of women during this time. READ IT!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Anita Diamant's The Red Tent is a well-researched and creatively-imagined first-person account of the life of a woman during Biblical times. The story follow's Dinah, the sole daughter of Jacob and his four wives. The Red Tent focuses on the women's daily rituals while following Dinah from her birth to her death, (even several years previous, and a little bit afterwards). The story is slow paced but highly believable, and makes for an interesting and compelling read. *Disclaimer* This really isn't a choice for younger readers because some of the issues expressed in the book contain mature themes that really aren't suitable for some people, and may even seem controversial to adults. The entire story is somewhat controversial, because essentially it's a Biblical fanfiction, which may be offensive to some people. But I feel that that's a poor reason not to read a book, especially this one.If you enjoyed reading The Red Tent, I also reccomend reading The Life of Pi and Oryx and Crake, particualarly the latter, which is a neo-creationistic story set in a not-terribly-distant future."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This is a book that uses the family and timeframe of Genisis but is from a woman's perspective, Dinah.

The roles of the women in the Red Tent are celebrated and appreciated. While still showing emotions, the women also show character, strength, feminity, and so much more. The book shows how men depended on the women to help make decisions for the entire family or community. I found this book comforting and enlightening in a time when religious indifference is on the daily news."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"A delicious read. As a mother, the tales of the various births and the respect and pride with which each mother in the book regarded her children moved me to tears. What a tribute to the renewal of life! Ms. Diamant celebrates birth, and babies, in a rich and dignified manner. I do wish that the nay-sayers begging for mercy for Ms. Diamant could stretch their literal interpretations a little. I say, Bravo! There is room in the world for the history of women, and it doesn't have to be in conflict with the history of men. There is no account of these women's feelings in the Bible, but that absolutely does not mean that they didn't have them! Imagine you don't have a chronicle to pass down to your children's children--does that make you any less a feeling person? NO! I enjoyed the book for what it provides. At the very least, it is a rejoicing of the gifts women have been given by God. Birth, wisdom, patience, understanding, and mercy. Be proud of what women provide to the world."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This book pulled me in and held me spellbound until I finished it. From a single mention of Dinah's name in the bible, Anita Diamant brought a whole world to life. Dinah's story is the story of all the women whose names and voices have been lost or intentionally silenced by over two thousand years of patriarchial religion. Her story, with all its physical and emotional details of womanhood, is simply beautiful. Diamant's writing is smooth and often lyrical, celebrating women and the work of home and family. A beautiful, beautiful book that I highly recommend."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I enjoyed this book as a work of fiction, noting that it departed radically from the true story of Rebecca and Issac's descendents found in Genesis. Description of characters in this book is entertaining, though inconsistent with the Bible. Through Diamant's writing, Dinah's mothers were reduced from women of God to pagans. Dinah was not raped, but allegedly fell in love with the prince Shalem. The family life portrayed was interesting, though a little much. I grew tired of their songs, goddesses, and child bearing. I was disappointed at the lack of a relationship between Jacob and Dinah, the rapidity with which Jacob (and the entire family) fell, and what I perceived as the weakening of Dinah's character near the end of the novel. All in all, a good read, if one keeps in mind that it is purely fiction and often contradictory to the Bible."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I am shocked and amazed at the readers who did not love this book. It was a wonderful story of sisterhood, envy, broken trust, forgivenss, restoration, atonement and healing. Even if one does not agree with the events (polygomy and sexism) in the book there is much to love. The writing was excellent, for example; descriptions of the love scenes, the sacredness of the womb, mentstration and childbirth. Those who are familiar with rituals can see the connection to days of old negative or positive.Dinah tells the story of how here circle of sisters upheld and practiced these rituals with reverence. Later in the story you see the contrast of women from other circles who do not value the rituals and therefore do not value themselves. As women we are all midwives because we are keepers of ritual and pass on our values of divinity mind, body and spirit. Most pivitol in this is that men are kept out of women's business. No man knew what was going on in the Red Tent and therefore it was respected until some misunderstood the importance of it all later in the story.I close saying that depending on what your references are culturally, spiritually or personally this story reflects that perspective. My hope is that it will change, renew or redefine it as a result of this colorful explanation through the lens of Dinah. The barbarian philosophies and actions still exist in The New Millenium however it is the responsibility as womb-an to call forth the divine and activate or reactivate sacred rituals for our own self care.Read it and pass it on,LT"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I haven't read Fictional books in years.

Yes, it's true that the novel is fictional (that's why it's a novel rather than a biography), but Diamant is very clever in her plot. The literal story from the Bible does not entirely make sense from a logical standpoint (for example, that a man tricked into marrying the ugly sister would have so many children with her), and the author's imagination makes sense of it all.

Told in first person through the character of Dinah, the only daughter of Jacob and Leah, \`The Red Tent' is a story of struggle, hardships, betrayals perseverance, courage, and love. Drawing from biblical references, Anita Diamant has rewritten this Old Testament story and given Dinah a new space to breath, laugh, love, suffer, and live. The novel begins with Dinah telling the reader the stories that have been handed down to her from her mother and aunts (Leah, Rachel, Bilhah, and Zilpah). Within the shelter of the Red Tent, the menstrual and birthing tent, a place of laughter, pain, and life, the four sisters share their stories with their young daughter and niece. And when the time comes for Dinah they welcome her with open arms when her time comes for her to enter a new stage in her life.By the time Dinah is welcomed into the tent as a woman and no longer as child the narrative has switched from the four sister's lives to Dinah's life. Within the succeeding chapters, Dinah relates her young life, her journey into adulthood, her fist love, their brutal separation, her life in Egypt away from the family that loved then betrayed her, the birth of her only son, her growing reputation as an exceptional midwife, her reunion with her family, and finally the finding of her second love Benia.From the beginning and up until the end of the novel, you feel as if Dinah is talking to you; as if you were the daughter she never had and she was passing her story on through you as her mother and aunts did through her. Diamant's flawless use of imagery provides a perfect resting place for this dialogue between narrator and reader, making the story utterly believable and captivating. In the end, she beautifully adds life to this very black-and-white story; giving biblical history a beautiful shade of red."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"It clearly helps to believe in G*d, and to have read the Bible, to suspend disbelief and live in this fully-realized story of Rebecca, Sarah, Rachel, and Leah, from Dinah's viewpoint. And to have a mental imprint of the terrain of modern and ancient Israel and the rest of the Middle East. The plausible story moves over terrain lately in the news, as it always has been in the news, since before the time of the Bible. Seculars who aren't feminists or interested in the relationships of men and women in a patriarchal society might find it unconvincing, possibly even \\"disgusting\\" as one reviewer put it, although that seems like an extreme reaction. If anything Diamant is delicate in her descriptions of daily life and love, and love wins out."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I really liked this book. It did have a tendency to brush past many years to get to another point, but it really didn't hinder the story."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This book moved me in such a way that when I began I felt different and then as I continued to read, I could not put it down, dying to know what would happen next. Then when I finished it, I was sad that it was over but I know the feelings and impressions will last with me always. I loved the way the story was told and came full circle leaving me with closure at the end."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This book started at a very slow pace giving a lot of background and setting the stage for the second half. I almost gave up wondering if it was actually leading anywhere. Then Diamant drops the bomb and book rips into gear. She creates an idyllic world for her main character's upbringing. Raised by her \\"mothers\\", the women's lives are largely segregated from the men's. The men have different lives and different values, competitive and violent. The women, in contrast, nurture and share, and you can see the importance of feminine values and the consequences of ignoring these values. In everything there must be balance and this book reminded me how dangerous an unbalanced world can be."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I don't often read a book twice. Especially in the same year... This book is a wonderful work of fiction -- Anita Diamant weaves a beautiful story that I had to re-read. I tried to get my husband to listen to the audio book on a road trip and he quit during the second disc because he couldn't stand the detailed descriptions of their birthing experiences. That's fair..."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This book came highly recommended by a friend, and I am glad that she did. I couldn't put it down. It was very well written. I am not a very religious person but I was enthralled by the setting and events that take place in this book, it makes me want to read the Bible more thouroghly, especially about Jacob.I really felt like Anita Diamant helped me to connect to all her characters. Being a friend, daughter, sister, wife and mother myself, I was very intrigued by the bonds all of these women to each other.I truly enjoyed it."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This book put a unique perspective on a women's role during Bibical times. I love it and found the historical content seemlessly interwined with a creative plot so you can't help learning soemthing new with each turn of the page."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I was intruiged with the idea when I heard about it. Of writing about the Dinah of the Bible. I was severely disappointed by the book. I was disgusted by what I perceived was the unbalanced focus on sex and all types and elements of it. Presented apart from the meaningfulness of the rest of life and interactions among humans. I avoid the soft porn romance novels because of this type of thing. I want relationships, not cartoon characters. The people, women and men, didn't talk or behave like anyone I know or have ever met. I enjoyed finding out more about daily life back in that time, but would've done better to find it out from a non-fiction book."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"As someone who strongly disbelieve in labels, I never thought of \`The Red Tent' as a women novel. Many readers talk about it like a wonderful novel. However, I have noticed that most women who read this book enjoy it, while I haven't find many men who tried this novel.From the beginning, Anita Diamant's book didn't get my attention. I found the female characters too good to be true. All the women should have a halo over their heads, because they are almost like saints. They can bear pain, they have good hearts and are full of love, while most men are men and selfish. Gender discussion aside, those people don't appeal me as characters. I found them too one-dimensional, and full of themselves.The narrative in this novel is complicated. The narrator is Dinah, a girl who's briefly mentioned in the bible. On the one hand, Diamant has created her whole story from square one; on the other she didn't have many evidences of what she's been writing. We must bear in mind, that \`The Red Tent' is fiction. The author herself has admitted that in her personal website. There is not proof of the so-called Red Tent, or the bricks mentioned in the novel. As far as fantasy is concerned, the novel didn't work for me. As I have aforementioned, the women are too nice and smart. Most of them sound like martyrs. I don't mean that there aren't --or even weren't, for that matter-- strong women. My issue in this novel is with the narrative itself.As a man, I don't mind reading books that are supposedly for women --albeit I don't believe in such things. Calling bad novels \`book for women' sounds like depreciating women's intelligence. All in all, either being a chick lit or not, The Red Tent did not work for me. And all the hype is meaningless."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"The first time that I read this book, right after it was published I enjoyed it, now that I have read it again, having read other works of historical/biblical fiction I'm not sure why. As a work of fiction it is well written, and I would recommend it but, there are other works that portray the story of Jacob and his family with more accuracy."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"First, I must confess that I wrote a review--my first and only--of this book almost two years ago that I've always thought unfair. I've often thought that I should have been more open-minded and critiqued the book less harshly. Imagine my surprise to come back here and see that I could edit my words.Having since written two novels of my own, I am more keenly aware that when an author is successful, the work will elicit a strong reaction from the reader. This novel did just that for me--positive or negative, it did as it was designed.My intial reaction to the book was passionate--too passionate and I regret that I critiqued it capriciously.The very nature of the subject matter--gender, religion--is enough of a reason to respond to the work with ferver. When the work is well written, the effect is more intensified.I am an avid reader of theologically-based novels. I had high hopes for this book. In many ways, it's well written and indeed an interesting point of view.For my taste, I have to say, the graphic descriptions of menstruation, birth, midwifery, were too plentiful. Yet, that's an important part of the story. These passages were handled appropriately. However, not being a favorite subject of mine, for this reason, I rate the novel with three stars.Literarily, the book is sound--ambitious, but not disappointing."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I quite like to read storys about women and that is what I got here. It was not the best book I ever read, but it could have been worse."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I was excited to read THE RED TENT because I had heard such wonderful things about it. However, as I read, I grew increasingly disappointed by the callousness of the author in regards to the Word of God. I acknowledge that this is a piece of fiction. My question for the author is, if you intended to write a piece of fiction based on an actual person, why did you not accurately use the facts on hand and build your story upon the truth? Why would you base your story on a real person and then change almost everything that you knew to be true about that person and the other related characters? It just doesn't make sense. Diamant weaves just enough truth into her work that readers with little knowledge of the Bible believe that her events may actually be possible. From the lineage graph in the beginning to Dinah's encounter with the prince, Diamant has taken liberty wtih the truth and changed it for a purpose that perplexes me. Just from a literary point of view, having that may errors proved a distration for me. I was so caught up in blatant errors that I couldn't fully enjoy the excellent descriptive passages. From a biblical stand point, her lack of regard for the truth was disturbing. The Holy Bible is the most dynamic piece of literature in human interest. It doesn't need to be \\"jazzed\\" up. Her novel would have rated 5 stars if she had made the entire piece fictional and had not \\"based\\" it on a actual person...."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This book was not what I expected from reading the other reviews. This book is not Biblical!!! The only thing she took from the Bible were the names. It should be looked at as a TOTALLY fictional story. It was good reading until about half way through, then it got kind of slow."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This book does not accurately represent the Biblical stories it uses. If you are going to read it, I would recommend reading the scriptures that tell these stories before hand so you can see all of the embellishments the author added for what they are."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I cannot fault the writer on her unusual approach to the tale of Jacob's wives and the story of Dinah. However, the story seemed to be an unveiled advertisement for the Wicca religion instead of supporting the historical approach given in the Bible. By the time Dinah began her menses cycle and I labored through the graphic earthy account of thier pagan ritual my stomach was queasy. As a Christian I was offended that the &quot;bad&quot; guys were the men that opposed the pagantry. I would not recommend this book to anyone and am sorry I spent the money for my copy."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"this is a boring , drawn out, wrongly imaginative book. didn't capture my attention, overhyped and not that well written. why is it doing so well? i'm confused. as a woman who usually loves women's fiction, and as a christian who loves reading about christian fiction, i can say this book is not a good combination! read it if you want a book that helps you sleep."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"The Red Tent had great potential. The Bible contains many stories that when fleshed out could make wonderful novels, and Anita Diamant seems to have done quite a bit of research into the time period. But, she ultimately failed to enthrall me. I think the problem for me seems to have been that Anita Diamant has never met a righteous man or woman, and seems unable to imagine one. True, every human has weaknesses, but Ms. Diamant seems to think that all people have the weaknesses (and to the degree) that she portrays. This book is disappointing to those who expect prophets of God and their wives to act differently---to have at least some knowledge of God's commands and to be striving to be better or come closer to God."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This was an interesting book because I usually don't touch religous books at all, but it was different, hard to get through at the end however."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I found this to be a wonderful story concerning relationships between women as well as mother/daughter relationships. Wisdom was passed down naturally as they worked."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Take away the historical background and what have you got? A cheesy &quot;chick&quot; novel, not particularly well written. But at least the biblical connection -- gimmicky as it is -- gives the story a more interesting dimension."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This book was good. That is about as descriptive as I can get, considering I got an overload of adjectives in the book. Although, I have to say that from reading this book, you can definitely get a feel for the life of a woman during that time period. It was very informative. But there were too many names and it was a slow read."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I would love for all my female friends to read this book, I could not put it down. I almost started from the beginning after I was done!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"No man should really consider reading this book."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I was very excited purchasing this book, and could not wait to start it. Unfortunately, I found it a slow-ish read. Just never got to any point where I could envision myself there, nor relate to the central (or any) character or surroundings."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I've read many of the other reviews and although I can't comment on the accuracy of the story or characters, I can comment to say that this is a very boring book. My mother said she loved it. I was excited to see that the book was about Jacob and his sons since I love the story of Joseph. But nothing much happens in this book until about page 206 of 336 pages. And even then, it's not all that exciting and not a lot comes of it. The book seems to be about women getting pregnant, not getting pregnant and having babies. What's the hype about? Skip this one."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I wanted to read this book when I found it on favorite books lists of those who I have a lot in common. I was shocked in the first chapter how \\"off base\\" the author is. I understand that this is a work of fiction. But I take offense when the basis for the fictional story is the Bible and the fictional story is so vulgar. I understand that the people mentioned in the Bible did not lead perfect lives. Please do not make a mockery of the sacredness of the Bible. If you wnat to read some quality Biblical fiction check out Francine Rivers' books on Tamar, Ruth, etc."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I found this book to be completely enchanting. The story unfolds like a rich tapestry held together with the love and tears of a family from the bible. The story is told from the perspective of Dinah, Jacob and Leah's son. I thoroughly enjoyed the tale of her life and how life was for women. Anita Diamant creates a vivid picture that has lingered in my mind.This was an excellent read and I have recommended it to many of my friends."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"The Red Tent shares a genre with The Wide Sargasso Sea and Mary Reilly, in that its author, Anita Diamant, has taken characters and stories from other books, in this case the book of Genesis, and fleshed out a story from a woman's unique perspective. I love reading history, mystery, and about mysticism. This book fascinated me to the extent that I considered calling in sick to work in order to finish it. The writing is very seductive. I treasure the author's skill in weaving relationships between Dinah and her birth mother, Leah, and her other mothers -- her mother's sisters. As a person of Christian faith, I enjoyed a &quot;what might have been&quot; fleshing out of Biblical characters. And I hold dear the concept of The Red Tent, the place where women gather on a monthly basis to share their creative and sustaining powers."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I purchased this book for my mother for Mother's Day, as it is a great tribute to mothers and the daughters who honor them throughout their lives. While it may rub students of the Old Testiment the wrong way, it gives an interesting look at what life in the time of Jacob and his sons might have been like for the women rarely mentioned. It definitely made me pick up my Bible and review the book of Genesis again!The story of the life of Dinah - Jacob's only daughter - as told by her, opens up many mysteries of the life of women in biblical times. Living in a life ruled by men, Ms. Diamont ably allows us to look into the separate, but equally diverse, lives lead by the women who served their men well; and makes us realize they exerted their own strengths in society.Dinah accepts the role the world offers her and finds joy and tragedy within it. Contemporary ideals are not introduced, which makes the story ring of realism for its setting.My wish is that my mother sees my choice in gifts as the tribute to all she has given me, and the sacrifices that entails, that I mean it to be."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"First off, I&#8217;m a guy, and yes, I read &#8220;The Red Tent&#8221;. I still love beer, carburetors, red meat, The O&#8217;Reilly Factor, and football but, I also thoroughly enjoyed this book. Anita Diamant has managed to craft a historical novel from a feminine perspective that is very readable to both sexes and still is quite engrossing. The book follows the general format Michael Shaara used in &#8220;The Killer Angels&#8221; by adding unrecorded dialogue to actual events and persons to tell a more complete, albeit partially fiction, story of the Civil War Battle of Gettysburg. Diamant, however, takes more storyline liberties the way Oliver Stone did with Kennedy assassination in his movie &#8220;JFK&#8221;. If you are not familiar with the Bible or do not consider it to be authoritative, then her take on the life of the patriarch Jacob&#8217;s daughter Dinah will cause no problems for you. That&#8217;s not at all to say that her ideas are not plausible. The Genesis accounts in the Bible of Dinah are not very detailed so, there is plenty of room for poetic license. Hardcore adherants to The Law or Christian conservatives will likely throw fits at several points, particularly Diamant&#8217;s take on the patriarchs. More than a tinge of modern feminism clearly permeates the book as most all male authority figures are made out to be blustering fools ... I give this book four stars, however, because I am NOT rating it based on ideology. It is definitely a fun read and promotes thought. There are no real fancy words or beautifully crafted sentences ... The masses, however, love it apparently as my paperback was from the 19th printing! There were plenty of times where I found myself unable to put the book down.The bottom line: Pick this book up (particularly now that it is out in paperback) if you are looking for a competent quick read...."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"[A note to Bible believing people:This is not a biblical novel! Although based on characters created by the Bible, those who seek anything other than a deeper appreciation of life in Patriarchal Times (as opposed to patriarchal times--in which we still live), will be disappointed if not outraged. If you cannot set aside (at least long enough to enjoy this book) your knowledge of how the stories surrounding Jacob's family &quot;really&quot; happened, do not pick this book up, it will frustrate you.]This poignant tale of community built and then unraveled, showcases solid research about life in the ancient near east. Although characters originate in the Bible, their behaviors are frequently explained far differently than in the corresponding Biblical stories. My recurrent response was &quot;that's not how I thought it happened, but it's not an impossible explanation.&quot;This didn't distract for long, however. Diamante writes to connect with the heart, not just boggle the mind. We become entranced, sucked into the community of Laban's daughters. We find their experiences awakening our own longings to connect. As the novel progresses, we feel the torn fabric of our own community in Dinah's tragedy and isolation.Listen, guys, you who always complain that women cannot be understood--read this book! If you don't get it, read it again. And again. Reflect on the men in this book. Reflect on how their lives impacted the women around them. CONSIDER YOUR LIFE IN THIS LIGHT. Or, continue grousing over your lite beer. Keep on complaining about women to your buddies at the sports bar. Perhaps that =IS= more satisfying, after all.Five stars for a great story. Five stars for handling &quot;historical&quot; material fairly &amp; with novelty. Five stars for research (I've read a bit on the ancient near east &amp; this this novel doesn't contradict any of it). Five stars for writing with a heart.(If you'd like to dialogue about this review, please click on the &quot;about me&quot; link above &amp; drop me an email. Thanks!)"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I'm puzzled by those who find fault with the book because it contradicts &quot;historical fact&quot;. Surely anyone who has heard two people relate entirely different versions of a recent event must understand that tales from several thousand years ago cannot be taken literally. Then again, people send money to Pat Robertson, so perhaps I shouldn't be puzzled. To predicate one's enjoyment of this work on how well the story fits with biblical accounts is to view this novel too narrowly. The fundamentalist faction in these reviews is as geeky as the nerds who can't enjoy Star Trek novels unless they get a plausible explanation of how the transporter would handle a person sneezing. Relax. Enjoy a finely crafted work of fiction.In any event, whether one believes in the Bible as a literary-historical document or as a divinely inspired revelation, the author has found a flawless narrative voice to relate the events surrounding Jacob and his four wives. Indeed, she handles even issues of the female protagonist's unusual access to events so skillfully that one never questions her veracity.The novel works on many levels. Not only is it a great story, but it made me think about the past (and my connection to those who came before me and those who will come after) in a new way. It also made me appreciate with more immediacy the tragic loss of women's voices in our historical documents. Is anyone else tired of history as a list of wars and powerful figures? Here is a new way of seeing the world, and no one could argue that this woman's life was boring or trivial. The author is insightful about family relationships, articulating the deepest feelings of children and parents, lovers and friends, as her protagonist grows from a child in the camp of Laban to a midwife in Egypt.I look forward to reading this book again, as I know I will, and sharing it with others."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This excellent historical novel was recently donated to our church library, and as librarian, I read it. This novel tells the story of Jacob's clan in the Old Testament or Torah, from the viewpoint of Dinah, his daughter. The story tells about what women's lives were like then, and their work in the clan, from food gathering, preparation and storage, weaving and spinning, time spent in the red tent to coincide with the lunar calendar, girls' coming of age, and child birth experiences, along with the training and practice of ancient midwifery.the Bible gives the bare bones of this story, and the novel extends it. It contrasts the life of the nomads like Jacob's clan with the lush life of the Egyptians by the Nile, to life in the Valley of the Kings amongst the craftspeople who worked on the pharaohs' tombs. I recommend this book especially for women, who want to know what life might have been like for women during the Old Testament in the pre-Judaism period. The wording and vernacular make you feel you are truly back in that time. Women of all faiths will enjoy this book, and so would men. However, the book is strictly from a female point of view to the point that the male characters are rather mysterious, sometimes loving, but sometimes chauvinistic and uncaring about the women's feelings; they order the women about, one woman in paticular is regularly beaten and abused, and women are seen strictly as servants of the men. Within this life style, some of the women have power within the tribe, especially in ruling the lesser women like the servants and concubines, and in female matters. I found it very interesting and certainly widened my view of what life was like for women back then."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This is Diament's first foray into fiction, and dear God let it not be her last. The story of Dinah, sole daughter of Jacob (of the Ladder fame) and sister of Joseph (of the colored coat), has until now been told only by a few cryptic lines in the Old Testament. Diament has taken these lines and turned the story of Joseph's colored coat upside down. Never again are you going to listen to Donny Osmond sing about his Technicolored Dreamcoat again and not snicker. A true woman-power type of book, this story chronicles Dinah's childhood, her first love and how he was brutally murdered by her brothers, how she cursed her family, and how she came to Egypt. The ending, while not entirely satisfactory, for some reason has an incredibly right ring to it. At the end of the novel, and knowing what happened to the Jews in Egypt, you are left wondering how much of Dinah's curse still resonates today. You are also left knowing Dinah's grief so well that if you had been she, you would have likely made the curse a thousand times stronger. Please, Anita, write another story like this! Make the Bible's women come alive again!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Our book club picked this book, I don't usually read this sort of heavily, woman oriented book but I couldn't believe how beautiful it was. Definetly for women in their child-bearing/ rearing years. I wouldn't have identified and understood this the same way a few years ago. I will look forward to reading it again."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"My family doctor, a female, insisted that I read this. I am so glad she did--I had looked at the book several times at the bookstore but it sounded rather boring. It was not only NOT boring, I was sorry when the book was finished. I hope to read more from this author. She interwove factual information about the time period with compelling characters that I came to care deeply about. One of the best books that I have ever read."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Taken on it's own as complete fiction it is a readable, enjoyable story about several generations of women told by one of them - Dinah. Personally I think she should have left the Biblical characters out of it since she took hardly a single fact from the Bible but their names. The story seems like a not very subtle attempt at denigrating men and the Judeo-Christian God in favor of the new age &quot;goddess&quot; mentality. If you read this book, do yourself the favor of not confusing it with anything written in the Bible."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I fully expected to love this book, to be swept away by it. The stories of the women of the ancient patriarchs of God are compelling for many reasons, not the least of which is because the Old Testament and Torah accounts are so sketchy. Nonetheless, Tent never captured my heart or transported me the way a really good book can. Just when it would start to lift me into the world of Dinah, I would be jarred by a detailed account of some superfluous vulgarity--usually by a male character--such as Jacob's wet dreams, masturbation, bestiality, the piercing of Dinah's hyman (by her mothers in pagan ritual), murder, battery, suicide, etc. Diamant suggests, via Dinah, that if the women had written the Bible it might have read like this, i.e. The Red Tent. If that had been the case, Jackie Collins and Jacqueline Susann would have failed to make any stir whatsoever in their day, as they would have been scooped by the Valley of the Canaanite Dolls' graphic records of old. Though I must give credit to Diamant for a book well written and researched. However, I take issue with her graphic details of a life we can only imagine, her assumption that these women knew nothing of the God of their husbands, and her liberal use of &quot;literary license&quot; to assinate the characters of our ancient prophets and their wives. Will I ever be able to erase the image of Rebecca as a vain, painted-up &quot;oracle&quot; (psychic/healer), who has nothing but contempt for others, including her disaffect, doting husband?"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Although I enjoyed the historical context of this novel, I was dismayed that much more attention was paid to the worshipping of false gods and very little to the worship and direction of God Himself. This makes the book read contrarily to the story in the Bible."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This is a good book. It's a little graphic in places for my taste. The thing that bothered me the most is that it twists the facts given in the Bible in a negative way. It makes Jacob and Joseph far less admirable. There's no evidence of Christianity in the book, which I had hoped for. The author is Jewish? Other than that it was a great story. A far stretch from the story the Bible tells."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This book made me want to have a baby... right here, right now and right outside. Seriously though, this was a beautiful emotional read. I'd have to put it in my top 3 favorite books of all time."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"What a story! I couldn't put the book down. First it was about the mothers, then the true store of Dinah. I felt that at every turn of the page some drastic, dramatic and life altering event was going to happen next. I will be recommending this book to ALL! Thank you Anita!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I was assigned to read this for an Old Testament class. This book was so boring that I literally started to cry because I didn't want to read another page. There is no plot! Just ramblings that go on and on and on. I'm not religious so I don't care if it's \\"right\\" I was just completely blown away because it literally bored me to tears."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I bought The Red Tent from a Friends of the Library booksale in my town for a buck. I mainly bought it because I kept hearing people say how great it was. Normally, I avoid religious books like the plague because I basically don't want to preached to. My stepfather was a Jehovah's Witness so I had that religion pounded in me at a young age and only escaped that oppressive environment after he and my mom divorced. So needless to say, religion and I don't mix. However, I will read a book if it seems interesting and if it's highly recommended. The Red Tent seemed to fit the bill. I am happy to say that I don't regret reading it one bit. It was an amazing story.The Red Tent was one of those books that just embraces women and their uniqueness. It's a book that celebrates women and I just found that incredible. I wasn't prepared for the feelings that would arise in context to this book. It was engrossing and it kept my interest throughout with no lagging parts. The characters were extremely compelling and I was in awe of Dinah's mothers just as she was. I cried, when Dinah cried and laughed when she laughed. The Red Tent just keeps you in the story and makes you care for all of the women in the tent.Like I mentioned before, I'm not particularly religious, so I don't know how accurate this was to biblical times or whatever. I just took it as it was: a novel. So, while the portrayal of Jacob and his sons might bother some who feel that it was inaccurate, it didn't bother me. Anyway, The Red Tent was a beautiful book with beautiful characters. Since I didn't expect to enjoy it that much, it made the book that much more enjoyable for me. It's definitely one of the best books I've ever read."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I'm one of a minority here but I failed to get past 1/4 of the way through the book. I really wanted to like it but it lacked enough emotion for me to continue on. I felt the writing was poor and dis-jointed. Like another reviewer said, it was every other sentence of \\"so and so begat so and so\\" as well as birth and after birth with very little emotion. The Red Tent had a great deal of promise but sadly failed to pull me in enough to keep going."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Although the book was an interesting read, it was very disappointing. It was not a biblical account and missed every opportunity to reflect on the positive in the people who were the beginnings of the Jewish/Christian faith. I will agree that there is a lot of scandalous and negative behavior in the early historical accounts of the bible, but this book made every attempt to dramatize and scandelize while omittimg anything edifying. There was no respect given to the God of Abraham and that I have to say was the most disappointing part. There are way better books that are interesting to read, give an accurate historical background, AND hold true to the integrity of the Word of God."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"It would appear that any book about interesting and perhaps unusual women generates much controversy among its readership (&quot;Bitter Grounds&quot; and &quot;The Poisonwood Bible&quot; come to mind). This book is no different. The Red Tent is loosely based on the Biblical story of Dinah, but it is a novel, not fact, even though it may be based in fact. Diamant even takes liberties with the Dinah story as it appears in Genesis in the Bible. However, it does appear to be thoroughly researched -- I found myself equally fascinated by descriptions of life during Biblical times as by the lives of the characters in the book. Unlike some of the other reviewers I didn't find this book to be anti-male. I and many women I know lead very different lives from our men and we too see them in a completely different light than they see themselves. We often laugh at them or paint them in an unflattering light, despite the fact that we love them. We are not, however, anti-male, just human and female. I suspect men amongst themselves discuss women in much the same way. I personally found this book full of thoughts and ideas that touched me deeply, especially since I am 40 years old, have had several children and have lived in foreign countries. Perhaps much younger people would have trouble identifiying some of the &quot;human condition&quot; scenarios in the book -- I don't know. Regardless, I have wholeheartedly recommended this book to several people and recommend it to you."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This is, by far, one of the best books I have read in a long time, leaving me sorry that it was over. The writing is beautiful in its depiction of life, from the women's point of view, about 4000 years ago. It was so incredibly moving that I found myself in tears at several times -- something that does not happen often!This tale is a possible story of the life of Jacob's daughter, Dinah, who barely is mentioned in the Old Testament. It starts with a recounting of Jacob's marriages to Dinah's mother, and her mother's three sisters, the births of the resulting children, and Dinah's youth, learning at her &quot;mothers'&quot; sides. It continues with Jacob's departure with his family and flocks from the lands of his father-in-law, and follows Dinah through her death. I don't want to say any more, because it would ruin the story.The author does not suggest that this is the &quot;real&quot; story, or a &quot;supplement&quot; to the Bible. It is not a religious book, per se, but does discuss the God of Jacob's father and, in contrast, the multitude of gods worshipped by other cultures of the time. The story is meant to provide a possible tale of an otherwise minor character, and affords a glimpse into the women's world of that time, not usually covered in the Bible.I cannot recommend this book more highly."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"First of all let me say that I absolutely loved The Red Tent. It's based on a character, Dinah, who is mentioned in passing in the old testament. Diamant has created a wonderful story about the women of biblical times, our fore-mothers Rebecca, Sarah, Rachel, and Leah, from Dinah's point of view.You do not have to be familiar with the bible to enjoy this novel, although if you are, you'll certainly recognize stories and characters. It's about the strength of women, their roles in a male dominated religious society, and their all important relationships.Although I was eager to read this book, I didn't expect it to have such an impact on me, nor did I expect to love it as much as I did. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I would like to take a moment to address some of the complaints made in the May 19th review. I did not experience THE RED TENT as male bashing. It's intent was to take a female view of the major women of the Old Testament and to breathe life into them. It is &quot;over endowed&quot; with a female viewpoint as a counterbalance to the bible's male view. Women in the BIBLE were often hardly more than property, so it is not too surprising that a fictionalized female character from this period might see men somewhat differently then we do. The BIBLE does portray Laban as a pretty disagreeable character, but in this book Jacob is portrayed as a tragic figure, not a negative figure. He is not the cause of the terrible massacre, but assumes the guilt of his tribe. Until then he is a respected male figure in the book. The women have their weak points as well. Rachel is vain, and the grandmother, Rebecca is a formidable figure of both arrogance and power. Isaac's trauma as a child, being nearly slaughtered by his own father, was treated with compassion. Diamant has Dinah speak of this trauma and how it left Isaac with a stutter for the rest of his life. Some of the women are weak in a way that makes them disagreeable. The carpenter husband of Dinah, Benia, is a truly admirable and loveable male figure and her young husband, the prince Shalem, slaughtered at the hands of her brothers, is as gentle and romantic a young man as you could want.As to the continual reference to pregnancies and childbirth, I believe this had a deliberate intent. During biblical times, childbearing is what gave women power. It is natural to assume that women of that period would indeed be obssessed with their own ability to bring children into the world - especially women of strength who would be able determine ways to use that ability to some advantage. The very nature of the Red Tent, was that it bonded women in a way that as a group gave them more leverage. Their &quot;mysterious&quot; ways were kept from the men who were somewhat fearful of their rituals and knowledge of childbearing. This was a woman's main source of power in a life that was in many ways powerless. Being a mid wife was as close to a career as a woman could have and it commanded respect from everyone. You have to remember that men and women did lead very separare lives at that time. Another source of power, still &quot;mysterious&quot; to men, was the role of a priestess and ordainer. Rebecca had this role down to a science in order to insure her place of distinction in the ancient world. I present these ideas as a difference of opinion to the previous reviewer, who is of course entitled to her opinion. I had my book group meeting last night and our book of discussion was THE RED TENT, so these themes were very much on my mind and I felt compelled to respond."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"First of all, I am very disappointed that Amazon posted reviews that spoil the ending of the book. The great mystery this book purports to answer is what happened to Dinah after her rape. Did she ever find love and/or happiness, and if so how? Some of the reviews here give away those plot points, and diminished my enjoyment of the novel.Second, comparisons to &quot;Mists of Avalon&quot; are very apt. This is a retelling of a classic story from a woman's point of view. However, unlike &quot;Mists&quot; or &quot;Firebrand&quot; the story being retold is central to major world religions. Readers have a lot more invested in the portrayal of Biblical characters than in Arthurian Britain or ancient Troy.BE FOREWARNED. These are not the matriarchs you grew up with. They do not worship the G-d of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. In the Bible, Rachel &amp; Leah's father worshipped idols, and the women in &quot;The Red Tent&quot; never convert to Jacob's faith. IF THIS DISTURBS YOU, YOU MAY WANT TO SKIP THIS BOOK. I think that's where many of the negative reviews are coming from. Compare Mists of Avalon with Sword &amp; the Stone and earlier Arthurian stories -- this is just as radical a revision. If you're not prepared for that, stay away. Frankly, I'm still a bit bothered by the concept of non-Jewish matriarchs. But the fact that I'm still mulling over my reactions a week after I finished shows how powerful the book is.The book presents a rich portrayal of the historical period. Diamant did a lot of research into daily life and paints a very vivid world. Frankly, I find Dinah a less interesting character than the matriarchs -- Rebecca, Rachel, and Leah. While Dinah is supposedly the focus, she was a minor character originally, so there's not much background. However, we already have a wealth of stories about the matriarchs, so those stories become all the more fascinating when compared to that background. [The motives behind the Leah/Rachel switch at Jacob's wedding, for example.]It's a very good book. I won't say it's a great book, because I am still disturbed by parts, but it's definitely a powerful story."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"In spite of four wives and numerous sons, Jacob's only daughter is Dinah, revered and even spoiled by four mothers. The heritage of the Jews is told through the female. Thus, it is Dinah's lot to pass on the stories of her mothers and grandmothers for the next generation to revere.Dinah begins the tales of her four mothers with the appearance of Jacob in the land of Laban. Over the years, Jacob marries Rachel, Leah, Zilpah, and Bilhah. Mostly, in the &quot;red tent&quot; where the women go to have their female cycles, Dinah learns what is expected of a Jewish woman. She explains their trip to Canaan, the strange meeting between Jacob and his estrange brother Esau, and her own rite of passage into Jewish womanhood. Finally, Dinah falls in love, but that leads to tragedy for her and a need to escape from her family.THE RED TENT is a fabulous biblical fiction novel that provides a full life to a footnote character in the Old Testament. Purists will take exception to Anita Diamant's liberties with other persona such as Joseph and Leah (even if her description makes them seem more real and complete). However, that aside, strict believers need simply pass on this fictional account that provides an intriguing look at the role of the Ancient Jewish woman. Anyone who enjoyed the QUEENMAKER by India Edghill will fully relish Ms. Diamont's loose, but seemingly feasible, intelligent and entertaining interpretation of the role of a minor biblical player.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"The Red Tent by Anita Diamant is an engrossing, well-researched story with compelling and believable characters. It is especially gratifying to find a sympathetic, detailed, and believable account of an Old Testament woman's life set in this era and part of the world. The story is told from the point of view of Dinah, daughter of Jacob, a successful nomadic sheep-herder. She is raised by four different women, all wives of Jacob and becomes a midwife. Through an intriguing and dramatic turn of the plot, she ends up in Egypt. The book was a pleasure for even this non-religious feminist to read. The images are riveting. The characters are memorable. I wish I were a screenwriter because the Red Tent would make a wonderful movie."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"If you are one of those people who tries to take the Old Testament literally, you won't want to read this book. But if you seek to find more meaning, more human qualities to this religious classic, this is definitely the novel for you!Throughout the Bible, women are rarely mentioned (except for being the mother of this or that male character). For most women, the question arises -- what really happended in the lives of these biblical women? And I think for people everywhere -- were the lives of these people really so colorless?The Red Tent explores the lives of the wives and daughters of the Bible's Jacob. Told from the vantage point of Jacob's only daughter, Dinah (pronounced Dee-nah), this book brings the last half of the book of Genesis to life.During the first half of this novel, the author draws you into the intimate details of the lives of 5 women - Dinah, and her four mothers. (As was common in the time, Jacob has 4 wives - all the daughters of his uncle, Laban.) The women struggle through the full range of emotions for one another, from love to jealousy, and back to loyalty once more.Mid-book, the tone of the book completely changes as the events of the story tear these women's lives apart. As Dinah suffers and becomes distant to the world, so the author makes you distant to the characters. This makes the last half of the book less enjoyable than the first, but without it, the reader would never find closure and would always be asking - but what about Joseph and is Dinah ever reconciled with her family?After reading this story, my curiousity was piqued and I felt the need to refresh my memory of the Biblical version. It is interesting to note how the author took the basic details and expounded into an amazing narrative of what might have happened. The next time I pick up my NIV, I will strain to see new meaning between the lines of these age old stories. (I am also curious to know how Ms. Diamont got her ideas for this story -- this is never revealed in the book!!)"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"THE RED TENT is what all fiction should be: powerful, beautifully written, brilliantly conceived and flawlessly executed. It is a work that approaches genius. What an imagination Anita Diamant boasts! It is difficult to understand how she even came up with the concept. As her notes at the end of the work indicate, her research and her scholarship are of the highest order.This would be a particularly difficult opus for any author, to take a first-person narrative, told in hindsight and with a minimum of dialogue, and set it approximately 5700 years in the past. Yet Diamant's characters seem as fresh and real as one's next-door neighbor. Again, what an imagination!Her &quot;heroine,&quot; Dinah, was the only daughter of the biblical Jacob to have survived to adulthood. Jacob was the son of Issac, grandson of Abraham, brother of Esau, father of the Joseph of &quot;The Coat of Many Colors.&quot; Women, it is obvious, were an afterthought to the information handed down about these patriarchs and prophets. Yet THE RED TENT is Dinah's story, the story of a person who was a footnote to history, just as Rosenkrantz and Guildenstern were footnotes to HAMLET. In both cases, authors with fertile imaginations have plumbed the lives of these minor characters for their significance.In Dinah's case, Ms. Diamant reveals the truth about the story of Jacob. In Sunday school, we are taught about his being tricked into marriage with one sister, Leah, when it was the younger girl, Rachel, whom he had loved. So this book solved a mystery I had wondered about all these years, what had happened to Leah when Jacob finally married Rachel. In THE RED TENT, I finally learned that Jacob, in keeping with the custom of the times, had two wives plus two concubines. No, my teachers never mentioned that detail.Life then was very hard, another fact which is glossed over in Biblical study, but which should seem obvious when contemplated. Ms. Diamant exhibits just how difficult it was, in every way, by modern standards. There was no notion of sanitation, no medications, women frequently died in childbirth, dental care was six millennia in the future, etc. Even if a reader understood all of this before reading THE RED TENT, Ms. Diamant demonstrates these realities with heart-stopping detail.These people were so primitive that, properly, they were not Israelites; perhaps they should be known as Canaanites or Semites. Still, from them flowed monotheism, leading directly to the Jewish religion which, in turn, gave rise to both Christianity, in all its permutations, as well as Islam. Yet the reader of THE RED TENT will find it unavoidable to examine the entire meaning of religion once it is set into it this framework of the concepts which fostered it.Ms. Diamant deserves the highest commendations for THE RED TENT, on every basis: concept, execution and prose. This book is the highest category of fiction."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"There has never been a book that has touched upon the very real (but unsung) roles females undoubtedly played during the years that the bible was written. This book reads like historical fiction; it is that convincing. The narrative voice is that of Dinah, as she states plainly, a woman not well represented in the writings of the bible. She goes on to tell of her mother's life, the tales of her sister-mothers', and her much anticipated birth. The stories woven and the lives intertwined by the author Anita Diamant are mystical, loving, painful, and I dare say enlightening. This novel will happily be shared and passed on from one woman to another...as it should be."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"It has been said many times already: this is a superbly written book, every page rich with historical detail. The women's roles are championed, and rightly so. Anita Diamant apparently did her homework on ancient Canaanite religion and daily life, and the realism is refreshing. But my gushing compliments must end there.Diamant's book left me bitter and cynical about the patriarchs and their children. And not so much because she makes us face the hard, cold reality of the story (Dinah's brothers were ruthless in their slaughter of Shechem and in their treatment of Joseph; Laban's family were all idolatrers). These guys had foibles and we must face the facts. But she showed a contempt for the males in this family, choosing to make them all out to be scoundrels, or at least bagelheads.Although the &quot;spirit of El&quot; is supposed to be with Jacob, it obviously doesn't do him any good. It's not even a trick up his sleeve, much less a way for him to deal with ethical issues or to work for the spiritual betterment his family. He doesn't pray, he doesn't contemplate the spirit world, and his sacrifices seem perfunctory. He just grovels assent to his grandpa's god and otherwise turns a deaf ear to the practices of the women, who spend their days revelling in whatever paganism is in the air. Indeed, most of life's wisdom in this narrative appears to be gained by being comfortable with one's bodily cycles and knowing which sheep have the best wool.At times I felt compelled to plead with the narrator, &quot;Just consider FOR ONCE that the bare-bones account in the Torah might be a little accurate.&quot; The reviewer from Chicago (llangevi@mcs.com) is not alone in his (or her) misgivings. Ms. Diamant acknowledges her introduction to midrash, but she apparently failed to draw anything from it. Jacob's incident at the bank of the Jabbock river would have been so much more meaningful as an encounter with Esau's malakh, and Joseph's story would have provided a much-needed resolution if she had portrayed him as the tzaddik he was, and used the cruel incident to raise issues of Divine Providence.But I suppose that's hardly possible, in a world ruled by the Moon Goddess, the Queen of Heaven, and a host of terraphim."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"_The Red Tent_ is very much like another perennial women's favorite, _The Mists of Avalon_. Where _Avalon_ tells the story from the perspective of King Arthur's women, _The Red Tent_ is the story of Jacob from the women's point of view: his four wives, his mother, and most notably, Dinah, his only daughter. The women are shown as strong, capable, and indispensible to their family's success. In this version Dinah, like Morgaine of _Avalon_, is empowered... a talented midwife, not mere footnote or caricature. This is a book that celebrates womanhood."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Woke up at 5:30 am just to have more time to read! I really loved this book."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I am not Jewish. I am not Christian. Yet this author captured my undivided attention for the two days it took me to completely read. I was not familiar with the story of Dinah nor Jacob for that matter, but now I thirst for more. I never wanted to leave the lives of Jacob's wives."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I read it in two days as I was fascinated by this culture of &quot;the red tent&quot;. This story is earthy and sensual, as I'm sure it was intended to be. And it truly celebrates women as lifebearers and healers and mothers rather than workaholics who have no more ambition that getting paid the same to do a man's job. In a time where women disdain being mothers or they choose to work instead of raise their children and run their home in a healthy way, this book is an inspiring detour into the old world.The story, however much it deviates from the true Biblical account, (and I'll get to that in a minute), captivated me. The Bible uplifts women and gives them a higher place in its story that any other literature of its time, but not much is said about Dinah because her story is not the primary reason that Moses recounts the tale of Jacob and his sons.And here is where I have a little beef with Diamant. Her bio says she's written plenty of books on Judaism, but you'd never know she was Jewish by her emphasis on the absolutely pagan practices of Jacob's family in this book. On this level, Diamant's story is wholly untrue for Jacob and his sons never worshipped any God but the one true God, &quot;El&quot; as he is referred to in this novel. Jacob's wives, at least once they left Laban's care, also worshipped this God and all that stuff about sacrificing to the Queen of Heaven and what not is pure fiction. I did not mind that, at many points in the story, Diamant deviates from the Biblical account (i.e. Dinah's in Shechem or the switch LABAN pulled on Jacob when he was supposed to be marrying Rachel). Its dramatic license and she does not claim to be writing new Scripture or anything... but when it comes to their pagan practices, I was really disturbed. I don't know what my point it... I just wish, on this point, she had stuck with the true story. Its ironic because I enjoyed the first section of this book most of all and that was the most pagan! I just threw off the fact that Diamant was retelling a Bible story and pretended it was entirely fiction.In short, I highly recommend this book to every woman, especially if anyone feels the need to feel uplifted in her femininity. Feminists need to read this book- hopefully they will come to realize that there is equal value in being a housewife and a mother than there is in being a CEO or a lawyer (and having the homelife be the center of your life)- you might not get paid, but the spiritual significance, the absolutely vital importance of these roles in the life of the world cannot be matched by any job. I believe this may be what Diamant is saying, in the end. This is what I got out of it, at least."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I'm the only person I know who didn't love this book. Even people who I knew would hate it were charmed. I wish I knew why, because I suspect it might be a flaw in my own character that keeps me from fully enjoying this book.Maybe it has something to do with the fact that I read Genesis for the first time only a few years ago and I had unfair expectations. I thought &quot;Gee, the story of Jacob would sure make a great novel.&quot; Imagine my joy when I found that someone had done just that. So, what it was like to wake up the day after your wedding and find that you married the wrong woman? Did Leah seeth with envy as she watch her sister led her people at their husband's side? How was Dinah looked upon by her tribe after she was rescued by her brothers? You won't find out here, because in the Red Tent, it never really happened that way. In fact very little happened exactly as it was set down in the Bible. The women aren't even followers of Jacob's faith, which must have been horrible PR for his career as God's chosen.The writing was beautiful, but the story seemed a little too close to the movie &quot;Titanic&quot; which I didn't particularly enjoy either. Maybe I just don't like getting in touch with my feminine side. (I'm a woman, by the way.) If I had trouble putting the book down it was because I felt more like an archiologist looking for bits of mangled history than a spellbound reader.Still, I attribute all my critisms to my uncultured tastes and not to Ms. Diamant's sparkling writing. I just happen to prefer the epics of Rutherford and Jennings to this lovely opus."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This book was good as a &quot;story&quot;, however, read it with the understanding that is it a story told from the perspective that Dinah and none of the women in Jacob's life believed in God and only God. Don't read it thinking it will give you insight on the Bible. It will not."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Besides the fact that this is an incredibly beautiful, inspiring & well-written work of fiction, I'm also willing to bet Ms. Diamant fully researched it to be as historically and anthropologically accurate as possible. As for \\"Biblical accuracy,\\" meaning fitting some people's extreme interpretation of a very broadly-sketched story in a depressingly over-valued work of dubious origin, please."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Carefully bringing the little known Biblical character of Dinah into a fictional novel, Anita Diamant has written a wonderfully convincing historical novel - The Red Tent. As the only daughter of Jacob, Dinah is surrounded by four mothers, Leah, Rachel, Zilpah, and Bilhah, all wives of Jacob, as she grows up among a community of women in Mesopotamia. Diamant artfully describes the culture of separated genders: the women exist to keep their men prosperous; the men work to provide for the community. These men appear to the women, however, as distant, mysterious characters. While our culture would see this kind of lifestyle as difficult and oppressive, Diamant describes their way of living as a vibrant culture of women, who are made complete by the sisterhood of the \\"red tent.\\" They cherish everything that composes their feminine nature, relishing their monthly cycle as a celebration of strength and friendship. Images of Dinah's simple childhood - cooking, baking, weaving, storytelling and midwifery - are conveyed with vivid color. The ensuing tragedy of Dinah's \\"rape\\" and Jacob's tribe's reaction is filled with pain and remorse with which the reader easily empathizes.Diamant portrays a believable culture of the Old Testament era, but one must remember that the book is a work of fiction, structured by a framework of Biblical characters and events. Portions of the novel are shocking, including many descriptive accounts of giving birth. Let the reader be warned, Diamant also portrays the women in the novel as pagans, worshipping household spirits and gods, not as believers in the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. Unfortunately, the fantastic character development of the first half of the book was not duplicated in the second half as Dinah goes off to Egypt to begin a new life. Furthermore, the novel's tempo drastically speeds in the second half, as it becomes more of a chronicle of her life, lacking the rich detail portrayed in the first half.The novel left a deep impression on me with its vibrant stories, fascinating descriptions, and deep emotional passages describing life in the Biblical era. While reading I became fascinated with the high value that women gave to their place in society -- that they made life possible through the blessing of childbirth. It was inspirational to experience a culture where women were fulfilled by having children, a concept not frequently honored in our culture. The book also presents a refreshing look at female closeness to a culture where girl bonding often consists of shopping and devouring ice cream."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This isn't a badly written book, but it isn't very satisfying, either. The story is very grim (if I'd remembered this part of the Old Testament I would probably not have been that interested in reading this novel), and because the author has chosen to span Dinah's entire lifetime, it ends up feeling rather episodic, with several long expanses of time summarized very briefly. The characterization is fairly well done, but Dinah's two love affairs aren't very believable. Both men are absolutely perfect in every way, and when she first meets them, there is no awkwardness as they're getting to know each other -- in fact, in both cases, there's no dialogue at all. They walk together in perfect companionship, without the need to speak to each other, and go straight to bed to make perfect love. I could have ignored this if it happened only once, but because it happens twice, it feels like the author didn't want to do the hard work of showing the beginning of these relationships in a believable way."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I must preface this by saying that I am not religious - but I loved this book. I really enjoyed the story it was telling. To me this is more a story about where we come from as women, rather than some religious/biblical treatise. Reading this book you can really feel a connection with the character Dinah and the writer brings to life her world with colorful vividness. This book has an almost feminist feeling and to my great amusement paints Jacob as a villainous man who personifies most of the worst qualities one can have. This story sucked me in and I read it practically in one sitting. It was one of the best books I have read in a while."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"The Red Tent is the story of the women of the bible. It is a beautifully crafted story of our mothers past. The story centres around the biblical character, Dinah, the only daughter of Jacob. Through the eyes of Dinah and her mothers, the reader is captivated by the stories of the time. The reader will become so engrossed in the novel that they will participate in the celebrations, hardships, births, and deaths.The Red Tent is a glorious place of rest, love, nuturing, teaching and learning. The Red Tent is a traditional place where women are excused from their many tasks to celebrate the new moon together. The Red Tent is a sacred place filled with mystery and intrigue.The Red Tent is a fablous read, and should be read by every woman. This book would be an excellent, thought provoking choice for a book club. I would highly recommend this novel!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"As one who has studied Bible from both Jewish and Christian perspectives for many years, I can quite calmly and quietly assure the author's critics that she has indeed done a superb job reading, interpreting, and extrapolating the Bible to create this marvelous novel. Those crucial points of change in any culture and especially in this one, both so familiar and so wondrously strange to 21st century readers, and particularly the gradual move from matriachy to patriachy are endless fascinating. Ms. Diamant paints very humanely her ancient women and men and her conjecture as to what may have actually happened to Dinah and her family are likely close to the mark. The shared intimacy and consorority of these women is awesome and something we so lack today. Oh, the numerous scenes involving human sexuality are hot and raw, but never obscene. Please more and soon, Ms. Diamant. Truly a virtuoso effort!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Most of what I read is nonfiction -- it isn't often I find a novel that holds my interest, let alone one that I don't want to put down. But this story, pulled from the Old Testament's Genesis (the one with the seemingly endless list of begats) was fascinating.Another reviewer here bemoaned the neglect of any mention of \\"God\\" -- in truth, God is woven into the fabric of this story (often spoken of as EL) without a bit of proselytizing. This story personalizes half the book of Genesis (25 - 50), making it vibrant, rich and fascinating to believers and non-believers alike. Although religion is a central part of the lives of the men and women we meet, the entire story takes place in a time when most are just beginning to consider giving up their beliefs in a multitude of gods and goddesses for the one God of Jacob's father.Written in the first person, it gives voice to the lives of women, so neglected in the Old Testament. The story leads us through Dinah's life from before it begins to after it ends. She tells us the stories her mother and aunts (the most well-known being Rachel and Leah) told each other and her as she grew up.As the only daughter in a family of 12 sons, Dinah has privileges most girls don't have. She is allowed into the Red Tent, the only place men do not go, and where the women go during their menses or when birthing. She also shares the daily life and rituals of her tribe, with special attention to the lives of the women. Childhood, adolescence, menstruation, weddings, worship of gods and goddesses, married life, childbirth, mothering, cooking, homelife, friendship, and death are all part of Dinah's life, along with passion and drama. Dinah becomes a skilled midwife, and is highly valued wherever she goes....Anita Diamant is a wonderful writer, historian and storyteller. Her Dinah invites the reader into the story in such a friendly, familiar way that you will find yourself eager to hear more of her tales, and reluctant to let them end. This is one of those rare books that you may find yourself reading again and again."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Dinah explains from the first chapter that if you want to know about a woman you must ask her about her mother, then wait and listen attentively. Since she had four mothers: Leah, Rachel, Zilpah and Bilhah--the wives of Jacob (Israel) she builds us up for a thick and complex story. Hebraic devices like the \\"selah\\" and touchstones of narrative lifted from Genesis point to the original scaffolding: an ancient, revered document: The Torah.Anita Diamant claims this story of Dinah is \\"midrash\\", or a search and investigation into the life of Jacob's only daughter. The story promises psychological depth and hereto undeveloped perspective as we follow how women participated in the beginning of the Hebrews.The book's title is a fictional device--the red tent becoming the temporary dwelling of all women in their time of bleeding, illness or other womanly moments (birth, nursing). The red tent is a makeshift community forced by the \\"uncleanness\\" of the flowing blood. It was this idea that attracted me, women sharing life together.The many wives of Israel (a.k.a. Jacob) chuckle and wink about being excluded, we learn that they are far from ostracized or unclean in their red tent. It's really a fantastic excuse to get away from men's life, to be free from: the demands of the lascivious Jacob, their grandfather Laban who is raunchy, debauched and violent so that they might bear children, gossip and nurse babies uninterrupted. Women of Israel unite! From them we experience the Genesis account of Jacob's wooing of his wives from an entirely different angle.Diamant changes the story and in a Reading Group Guide at the end explains that she always felt bothered at the traditional story which assumes Rachel's beauty and Leah's ugliness. Diamant repairs these details by changing the story, contending much more than illuminating the Genesis account.Leah, for instance, has no weak eyes, quite the contrary; her eyes were different colors, one blue and one brown. Dinah says she makes other people weak because of them. Leah combines her striking, unusual looks with a tall, full-figure, all the wit, intelligence, business-savvy, management skills that a woman could dare to own, and adds a sexy, long-limbed, flexible and adventurous femininity in bed. We wonder why Jacob wouldn't woo her first.Rachel, while beautiful, is unripe, frigid and much too young to be married. At the instigation of Zilpah, who, like Diamant, never liked beautiful Rachel much anyways, Rachel refuses to meet Jacob on the wedding day. Zilpah who begins to sound too much like Diamant's puppet, scares Rachel off with stories of women's pain in childbearing and how huge Jacob's phallus must be. At the wedding Jacob receives Leah willingly, he's actually glad to be able to spend his lust on her--so much for Jacob's enduring, hard-won love for Rachel. Diamant writes that the story we know from Genesis is supposedly recreated by Leah and Jacob to protect Rachel from feeling ousted.Reuben, the oldest son of Leah, loves his step-mother, Bilhah, and she him. This is to explain why Reuben finally gives in to his attraction, bedding her to mutual (as Diamant \\"midrashes\\") satisfaction. Jacob transmogrifies into the stingy, jealous husband intent on keeping them apart, later robbing Reuben of his blessing and of course sexual pleasure in his step-mother. Diamant suggests that incest is permissible, given mutual love and blames Jacob for disinheriting Reuben of the full blessing as first born.She finishes off Israel's reputation by demoting his final prophesy and blessing into the mad ranting of a crazed old man.Dinah isn't raped, as Genesis explains. She's in love and gives herself willingly, fully in four days drinking her fill of this glorious, Abercrombie-looking Prince of Shechem. Her brother's envy and violence create the demand for mass circumcisions and open an opportunity for annihilation of Shechem men. Dinah, true to the Genesis story, is left widowed.Joseph is bi-sexual, or perhaps gay, having been both Potiphar and Potiphar's wife's lover--the real cause of his imprisonment. Even as he travels to reap his feeble--and deranged--father's blessing Joseph's eyes wander longingly to the lithe, thin servant boys.By the end of Dinah's tale, we start to wonder if there are any good men left (and there are some, the story finds them, digging them out of the woodwork). Diamant's heroes are never the ones that YHWH chose in the Genesis story. Few men meet Diamant, and therefore Dinah's, approval.Diamant seems to be going beyond \\"midrash\\", she refutes and undercuts key character traits around which the old story pivots: Joseph's virtue, Dinah's rape, Leah's rejection, Rachel and Jacob's mutual love, Israel's blessing. Genesis already seems to offer enough jealousy, rape, sex and violence without besmirching the small glimmers of goodness.Diamant's re-writing reaches an embarrassing frenzy as Dinah's anger finally spills. In a rage, howling for vengeance Dinah stands up against her family, the blood of her slaughtered husband drenching her clothes as she curses her entire clan. We are left to believe that it is the mighty Dinah who calls down pain and damnation on Jacob and sons. Her curse becomes the cause for Rachel's death in childbirth, Reuben's incestuous rendezvous with Bilhah, Jacob's quarreling sons, Joseph's disappearance, enslavement and the years of famine.This is a new mythological Dinah, larger than life, a goddess who can incant pain and destruction when she has been wronged. Dinah's faith is not in YHWH, in fact she clings to the gods her mother Rachel drags from place to place, to the songs to the goddess that Zilpah chants, to the strange feeling she gets when near rivers and to reverence for the strange, coming of age sexual initiations that the women in the red tent follow. The God of Israel, we are led to believe, is strictly for the men folk.Dinah's account grows increasing less interesting as Diamant departs from Genesis. The tragic bit lies on the last page when Dinah is forced to spout Buddhistic ideas, much as a modern survival incantation. She will live forever she promises, though it sounds almost like another curse on her readers. She will haunt our steps because we have listened to her story. Her memory will endure, she explains, because Dinah was loved.But I wonder at her being loved and loving so well. She's left kin and mothers, abandoned the women who offered her life and love, cursed her fathers and brothers and failed to reconcile any of her relationships, including her estranged son. Hers is the story of a woman of strength? This is the story of Dinah, a daughter of Israel?We learn from the back cover that Diamant is an award-winning journalist. She writes well, building in clarity what she lacks in accuracy. She retains every disreputable bit that discredits leading heroes of Genesis and heaps more hypocrisy for effect. She removes and often excuses the woman's behavior. It is her skill in writing that might give those who revere Genesis pause, it weaves its own mythology.The most prominent endorsement sits centered on the front cover, beneath a sensual and mourning Dinah. James Carroll writes, \\"The oldest story of all could never seem more original, or more true.\\" This is perhaps its appeal and its pain. Diamant writes more graphically and sensationally than the ancient text.In the Reading Group Guide, Diamant warns us that this book is a work of fiction and as such is a \\"radical departure from the historical text.\\" I would agree and wonder at it, too. What happens when women today grow more familiar with her fiction than the age-old story in Torah? It is possible than in attempting to give voice to the silenced female, her \\"midrash\\" has further tarnished a story that lives longer and deeper than any of today's fiction."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"[Note: This review is a rewrite because it took a few versions for me to articulate my disappointments. [3/8 found the previous versions helpful when the following revision was posted.]The many favorable reviews reflect an admiration for Ms. Diamant's skillful prose. I, too, was willing to grant high marks, but for one fundamental, fatal mistake: any story about Biblical characters, especially a biblical protagonist, becomes a biblical commentary, requiring that loftly level of biblical scholarship. Ms. Diamant's commentary on Dinah (the stuff of Midrash) presents one of the ugliest misrepresentations of the Torah (the Hebrew bible) one could imagine. I expected to enjoy a well recommended \\"modern Midrash\\" on Dinah (Dee-nah). What I read was, in the end, a mean-spirited, idolatrous, feminist (in the ugly sense of the term) rant against the patriarchs and matriarchs of the Jewish faith, using a caricature of Jacob's only daughter as a foil.Dinah, the only daughter of Jacob, has but a bit part in the Messorah (the commonly translated) text of the classic \\"Written Torah\\". But bit parts in the Torah are epical when one includes the back-story in the \\"Oral Torah.\\" I found Ms. Diamant's appalling ignorance of the Oral Torah especially sad, and what makes The Red Tent, to me, a missed opportunity.The ancient oral history of Dinah is lush with plot and protagonist possibilities, a narrative known to anyone familiar with the Talmud and Midrashim. The daughter of the less loved Leah; the daughter who was supposed to be born of the more loved Rachael; a tender eight-year old girl of apparently astonishing beauty that went out to befriend some girls to play with (perhaps tired of her brothers?). Only she is raped by a child molester-prince who had the audacity to try to buy her for a wife after the crime; an uncivilized, wicked predator neither his father-King nor the men of Shechem would impose justice upon. Such a child-rape was unheard of on the earth; hence Jacob's shock and silence. About how two of her brothers demanded justice for their violated little sister, delivering the punishment for theft according to the Laws of Noah, executing the complicit men city-wide. (Feminists should stand up an applaud this non-nonsense treatment of such abusive men!) Yet the more fascinating story, one the author threw away for who knows why, is about Dinah's daughter Asenath (not a son) who married Joseph. Of how her grandfather, Jacob, gave her a protective necklace with the Name of God on it. Of how Joseph met Asenath; a proto-Cinderella tale of divine favor and joy (Joseph could read the Name on the necklace and knew she was from the house of Jacob!). God provided Asenath a soul-mate equal to the holiness of her own soul (noting the essence of the Jew's holy soul comes from their mother (Dinah, and Leah)). The casual Bible reader knows Joseph's trials were meant for good, yet few know that God, through Asenath likewise saved Joseph, and Dinah's sad trials were turned to good in the end. This was the authentic, compelling commentary I expected. How we learn to recognize the merciful hand of God helping us in spite of the sometimes unfair, wicked events people with free will seem to rain down upon us.Instead, Ms. Diamant heaped up insult after insult upon Isaac, Jacob, Rebecca, Joseph, and his \\"barbarian\\" brothers. Specifically, the utter distain Ms Diamant displayed toward Rebecca was disgusting. It is preposterous that Rebecca -- the girl that ran to water a stranger's camels, who lived in the tents of Abraham who had doors on all four corners to welcome strangers and teach them about the kindness of One God, who poured her heart out to Shem seeking understanding about the fighting twins in her womb, who foresaw the wicked generations of Esau and facilitated her blind husband Isaac's blessing of Jacob (the son who merited the mantle of God's anointing) - that Rebecca could shun and rudely turn away and be unkind to a Ms. Diamant's servant girl? No way. All wrong.The author had these richly layered, wise, heroic-women narratives to work with, but gave us only ordinary women, obsessed with sexual relations, menses, gossip - women seeing very little virtue in the men around them, and little intimate knowledge of the God of ancient Judaism.The better story of Dinah is yet to be written. It's a powerful story, brimming with inspiring courageous women. The Red Tent, as a commentary on the Torah merits only the trash can.(For any one looking to taste the real stuff - of Midrash that will put you on your face before God, and encourage you make a difference in your community, read \\"The Light and the Fire of the Ba'al Shem Tov\\" by Yatzhak Buxbaum.)"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"The Red Tent will prove shocking for some readers unfamiliar with the values of ancient nomadic life in Mesopotamia and Canaan. It is, however, an amazingly clear and compelling picture of that lifestyle. Diamant writes with keen understanding of historical research relative to the period presented in the biblical stories of the family of Jacob, Rachel, and Leah, retelling and expanding those stories from the perspective of Dinah, the daughter of Jacob and Leah.She does not attempt to stay faithful to every detail of the biblical stories. Jacob works for 14 months for the right to marry Leah and Rachel, rather than the 14 years in the biblical story, for example, but Diamant creates a narrative world that places the biblical stories accurately in the cultural context that they assume. She presents a realistic picture of the complex religious realities of the time, in which Jacob's worship of only one deity surely seemed odd to his neighbors.The book contains some very violent scenes and plenty of explicit discussion of childbirth and sex. Its portrayal of these aspects of ancient nomadic life, though, is surely accurate. I highly recommend the book for anyone wishing to better understand the cultural context of the biblical stories of Israel's ancestors.The first two thirds of the book are set in northern Mesopotamia and in Canaan while the last section is set in Egypt. The material on Egypt, while well informed, is not as compellingly narrated as the earlier sections. I found the last chapter unconvincing, but perhaps that's a matter of personal taste. I'll let you decide."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Throughout all of my sixteen years of girlhood, I have been raised in a society that is gradually giving more and more equality to women. We (if I can say &quot;we,&quot; myself being only a girl) are finally being put on a level playing field with our male counterparts and are being given the rights long sought-after, even though perhaps there is still much to be done. This is, as Martha would say, a good thing.However, an indirect result of this movement has been the loss of our gender identity. The attitude that was drilled into my subconscience was that we were only lesser versions of men, with nothing to really be proud of, and nothing to hold sacred about ourselves. Our physical properties, our emotions, and our monthly cycles were only limiting hindrances, and we should strive to basically be as comparable to men as possible. We were to go through life with the feeling of being unlucky, of being put in the unwanted 50% of life. And that, I say, is a bad thing. Our daughters are being given no reasons to be female.This book, if nothing else, has taught me differently. My eyes are now opened. My attempts at describing the transformations of my heart would only be futile, so I encourage you heartily to READ THIS BOOK. This novel has shown me a culture that thinks women are special...every little part of our body, or every facet of our soul...it all has a beautiful purpose. I no longer feel hindered, but liberated, and although she doesn't know it, I look on my mother with a new kind of love, and a deeper respect. I realize now what the bond between mother and daughter...yet another thing that has been diminished by our culture... means.I beg of you, read this novel. You might walk away from it enlightened, and even if you don't, you won't be able to put it down."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Before reading this book I suggest that you read the story of Jacob and his many sons, as described in the Bible at the end of Genesis. Receiving little mention are Jacob's wives and daughter Dinah, the focus of &quot;The Red Tent.&quot; I loved this book for bringing me back to biblical times and filling in the many gaps. It helped me see that some human emotions are timeless: sibling rivalry, romantic love, jealousy, charity and pride to name a few. These themes are in the bible too if you read between the lines; for an example of what might have been between those biblical lines, read The Red Tent.I couldn't put this book down and I highly recommend it. I think that open-minded persons of all western religions and non-religions will be interested in this book, Christian, Jewish, Pagan, Agnostic and perhaps Moslem. This book may not be to the liking of strict religious fundamentalists. If I could, I would give this book a 4.5 on a scale of 1-5."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"On the recommendation of a Christian friend, I ordered this book hoping to gain more insight into the story of Dinah. Instead of an insightful, well-researched depiction of biblical events, I got a poorly written, anti-male, anti-God tale that is the polar opposite of the biblical account. Diamante's main character (Dinah) is a joyless shadow who merely observes life and whose only emotion seems to be anger. Other female characters (Leah, Rachel) are vastly more interesting because of their competition for Jacob's affections. The male characters, who would later form the tribes of Israel, are one dimensional, clueless caricatures. Their interaction with Dinah ultimately leads to disastrous events, thereby painting them as bumbling, misguided fools. Further, Diamante's account is laced with references to bestiality and homosexuality but only when describing male characters. She attributes main events to the works of the \\"goddesses\\" and completely rewrites the story of Jacob and his family.I would never recommend this book to anybody and I'm sorry I read it. I kept hoping it would get better at the end, but instead, it got more ridiculous. I have read the biblical account of Jacob and his family many times, so I could discern which events in this book were fictitious. I caution other readers to take this book with a grain of salt. It is revisionist history with very little foundation in truth. Ultimately, her story of Dinah did nothing to bring greater understanding to this lesser-known biblical character and was a complete waste of time."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"When I finished reading this book, the feeling that I had been there stayed with me and still to this day, I can imagine how it might have felt to be in the Red Tent. Anita Diamant has created a scenario of women's lives in the time before women's lives were recorded because they were not considered to be very important compared to men. Did these women have special ceremonies, stories, songs and rituals they performed when they were separated from their men during menses or after childbirth? I certainly hope so. The book is rich with visuals. How much of it is true? If you are not a stickler for historical accuracy, you will love this book."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I loved this book. At first I thought all the names were going to be a problem, but I soon was emersed in the lives of the women of the red tent. All women should read this book and then pass it on to all your friends. I just ordered three copies to send to my friends as a summer reading gift. You have to read this book!!!!!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This is a wonderful story about the often overlooked women of Biblical times. It's told from the women's perspective and has a very different slant than the 'traditional' story of Joseph and his many brothers. This is a beautiful story of Dinah and her life from beloved daughter of many mothers to aged midwife. Very enjoyable and not 'religiously' slanted. If you don't want contradictions to the traditional story, you probably won't like this. Along the lines of 'Mists of Avalon'."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I couldn't put it down...When I finished, I went out and bought 5 more copies for family and friends. Red Tent made me proud to be a woman. Read it and be empowered!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This is a fantastic book that I'm sure is being overlooked by alot of men based on the subject matter. It's their loss, because it's great. Being familiar with the Joseph and his coat of many colors story, I found this story of his sister Dinah immediately engrossing and hard to put down. Getting lost in the world that Anita Diamant re-creates reminded me in tone of &quot;Memoirs of a Geisha.&quot; And if you liked that book, you'll probably respond to this as well. Ladies, do your literature loving boyfriends, husbands, and companions a favor and give them this book after you've read it yourself."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This is a novel of interest to those raised both as Christians and as Jews. In fact, it is written in the same spirit as Marion Zimmer Bradley's novel, The Mists of Avalon. The Red Tent brings the previously mute female characters of this story alive. I hope Ms. Diamant will try her hand at other women from the biblical tradition."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"The premise of this book is fascinating and very well-executed. Once I picked it up I was unable to put it down. Anita Diamant does an amazing job of recreating Biblical times through her writing (without it becoming a history lesson), and creates characters that captivate from the first page. Although based on a woman from the Bible, this is a read for everyone, religious or non. I loved this story of strong and beautiful women. This book is about women celebrating their womanhood and marking a plac in a male dominated time - it's an inspirational tale!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Normally I shy away from Biblically-based stories, being decidedly a-religious, but I found myself completely engrossed, and finished the book in a few short hours. This book is a touching story about female power, struggling against society, and finding oneself in the end. Brava!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"It took me awhile to pick this book up because I'm not a fan of this time era however; I was forced to read it for book club and was extremely surprised. It did take me some time to get into the book but once I was 1/4 way into it, I couldn't put it down... I read the second half of the book in one afternoon! One of the reasons I enjoyed the book was because I knew the stories of Jacob's sons in the Old Testament. When reading, I'd wonder when certain parts of the biblical story would take place. But the best part of the book was really Dinah's story. The reason her story is so greatis that this wouldn't happen in today's world. Reading the book, I caught myself shaking my head in disgust many times wondering how these things could have happened... yes, I know it isn't a true story but the book took me there and it was. All there is to say is 'amazing'."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"The premise of this book is fascinating. Dinah is a footnote in the bible to the more &quot;important&quot; story of Jacob and his twelve sons, the fathers of the tribes of Israel. The book wonderfully evokes the interaction between ancient men and women, different religions and cultures and the world of the red tent. I wished the world of the red tent still existed, I could do with several days every month to laze on pillows and listen to the stories of my mother and other relatives!!I learned a great deal and was intrigued by Dinah and saddened by her story. This book most emphatically is NOT a bible story. God hardly comes into it.I thought the book lost its way towards the end but this does not undermine the enjoyment of the reader in exploring this forgotten world. I, too, finished the novel quickly and this is a sure sign of an engaging and enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I read this book out loud to my girls...we cried together, laughed together and through the stories..we connected with women past, present and future.Truly a must read...Joy Nelson"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Women's history in ancient Israel. Wonderful view into the world before modern medicine and birth. Loved the perspective of women supporting each other"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I truly loved reading this book, to the point where I'd deliberately stop reading it for several days to draw it out before finally finishing it. By the end, I was nearly in tears -- would have been, if I hadn't gotten interrupted at a pivotal moment -- and I am not easily moved to tears by books or movies.It is not a perfect book. I was tempted to remove a star because the book deviates from the Biblical passages it's based on without any justification or source material given. I was also tempted to remove a star because the novel rushes through the most important scene -- the mass murder committed by Dinah's brothers and its immediate aftermath -- far too quickly. In the rest of the novel, the author makes large amounts of time go by with grace and handles the events of several decades with such aplomb that you're barely aware of time passing, both in real life and in the book. But that scene just feels rushed and unbelievable, and she doesn't set up its preamble well enough for me to understand why Dinah's brothers felt justified in slaughtering an entire city full of people. I also could have done without the narrative device she uses at the beginning and end of the book, in which Dinah directly addresses the reader from beyond the grave.But I had to put all that aside and acknowledge the profound impact this book had on me. It left me wanting more. I wanted a bibliography of her research sources so I could continue to put myself in that world by reading more stories that took place at the same time and in the same place. I wanted another book with more details about the vast family sired by Jacob and some of the other women and men mentioned in this text. I didn't want to stop hearing about Dinah's own life, sad though it was much of the time. I didn't want her story to end.So in me, the author's mission was accomplished. This was a compelling read that stayed with me weeks after I finally turned the last page. What more could a writer ask for? In her prologue, she is not just speaking for Dinah, but for anyone who takes the time to put their words onto a written page: she wants to be remembered. And she will. By me, and hopefully by everyone else whom I plan to recommend this book to in the future."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"The used book was in great shape.

I enjoyed reading the Biblical story from a women's point of view. Loved the details describing the bonds between the women."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I should state that this book isn't a supplement to the Old Testament but rather a historical FICTION book that took a part of Genesis and created something entirely different, I wouldn't state that this book is a \\"faith\\" book but rather one that took liberties with some of the ancient Bible characters.I had bought this book after moving to a new state, being so far away from my family made me feel awkward and alone..not the mention the tv had not arrived yet so I had to find something to do with my time and I had to rely on books. I had bought this book not expecting to fall into the story but I did. Now the story itself is well-written and the author did a very good job bringing me into the ancient world. The characters come to life and the women have a complexity that I found both puzzling and endearing. This went deeper into the story of Dinah and showed that her mothers had lives of their own. Leah and Rachel were stuck in the eternal battle over Jacob while the two other sisters Zilpah and Bilhah have their own stories that I have never heard. Dinah's tragedy shocked me and I felt the same fury and heartbreak she had and I loved to see her rise above her sadness to shape a life for herself. The bonds of womanhood had been laid heavily on her, first being the only daughter and then being a woman in a time where they were barely citizens and it is interesting to see Dinah's journey through life."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I loved this book, and every time I mention this title in a group of women, there are always at least a couple who have read it and say, \\"Oh THAT book...

You won't regret it."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"So I keep on seeing the popularity of The Red Tent. I really wasn't interested in reading anything biblical (Old Testament) although I am a woman of faith. So one day I downloaded the sample and I was hooked.

I would recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"While the historical inaccuracies seem to be a deal-breaker for many people, I truly enjoyed this book. As a person that frequently wants more than just the casual mentions of characters of the bible, this was a excellent extension to Dinah's single appearance in the scriptures.

Beside being a religious topic, it paints such a beautiful picture of cross-generational female relationships within a family.I recommend it to everyone."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"All in all this was a pretty decent book.

I read it every summer...in paperback. This hardcover version is for my library.This exceptionally well-written book tells the story of Dinah from the old testament of the Bible....from her perspective.

Understand that it is a fictionalized version of the story and you should enjoy it very much!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Although this book is sometimes catagorized as \\"women's lit\\", I don't think that is a fair assessment. It is simply one of the most extraordinary works of historical fiction I have ever read. Not only is the story about events in the ancient world, it is told through the perspective of the ancients in a most imaginative way. The imagery is haunting for the way that it jars our 21st century sensibilities. The author manages to communicate to the reader just how the ancients would have interpreted such things as the passage of the year, biological functions, birth, death, and family. I read this book several years ago, and I still have distinct images of it impressed in my mind. It's one of those rare books that has fundamentally changed the way that I see the world. I plan to read it again sometime in the future.Anita Diamant must have an extraordinary imagination to have so insightfully presented such a plausible history of our collective past."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"The Red Tent is the story of Dinah, the daughter of Leah and Jacob, midwife to the other side of a story that is but a chapter in the heroic tale of the Hebrew people. The writers of the Bible tell us Dinah was a rape victim and that her brothers Simeon and Levi avenged her honor by slaughtering the Shechemites, whose prince committed the act.Dinah's version transforms the rape into a short-lived love affair. There's a world of difference between sex as an act of violence and sex as an act of love. In this case the difference is between her experience of a man whom she loved and two brothers whose hunger for power and land drove them to profane sacred ritual in the name of personal power. The Jacobites had ordered that all the Shechemites be circumcised as part of a peace treaty and then attacked them while they were recovering from the experience. Treachery, plain and simple.How is it that two opposing world views could coexist within one family? Diamant explores this possibility in this work of fiction. The women of the tribe of Jacob worship the Queen of Heaven, Inanna and appeal to her many aspects--lesser gods and other intercessors--for insight, healing, and more. The women's lives are ordered around the red tent, where they are set apart once a month for about three days to menstruate, where they deliver their children, where they tell stories and sing. They leave their differences at the door of the tent and share in a deep spiritual experience. The Spirit as they understand it is not separate from the physical world. As a result, everything is holy. Dreams are portents of the future. Clairvoiance, dream interpretation, prophecy, and other acts of spiritual insight are the result of being in tune with the rhythms of the earth, which rhythms are symbiotic with the bodily rhythms of the women.The men have no knowledge of life inside the tent. In their world, men quarrel with each other--think of the great biblical battles between brothers and between fathers and son. It's all about the strongest man--even about the strongest god--rather than about community.Ulitmately, the male-dominated world of Esau and Jacob, Jacob and Laban, Jacob and his sons, the Jacobites and the Shechemites gives way to the world of Dinah and Joseph--one a judge, a teller of truth, and the other a diviner a teller of dreams. Between them they create a faith in an almighty god that is mother and father, creator of this world and of the spirit world, and the main character in a story that invites us in to read, reread, and rediscover our relationship with God again and again."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I found the Red Tent to be a quick, interesting read. It expands on stories from the bible. And though I look at these with major creative license (i.e. I don't think what happened in the story is necessarily true) it was extremely entertaining."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"A very creative book and an easy read. Reading this book didn't change my life dramaticaly, but it was interesting nonetheless. It's a story told from a female perspective, and is set in the Biblical days.

Being a seventeen-year-old, this is unlike any book I've ever read. It was recommended to me by a Book Club I recently joined and I am very glad it was. This novel follows the life of Dinah, the daughter of Jacob and sister of Joseph and is amazing. One of my favorite things about this book is that Diamant makes it so easy to read and extremely easy to remember which characters are which, which can be very difficult with all the names found in this book. I also appreciated how it shows the turmoils of being a woman of the times, the stories of the \\"Red Tent\\", which I found completely enthralling. It makes me love being a woman, tying me to every woman that ever lived. I love that."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This may not be the most in-depth review you will ever read, but it is heartfelt.

I have to say that it is a must read for every woman. Truly amazing."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Anita Diamant has written a book with the ability to evoke the raw emotion of age and wisdom. Any woman who can read this book and not be moved to tears has not yet suffered enough to be able to enjoy the sweet sting of resolved pain. Read this book and remember the stories of your mothers and their mothers and their mothers' mothers."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I am usually harsh when rating books, however, this novel was exceptional. Ms. Diamant has the biblical character, Dinah, tell us her sorrowful life story. This novel is rich with description of the often questioned culture of the early time of the Old Testament.While reading this, I often felt that I was there with Dinah and her mothers in the Red Tent listening to their tales and rituals and traditions. The novel starts off by describing Dinah's mothers and how they met her father, Jacob. Further through the novel, there is amazing character development and you can get a taste of how all the wives of Jacob feel about their husband and eachother. There were times, in the first part of the novel while Dinah is growing up, the I cried because of the beauty of the novel. Like I before, I actually felt like I was there witnessing everything along with Dinah. As the second half of the novel comes along (I will try not to give anything away) when Dinah lives the rest of her life in Egypt, I cried along with her and felt her grief.As you can tell, I love this book and I can easily say it is one of my favorite books. And of course, being the emotional reader as I am, as I finished the book I cried and Dinah dies with her \\"family\\" around her.If you liked \\"The Mists of Avalon\\", then this novel is a good read for you. However, I recommend it to everyone and anyone as an excellent and moving novel."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This book is a wonderful insight into the life of women in Biblical times. This book gave me a new insight into the little I knew about the women in this era. This book will make you feel a whirl-wind of emotions for all that she expirences. This book is one of those books that everyone would love."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Although I can't argue that The Rent Tent is a well-written page turner, I would definitely not recommend it to someone looking for biblically-based or spiritually enriching fiction. If you prefer the genre of book that has graphic sexuality exuding from practically every page in order to keep the reader's attention--you'll love it! If you are looking for a book that integrates the physical, spiritual, emotional, and relational dimensions of life with a good story, I suggest something else such as 'Same Kind of Different As Me', 'The Shack', or 'Redeeming Love'. Since this was recommended to me by someone with whom I had been in a book discussion group of those titles, I was not at all prepared for the content of this book. It makes me sad to think of the millions of women who have or will read this book and think this IS the story of Jacob, Rachel, Leah and other biblical characters. They will miss the whole point of God's plan and pursuit of humankind in order to restore them to a relationship with Himself. Yes, He takes very imperfect people and uses the characters and events in their lives to draw them to Him. If that message is somewhere in The Red Tent, it was kept a well-hidden secret beneath a tawdry dime-store novel, \\"sex sells\\" storyline. Oh, well, we are inundated with it everywhere we go. For those of us who try to escape to a higher level through reading, this is not the book for you."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"The story of The Red Tent has squeezed my heart, captured my breath and has kept my in or near to tears from the first page to the very last. It has been an honor for me to go through this very emotional up and down journey with Dinah and all the other characters in this story. Every person in this books has had a tale to tell. The author has done an amazing job of doing that for each one of them, and in a way that will stay with the read for a long time to come. She has given an amazing and wonderful voice where there was none. I think Dinah would be please with the story and remembrance she has been given. I can't compliment this book enough. If you only read one thing, read The Red Tent. You will not regret it. :)"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This is not a \\"true\\" story but it gives some insight into maybe how the story of Jacob's wives started and ended. It was an awesome book, one that I have read at least five times. You need to go into the book though and realize that it is fiction and just one way of looking at the story. This book actually went around our bible study group and everyone enjoyed it, as a great fiction book based off of scripture."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I found this book in the library and picked it up on a whim. I started to read and was blown away by the rich texture of the story.The premiss of the book fascinated me; tidea of reading about women who lived during Old testament time was excitig and new; the details of the period added rich color and life to these well known characters.I loved the book and am sad there was not more to hear from Dinah or the author. For similar premises I recomend works by India Edgehill.please visit me at BookDevour.blogspot.com"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I;m still not over the circumcision of Reuben, thank gosh it was not described like that for all the other boys, otherwise I would not been able to finish the book.When Sharem and the king were circ'ed it wasn't too bad to me cause they were adults when they agreed to it, and I was so impressed that Sharem was willing to go through that for Dinah. What a man!! If that's not true love, then I don't know what is.A few things made me laugh. I don;t remember the exact line, and looking back I can;t find it at the moment, but when it was suggested that one reason for women dying after they give birth is because baby did not empty the breast. Also when it was joked by Werenro that a red haired child meant that baby was conceived while the mother was on her period. LOLOLOLIn the begging of the book when it was about Dinah's mothers' I like how it was said that Adah had pelted Laban on the head over and over again after she found out that he had touched some of his daughters innapropretely. WTG Adah! Reading about that time period I was expecting some sort of mention of it, but I was not expecting to read that the man was punished for it by his lowly wife. Needless to say that I was happy when they all left Laban's camps. The guy gave me the creeps and I was happy to be rid of him while I read.Notice how Dinah was never introduced to anyone? When her mothers' and brothers met Rebecca, plus when they met Jacobs twin brother Dinah, was never once spoken for. I guess if you a girl in that time you don;t exsist between weaning, and getting your period. Nice life.I love the idea of a Red Tent. Before starting this book I had no idea what the title meant, and it suits the story well! I would love the right to just go off somewhere by myself once a month and not be expected to do a single thing. Thats cool!The party and celebration when girls become women is dear to me, because I plan to do it with my own daughter. I already have the whole thing planned out in my head, I can't wait to do it.The ceremony as described in The Red Tent is not what I would do though.Having my daughter lay outside naked while I stick something in her to break her hymen is not something I'm keen on.\\"It did not hurt. The oil eased the entry, and the narrow triangle fit perfectly as it entered me. I faced the west while the little goddess faced East as she broke the lock on my womb\\"Thats as sick as the circ'ing was."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"\\"She sees clearly into the hearts of men and none fool her with fine words that conceal a lying heart.\\" Wow, wow, WOW! Can you say powerful? This book was literally amazing. You will laugh and cry with each of these 5 women in this wonderful novel by Anita Diamant. If you enjoy learning about different cultures in past times, this is the book for you! Not only does it give Dinah an actual story, but it gives the reader some insight as to what life could have been like for these ancient women. This is an excellent read that I highly recommend!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I found this story to be delightful, intriguing and insightful! It is beautifully told and gave me the unique perpective of what it was to be a woman during that time. Though based on a small part of the bible, I did not have to be versed in the biblical aspect to enjoy this story. The narrative truly pulled me into the story, I could not put it down!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"My godmother bought me this book and I have to say I read it in 2 days savoring every word. I was so intrigued by it that I decided to go and read the book of genesis. Yes it was inaccurate but her purpose was to tell a story, a story that a grandmother might tell her granddaughter verbatium. Just read it, look at it and you will get lost in the beautiful story."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Having been assigned this book in a women's literature class, I was sure I didn not want to read it. Hesitantly, I opened the cover. I was instantly drawn away into the story of Dinah, her four mothers, and the red tent. Theit sisterhood during their times in the red tent is absolutly inspiring. It is a wonderfully descriptive book and I couldn't put it down. I finished it, thoroughly satisfied, in a day and a half. It weaves a tale that is like no other I have read. It is a roller coaster of emotion as is the daily life of anyone who is intune with themselves, their family, and nature around them. It is a thoroughly enjoyable read, and good to the last drop!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Anita Diamant has completely won me over - I am now a huge fan of historical fiction! I chose this book because of the positive word-of-mouth from several friends, and I never regretted my choice. Diamant's style in this book is very simple and direct - you feel as though you are walking, living, seeing and breathing during Old Testament times. I absolutely loved this book, hated to see it end, and whole-heartedly recommend it to everyone!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This was a great period historical fiction book. A very descriptive view on what it was like during a time when women were considered separate beings from men."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I bought this for a friend on tape who had just had a stroke. I thought it would be a way she could be stimulated."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"i really enjoyed this book. i would probably even read it again. i really liked it. i have had friends love it or not care for it. i loved it."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"To start off, this book is written well. It is a good and fair story. I just did not identify with the story enough to enjoy it. This book was recommended to my by a friend with similar taste in books."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Though, I know that this is fiction, it's interesting to see the parts played by various women in Jacob's life."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This book is a very interesting book because it explains all about what the women went through at that time. Once you start reading it you just have to continue."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Not crazy with all of the author's liberties she took with the biblical &#34;heros&#34;. I really enjoyed Orson Scott Card's series on the Old Testament women better- although he takes his share of liberties as well, but at least they are more respectful."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This story is so moving, I can not wait to tell others when they ask \\"read any good books lately?\\""},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This isn't so much as a review as a bitching-and-moaning. For twelve years, I tried to launch/maintain small spiritually-oriented women's groups in Northern/Central California. All failed. In this locale, women came and went as they pleased (no commitment). If without a boyfriend/husband upon entering, once they found a significant other, they abandoned the women's group without so much as a by-your-leave. Conversing was via talking-stick, which meant that virtually no response or interaction after a woman said her piece happened (no in-depth discussion, or for that matter, no discussion at all).I'm pretty down on women's groups. At least here, women don't give a cr*p about other women. Women exploit women in the short-term, then discard them, just like the rest of American \\"disposable culture.\\" Women only care about men. Same old detritus."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Well researched historical fiction, from another point of view. This book is very well-written and truly enjoyable to read. I LOVED IT!! I laughed and cried, what a journey!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this beautiful story woven from a brief reference in the Bible. I'd recommend this book to any woman!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I must be on a biblical fiction streak, because, wow, this was another fabulous read... at least for me.The story of Dinah (she gets chapter 34 of Genesis, kind of...) is told from her point of view in this massive book of her life. We are given background, shadows and highlights, details and grand scheme images, all of which I was fond of. This kind of exploration of a character, who on a read-through the Bible might not (and didn't for me, at least) garner any further questions, is breath-taking.Not only are we given a peak into Dinah's life, though, we are given a possible universe in terms of female relationships in the times of Jacob and Joseph. What it means to be a daughter, a sister, a wife, a mother, a mid-wife, a wet-nurse, a widow, a wanderer... these are what it means to be Dinah. But Diamant's exploration of this girl (and this woman) goes beyond the gender roles she plays, and allows me to see the omnipresence of femininity, in terms of growth, dreams, and desires.There are claims that this novel is a bit too free with the sexual descriptions of Dinah, her mothers, and the workings of female lives in general (birthing, feeding, caring, pleasuring), but this could not be further from my read of the novel at all. Instead, I think the book could not have worked without all of these snapshots of a woman's body and the creation of a niche for that body in the every day lives of the people of the Old Testament.This is a powerful book for any woman interested in the historical period of Jacob and Joseph, for any woman interested in interpersonal relationships between women (and how they might have a constant structure in time), for any woman interested in faith - how it can be viewed as intrinsic, irresolute, and increased over the course of a life."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I don't usually read modern day literature, but I have heard that this book was a winner and boy were they right. This book is an excellent read. It has an excellent story line and is very well written. It is the kind of book that leaves you thinking (and feeling) days after you read it. I can't wait to explore her other books."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I first read this book a few years ago and loved it! I bought it for every woman I know, and told everyone about it. I even bought an audio version for my mother-in-law.I picked it up a year or so later and read it again.I was so touched by the characters in this book. Their life story, the conditions in which they lived and the way they navigated the complicated relationships.I loved the fact that it was rooted in religious history, but I dont think that should turn people off either.It is a very empowering book for women, and families."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"It is very rare when I truly love a book. After finishing this, I wanted to read more so badly I actually read the front and back covers, author bio, etc. Just hoping to continue the feeling of this fabulous book. It is now my #1 favorite book. I love it."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"As my son Daniel (a biblical name you will notice) was sailing up the Nile on a felucca, on his Christmas holiday, I was blobbing out in the steamy southern hemisphere heat, reading this novel, set first in the land of the two rivers - Tigris and Euphrates - Mesopotamia (now Iraq), then Canaan (modern day Israel) and then Egypt. Definitely a woman's book, it follows the story of Dinah, the only daughter of Jacob (son of Ismael, son of Abraham). There is a lot of \\"begetting\\", birthing, betrayal and death - but finally it is a love story, as Dinah finally finds peace and contentment in the home of a master carpenter in The Valley of the Kings, where she spends the latter part of her life. An interesting insight into the life of a shepherding tribe in those times, and much more readable than the same story in the Old Testament of the Bible. And like the Bible, I wonder how much of it is fact and how much fiction??? From my reading of other reviews on this site -I gather there is not much \\"fact\\" at all!!!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I read this book non-stop one weekend while I was up North and it was truly wonderful. The detail in which Dinah is created makes you (as a woman) connect with her on a very deep level. You feel as though you're actually living in Biblical times and you feel every emotion she experiences with sincerity."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This book was enjoyable, but not historically accurate. Had it not been called a novel, I would have given it less stars because it's clearly historically inaccurate. I guess \\"based on a true story...\\""},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This book tells the fictionalized story of the wives and daughter of Jacob from the Old Testament. I loved the story. The focus is on the hopes, the dreams, the work, the struggles and the relationships of these women. These kinswomen have a deep bond and strong love for each other, but also are quite competitive and even treacherous toward one another at times. And, they have very little true authority over their own lives.The first part of the story is about Dinah's upbringing and focuses mostly on her \\"mothers\\"--her biological mother and her aunts. The second part focuses on Dinah's adult life, mostly in Egypt.The writing is quite good and the story very interesting. Although this history is so far removed from modern times, it is easy to relate to Dinah and her mothers. They have the same dreams for love, success and happiness that we still have today, albeit with different ideals of each. I found myself identifying in some part with most of the women in this book. Their strength, their disappointments, their joys are all familiar.I think we learn so much by reading stories and relating to the characters in however small a way that may be. I highly recommend this book to anyone wanting to explore female kinship and friendship."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This book really pulls you in! One of the best I've ever read. A really easy read!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I liked this novel because I like historical fictions. It had some very slow parts. It was not a book that I started reading and could not put down. It was a slower read than I wanted it to be. But, I enjoyed the subject matter."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"The story is compelling, inspiring, sad, and beautiful. I could not put it down. Reviewers have commented on whether it is historically factual, I don't know that answer but it is a page turner and a new classis for women's literature in any culture."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Was perusing the books in my library and deciding which I would pass on or reread someday.There is was...'The Red Tent', a gift from my daughter years ago. Certainly, I remembered how much I enjoyed this novel and how it gave me some understanding and knowledge of women and families in the Old Testament.Having read thru the Bible a number of times, it was a very enjoyable historical novel complement.I went to look at my review here on Amazon and alas! I didn't provide one.So here it is, better late than never, minus little minutiae that could have added to the review.A lot to be said when you decide to revisit a novel!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"A wonderful read which connects woman with our history. The mothers & daughters in this book are so relateable. Some things are timeless"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"The Red Tent: A Novelby Anita Daimant is a book for women (or men who care to admit) who enjoy stories set in a historical period and who are open to a creative retelling of the biblical story of Dinah.I personally liked Anita Diamant's writing style as she described familiar events from the Bible with a narrative flair. She describes Jakob and his family's day to day lives in detail. The story describes the wives of Jakob as normal women--sometimes they quarrel, other times they laugh together, and with the hardships that fall upon them, they comfort each other. The interesting part of the story is when the women go into the Red tent during their \\"time of the month\\" and enjoy the quiet reflective moments together without having to worry about their daily chores and obligations. The men of the family always think of the Red tent as a dirty, unholy place so they never bother the women inside.I enjoyed the book very much on a literary level. Of course, if you have read the Bible, you may argue that as a historical piece, many of the events are inaccurate. I prefer to see the book as a lens on how life may have been for women during that time."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I enjoyed this read, it kept my interest and I finished it quickly which is always a good sign.

I strongly recommend it."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I wish I read more reviews before I bought this book.I didn't read it all because after a while it just put me off completely.I was expecting a book like Redeeming Love but this book is anything but...The author invents things like Jacob worked seven months, instead of seven years, and their actions are anything but Christian like, such as having sex with animals... And constant bad mouthing of characters.I don't think I ever disliked a book as much as I do this one..This book left a bad taste in my mouth and made me feel sick ..."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"But it's a great book.

I was a little confused initially trying to figure out who the storyteller was, but that confusion quickly disappeared as the story progressed. I loved the rivalry between the women.

I can't recommend this highly enough."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I found this to be a wonderful piece of historical literary fiction. I didn't read it as an alternative to the Bible. I found the characters rich, and their relationships complex. The experience of the Red Tent was touching. To me the characters were almost real. There were many insightful moments. The touching story of a woman's life."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I really enjoyed this book. Was written very beautifully. Fascinating to take a passage from the Bible and then make it into a beautiful story"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Although this book is a novel it brings Biblical characters more to life for me.

I would recommend it to anyone to is interested in history in biblical times. It is a well written easy read."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Let me first state that this book is not for the religiously sensitive, anyone looking for historical/religious insight, or anyone who is easily offended. I think a lot of the negative reviews come from people with certain historical or religious expectations.However, if you are simply looking for a compelling feminist story, you're in the right place. I'd place The Red Tent along side The Mists of Avalon for both historic and religious accuracy and content- so basically, don't look for it. But if you want a story about women, strong, spiritual, women, this is a great story.This book touched me profoundly- and it is far more than sitting outside a maternity/labor ward, as on reviewer suggested. There is so much more deeper meaning in this story, and it's not difficult to discover.This is one of my favorite books. If you liked The Mists of Avalon, you will probably like this one- or vice versa."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Even as a Christian and considering the liberty she takes with biblical characters, I believe this is a book to be read by all women. So beautiful."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"The Red Tent is one of the best books I have ever read! It was plausible, and it taught me a lot about the women of this period. I think every woman should read it. I enjoyed it so much, I bought my step-daughter a copy so she could read it. Everyone I know who has read the book has loved it! Anita Diamant shows an incredible talent for story telling in this book. I look forward to reading more of her books."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I would reread this book without hesitation!the descriptions so vivid...the story telling is supreme. the author really uses the english language to her advantage.One can sympathize with the main character Dinah. Sometimes I wish women still had a red tent to congregate in... sigh"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Anita Diamant, The Red TentThis book tells a fictionalized story of Dinah, the daughter of Jacob. It's a story of the women of ancient Hebrew society, with emphasis on the wives of Jacob. Though Dinah makes only a cameo appearance in the Hebrew bible, Diamant manages to milk quite a novel out of very little raw material.As a guy, I am definitely not in the target audience for this book, which is undoubtedly marketed as \\"chick lit.\\" (The Amazon reviewers, I note, are overwhelmingly women.) So let me speak to the guys out there: this is a really good book. Diamant focuses on the sisterhood of the red tent, where women retreat during menses and childbirth, but she manages to give us a convincing reconstruction of the ancient Hebrew world. The characters are real, and the setting feels right.The most striking aspect of this book has less to do with the book than with the author. Diamant is a convert to Judaism who has written several books on the practices of contemporary Judaism. However, this book is remarkably pagan. She emphasizes the pagan practices of the women, which she juxtaposes to the Jewish (or Yahwist) practices of the men. This feminist narrative sides with the women, of course, which means that the author's voice sympathizes with the pagans. Seeing this perspective into the world of early Judaism makes this book distinctive."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I bought this book 2 wks ago and got it in the mail last week. It's a great book. I read it all and it's just great. If you are into the old Egyptian ways and the lives of women, Get it. It's worth it!!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"A very long time ago when I went to Sunday School there were many short stories, labeled 'might have been' stories, that used names or events from the Bible as their starting point - kind of like today's fan fiction. Their purpose was to illustrate a point, or to fill out details to make the Biblical account easier to understand. THE RED TENT is very much in the tradition of those 'might have been' stories.Dinah, daughter of Jacob, sister of Joseph, granddaughter of Issac is, like so many women in the Bible, reduced to little more than a footnote to the men around her. In THE RED TENT we are given a glimpse into the possible lives of these shadowy women, of how they might have lived and thought and influence they may have been able to exert behind the scenes. Diamant has managed to create a wonderfully detailed description of the four wives of Jacob and their place in the world of Genesis. The familiar biblical accounts are slightly altered when they are told from the women's points of view, just as any story is slightly different when told by different people. That, coupled with Diamant's depictions, brings the characters both familiar and new of these well known stories to life.THE RED TENT is a well told tale, one that will appeal to fans of MISTS OF AVALON as well as many others."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This is an amazing book. Every woman should read this and pass it to a friend to pass around. You will look at the bible and woman in a whole different way. Woman were pretty strong then too."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This book brings to life the many stories I heard as a child in Sunday School. I gave up religion many, many years ago. This book never mentions anything \\"Christian\\"...in fact there are references to the other gods of the day...Isis, Enlil, Enki and so on. My life as a woman, mother, and now a grandmother has been affected in ways I could never have imagined by the reading of this beautifully written story. It swept me away and I made it last a week because I did not want it to end. I would love to read more period stories like this."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"For me, this book just didn't live up to the hype. It wasn't a bad book, it just wasn't awesome either. It was repetitive and tedious in parts. There were parts I enjoyed too though. I'm not sure what the problem was for me. Yes, it deviated from the Biblical account of events, but that didn't bother me morally as it has some reviewers. Perhaps my brain had trouble differentiating between the two accounts. I'm glad I read it, but can't say that I would highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Anita Diamant has brought to life the story of Dinah in a way that I had never considered before. It was an extremely good read, and when I revisited her story (Dinah) in the Bible, I found it to be true to the Word as much as a book of fiction could be. Thank you Anita for personalizing a story that is not told as often as it should be. I will be spreading the word about this book for years to come."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This book was beautiful. Tremendously imaginative, hopeful, compelling, I would recommend this to anyone, but especially to women who enjoy just how far gender relations have come in, say, 2000 years. I tore through it in just a few days and was disappointed when I'd turned the last page, as though I was saying goodbye to someone I'd fallen in love with. Vivid, moving, good stuff."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Definitely a woman's book. Gave a deeply revealing insight to customs of that day and the place of women in that society. Not the picture I have of Joseph from my early Sunday School days, however. Made me feel that some history had been changed to fit the story line. Thoroughly enjoyable - I foundthe book easy to read and understand."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I just read two five-star books back to back! This was the first of them. This story grabbed me from the beginning and I didn't want to put it down. It would be a great addition to any women's book club. I loved the courageous central character. The book was easy to read and there was not a dull moment!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"The book is very emotional and informative. I had no idea and no concept of how women lived and survived during that time and didn't even consider how a woman handled her female hygiene. THe book is VERY WELL written and one you don't want to put down."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Highly enjoyable and very well written. Life in biblical times is seen through eyes of Dinah -briefly mentioned in the bible. Knowledge of biblical stories is not necessary and people from all faiths or none will enjoy this."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"A wondrful story about womanhood and the ties that bind us. From the start you become connected to the beauty and individuality of every woman. It makes you see just how beautiful motherhood is."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Loved the feminine perspective of story. This author has such a beautiful style of telling a story.

Anita Diamant has been very up front, saying this is a work of fiction. Over the years, the book has taken on a life of its own and some folks have gotten their feathers ruffled. I'm a Christian who's actively involved in my church and community, and I didn't have a problem with this book. It was clearly presented as fiction, and I never saw it as anything different. In my opinion, the controversy shows the superb writing skills of Anita Diamant. She obviously has made it so real that some feel she's trying to re-write history. Not the case. If you liked this, try her other book, The Last Days of Dogtown. More historical fiction about strong women!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This is a powerful book about the stregth of women. The charaters become alive and you feel conected to them. This is a great book for book club, especially of women. It has a similar feel to Pearl Buck's \\"The Good Earth.\\" It is one of my very favorite books, and I highly recommend it. These women lived over 2000 years ago and it amazed me how similar we are with them. If they could live through childbirth and the conditions of that time period, we can do it today, too. Even though women were thought of as less superior, they had so much more power than the men gave them credit for."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This is a wonderful book. It is a great mixture of fact and fiction, which makes for such a memorable historical novel. One of my alltime favorites!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This goes at the top of my reading list. I love this book, and I have recommended it to many of my friends. It was a gift to me from my best female friend, and I have given it as a great read to many of my other friends. It think it would also make a great book-group read.Highly recommend!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I found The Red Tent a highly approachable, entertaining, yet serious read. A feminist novel without bashing you over the head with it, the character of Dinah holds the readers interest while giving a unique perspective into well-known biblical stories. This book has a lot of depth to it, teaching the reader while it entertains."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This novel is a wonderful piece of historical fiction. I am not a student of the Bible so I had no preconceived notions going into this book. One of those books you don't want to put down."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This book is a story of Dinah, a character from the old testament that we know little about. It is the story of her life and her family in biblical times. There were things I didn't know about really, like the multiple wives and marrying close relatives. But it was in some ways very romantic, and sometimes heartbreaking. Dinah was a very strong woman.Also, I learned alot about what it was like for women when men were in charge of everything. But women were still a mystery to men, and what went on in the red tent was only for women to know.I really liked this book, it was hard for me to put it down once I started."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"It was hard to think that this fascinating novel was just a fictional account of Dinah's life. The depth of the author's research was not only readable but believable in every sense. Historically the Bible is in itself fascinating. Reading about Jacob his wifes Leah and Rachel and what signifigance their lives had on history as a whole is very well told here. I truely wish more had been written about Leah's daughter Dinah. The Biblical records were indeed sketchy at best. Here Diamant can only guess what happened. Her take on what could have happened is plausible. Reading about ancient culture in novel form sure makes for fun reading. I really enjoyed this book and actually learned plenty in the process of reading it. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Ladies, you will not be disappointed with this one. I do not consider myself a religious person, or into history, so I didn't expect to enjoy this nearly as much as I did. It was laying around my mom's house and I just picked it up. I had heard of it but didn't really know much about it. I was sucked in immediately. It is about the bond women have, the importance of family and the role they play, the importance of tradition. And unlike so many other books, it is really not depressing, but uplifting. Be aware that it is pretty intense. The story is wonderfully told, and the characters are so real and detailed, you feel like you are right there with them. If I could give it more than five stars I would!!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I didn't want to put this book down.It grabbed me from the start with my inquiries about polygamy as something I could not comprehend...when the four sisters (Leah, Rachel, Zilpah, and Bilhah) take one husband, Jacob, and all give birth to his children, I was completely intrigued.One daughter is born.Dinah.And this is her story.I value all the references to menstruation, birthing, and motherhood... these are the ties that make us women.I value all the references to rituals, songs and tradition... these are the things that make the story so intricate.I passed the book along with a bit of sadness that it is over..."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"It may take a while to get into this story but it's well worth the effort. I read this book a year and a half ago and I still think about it now and then. All the women that I've shared this book with agree that it's the best book they've read in the past few years."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Based loosely on the Biblical story of Abraham's progeny, his great-granddaughter Dinah tells the story of the women who birthed Jacob's dynasty. Purists will be offended with the liberties taken to weave fiction in and around the Biblical account. I enjoyed it alot. The characters created are whole-grain women, intelligent, strong, protective, beautiful, ugly, sweet, mean, diligent and lustful, tender and invincible, victim and indominable, temptress and terror. A real woman can be all these things and more in the brief moment between kisses. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I took a long time to read this book. It was on my list to read and so glad I finally decided to read it.I loved the interpretation of Dinah and what her life was probably like in that time. I loved the historical lives of the women and the close relationship they had as women. My favorite type of book to read is historical novels and this filled the need for that type of book. Great Read!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I love this book. Diamant truly reveals women as sisters, daughters, wives, and lovers. Its everything I want in a book. It inspires, stirs the imagination, and captures the heart. I have read the book numerous times and listened to the audiobook and as I change as a woman what this story tells me also changes."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"What a wonderful window into the life of women during very early civilization. Very intelligently written and told from a woman's perspective. I couldn't put it down. Eight stars."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This is my review of the book. My review of the narration at the end.I read this kicking and screaming. I had put it off forever. I expected biblical thumping. What I found was the world of my older sisters and how they lived.Anita Diamant wrote such a lovely tale. Her research was apparent, but this was a what if. What if there was a HERstory? Let's let the womyn speak. In a world of many religions what was the story of those who were not men. What of the people ignored and put in jobs of subservience?It is a story of warmth and love. I found myself loving the characters; well developed, all of them. I admit to the tears that fell in the end and feeling sorry to see the end of the book.This was a borrowed book from the library and I was lucky to borrow the CDs simultaneously.Carol Bilger narrated this great tale. I loved her interpretation. She made me feel like one of my aunts were telling the story. Her voice was warm and told even the most obscene parts with loving tones. I hope every womyn gets the chance to read and listen to this wonderful story.I hope I can add this combination to my personal collection on of these days."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This was clearly a work of love! As I completed my literary voyage with Dinah and closed the book, I was compelled to whisper, \\"Well done, Anita!\\" I usually don't enjoy biblical fiction, but this was a gift from a friend years ago, and I'm clearing my bookshelves, getting ready to downsize, so I read it. I'm very happy that I did! Anita Diamant chose a minor character from the Old Testament and fleshed her out into a fascinating woman well worth knowing. Beautifully and poetically written, I was caught up in the tale on the first page."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"The author of The Red Tent interprets the life of Dinah, the only daughter of Jacob, and her journey through womanhood. Taking what little we know about Dinah from the Old Testament, the author expands on her life and the struggles she had to push through while growing up in a male-dominated society. People do not have to be experts on the Bible to comprehend and enjoy this book. The Red Tent gives insight to the lives of people in Biblical times. Throughout reading this book, the author's words encompassed me and made me feel like I was part of the story. Dinah desired to enter the red tent at an early age; a place where menstruation, birth, and all feminine issues collided. The feelings of enjoyment play out through various parts of the book. The author has a way of describing important parts of the novel in such detail that readers are sure to remember this book wherever they go. The author's intriguing writing ability will make any skeptical person passionate about this novel. As a young woman, I am drawn to the different perspectives and troubles of feminism. Dinah deals with multiple incidents where she is forced to let go and forget. The Red Tent can easily be applied to modern day life in which we must learn to overcome challenges no matter what the cost. The author demonstrates the true meaning of living, through Dinah in this novel. The Red Tent is an amazing book that inspires and entertains women of all ages."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"The Red Tent will take you back in time. The story is so vivid and compelling that you feel you are right there experiencing it all. You feel every emotion of every character. The landscape so realistic and mesmorizing you will actually see a vivid picture in your mind. Excellent story. Worth every moment. I was transfixed. The Red Tent is one of those books you come back to time and time again and each time you get something more out of it. Anita Diamante is a superb story teller."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"The Hebrew Bible (the Torah) contains a brief narrative of a horrible incident surrounding Dinah, the only daughter of Jacob, father of twelve boys--who later became the twelve tribes of Israel--and husband to four women. Though it is implied in the Torah that Dinah was raped, she never speaks during this narrative, begging the question of what actually happened. In The Red Tent, Diamant allows Dinah to tell her story, beginning with the story of her mothers and continuing through her upbringing, the horrible event, and all the way to the end of her life. While the book is technically split into three parts, as I read it there was a definite shift from the first to the second half. The first half is more like background information, largely cultural, and leading up to the event described in the Bible. What I would call the second half depicts the event, its aftermath, and the rest of Dinah's life, and reads more like a regular novel. While in most novels this much background information would get tedious, here is does nothing of the sort, and in fact is the reason I loved Diamant's novel so much.The front cover of The Red Tent quotes author James Carroll, who said of Diamant's novel that \\"The oldest story of all could never seem more original, or more true.\\" While I hate to be the reviewer using someone else's quotation, those last two words perfectly articulate what I felt as I read this beautifully written story: it seems so true. Having grown up hearing and reading the stories of Judaism's forefathers and foremothers, Diamant's novel brought to life all of those stories and commentaries. As I read, I could practically see each event unfolding, and had no trouble believing that it all really did happen. Particularly in the first half of the novel, I had fun trying to figure out which events were ones I had read before but forgotten, or ones from Diamant's own imagination, which made reading The Red Tent even more enjoyable.While it is probably useful to have at least some cursory knowledge of the stories of Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and Jacob's family, it is by no means necessary to be completely familiar with them prior to reading The Red Tent; Diamant briefly reviews each significant event, and even someone with no knowledge whatsoever of these Jewish ancestors should still get more than enough out of this piece of historical fiction (or midrash, the term for such commentary on the Torah, which literally translates as \\"investigation\\" or \\"study\\"). Keeping track of all of the characters might be difficult without prior knowledge of who they are, but this is really no fault of the author--the Torah is insane when it comes to names.Diamant's story is unlike any I have read. Through the lips of young, curious, exuberant Dinah, Diamant makes these lifestyles enviable. I never thought I would yearn to live in tents and travel for many days or weeks just to get a short distance away (though only short by today's standards), singing as I walk along with all of my belongings and family members. Beautifully and elegantly crafted, The Red Tent drew me into a world completely unlike my own, but one whose existence I easily accepted. Whether or not this is what actually happened to Dinah, this midrash is one worth reading.If Amazon had half stars, I'd give this 4.5 stars (because I liked the first half a bit better than the second)."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"So many of us are familiar with the story of Joseph and his brothers, resulting in the 12 tribes of Israel. Their sister, Dinah, gets but a mere mention in the Bible, and what little is told of her is of her shame, her rape by Shechem, and how her brothers avenge this. Now, we learn her full story, what it meant to be a woman in ancient days, how the women fit into those Biblical tales, the story behind Shechem, and what happened afterward.Obviously, this is a work of fiction. But beyond that, it is a work of art. So many times, I have found a profound lack of female voice, and feminine story, in biblical literature and study, that this book is such an amazing breath of fresh air. I love learning about Dinah from childhood, something we are never privy to in scripture. And I love a behind the scenes look at what some of the other women of the Bible may have been like, as well as the roles they may have played in Bible stories.Clearly, a lot of creativity went into this story, particularly what happens to Dinah in her adult life, which has no Biblical parameters. But it is also clear that Diamant has done a tremendous amount of research to make the book as historically accurate as possible, and I cannot help but wonder if something like this story may not have actually happened to Dinah.I love when Biblical historical fiction is written in a way that even non believers can enjoy it, as I think that this story has been. I found a similar treasure in Roseanna White's A Stray Drop of Blood, so if you are a fan of that book, you will like this book (also, Roseanna has another Biblical historical novel coming out soon, so stay tuned!). This is a book that I can read again and again, and never tire of it. It is a highly recommended addition to the library of any lover of historical fiction, particularly stories with strong female characters."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I first read this book almost 4 years ago. Although it is at first hard to keep up with the names and complicated realtionships you soon find them to be as familiar as old friends. I have recommened this book to all of my friends and family. This book has inspired me and changed my out look on life everytime I've read it. It is a truly beatuiful story and one that every woman must read."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I read this book a year ago and now I a reading it again. It is just as wonderful the second time around. I really love this book and would recommend it to any woman."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"The bible was written and EDITED for men by men. This book is a wonderful look at life might have been like for women during these times. If only we could all still have a red tent, perhaps we would not be so far removed from the mystical miracle of our womanhood. I'm buying this book for all of my friends!!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Initially I was reluctant to read this novel...and now I don't know why. This powerful novel tells the story of Jacob as seen through the eyes of his daughter, Dinah. The writing is so vivid and colorful that you stop breathing, especially in the last few pages, which will leave you in tears. Diamant cleverly gives you a traditional biblical story but in a new female perspective. It is definately a must read and you would not regret reading it."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I read this book some time ago, but I continue to recommend it to everyone. A beautiful book about female strength in a very male dominated time. It was very difficult in the beginning simply because there were so many difficult names, but once involved in the story, I could not put it down."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This has just become my favorite book! Yes it can be explicit some times, but I thought they were appropriate for where the story was going. You finish this book feeling very proud to be a woman. :-)"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This is an amazing novel, that anyone with an open mind would enjoy. I couldn't put it down."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I loved this book. It's a real tear jerker, but a wonderful tale beautifully told. I would recommend it to all my friends. I enjoyed the afterword where the author describes how she came to her conclusions and got the idea for this book. Remember, it is fiction, and you will enjoy it."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I didn't expect a rehash of the Biblical story, and I enjoy books in which minor characters get a chance to tell their side of things. But there was something about all the \\"begetting\\" here that made the read a little slow. Still, I recommend Dinah's story as a powerful historical revision that turns midwivery into a talent much mightier than any sword."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"The Red Tent has opened up the Bible for me as never before. It is as if the women who fell through the cracks of biblical history come pouring forth in all their honesty and splendor. How can I ever forget Dina's journey and the sisters and mothers who joined her in The Red Tent? It seems that Anita Diamant has channeled this book spiritually. She had me at &quot;hello.&quot; The prose flows and weaves this family saga into a tale of men's violence and women's patience and survival strategy never to be forgotten. Everywoman can sing because of this book."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I thought this book was wonderful. It showed how complex the relationships between the sisters and their families were and just how hard it was to be a strong woman in those days."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I thought this book was amazing! I have bought additional copies for friends and family. It was not only enjoyable, but moving as well. I have recommended this to everyone, especially women. It seems we are disconnected from ourselves and each other in this modern world. This book reminds us of the beauty of motherhood, nature and the circle of life. Very well done!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This was a fascinating tale of fact and fiction. Mostly it was a wonderful weaving of a womens role and point of view we hardly hear or read about in religous books. Anita Diamant explores with vivid detail a women's life in the middle east the beginnings of the 12 tribes and the Mothers of the Hebrew people, Sarai, Rebecca, Leah and Rachel as well as the lesser known mothers. Hearing about Jacob and his son's from a female perspective is understanding who we are today as women and how we helped to create so much in this world. Pick up this book and enjoy."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"One of the best books I read this year and recommended to many friends. Although it is fiction, one learns about the people and times from this author's view. Different perspectives of this subject provides much to think about; this is simply one more. I loved the how this story was told."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I didn't expect that this book would be so enthralling when I first picked it up and started reading it at midnight. Anita Diamant does a tremendously superb job in the storytelling. It is wonderfully woven together and the imagery is so vivid. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I couldn't bear to put this book down and read it in two sittings. The rich details of Dinah's fictional life as a midwife, her husbands, and her hard-knocks experiences were engrossing and inspiring. I closed the last page of the book regretfully, not wanting Dinah's story to end. I became attached to the heroine of this story, who was brave, intelligent, caring, and a respecter of life. I highly recommend this well-written novel to fans of historical romance."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I found this book to be a refreshing change of prespective. I enjoyed what Jacob's wives and daughter would have to say if they had had the chance. It is a wonderfully written memoir of an often- misunderstood Biblical character. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Anita Diamant, man, I wish she was my aunt or something, because she is a superb story teller. Her book The Red Tent was completely well rounded. Yes, there were parts that were very anylitical and really dragged (her Journalist ways cutting through I suppose), but Dinah's character and the rich plot and setting really salvaged the book! Mrs. Diamant also had some killer analogies. I would recommend this book to any woman, I couldn't see a man reading this book and really feeling for it and enjoying it the way we women can. Its a cruel, but true generalization for this book. This makes me see Judaism and the stories from the bible and the book of Genesis in a whole new light! (considering the fact I never considered the stories, I never touched a bible until I read this book) No, don't get the wrong idea, this book doesn't brain wash you. It makes you enthused because your enlightened by a more in- depth femenist take on a bible story. If you liked Memoirs of a Geisha, you'll love this book. I only wish I could read more books like The Red Tent that took religious text and mythology and made it beleiveable and wonderful."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This is an outstanding book. I could not put it down. I have E-mailed The Oprah Show and suggested that Oprah add it to her Book Club. The book was riveting. I am a teacher and the book was reccommended to me by my school's librarian. You must read this book."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"When I started the book, I thought it might be a lot of history with confusing character names to remember. Once I was two to three pages into the story, I couldn't put it down. One of the best books I've ever read. After I finished, I picked up the Bible and was amazed that some events were spoken about. A truly talented author to shed light on the shadows of such a well known story - completely believable."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I read this book a few years ago, and have been recommending it to everyone! \\"The Red Tent\\" gives us such a revealing look into what life must have been like in the days of Genesis. Although this book revolves around biblical characters, please don't be intimidated. This book is rich in history, detail, and love. Anita Diamant celebrates womanhood and life with this incredible story. It is one of those books that simply must be read and talked about!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"OH WOW!!! Normally it takes me forever to finish a book. I read this one in a little over a day. I couldn't put it down. I felt fear, compassion, love, hope, pride etc for the women. It was so facinating from the first page to the last sentence. I am so happy that i read this!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"A member of my book club introduced this book to me so it wasn't something I had chosen to read but I am so glad I did.I really enjoyed The Red Tent. I found it to be very easy to read and hard to put down. Even my husband enjoyed it. The characters were interesting and the events that occurred were written with strong emotion. I found it fascinating to read something about the people of the time and speculate how they may have lived.I also found it interesting to refer to the Bible once I had finished and see how closely she followed the story. Our book club had a lovely discussion about the book and the loss of the identity of men and women in modern times. I really enjoyed this book."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This isnt a book for those looking for a biblical story painted a prettier way, it is a NOVEL, and as a novel it is breathtaking. Many biblical or historical novels I read fail to bring my into another world, too many anachronisms and such. The author has done her research and is a great story-teller."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"So many of the reviews written take high exception to the fact that so much of what is in this story is not found in the bible.This is a work of historical fiction..the author does do a wonderful job taking us into the lives of the women at the time and the beginning of the One God religion. Now this was a time where this \\"new belief\\" was not widely shared with the women - (this was way way before Gloria Steinam) and the women were left to their old pagen ways. Keep an open mind and enjoy the evolving story and you might even have a better understanding and appreciation of the stories of the old testement."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Anita Diamant has crafted a captivating read in this tale of Dinah, daughter of Jacob. Genesis 34 recalls only the tiniest thread of Dinah's existence. Diamant has, with a seer's vision and an abundant well of imagination, woven a elaborate, integral tapestry from that thread. _The Red Tent_ is an accounting not only of Dinah's birth, life, and death, but also a vivid recollection of the proud people whence she originated."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"The story was easy to follow and a great example of a relationship between a man and a woman. A true Biblical love story."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This book is awesome because it not only tells a lesser known story from the old testament, but it does so with such finasse that you learn about the culture of the time. Obviously, much of the book is fictional but it makes you feel like you are living her story and it opened my eyes to what happens to Dinah. It took me a few pages to get used to the style of writing and I initially was reading for a book report, but this book turns out to be a fantastic read and I recommend it highly to all the women in my life!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I really enjoyed this book. Diamant does a good job of weaving together accounts in the Bible, history, and her own imiagination to create a story about women and what their lives might have been like during Biblical times. To those reviewers who have complained that The Red Tent does not mirror accounts in the Bible, my answer would be that this novel is a new creation, based loosely on the Bible and what we know of historical fact from this time period.The characters' lives illustrate the challenges women faced, including their positions and duties within the society, the limits that were foisted upon them, and the roles of both faith and special talents/gifts within their stories. Don't read this book expecting rote regurgitation from the Bible. Rather, be prepared for an imaginative, rich, and detailed story set during Biblical times and depicting some Biblical characters. A good read."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Diamant did an incredible job in giving Dinah a personality and voice where in the Bible she had none. Diamant very vividly captured the thoughts and perceptions of Dinah while she faced her tragedies, her first love, and her relationship with her family, including her father, mothers, and brothers. It was a very touching novel, filled with wit and yet very clever. Diamant did a wonderful job."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"If, like me, you love books that really focus on the daily rituals of life in ancient times you will find this book fascinating, but if you don't you'll probably like it anyway."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"As a fairly conservative Christian and supporter of feminism, I am deeply offended by this book. The author takes broad liberties with the biblical family history of Leah and Jacob, and seems inclined to satisfy her own personal agenda. By doing so, Ms Diamant paints an unfair portrait of a society of women that are, in a sense, one dimensional; it would appear woman (or at least this one particular woman, Dinah) is prone to make life-altering decisions on the superficial characteristics of how a man looks. I am also greatly offended by the pagan spirituality that these \\"women of the red tent\\" supposedly protect, nurture and revere amongst a strictly monotheistic, Jewish society - hardly plausible but then again this is fiction.I will agree that Ms Diamant is an outstanding writer. I just wholly oppose calling this a 'christian' fiction as Ms Diamant has simply used a biblical text as her launch pad to a undermine and confuse a judeo-christian worldview."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"While the book was well reviewed by others I was disturbed by the lack of veracity of actual Biblical history included in the novel. The continual representation of gods and goddesses was also disturbing. When I read the summary review for the book it seemed as if it was a fictional account of a real woman mentioned in the Bible. So as a Christian I looked forward to reading the book. But it was not at all what I thought it would be. It was all fiction and misrepresented the main character."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I thought this book was incredible. If you're looking for a work of fiction that tells a woman's story, this is it. It expounds on little known women of the Bible and tells a richly woven tale of the secret intimacies, thoughts, feelings and reflections of what life was like for women during Biblical years. I love this story and would highly recommend it. I thought the audiobook was especially enjoyable because I would've otherwise struggled with the pronunciation of names I am not familiar with."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Why aren't there more books like this? People get too caught up in biblical truth, when really the obvious purpose of this book is to bring dimension, emotion and spirituality to the women of the Bible. After reading this book, I'm almost sad that I don't have a red tent to go to with my mother, my sisters, my girlfriends...imagine how much more intimate and spiritual our relationships with other women could be with such feminine quality time.This is a beautifully told story of little-known women of the Bible. It will give you a rich perspective of a culture that is ancient and removed from many of us. This is definitely worth reading and I would recommend it to any Christian woman!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"While I thought this was an extremely good book, I wouldn't consider it a Christian book. Yes, it deals with Biblical times and SOME of it may be fact, but alot of it is fiction... It's a good read if you can remember that."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Excellent. Although a little difficult to get into, once it got hold of me, the book wouldn't let go. One way of saying that &quot;life doesn't change&quot; no matter when it takes place."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I found the book to be entertaining yet it grossly strayed from the portrayal of the biblical characters found in Genesis. As someone who values the Bible, it was troubling to see many of the characters and situations greatly distorted by the author."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I almost didn't continue reading this book past the Prologue, which I hated from practically the first word. If the first chapter hadn't engaged me a little bit more (enraged me a little less), I would not have bothered to read this book. Having once begun, for all its flaws, I felt compelled to finish--but only because that's the kind of reader I am, not because I found anything compelling in the writing or story.Simpering and superficial, The Red Tent is of passing interest only for some of the cultural/historical information found within. Much of the cultural information is cursory, though. And often the text raised questions of knowledge and authenticity.The story as story is also plagued with problems of knowledge and authenticity. A first person narrative, the reader is supposed to believe that some of Dinah's non-first-person stories have been relayed to her by others, I guess, but the novel fails to generate any true sense of belief in that regard. Time and again, I found myself not thinking about the story but about how ridiculous that Dinah should be relating something she could not possibly have known. This is the result of clumsy writing. The central, violent action comes as something of a shock after half-a-book of saccharine writing, and is the source of what could be a powerful conflict (certainly it determines Dinah's subsequent life), but the prose never rises to the level of drama, certainly not to the level of tragedy, and Dinah is ultimately a character bereft of understanding or believability. What little Diamant accomplishes by way of making Dinah an interesting character is completely undone by the ending of the novel, artificial and unaccountable.I gave this book 2 stars because: (a) Diamont can write in complete grammatical sentences, and (b) it isn't easy to write a 300+ page story of any kind."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I really loved this book. I am not much a bible reader but this felt like such a believable story. I was transformed to biblical times and even sort of wished I could experience the Red Tent myself. It was such a lovely way to see women in the past and to take pride in our womanly ways."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This wonderful book just pulls you into the story. The details - such as describing the scent of lotus blossoms along the Nile at night - make you believe the author was actually there. It gives the Bible stories new dimension."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I really wanted to like this book. I assumed it would be a book of midrash, the kind of story telling that fills in gaps in the Biblical account. Midrash comes from a Hebrew word meaning to seek out, i.e., to search for deeper meaning. It is tacitly assumed that the midrash in no way contradicts the Biblical account, but rather reinforces its fundamental values. I am definitely no literalist, and I thought it would be enlightening to spend time considering the ancient world from the women's point of view.I got no further than the second chapter. By that time, the author had depicted Jacob as praying to multiple gods and masturbating in public; later, he and Leah snicker about having fooled Laban into thinking that Jacob was outraged over the substitution of Leah in place of Rachel at the wedding, in order that Jacob and Leah can wheedle more out of stupid Laban's property. I was so revolted, I gave up.I do not question Ms. Diamant's skills as a storyteller. However, The Red Tent should carry a disclaimer, of the sort printed in works of fiction, that state that the characters and events in the book bear no resemblance to real characters and events. The disclaimer for The Red Tent should amplify upon this theme and state that the characters and events in her book bear no resemblance whatsoever to the characters and events in the Bible. What a wasted opportunity."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Hmmm. Rating this book was probably one of the hardest things I've done at amazon.com, besides forking over my credit card for one of my periodic book-binges. Anyway, this book is fantastically written, bringing the Old Testament era to life with the sounds, smells, and even tastes of a culture that frankly, I haven't been too intimately familiar with but feel that I should. The language and plot flows smoothly and poetically. The book itself was amazing.The only problem I have is with the author. I grew up in a heavily Catholic family and had 17 years of formal Catholic education. That said, I would be the first to admit that I'm not the most conservatively religious person in the world, quite the opposite, but I have read the Bible cover to cover, several times. However, I had issue with some of the &quot;embellishments&quot; she chose to include in this story. I completely respect the art of removing a Biblical tidbit and building fiction around it, but at points in the novel, the complete lack of respect for what many consider &quot;forefathers&quot; and important religious figures is disconcerting at minimum. Many of these add-ons are cheap and possibly only included to boost sales, as they more resemble a kinship with Danielle Steele. I would feel differently if I knew that the author had conducted alot of research and found that these things (okay I'll say it, bestiality) were common back then, but if she just picked it out of the blue, I am massively disappointed at her slip from the respect which is due religious figures from ANY religion or creed. There is a large gap between coloring these figures as human with massive human flaws and issues aside from what has been present in the OT, and painting them as base characters from the latest trashy grocery stand book. However, this issue seems to only exist in the first few chapters, so it was more like a nagging feeling than a real problem.Another concern I had with this book is the modernity issue. Again, I couldn't find any implication or hint as to the amount of research this lady did, but nowhere between the covers or even on the website did I see any anthropological or Biblical technical references (although I could just somehow be missing it), so I would have to guess that it was minimal. With that in mind, the contemporary themes were unsettling. I felt like she was trying to make the exasperated point of &quot;times never change&quot; and &quot;history repeats&quot; and other such cliches, but perhaps at the expense of authenticity. Some of the actions and behaviours of the characters were a little too close to home. If I can say, &quot;Hey, I've done that&quot; in reference to someone who lived thousands of years ago, I have to be a little wary that the story hasn't been &quot;updated&quot;. Then again, I'm not a specialist, and maybe she is. Who knows, and that's the problem. I did see evidence of a greater knowledge of the culture behind the OT, so it's not like she's making things up as she goes along, just to clarify.So after all this complaining, why four stars? The artistry of the writing more than makes up for annoying details. I just thought I'd alert any fundamentalists or readers who are particularly sensitive about religious issues, which I can be sometimes, despite all my liberal-ness. For those with tough skin, this is a riveting story well-composed with vibrant images exploring topics and even methods of writing rarely seen.If the subject matter interests you, I'd recommend Karen Armstrong. She writes wonderful nonfiction investigations into religion, the monotheistic ones in particular. A collaboration between her and Diamant would be unstoppable and world-altering."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"The material of this book appears to be interesting, and the novel would probably be quite enjoyable. But the audio tape is greatly damaged by the breathless, over dramatic style of Ms. Bilger, the reader. Often emphasizing the wrong word or the wrong syllable, Ms. Bilger distorts the meaning of the text to the point where this listener could not even make it though the first tape!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Many people have written about the inaccuracies of the bibilical nature of the book. I simply found the stories of these women BORING and PREDICTABLE. There is no depth or realness to any of the characters. Each sister represented a type of woman and each of them responded to every situation in exact way one might expect. BORING. I did not bother finishing."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"As I see it, The Red Tent has four major strengths: (1) It's well written. Ms. Diamont has created a living world peopled with real characters. The prose is often nearly poetic, yet the dialog is realistic, dramatic and moving. (2) Second, the book often has the taste, texture and aroma of history rather than fiction. Ms. Diamont appears to skillfully weave historical and archeological fact with imaginative story telling. The result is a work of fiction constructed on a skillfully built scaffold of fact that feels like history even where it is obviously fiction. (3) Ms. Diamont demonstrates uncanny skill in taking &quot;silences&quot; of the Bible (where the Biblical narrative leaves off) and interprets them in ways which are not obviously contradictory with what IS in the Bible. Her ability to pinpoint such &quot;gaps&quot; in the sacred text and fill them skillfully and with imagination makes her novel fascinating reading, including for those familiar with the Biblical text, for here is a realistic point of view of what the Bible might have said if it had filled in those silences. (4) Finally, and most importantly, the overwhelming strength of The Red Tent are the portraits of the women who people its pages, most especially Leah and Rachel, Bilah and Zilpah, and of course Dina. Never again will these women be mere shadowy figures evoked only by a few Biblical references to their names for a reader of The Red Tent.However, the weaknesses of The Red Tent are also real and parallel the novel's strengths. On the whole, the men in its pages are far less substantially portrayed than the women. They tend to be one dimensional cardboard cut out type characters, even Jacob and Labon, and far more so the king and prince of Shechem and male characters populating the portion of the novel taking place in Egypt, including Joseph. Similarly, the novel's blending of history and imagination breaks down when the story line reaches Shechem and Egypt, the descriptions of both of which are more suggestive of suburban living in this century than historical reality.But another weakness of The Red Tent is, I believe, also its fatal flaw. This is Ms. Diamont's failure to follow through with the courage of her own story's convictions. In her novel she creates living, breathing, strong, sensitive, intelligent, caring, flesh and blood Biblical matriarchs, and then abandons them to an age-old male chauvinist stereotype. For apparently, Elokim, the God of Abraham, is the province solely of men in the world depicted in The Red Tent. Despite the statements in Biblical narrative indicating that Abraham's wife, Sarah, Isaac's wife, Rebecca, and Leah all individually prayed to the God, Elokim, Ms. Diamont ignores these jewels of Biblical feminism. Instead her finely drawn heroines stay mired in the muck of paganism. They are more interested in their wood and stone household idols than in the fascinating concept of an all powerful and invisible God, a God who is worshiped by the very man each of the four weds, loves, lives with and bears the children of.How could this be? Is it conceivable that woman such as the characters portrayed by Ms. Diamont could possibly be satisfied worshipping sticks and stones when in their own home is a higher spiritual alternative? One could argue that these women, unlike Jacob, were raised in ignorance of Abraham's monotheistic and all powerful God in the company of idol-worshiping Laban. But is it conceivable that not one of these four articulate, intelligent, spiritual women as portrayed by Ms. Diamont would show any interest in the most earth shaking spiritual phenomenon to touch the planet - at the very moment it took place and in their own household, tents, and family? I think not.Sadly, The Red Tent appears to be so enmeshed in defending a view point -- that women of the Bible are just as rich, full, complete and complex human beings as are men in the Bible -- that it steps right into the trap of handing God in the Bible over to men, staking the claim of Biblical women instead to idol-worship. The unfortunate but incontrovertible message we receive is that men in Dina's day may have found the imminent and omniscient invisible God of Abraham and Isaac compelling, but the women did not, and would not or could not strive for this new spiritual height. This is the novel's fatal flaw. Despite all of its power and drama, its skillful blending of historical and fictional events and personages, in the end, The Red Tent serves up the same old stereotype. Biblical matriarchs - whose rightful place is that of true spiritual partners of Biblical patriarchs, are instead left diminished in our memories as spiritual dwarfs. How sad! What a tragic waste of a powerful writer and story!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"For all of the readers who were disappointed because it was not biblically correct...give me a break! I found it in the fiction section at the library. From what I understand the very definition of fiction is not factual. The story was beautiful and I fell in love with the characters. It was an amazing tale of love, loss, tragedy and the beauty of letting go and moving on. I actually cried at the end (not something I do). I was captured by it from the first page, couldn't put it down and was disappointed to come to the end! I plan to read it over and over again!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"When I was about thirteen. my mother \\"Got Religion\\", and constantly nagged me to read the Bible. So I did. But I don't think I was reading the stuff she wanted me to read. Being a melodramatic teenager, I of course zoomed in on the vast violent soap opera that is the book of Genesis. And my favorite part was the rivalry between Jacob's wives: Leah, Rachel, Bilhah, and Zilpah. They seemed vibrant and alive to me, as if somehow in the few words said about them, their essence had been accidentally preserved.So of course I read _The Red Tent_. It's a novel retelling the story of Leah's daughter, Dinah, who is a footnote in the Bible. According to Scripture, Dinah was raped, and her brothers took bloody revenge. The hypothesis of this book is that it was not a rape but a forbiddden love affair, referred to as rape by Dinah's male relatives because they could not accept what had really happened.The most interesting part of the book is the beginning, where Dinah recounts the story of her mother and aunts, who were just as vibrant as I wanted them to be. They loved and envied and bonded in their lives as Jacob's spouses. And they worshipped a Goddess. This seems to be the most controversial part of _The Red Tent_. Everyone is falling all over themselves insisting that those women never worshipped any Goddess. Actually, if you look at history and the Bible, the Hebrews of the time were constantly going back and forth between condemning the goddess Asherah and worshipping her alongside Yahweh. It's not at all implausible that the women of the Bible might have worshipped Asherah in secret women's mysteries.Then Dinah grows up, has the love affair, and blood is shed. This part of the book is also interesting--sexy, sad, and scary--but it is very short.Then Dinah flees to Egypt. From this point on, my interest lagged. Maybe because this part wasn't in the story I knew, and Diamant was making it all up, or maybe just because it was less dramatic. Dinah recovers from her emotional wounds and meets a Generically Nice Guy. Blah. :(Four stars for the first third of the book, three for the second, two for the third. Three overall."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Although the story of Jacob and his sons is familiar from the Bible, Anita Diamant has presented this story in a very distinctive way. Most notable is the manner in which the God of Jacob, Isaac, and Abraham is presented: as being just one god amongst many, and a fit enough consort for the Queen of Heaven, rather than just a single old man with a white beard. Most of the other gods involved would appear to be either Sumerian or Egyptian, and were gods that were genuinely worshipped at the time (Anita Diamant has done her research well). There would appear to be a division between the way that women and men worship gods here: although Jacob does cry out the names of other gods when suffering from a sick stomach, he does increasingly come to rely on the God of Isaac his father, and Abraham his grandfather. The women worship a whole variety of gods, such as the god of beer, and the goddess of victory and fertility. Laban also has a whole teraphim of little gods, until Rachel famously steals them from him, so that her detested father may be cursed by their absence. Leah, for her part, declares that they do not need gods, only each other, but even she upholds the traditions of the red tent, to which the women retreat whilst menstruating. Having departed from Laban, Jacob and his family set out and make their way in the world. Leah and her sisters find that the traditions of the red tent are not upheld by the women of the different tribes that their sons have married into, and the integrity of the red tent itself becomes threatened.What does not seem to be important here is what gods are worshipped, or how many, but that the roles of men and women are changing. There have previously been matriarchs as powerful as the patriarchs - Sarah, wife of Abraham, and Rebecca, wife of Isaac. Yet Leah and Rachel are not given as much prominence in Jacob's tribe. Not that the lot of women, such as Laban's slave wife Ruti, is all that fantastic. But with the loss of their traditions, the potency of these women seems to diminish. Although the four wives of Jacob add to his richness with their skills, there is a danger that those women who are not enslaved, will be even more reduced in their roles as they become mere bargaining chips in transactions amongst men. Rebecca sadly concludes that Dinah will not be her heir at Mamre. Jacob, shamed to have discovered that Rachel did actually steal Laban's teraphim, destroys these icons of household gods that have been used to welcome Dinah into adulthood. And from there, things do really start to go wrong. But is this due to a curse of their gods, or because Jacob has grown suspicious of his wives and their ways, and now relies instead on his avaricious sons Simon and Levi for advice?There are some differences from the Biblical account of the same events. In the Bible, Laban welcomes Jacob with open arms. Jacob also wrestles with the Lord God himself before reuniting with Esau, but Anita Diamant suggests that his broken leg and fever were caused by an encounter with a wild boar instead (although, since Dinah is accompanied with Joseph when she encounters the boar, we are never quite certain that it is real, since Joseph has a tendency of seeing visions, just like his father). In the Bible, it's Jacob who gives Joseph his famous technicolour dreamcoat, but in The Red Tent, Rachel is the more likely tailor of this garment that Joseph's brothers sneer at. There is not much mention of a famine in Egypt, even although Zafenat Paneh-ah is in power there. A few of Jacob's sons would have appeared to die earlier than they do in the Bible, and Judah and Reuben are not as squeaky clean in the Bible as Anita Diamant presents them. And the last mention of Dinah in the Bible is \\"Should he deal with our sister as with an harlot?\\", which does not forebode well... Anita Diamant accounts for these differences by relating that these are the forms of the tales as carried down by the women, whilst Jacob's account of the same events is quite different. Since Jacob has only the one daughter, it would not appear that the women's stories will survive, but maybe the story of Dinah is too terrible to be forgotten...Some of the most compelling passages are the birth scenes: like Rachel before her, Dinah becomes a successful and much sought-after midwife, and Diamant has researched the herbs and the methods they would have used at that time very well. This is most of all, a highly compassionate novel - when Dinah leaves us, her audience, we are truly sorry to see her go, and that it a sign that Diamant has created a vibrant and powerful character. The minor characters also make a great impact - although her scenes are few, if ever there is a film of The Red Tent, I would suggest that the role of Werenro be played by Julia Roberts. If you know the Biblical story well, then you will know that there are quite a few horrors in store for our Dinah, and Anita Diamant has handled these well. But as equally important as the horrors are the delights of this book, and they are as numerous as the tribe of Israel of which they tell. Although this novel has been mainly marketed at women, male readers will be equally enthralled by Anita Diamant's splendid narrative. I have done an online reading guide - interested readers can contact me for this."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I enjoyed this book. At first it seemed to move slowly because there was more description than dialogue, but as the story progressed, more dialogue happened and the reading moved faster. I liked imagining that this is what life was like back then. The desciptions of the various places Dinah went was well done. After reading it I went to the book of Genesis, just to see how closely the story followed. I thought it followed pretty close. There is not alot of detail in the Bible, so the author had to use her imagination and fill in some gaps. It is a work of fiction, based on a a particular character. That's what people need to remember when they read the book. It is fiction. Some of the reviewers who have gotten upset over the book need to remember that these people are not Christians, this is long before Christ, heck, these people are not technically the Jews yet. So chill out. If these people were so perfectly holy (i.e. worshipping idols, incestuous, etc) they wouldn't have wandered around the desert for 40 years or (if you're Christian) needed a savior. This is written by a Jewish author so therefore it is written from her imagination and perspective."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Dinah, only daughter of Jacob, is only mentioned in the bible to tell us that she was taken against her will by a prince who wished to marry her. Jacob and his sons demanded double the bride price and then, rather than accept it, two of her brothers took it upon themselves to avenge her. This book tells us so much more. It is full of names we recognise - at least, those of us who have seen Joseph and the Amazing Technicolour Dream Coat. Dinah tells us her story in her own words, the childhood dominated by Jacob's 4 wives, her 'mothers' who took her into The Red Tent with them where she learnt her family's history and their tribal customs. We learn of her years in Egypt and her meeting at last with one of her brothers.The book is very much a story of women and their lives. Dinah becomes a midwife, helping other women to bring forth new life and we learn of birth practices in that era. The Red Tent itself is the place where women go during menstruation. All women (except slaves) go there for the same three days a month, confirming the belief that women in close proximity menstruate at the same time (for example, nuns). I found the daily lives of these people fascinating and the story gripping. It is full of passionate love, anger, vengefulness and hatred - all the deepest human feelings are here. It's a book to make women proud. I would love to feel that it affected men too."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Well written yes. It is very very well written the author has extreme talent. But... Biblical no. Had I realized that when I purchased this book that it was only loosely based on the Bible story, I would not have likely purchased it. The basic story of Jacob, Leah and Rachel is there but many additions make it far from being Biblical. I am not sure what the authors point was to use Biblical characters that deviate from what the Bible says. It could have been a great book using other characters/names and not that it is \\"as if a woman wrote the Bible\\".Without going into the entire debate over the Bible, for those of us who are looking for a Biblical based piece of fiction, this is not it. You will be disappointed and there are portions that are sexual in nature, just short of graphic, although not obscene.I suppose had I read the reviews prior to purchasing the book, I would have known better. Her writing is very good, drew me right in. Unfortunately, I was hoping for a story along the lines of \\"Lineage of Grace\\" so was subsequently disappointed."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This novel was recommended to me by a friend and kept my attention the whole way. A very differentperspective of the Bible stories and characters, keeping in mind that it is fiction. It does makeyou realize the humanity and realness of the people from the Bible and the differences in the waymen and women related then and now."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I am about three fourths of the way through The Red Tent and I don't want it to end. While I am quite familiar with the story of Jacob's life and the Tribe of Israel, I absolutely loving this story as told from a woman's perspective as if Dinah herself had written it. If you have an imagination then this book is for you. Otherwise, don't frustrate yourself."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This is a fantastic imagining of the lives of women during the time period of the Book of Genesis.It demonstrates how women can carve out a slice of power in a patriarchal society-- even though their roles were strictly defined by convention, that convention also allowed for them to play an important, if secondary role.No one who reads this would think that it's ok for women to be subjugated in the manner that the book portrays, but it is an inspiration to see how the characters in the book handle the cards they've been dealt.The book is extremely nuanced, exploring all manner of familial and societal issues while maintaining an intensely personal focus. The setting is so richly detailed, and so exotic, that it warrants the effort of reading by itself.The writing itself has a matter-of-fact, flattish tone, which I found to be quite enjoyable. It wasn't as lean and fast-paced as it could have been, but it did succeed in evoking the \\"flavor\\" of the bible, which is a neat trick when writing a modern novel.As a white american atheist male, I suspect I'm not the target audience for this \\"biblical chick-flick on paper,\\" but I enjoyed every page, and wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone who enjoys heady, thoughtful books."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This book had me hooked and I could hardly put it down. It's fair enough to say that getting started can be a challenge with all the unfamiliar biblical names. Get past the introduction of characters and you're full steam ahead. Anita Diamant takes a biblical story, then tells it from the viewpoint of the women. Their secrets, their stories, how they lived, what they did for each other just to survive and the bond they all formed. I related very well to all the characters which jumped out from the page and greeted me. A well written book I almost wish she would write more about other biblica women."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I enjoyed this fascinating fictional tale of the life of Dinah, daughter of Jacob and sister to Joseph from the Bible's book of Genesis. It is told in the first person, through the eyes of Dinah and follows her life from early childhood and through the joys and sorrows of her life. This is not a quick paced, action packed novel. There is a lot of discussion of family relationships, the challenging tribal life, the various gods and goddesses, and ultimately love. It tells of Dinah's gentle strength to meet the hardships of life and is a very feminine centered story. The author does not sugarcoat the harshness or the twists and turns that life can take. I can understand why this novel is controversial. It doesn't give an accurate portrayal of the intent of the bible story, but I liked the rhythm of the novel and the glimpse into a woman's role in the society of that time. Although I was very moved by this story, I did not rate it 5 stars because there was a little too much paganism for my taste. Other than that, the author provides a compelling narrative of possible life in ancient biblical times and I will recommend it to others."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this fictional tale about women in biblical times. Women who held more power, knowledge and influence than even they understood. This was a time where many gods were worshipped and the idea of monotheism grew. Anita Diamant, choose characters straight out of the book or Genesis, but if you investigate the author's website, she informs us that this book was never meant to be a history lesson, but rather entertainment for readers. Definitely five stars worth of entertainment.This book, for me, had the same essence as, A Thousand Splendid Suns, Snow Flower and the Secret Fan, and Memoirs of a Geisha. All of which were engrossing tales."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I NEVER expected to be drawn in so quickly! This book was a great read. I actually find myself thinking of the characters like I know them. This is a wonderful read, especially women!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I'm a fan of historical fiction and found it fascinating to see how women of the biblical era MAY have lived. I think it's important for readers to understand that this book is purely fictional based on biblical characters (and not all of them were included in the Bible). I give this book three stars because much of it was somewhat depressing (chalk it up to the times in which they lived) and I would have liked to have known more of what the male characters (particularly Jacob) were thinking and feeling. I realize it was written from a female perspective. Still, it would have been nice to understand the males better. Also, the seemingly endless childbirths got old. I did struggle a bit to finish \\"The Red Tent,\\" but I'm glad Dinah found love and happiness at last."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This book was a rare treat. The voice of Dinah's character gives strength to the reader. In a story set thousands of years ago, we learn that people have always been searching for understanding and compassion, no matter what your beliefs may be. Pass this one along to a friend! I hated to see it end."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"It was chosen for my general fiction book group, and I thought, &quot;Oh, great. Another navel-gazer in which women complain about men and commiserate over cramps and bloating.&quot; Imagine my surprise when it turned out to be an imminently readable story about Dinah, daughter of Jacob. Granted, Jacob doesn't fare very well in this book, and there is quite a bit of general male bashing, but the well-written prose and clever use of a classic Bible story as a jumping off point for an examination of women's relationships in a polygamous tribal society make the book a worthwhile read.Caution: This is not a scripturally faithful recounting of Dinah's story, so don't use it as a Sunday School text, or the church elders will want to have a word with you. :-)"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I read this for a book club, where it engendered a fascinating discussion. What a rich, full life Diamant has imagined for Dinah in a time and place that we know so little about the daily life of women."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"First, I would like to clarify that this book isn't only for religious people or those with a strong biblical interest or knowledge. The Red Tent is a story that celebrates women, sisterhood, and offers characters that will speak to your heart, entertain, and enlighten. Each of the women Diamant introduces &quot;speak&quot; to a different aspect of the reader. This novel serves as a reminder to women in our fast paced, driven, and often conflicted society, that although our lives are very different from the women that came before us, WE aren't so very different and their stories offer lessons that resonate deeply within each of us. Ultimately, a real page turner -- read it over a weekend, couldn't put it down, and was sad when it ended."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This is one of the best books I have ever read in my life. I was spellbound by the story. I would recommend it to anyone and all women."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Ringing with a pure music that inspired tears from the core of my soul, Dinah's immortal tale of loss and forgiveness stunned me with its simple, clear tones. Though a glowing reflection of the biblical tale, this story stands alone and sings in the heated voice of an un-captured bird. Long this tale has endured, and eternally may it yet."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This book is the product of the author taking one &quot;insignificant&quot; paragraph from the Bible, and expanding it into an unforgettable story. It's the history of women; where we came from. I've passed this on to a number of women, including two who called me in the wee hours of the morning, in tears, after finishing this book. It's for mothers, and daughters, and it's very important to share."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I read this book in 2 days - couldn't put it down.

And what they did keep--and perhaps we've kept somewhere in our collective feminine conscienciousness--was shrouded in the Red Tent. I found her investigation of what might possibly have transpired between the lines of the Biblical stories a delight and an inspiration to someone who is also a writer (\\"Forever Retro Blues\\"). At any given moment it was difficult to put down. I shared Dinah's pain at the loss of her first love, the loss of her son. This was really a worthwhile read."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I received this book as a gift, when I read the back of the book and wasn't to thrilled about reading it.

How could I not, the story about a woman and her four mothers, whom happen to be sisters. The reading is easy and exiting. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I particularly enjoyed the first part of this book. I could not put it down. Overall a very interesting and well written book."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"An outstanding read from the get-go. Whereas it starts a bit slow, I was so mesmerized by the history of the era, that I didn't really notice. The characters are in depth and interesting. I enjoyed the contrast of this book to the actual story in Genesis, which I was coincidentally reading at the same time. It certainly gives the woman's perspective and makes you wonder what the bible might have been like if a woman's perspective were accounted for. It also caused me to appreciate how far we women have come in society. We should be thankful of the choices we now take for granted that women in biblical times could not have dreamed of! At any rate, a wonderful read. I look forward to reading more from this author."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"The Red Tent is an amazing look into a woman's life during biblical times.

The fictional world created by Diamant seemed very plausible, and the book reminded me that throughout the history of the world the contributions and knowledge of women have been frequently ignored and/or forgotten. Through its fictional portrayal this book reminds me that just because it was not written down or remembered, it does not mean it did not exist. To the reviewers who complained that its &quot;not like the Bible&quot; - the book IS FICTION, and, frankly, if you can't handle fiction based on what only some people believe to have been fact, then you may need to consider broadening your scope of the world. To quote - &quot;there are more things in heaven and earth.&quot;"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Have you ever wondered what it was really like for the women? What did they do? What did they think?

I'm pleased to say that about 1/2 way into the book, I actually began to look forward to listening.I had a very hard time listening to the reader of this cassette, however. Her style seemed that of an announcer for a radio ad. To be specific, she sounded like the voice for \\"Frugal Fannies\\" -- a discount store in the New England area. It was a bit over done...plus, to my ear, she seemed to have a hint of a southern accent, which made it hard to picture her as Dinah.I'd recommend the printed version!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"a very good book. i was hesitant to read it, but because i was uninterested in the other book i borrowed from the library, i decided to try this one instead. i couldn't put it down. i completed it this weekend and wish now i had read it more slowly so i could enjoy it for a longer period of time."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This book was recommended to me via a friend in a book club. At first, I was hesitant due to the nature of the book and my non-religious background.However, I can tell you that this book is the only book that has ever moved me to tears. It's the kind of book that when you finish, you set the book down and think about it for days to come.I have passed this book on to friends and women in my family and all have come back with the same response... &quot;phenomeonal&quot;. Don't let the subject matter haunt you, Red Tent is a story everyone can learn from."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Anita is an amazing weaver of story, myth and the nature of the human being- This book is a masterpiece."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I loved this book! It was given to me by a friend, and when I first began reading it I wasn't sure if I was going to like it. By the third chapter I couldn't put it down. I bought the hardcover edition for my library and I recommend it to everyone- it is truly a great story and a well written novel."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"A throughly enjoyable book from beginning to end. I would recommend highly."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I was not raised Christian or Jewish, and so I was worried when my book club picked \\"The Red Tent\\" as a selection. A few of the other ladies explained to me the basic story in Genesis, and then i read it.I found it very interesting. Some of the other women obviously found it more resonant than I did, again probably b/c I've never read the Bible. I do have a basic grounding in history, though, and I wonder if there was indeed a paganish, gynocentric culture like the one described here in Mesopatamia in the distant past. In some ways, the tone and theme kind of reminded me of \\"The Mists of Avalon\\" (feminist pagans in Arthurian England, suppressed by evil male-centric Christians) or \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" (feminist Christians in the early days of Christianity, suppressed by evil male-centric Popes). This was kind of \\"feminist Jewish pagans in Mesopatamia suppressed by evil male-centric other Jewish Mesopatamians.\\"If you like some religion with your fiction, try:The Da Vinci Codeby Dan Brown orRabid: A Novelby T.K. Kenyon.Minna"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"\\"If you want to understand any woman you must first ask about her mother and then listen carefully.\\"Very interesting book about the lives and customs around 1402 BC in Hebron, where Jacob (the protagonist's father) and his progeny lived. The famous one in the Old Testament is Joseph and his coat of many colours, the gripping story is about Dinah, the only daughter.Sad, tragic, painful, but very well written and absorbing."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I, like many other reviewers, loved this book for its supreme richness and depth. But one of the ABSOLUTE best qualities of this book has to be the meticulous details Diamant writes surrounding women, menstruation, and, especially, BIRTH. I believe the experience of birth in America today is being lost ... so many women are too focused on the pain of birth and they are terrified of how it will feel, etc. I also believe that this perception is reinforced by popular media, by what a birth is \\"supposed\\" to look, sound and feel like. Books like Diamant's, however, seek to break that trend. Birth is presented as a joyous and miraculous event. Whether modern women like to admit that or not, birth is very closely connected with death, as Diamant drives home several times. Because of this important facet of the book, I did NOT find any of the graphic descriptions unnecessary or over-the-top, as some other readers did. A caveat: I have recently given birth, and I'm wondering if that made this book resonate with me more. A year ago, I may not have had the same emotional response. I encourage all women to read this book, and all women who choose to have children to embrace the birth process for the holy experience that it is ... not something to be drugged for and forgotten about."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"The Red Tent is a book I've been putting off to read as the story line just didn't really appeal to me. As much as I dearly cherish the Bible, Old Testament charactors were always dry for me and I have stuck to reading mostly the New Testament. I decided to give it a try and boy, was I in for a surprise. The Red Tent brings these Old Testament figures off the dusty shelves of history and brings new life to them as I never could have imagined. Although this is a fictional account and creative liberties have been taken, I look at the Jacob and Rachel story in a whole new light. An amazing story that journeys into the hearts of women, revealing the joys, pains and heartache we all suffer through life. My eyes were filled with tears as I turned the last page and finished the incredbile saga of Dinah."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This book's descriptions of women's attitudes towards the men were amusing (they smell,are hairy,and increasing the herd and other assets is a man's main goal in life), and probably are not too far from the truth. As a Christian, I really enjoyed it; but it must be read as fiction, not as a Bible study or documentary. Just enjoy it. Lighten up. One of my favorite parts was the introduction of a group of women entertaining the villa (camp, harem?) who sang in more than one note (the first chorus?). The people of the times washed seldom, smelled, and were real people who herded sheep for a living. They were a mixture of pagan and Jewish ideas (remember the golden calf?). They were not anticeptic, god-like creatures Bible studies sometimes portray. Perhaps other Christians don't like to think of Bibilcal personalities as real. I think it quite possible that with multiple wives totally accepted, the women were closer to each other than to men. Today's first world societies of 1 man,1 woman units are not the way it was in the Jewish culture, and still not the way it is in many countries. Yes, I recommend this book as worth reading."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Someone recommended this book to me about two years ago, and I avoided reading it because the back of the book made it seem really boring. I'm not religious and didn't really care to read anything boring and biblical. However, after seeing how many good reviews it got here on amazon, I tried it and I loved it! It's not biblical at all like I thought it would be. The writing is very lyrical and the story sucks you in without you really realizing it. And I found myself wishing that I could just hang out in this red tent whenever it was my \\"time of the month\\", because it sounds so sweet and fun.Definately a great read, the blurb on the back doesn't do it justice. Read this book!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"It was very nice to read a story like this told from a womans point of view! A woman adds depth to a mans story."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"A fascinating tale of women and men borne of Joseph. It truly is as the Bible would have read if written by a woman. It reveals many aspects of the women's lives that were before untold. (Hard to believe this is a novel .) Very believable. It has many unexpected twists and turns. A wonderful read, I didn't want it to end. Hope Anita writes another SOON!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I have 5 daughters and 1 son--In fact, my oldest daughter gave me this book to read. As tenderly as I love my son, this book explains the complex deep feelings I have for my girls intermingled with all my hopes and dreams for them---as were my mother's for me. Why wasn't the Bible written by a woman?"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"MY BOOK CLUB IS READING THIS BOOK, I JUST FINISHED IT AND I COULDN'T PUT IT DOWN, (FINISHED IN ONE DAY )I ENJOYED THE SETTING, ANCIENT TIMES, THE DESCRIPTION OF BASIC FOODS AND DRESSES, THE CHARACTERS, THE FACT THAT WOMEN WERE SO CLOSED TOGETHER IN MANY ASPECTS, CHILDHOOD, WOMANHOOD, CHILD REARING, BREASTFEEDING, SISTERHOOD, AND THE IMPORTANCE OF WOMEN AS MIDWIFE. IT TOUCHES UPON HAPPY LIFES AND LOVE, THE RESILIENCE OF THE HUMAN SPIRIT AND THE DEALING WITH MISFORTUNE. A GOOD BOOK."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Of the many problems I have with religion is that women seemingly had no place. I've tried the Bible and I got tired of women being relegated to role of wife and mother. While Diamant's book has no shortage of that (probably because it's true), she manages to showcase the strength of the women of this novel. I was craving a feminist view of a Biblical society, and Diamant's book quenched that desire. It's a wonderful story!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This was one of the most enjoyable books that I have read in a long time. Anita Diamant took a biblical storyline and wove a fictional storyline about Dinah, the daughter of Leah and Jacob. Dinah was given minor attention in the book of Geneis, but in The Red Tent, Dinah is given a respective platform to tell her engrossing tale. Dinah's story shed a new perspective on the traditional story of Dinah and her forefathers and foremothers. The sisterhood of women is strongly developed in this story. I would recomment this book to anyone who grew up on the stories of the bible as a child, and now gets a chance to view the stories from a more adult and female angle."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Loosen up your Bible ideas here - you'll be reading a familiar story, fleshed in with amazing detail. Who can say it is or isn't the way it was? This very interesting story of Dinah, the despoiled daughter of Jacob, takes the Genesis account of her rape and the revenge her brothers enacted and gives us a beginning and an end for her life. It is really a window on women in ancient Cannaan and Egypt and makes great reading."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I read it, and then immediately re-read it. This book is a fascinating look at ancient history, and at the history of women in particular. Diamant's Dinah and her mothers/aunts let the men follow the patriarchal God of Jacob and Isaac, yet kept the ancient matriarchal views of the Earth Mother alive in the red tent, where the women of all walks of life, retired every new moon and for births.A highly recommended book for anyone interested in philosophy, history and new perspectives on biblical stories."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"As historical fiction, The Red Tent has the potential of being offensive to some who do not wish to expand on the literal word of the Bible. The writing, however, is lyrical, and the story of a woman -- a minor character -- in Biblical times is addressed with great sensitivity. Having lived in that part of the world, I was able to see many aspects of modern Middle East culture reflected in the book, and this made the book far more believable for me. I savored this book, which is not something I do often. I would recommend it to anyone, man or woman, who would be willing to explore its topics with an open mind."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This was one of the most wonderful books I have ever read. It was so exciting to be able to tie it in with the Bible and know that these people were real. It was so hard to remember that it was fiction. I found this to be a very powerful and moving book. I borrowed it from a friend to read but now I'm buying it so that I can have a copy for myself and to share with other friends and family members. I would recommend this book to any women who enjoys history and would like to find out a little about the lives of women from the past."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"One of the most engaging and beautifully told tales I have come across in a while. It colors the ancient world with emotions and scenes that bring the characters to life fully. It inspires one to rise above adversity dependant only on one's inner strength and faith in a higher power. I found myself eagerly waiting to be transported through this tale to a place of both simplicity and magic. A fast read that speaks to women, but can easily be felt by men. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This book is amazing in its ability to tell the story of Jacob, his wives, sons and daughter from another person's point of view. Not from a \\"man on his quest for El\\" view but from an in depth, personal, loving, and particularly, woman's experience. When I first picked up the book, I thought it would be just another story about women crying and being abused. It was far from that. It was the story of the bible told from another person's (Dinahs) life as she and her mothers experienced it. I loved every word, paragraph, page, and chapter. Awesome!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This is biblical fiction at its best, but remember it is fiction. The story of Dinah is based in fact and embellished with fiction and it's incredibly well done. This book engulfed me and I could not put it down. Stunning imagery and well developed characters draw you in. The story moves well and covers a good deal of material. This continues to be on my top ten list of favorites. This is a definite buy not borrow!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I don't think I have ever been more proud to be a woman than after reading The Red Tent. Diamant depicts her women with such strength and richness of soul thatI caught a glimpse of something I think I have always longed for."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I thought this book was great. My english prof. told me to read it, after we read The Mists of Avalon in class. I was expecting to read a book that would pale in comparsion to Bradley, but The Red Tent can't even be considered next to it. The book was very well written, and it wasn't an overly religious, of which I was afraid of. It was simply an honest telling of the life of a girl easily looked over by the men, but made into a doll by the women. I highly recomended this book."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"From a minor excerpt of a biblical story, Anita Diamant has created a vivid tale of Jacob's daughter Dinah. Dinah is the only daughter of jacob's four wives, and therefore the sole recipient of generations of women's traditions, stories of her mothers, and family midwives' remedies. Dinah is given the responsibilities of womanhood early on, due to a lack of extra hands for spinning and weaving and other such womens work. She is welcomed into the red tent among her mothers and maids, a practice which was strictly against tradition. But life does not remain so simple for Dinah. Her life takes on a streak of tragedy with the complications of her marriage.Anita Diamant tells this story quite convincingly through Dinah's eyes. The realistic feel of the story is achieved much through the characters' complexities. Dinah's mothers act as mentors, dispite the lack of control that they are givin as women. Her brothers are cherished playmates and enemies who fail to understand her. Dinah's thoughts of her family are just as complex. They are cherished memories and unforgivable beings. Anita gives us a familiarity with these families that is unattainable through the bible. She binds us to this matriarchal circle of women in a unforgettable way."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This novel is an enlightening fictional novel based somewhat on the teachings of the Bible. Throughout the book, stories of survival and way of life from olden days are told through the narrator and main character,Dinah, who was Jacob's daughter. Many of these stories are similar to, and have the same characters of those found in the Old Testamant, or the Torah. The Red Tent tells the stories of Jacob's four wives and sisters: Rachel,Leah, Zilpah and Bilhah.The red tent is where woman of all ages would go during there menstrual cycles. In this tent, they were pampered similar to today's spa. They also socialized. Once a young girl went through their cycle, they were considered a woman. This novel tells ths stories of each of the daughters entering the red tent.Throughout this novel, Dinah tells stories of her life and her experiences of growing up as a Jewish girl. She tells the story of her trip to Canaan. She also tells of many hardships she has with her family as she tries to find her Jewish womanhood. Dinah eventually finds peace, love and freedom, and most importantly, her place in society.The Red Tent is a great novel and I would recommend it to any young women and older women as well. In my opinion, this novel helps to give women the strength and encouragment needed to live as a woman in a growing world."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"When I first saw this book it was back in 2001 after I had lost my baby girl. I couldn't read it then. Then in March this year my lecturer at my Bible Class recommended this book. I felt that I could relate to Dinah. The way the story was written was good and it was a real eye opener. But then, read it and believe what you will. It's your door to understanding more about the way the Jews treated women."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Why it took American women five years to \\"discover\\" this book I will never know! I read it in 1997 and was enthralled by the flowing prose and the meaty content. This is a novel for all women of all ages. I strongly recommend reading The Ladies Auxiliary by Tova Mirvis (available from Amazon.com) in conjunction with The Red Tent. The comparison will leave you reeling, laughing and with a plethora of Book Discussion topics. Happy reading ladies. Catherine Lindberg, Santa Fe, NM"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I didn't read this book as a biblical history lesson, though I feel confident that Diamant explored these women more than anyone else ever has. But I read it as a novel, and as such, it was phenomenal. It made me feel blessed to be born a woman, and renewed my appreciation of our special powers to bring life, nurture life, and sustain life. And, most importantly, it made me realize the importance of women sharing wisdom with one another."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"the story line drifts off toward the end. While the first half of the book entertains with details of the main characters surroundings, especially the women's lifes, the second half of the book disappoints. Once the &quot;rape&quot; occurs, the author limits herself to broadly developing the main character (if that), rather than giving us more information on other characters. This book is a nice, quick read, but not very consistent."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"The book was in excellent condition. Looked brand new. Delivery was quick.

After reading it for the first time, I set it down for a couple of days and then read it through again. I've since read it at least twice more, and each time it is as engaging and captivating as the last. It's a book I would recommend to any educated, passionate woman I know. My copy has been loaned out numerous times already.Diamant's descriptive abilities are superb; the world she creates is one the reader feels she's been to. An absolute must-read -- and must read again and again."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This book was a page turner. I loved it and it tells a story that that is so unlike the story in the Bible depicts. I thought it was powerful and it pulls on all emotions of the heart.

The author truly captures the deep pain and great joy of being a woman and mother."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"My mother recomended this book, and I can read it again and again with out getting bored.

This is a book that only a woman could truly appreciate. I enjoyed every second of this book and encourage women everywhere to give it a chance."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Historical fiction usually fills in around known facts. If you know Genesis, you will note many contradictions to the scripture. This was very disappointing to me and detracted from the story. Paganism is glorified and the fathers of the Christian and Jewish faith are shown as people who don't even like their own faith. If you like wholesome books, parts are not."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I recognize that this is a work of fiction, but it would seem that the author should be true to the documented descriptions of her characters in the Bible. In an effort to tell an interesting story, the author has portrayed many of the characters to be people they never were. If one is going to write a ficitonal novel about this time in history, perhaps one should use fictional characters. Because I have read and studied Genesis, I found it difficult to reconcile the information that I knew to be truth with the story written by Diamant. As I read, I often thought &quot;This is a lie&quot;. While the story was well written, I strongly disapprove of the author's inaccurate description of many of her real life characters."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"As several other reviewers mention, our congregational book club chose this book as its next subject. I found myself continually weeping at many descriptions, I also felt myself being manipulated by the author. I felt as if Diamant had an actual list of current women's issues (rape, abortion, marital abuse) which she needed to work into the plot. While she is a talented writer, the book might have seemed less contrived had I not begun to take note of and list these various contemporary women's issues to see how many of them she would eventually weave into the story. Yes, I learned a great deal about life in that time and I believe that the book was well researched. Nevertheless, be warned that you will notice every current PC topic in here and most of the men are w/o redeeming qualities. I still think it's worth reading and I'm glad I did."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"What a fabulous book! I could not put it down and once I finished, I started it over again!

The book focuses on the women in the community including Jacob's wife Rachel, his 3 other wives, and their children--particularly their one living daughter. The story is told from her point of view and does a great job illustrating the culture from a woman's point of view. Wonderful book...I hated for it to end!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Anita Diamant gives us a story from the bible through her eyes. The Red Tent is an amazing story about John and his five wives. At the beginning of the story, a conflict immediately starts, whether or not Rachel should get married. With a conflict this early in the story, you know this has to be a great read. I think The Red Tent is an awesome story that everybody can learn from. Some situations in this book may make you laugh and some may make you cry. If you need some inspiration in your life, I suggest you read this book. I give this book a 3 on the rating scale. I give it a 3 because I think some of the situations are a little too descriptive and the story could have a little more suspense."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This is a great book for women and feminists who like historical tales of strong women.Once I picked it up, I couldnt put it down. The story is mezmerizing."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I thought this book would be boring, but it turned out to be completely interesting and well-written."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I just finished The Red Tent. I read through Diamont's website and many of the reviews here on Amazon. My criticism is not based on too much sex, or historical inaccuracy or even Biblical inaccuracy. I do wish she would've given a disclosure stating that the story is NOT biblicly accurate, however, in order to save others from believing a twisted form of the real story. Hopefully nobody embarrasses themselves by getting into a discussion with a real Bible scholar. But never the less, my criticism has to do with her slant on the God of the Hebrews and the God of the Christians as He is one and the same. There's no reason to doubt the paganism that was prevalent in the culture in the land of the Chaldeans who were Abraham's people and therefore Rebecca's, Rachel's, etc...cultural paganism that was Abraham's own practice until he was called out by God to purify himself from that life and disciple his family in the ways of the One True God. There was also much paganism in the land of Canaan where the descendants of Abraham spent much of their time prior to moving to Egypt and eventually becoming slaves there. Who of us knows how difficult it is to drive the old ways out of a group of people. I don't doubt that it was challenging for Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, but I do believe that they were successful after all Jacob is the father of the people of Israel. There's no reason to be so upset over the displays of sex for we do not know exactly what was considered to be permissible sexual behavior in a culture ruled by false gods as was the culture they were living in...and I think we all know how difficult it is to be IN the world and not OF it. And, by the way, they were FALSE gods not OTHER gods regardless of how SHE interprets the 10 Commandments. She wasn't writing a documentary or a history book, so I really don't care that much what was and what was not accurate in that respect. Though, I might add, a good writer even of fiction should go through the painstaking work of ensuring that her work is historically accurate since it will be assumed by her readers. And quite frankly, God created sex to be passionately enjoyed as long as it's within the parameters of a covenant marriage between a man and a woman in the privacy of their marriage bed. Still, what left me with a bad taste in my mouth, was, as I said, how our God was portrayed. It makes me wonder if her changes to scripture could have been on purpose to color the readers' opinion of God Himself. God, who is holy and righteous and unable to tolerate sin, yet willing to go to the greatest lengths to forgive mankind because of His love for all of us came across as being brutal by her point of view...as vicious as a wild boar. Her portrayal, instead, glorified false gods, sexual perversion, ancient mysticism and most importantly unforgiveness...something that goes against the nature of our God. Just because SHE couldn't see how the main characters who were so offended in the story could ever find forgiveness doesn't mean that they actually nurtured bitterness until the day they died. I would be the first to say that even the greats of the Old Testament had many, many faults, but that was in spite of the God they followed. I give Him glory for how longsuffering and forgiving He truly is and am amazed by it more and more every day. The murderous acts of Jacob's sons were not because of God, but because of their own sinful flesh. But Diamant wrote the story with such a twist it was as if she were saying that it was their God who caused them to do such an abomination. I fear that those who do not know God for who He is have probably been and will continue to be misled by this work of fiction. Scripture makes it clear that Joseph forgave his family. Though its true that nothing of forgiveness is mentioned on the part of Dinah, the point of the historical true story found in Genesis is that God forgives even the most abominable of sins and so we should as well, or at least be amazed by His forgiveness and accept it with thanksgiving since we are all in need of it. I do believe her writing is highly entertaining, but the lump that grew in my stomach as I read more and more of her interpretation of the One True God left me feeling mournful for how she blasphemed His Name, even assigning Him the generic name of El which is unheard of among orthodox Jews. I would give it no stars for that, but the system wont let me. I do pray that the author will someday come to know the personal, loving, and righteous God of the universe since she claims to be such a scholar of Judaism."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I am sure this novel was surprising to some people who have never experienced any variation in their chosen dogma. To those of you who have, however, and especially those of you who have researched menstration rituals, The Red Tent may be a wee bit on the boring side. The character developement was good and I enjoyed the fact that Diamant chose Dinah (only mentioned once in the Bible) to concentrate on. I regard this novel as fluff reading, however. It is mediocre at best with so many other available stories to read (try Anais Nin, Julio Cortazar,for example). Sorry, but maybe a little research ... would lead you to a better buy."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"After reading the first 7 reviews on this book, I ran right out to Borders and bought it. I thought I would settle in for a great read over Thanksgiving weekend. This book is a disappiontment! It is tedious and boring. The writing style is simplistic, written at a 4th grade reading level.Sure, Jacob married Leah and Rachel. After that, the author made up this wife, that wife, and the next wife; all with strange names. They all bore children with mostly strange names. Next, they each worshipped household gods with strange names. Half of this story is an alphabet soup of names. If I was interested enough, I could keep everyone straight, but I am not.In my opinion, the author took a Bible story, plugged in some basic facts, and ran wild making up the rest.Too bad she didn't make it interesting while she was at it!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"A vacuous hypothesis based on Biblical times. The book is without any real story, no depth and lacking in any intelligence whatsoever. It should have been published by Mills and Boon."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"OK I admit it! I was fooled by the jacket cover and the many positive reviews. I should have read the negative reviews here first. I have learned my lesson!I was thinking I was buying a historical (biblical based) fiction. WRONG!I probably shouldn't rate this as I am not a fan of romance novels; I am not putting down the genre, it is just not for me. But I do wish it would be appropriately placed in the bookshelves.This novel is unabashedly a ROMANCE novel."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This book is a very hard read. To many names to remember.

But lost track of people.Queen."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This novel, based on Biblical facts, was recommended by someone in my Bible study. An excellent depiction of the role women played in Bible history.Created an understanding of some of the mystical practices of that time."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"It was an interesting story and very well written. And it certainly was historical FICTION....i think the only thing historical about it was the fact that they used biblical names and places. Dinah was raped, not fell in love and had pre marital sex. I think that alone is an injustice to the real Dinah, to be raped and then have the idea put into the minds of those who read the book that she might have consented. how horrible!! I had to go back and re read the actual account from the bible and while reading the book had to keep reminding myself that it was total make believe, because boy! does it get your feeling stirring!! For the bible believing christian this is a dangerous book to read. For those who aren't, I believe this would be an excelent read."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This was a fine book... but NOT up to the hype!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"\\"The Red Tent\\" is a story of Dinah (Dee-nah) and her family. Parts of this story are pretty barbaric and bloody, having its roots in The Old Testament's Book of Genesis.The beginning of the book introduces us to the idea of the red tent where we learn of its function as it relates to women. For example, the red tent is a place for women to gather and share their experiences, both personal and practical. Not only is history passed on within the confines of the red tent, but also the opportunity for learning is availed. Stories are told and songs are sung. The red tent is a place of childbirth and a gathering place for women's \\"monthly rites\\".While I like the female support the red tent provided, the writing of Diamant is sometimes pretty graphic and repetitive.The middle part of the book expands upon the complicated relationships between Dinah and her several mothers, her siblings, and her changing, tumultuous life.Part three presents an ending that brings things together for Dinah that is as acceptable as the time-period allows.For me, the story is too ruthless.--There is a helpful family tree of the generations that aids in keeping track of the many names and relationships."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This book is really broken into three pieces. You'll fly through the first third, start wondering what else can possibly happen in the 2nd and then be completely amazed by the turn of events in the third. Its a must-read for women and a great book for book clubs. There's a lot to discuss. Anita Diamant is a great author and really makes you love and know her characters."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I have just finished reading the Red Tent, it was it captivating. The story of Dinah truly makes you wonder. I found myself searching for more information on her. Diamant weaves a wonderful story of Bible history, fiction and ancient womanhood. This would be a lovely gift from Mothers to Daughters and Daughters to Mothers."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I was hooked after just the first paragraph. Dinah's story is so easily overlooked in the Genesis account, but Diamant breathes new life into it with her vivid characterization and descriptive style. Many conservative Christian readers have been upset by the sideways steps this book sometimes takes from the scriptural account. I don't share these concerns -- this is a work of fiction, and doesn't suppose to be a true story. Rather than being a fault of this book, I see those inaccurate moments and creative storyline as a strength. I actually wanted to read scripture more after reading The Red Tent, and my curiosity for understanding the subtext of biblical passages was greatly increased.Having travelled to Israel myself, her story reacquainted me with the sights, smells, and sounds of that trip. But beyond the vivaciousness of her storytelling was the story itself. And, oh, what a story. I so enjoyed listening to the author's vision of feminine life in ancient Israel. Hearing the women share their secrets, support one another during life's difficult moments, and cling together in sisterhood made me so glad to be a woman myself. Diamante has capture the essence of womanhood in this book, and I enjoyed it so much that I've passed it on to many other women (and even a few reluctant men!)."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"There was some mention of feminism and the depiction of the male characters as fools. That was true, where many were concerned, including the female characters. To me, that made them real.I have to admit that I have read very little of the Bible, and probably wouldn't have read this book had a friend not recommended it to me. I'm glad that I did. Although the book started out rather slow, Diamont drew me in with the characters of Leah and Rachel, who fell in love with a man named Jacob. She did an excellent job of describing the sibling rivalry between the two women, the clash between father and son-in-law, and the horrifying event that rips the family apart.The Red Tent is a tightly interwoven novel of female bonding, lust and jealousy, and family legacies. You don't have to have a strong knowledge of the Bible to enjoy this book. The fact that Diamont took a very brief glimpse of history and blew it up into a believable story shows how creative she is. I'd recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Yes, I realize that is partially based on a biblical character but let's face it she took a lot of liberties with the story. Nevertheless - I loved this book and was so sad when it came to an end. This was so interesting and I can't recommend it enough. I could just see how so many of the things she wrote about could have been possible. Please give this to a friend as a gift but be sure to read it yourself - you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"It is said that the story told in The Red Tent is like it would have been if the Bible were written by women.The main character in the book is Dinah. She is the daughter of Jacob and the sister of his 12 sons from the book of Genesis. We only get a tiny little hint on Dinah in the Bibel story, here in the book we meet first a little girl, deeply loved and spoiled by her mothers, the four wives of Jacob, later she is growing up to be a strong woman, living in a remarkable period of early history.The Red Tent tells a story of bounds between women, strong women in a society where the most important is to be a man, a strong man. Anita Diamant tells us a story it is easy to believe in. It could all have happend this way. Her pen make this period of history glow, the storytelling is so rich and the people come alive even in our world of 2001.Thank you Anita Diamant for giving me this story, reading the first books in the Bibel will never be the same for me after this. You have helped me to start using my imagination to read the story behind the story.Britt Arnhild Lindland"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I could not put this book down! I found myself reading it in the middle of the day - completely neglecting my children, husband, and dog! Despite some of the innaccuracies I found it to be a compelling novel that pulled you into a different time and place, the same way Memoirs of a Geisha did."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I couldn't put this book down. At first I hesitated about the possbility of a religious slant but the first few pages had me hooked. I enjoyed every word. I don't think it would be a bad idea for this day and time to have some place like the red tent to go to. Of course I would like our tent to be well equipped with the best music, books, food, drink, etc. and along with a bunch of good friends. Hay, why not! Men don't want us around during that time with the PMS thing anyway, why not let them fin for themselves? All kidding aside, this was a very interesting book and I loved the way the story was told. I was sad for Dinah when he father died and I was sorry to see the book end. I hope the author will write more books along these lines, I would enjoy reading more of them."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"&quot;You who come to me with hands and feet as soft as a queen's, who are so free with your tongues....who want to hear my story&quot; ...thus begins the story of Jacob's only daughter Dinah. I was very skeptical when I received this book, it looked too &quot;touchy feely&quot; for me. I was hooked after the prologue. The story of Dinah and her four mothers was so engrossing I finished the book in less than two days. There is sorrow in the Red Tent (the women's tent), there is death, there is love and joy.The prose is moving, the story compelling and the end will make you laugh and cry at the same time.Read the book!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"If I died tomorrow, I'd be satisfied with the Red Tent being the last literary piece of material to have crossed my eyes, imagination and soul. Dinah (Anita Diamant) says/writes a little about death and love in the end of this novel - basically, there is no shame in death, it would only be a shame to not have read this book before that circumstance befalls you."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I was very hesitant to read this book because I am not a religious person and am not at all familiar with the Bible. My original hesitation from reading this was also a fear that the story would \\"preach\\" to me.I instead found a great, fictionalized interpretation of Jacob's family - his daughter Dinah in particular. I had to keep reminding myself throughout reading that this was a novel, and not a true story. I can honestly say that the best part of this book was the fact that I was so in awe of Dinah, and how her story was interpreted in this novel, that it made me very interested in the way her story (or lack there of, apparently) was presented in the Bible.I would highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This book was recommended to me by a very good friend of mine and I really enjoyed reading it. Although it is fiction, it gives one a sense of satisfacton that perhaps this is how Dinah's life progressed-something the bible does not do. One thing that I did was to go back to my bible and read some of the passages about Dinah's life. I realised that, indeed, nothing much is known about Dinah, let alone any woman in the bible. In fact, most of them were alleged to be \\"bad girls\\". Anita Diamant gives us an imagination that we can hold on to, fiction as it may be. For instance, the bible doesn't say much about Dinah's feelings towards Shalem. Was she really raped? Was the sex consentual? The bible says Shalem \\"spoke tenderly\\" to Dinah. It makes one believe that Shalem, much as he defiled Dinah, was perhaps in love with this fine woman. This is a book which needs to be read with an open mind"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. The book tells a fictional story of the biblical Dinah, Jacob's daughter.The book describes how Jacob acquired his many wives, and the relationship Dinah had with each of them, including her own biological mother.The book is obviously a work of fiction, but it is clear that extensive biblical research was undertaken to write it. The author's depiction of events as they may have occurred is wonderful and tought provoking. It disturbs me to read reviews that criticize the book for not being in agreement with a particular faith. This was not the point of the book at all. In my opinion, the book was written to entertain, and it does just that.Another plus: Anita Diamant rounded off the positive experience by following through on the all the characters in the end."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"What a great way to combine imagination and history and place it in a biblical setting. To take the outline of a biblical story and create such a novel was outstanding. Ms. Diamant did a fabulous job of creating believable personalities and believable events surrounding a group of women that we know very little about.My comment to those who closed it because they were offended that it wasn't &quot;truth&quot;: Open your mind to enjoy a great story. Reading this novel seeking biblical truths would be tantamount to reading Al Franken seeking the Democratic Platform. Go to C.S. Lewis, M. Scott Peck, or Phillip Yancey for theology. Read this for the same reason you'd read Tolstoy, Shelley, or any other writer of great fiction."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"The Red Tent is the story of Dinah, a lesser known character from the book of Genesis in the bible. The Red Tents illuminates what life was like in this early century for women. It has tales of love, betrothal, marriage, birth, menstruation and death.The story is told in Dinah's voice and begins with the story of her four mothers and her father, Jacob. Dinah tells of each of the traits that she learned and inherited from each of her mothers. The book then finishes the tale of Dinah's life as she leaves her family's homeland first by choice in search of love and skill of midwifery and then by revenge and hatred of the very men she called brothers.Do not be scared away from this book thinking it is all biblical. It is an excellent FICTIONAL novel that tells a wonderful story."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"While I'm fond of historically-based fiction, this is one of my first perusals into fiction based on a biblical story. I really didn't know what to expect, fearing that maybe it would get preachy or try to re-write the Bible in strange ways. I must say that I was very pleasantly surprised by the quality of the storytelling!Anita Diamant manages to take basic facts and weave them into a rich, detailed tale that gives voice to women. Her voice is the voice of the main character, Dinah, who is the daughter of Jacob and one of his four wives. She focuses on the lives of these women, the lines that are drawn, the varying roles they play, and the sacred times in the Red Tent itself. Her details are compelling and sensual.The structure of the novel is odd, though. Usually a novel begins with a harrowing, tragic event. In this novel, the tragedy is halfway into the story. Rather than settling down for a denoument after this, the story continues into a kind of tacked-on story in a brand new setting, more Egyptian, that is not told with the same surety and finesse. Just when we're getting used to Dinah's new circumstances, they change again and she is taken even farther away into a simple married life. Somehow it doesn't quite jibe with the rest of the story and instead of reading it because I was enjoying it so much, I found myself reading it in hopes that it would get better.Still, the book deserves 4 stars and deserves to be read. One just can't help wondering how great the book would have been if the author had chosen a different adult life for Dinah."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This is a fictional account of the Dinah story, which like most concerning women in the Bible, is told very, very briefly. So no matter what Diamant chose to write, much of it would have to be invented.I can understand why some would be upset at the changing of events, such as Joseph's encounter with Potiphar's wife. But I do not understand the hubbub concerning the male characters in the story.First of all, many of the patriarchs were loved by God because of their faith, not beacuse of any inherent goodness, much like Christians are saved through grace and not because we are qualified. Many of these men were polygamists, something Jesus condemned in the New Testament, and however you look at it, being a 2nd 3rd or 4th wife couldn't have been a holiday for any of these women. Jacob cheated his brother, Abraham prostituted his wife (to Pharoah b/c he was afraid), David used his power as king to sleep with another man's wife and have that man killed. These were great men b/c of their faith in God and their willingness to repent and trust in God over and over again, and ultimately to follow that God whereever he led them. That does not mean that they were perfect (or great) husband or fathers. Look at how David handled the rape of his daughter. One reader didn;t like the way that Diamant changes the circumstances of Dinah's \\"rape\\". I find equally disturbing the storyline in \\"Unspoken\\" (francine rivers) that has Bathsheba harboring a hidden love for David. The Bible says only that David saw her, wanted her, slept with her, and killed her husband to get her.Let's not forget that under Jewish law, a married woman who was raped and did not cry out for whateever reason was killed. An unmarried woman in the same circumstances was married off to her rapist.The Red Tent does not present a particularly endearing portrait of males, but why would it? Women were property - their lives were completely controlled by men. Females slaves cost less than male slaves. Any injury to a woman had to be paid to her male guardian. Men were never barren in the Old Testament (a few were too old), only the women were...The family trees only occasionally mention a woman's name, etc, etc...Deborah was an exception. Esther, well those of you who know your Bible history also know that the book almost didn't make it into the canon (not b/c it centers on a woman, but in part, b/c it does not appear to focus on God)The point of all this - in an unequal system, there is going to widespread abuse and of all the characters in the Bible, women were often the most vulnerable and didn't have the rights that they do today. It is unreasonable to suggest that a story told from a woman's point of view would make no mention of their frustrations and difficulties living in such a society. You've got how many women married to one man, and he really only loves one of them. It's not an enviable situation.....Finally, the Jewish nation was monotheistic, but that is after God called them as a people to serve Him. Before that time, they likely engaged in idol worship. We know for certain that some of them continued to engage in idol worship and hold on to superstitions and unGodly practices throughout the centuries, b/c God continually called them to task for it. How many times was Israel punished for serving other gods?It's been a while since I read the book, but I really enjoyed it b/c it was about women and it addressed some of the touchy issues that \\"religious\\" fiction often fails to touch. Of course, I am familiar with the Old Testament and I have read the Biblical version of this story. I also know that the OT contains many very disturbing and violent stories concerning God's people.I think that depending on how you read it, The Red Tent can encourage you to really think about the lives of the countless women who lived in Biblical times, but go unnamed or unmentioned."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"A minor figure in the story of the founding of the Hebrew people -- and let's face it, most of the women are minor figures -- gets a vivid reimagining in this mannered but moving novel. The goddesses, rituals, and dreams of the women of Jacob's household come to life as we spend time in their &quot;red tent,&quot; the place of monthly seclusion. Diamant takes her time bringing us through Dinah's childhood, and the ways of women (who mingled little with men at this time) become dear to us.When Dinah becomes a woman, and her tragedy (the only part of the story based on the Genesis record) approaches, Diamant's tale is shocking, almost rushed. Everything changes for her heroine so rapidly that the reader is left mourning a way of being in the world that she will never experience again. Part Three of the novel ties some threads together in a rather too predictable fashion -- Dinah meets exactly the people she needs and ought to meet for a satisfying denouement -- but her experience with motherhood is achingly bittersweet, and moved me to tears.There is nothing reverent in this novel, unless it is reverent to a mystery women share and monotheistic religion has devalued. Don't come to this story for an elaboration on a few Bible verses. The premise of &quot;The Red Tent&quot; is that the Genesis narrative hides and elides hundreds and thousands of stories, and makes the remaining ones too simple. If that offends you, you will be disappointed by Diamant's tale. But for those who would like to approach the schematic of Biblical literature with imagination and freedom, &quot;The Red Tent&quot; is a magnificent example of a very rare genre."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This was perhaps the best book I have read in ages. This book was selected for my book club and I was not thrilled when I was told the premise of the book; however, I was plesantly surprised. Such a richly woven story, it is incredibly moving and reminds us what it is to be a woman."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Amazing book! So far, I have given this book to my sister and my pregnant best friend and both have LOVED it! This book will lift you up. Not only is it an amazing account of women during biblical times, the echoes of Dinah's life resonate in my life today with richness and strength. Whether you are 15 or 85, this book will touch your heart and remind you of the universal sisterhood, motherhood, friendship-hood, womanhood and \\"being-hood\\" we all share as inhabitants of this planet Earth (think Mother Earth). \\"If you sit on the bank of a river, you see only a small part of its surface.

These Hidden Ways stories are great reading, they have an originality to them which I've found in most of Rosenberg's series. The only complaint I had with this book in the series was that the story itself was a little simplistic compared to the previous two. I still enjoy reading about this world and characters and enjoyed this book all the same. I hope for more in this series real soon and would recommend it to all."},{"Title":"The Crimson Sky (Keepers of the Hidden Ways)","review":"I'm an unembarrassed Rosenberg junkie, and my only complaint is that it's too long between fixes.I'm very fond of the Guardians of the Flame books but I think the Keepers of the Hidden Ways books may even be better. I think I have to agree with the previous reviewer that I wanted more of the story, because I do want more of the story, but I think that will be true for the foreseeable future until Rosenberg ends it.I'm not sure exactly how he's going to get there, but it looks like he's fixing to bring his characters up to and maybe through Ragnarok, and this is a ride that it would be a pity to miss.Buy it. Read it. Nag him for more."},{"Title":"The Crimson Sky (Keepers of the Hidden Ways)","review":"I truly enjoyed the first book of this series. The second one had, to me, decent pacing, and an ending that got dropped in at the last minute.This book has laggardly pacing; major activities happen off-scene and are simply alluded to, or brushed over towards the end.I'd rather have had more action and less meandering over the scenery, and less introspection on the parts of newer characters. In the first book, it was clear that this was a &quot;buddy flick&quot; -- Thorian Thorsen was the primary character, Ian was a strong secondary character. The second book brought Ian into the spotlight, and sort of shoved Torrie into the &quot;Dumb Blonde Swede&quot; role, which may be fitting for Ian's perspective. Torrie still comes off as being slow witted, if likeable.This book spends more time with the local cop for Hardwood ND than it does with either of the characters we established earlier in the series, and at the expense of the action in Tir Na Nog. The closure on the book feels terribly contrived, like it was done to either trim the novel down by a few thousand words, or because he ran out of time to write it before his deadline came up.The fencing scenes in it have the details more or less right, and if there are fewer in there than I'd like, well, it may change later. The overall plot is good, if a bit overpadded. The scenes from Torrie's dad's perspective are lovely. The homily on tolerance for homosexuality, while germane, and important to the author, came off as being heavy handed.All in all, I'd recommend it if you've read the first two...and I can hope that Mr. Rosenberg has more time on the next one."},{"Title":"The Crimson Sky (Keepers of the Hidden Ways)","review":"An excellent continuation of the saga. The characters are excellent, real people you want to know. I was sorry the story ended because I wanted to spend more time with these characters.

The one thing all his books seem to have in common is an upward trend in Rosenberg's use of vulgar language... all of which is unnecessary, offensive, and highly distractive to this reader.

Includes endangered, endemic and vagrant species. Beautifully detailed showing all local varieties, this book is Written very specifically about Bhutan Birds but, still gives information about where in Asia these birds range. This Book is a must have!"},{"Title":"Birds of Bhutan (Helm Field Guides)","review":"I spent 17 days recently birding Bhutan with a group and using this book for pre-trip study and identification assistance in the field. The illustrations were mostly accurate (with a few glaring exceptions) and the book was small and easy to carry in the field. Actually, I thought it was too small. I would have preferred illustrations of the birds that were 1/3 larger, knowing that the trade-off for that would have been a 1/3 larger and heavier book to haul around. Additionally, when I looked up birds in the index, plate numbers only (not page numbers) were given. For some reason the book's designers put the plate numbers in impossibly small font in the inner portion of the page near the spine where they were not visible to use in finding the page quickly. Apparently they gave no thought to the needs of the birder using this book in the field. Once I realized this during my pre-trip study at home, I marked the plate numbers in large print on a portion of the page where they were quickly visible as I searched for the correct page. Also, I am accustomed to using the range maps that most field guides include. This book indicated species distribution by listing the first letter of the dzongkhags (districts) where it had been found. This was not at all helpful to me because I was not familiar enough with the names of the districts and their accompanying abbreviations to use this. I did, however, know where I was in the country and could have utilized range maps effectively had they been included."},{"Title":"Birds of Bhutan (Helm Field Guides)","review":"Basics: 2004, softcover, 192 pages, 70 color plates of 600 species, no range mapsLike several other books by these authors, this book is a select, reduced version of their original work \\"A Guide to the Birds of India, Pakistan, Nepal, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Sri Lanka, and the Maldives\\" of 1999. This Bhutan book is a true field guide sized option that illustrates all 600 species found in the country.The plates illustrate the birds quite well and are usually shown with multiple plumages when significant differences exist between genders, age, or subspecies. These illustrations are good enough to identify most species. Each plate contains 3-14 species, made up of 8-25 illustrations. The plates for the raptors are somewhat crammed with many smaller illustrations, but they are still decent enough to work for identification.Like the Southern, Northern, and Nepal counterparts to this book, the text is the weaker element. Each bird receives 3-15 lines describing it. This text may not always be sufficient to differentiate between many of the more similar birds. Sometimes a line or two is offered about the habitat or distribution. The raptors receive the most coverage while the passerines receive the least (i.e., 3-5 lines). There is only the sparsest of information given for vocalizations. Many of the birds have none. There are also no range maps.Unfortunately, missing from this book are the several appendix-tables found in the three other sister books. Those tables helped to supplement the relatively thin text on identification. They provided a comparison list of the more difficult bird groups such as nightjars, warblers, rosefinches, and the Yellow and the White Wagtail.For Bhutan, this book is probably your second best option, aside from the author's combined Birds of India that use the same plates. A superior, but more expensive book is the \\"Birds of South Asia\\" by Rasmussen.If you're looking at other titles by these authors, Inskipp/Grimmett, keep in mind this Bhutan guide comes from the combined (but still condensed) Birds of India, which includes range maps. Basically, if you own Birds of India, you already own everything in this book. And, these two books all come from the aforementioned larger work that has everything along with extensive, in-depth text.I've listed several related books below...1)Birds in Bhutan: Status and Distributionby Spierenburg2)The birds of Bhutanby Ali/Biswas/Ripley3) Birds of Nepal, with Reference to Kashmir and Sikkim by Fleming4)Photographic Guide to Birds of the Himalayasby Grewal/Pfister5)Birds of India, Pakistan, Nepal, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Sri Lanka and the Maldivesby Grimmett/Inskipp6)Birds of Nepalby Grimmett/Inskipp7)A Guide to the Birds of India, Pakistan, Nepal, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Sri Lanka, and the Maldivesby Grimmett/Inskipp8)A Photographic Guide to the Birds of India (Helm Field Guides)by Grewal/Harvey/Pfister9)Tibet and its birdsby Vaurie"},{"Title":"Birds of Bhutan (Helm Field Guides)","review":"I took this to Bhutan in 2006 and found it good to use but with glaring omissions. The text is weak and there are no range maps. The illustrations are good but a bit cramped on some pages. I'd have liked a bigger book with range maps and larger artwork with more plumages for breeding and nonbreeding. There are no references to voice and the habitat notes are usually one or two words. More detail would have helped this book immensely. The plus is that this book is very easy to carry as it is so condensed, easily fits in a leg pocket on your cargo pants/shorts. Also there is good habitat information and bird areas at the beginning of the book. At the moment this is the best guide to take with you if you are visiting Bhutan though I find the illustrations in Rasmussen's Birds of South Asia as good or better plus it includes range maps though you do more searching as it covers the whole subcontinent. This guide really should be 3.5 stars but that's not an option and it's not four stars in my opinion. Adding range maps and larger less cramped illustrations and more complete text would elevate this book. Take this for the field and keep Birds in Bhutan:Status and Distribution handy for reference or range maps and anltitudinal range.Birds of South Asia: The Ripley Guide.

A must read. A wonderful compiling of heart wrenching stories that touch home."},{"Title":"Living With Contradiction: Reflections on the Rule of St. Benedict","review":"The first word of the Rule of St. Benedict is 'Listen'. This rule, composed centuries ago for Benedict's community, and continued by communities across the world to this day, is a powerful way of living into the fullness of God's grace and love. However, as the title of this text by Esther de Waal indicates, it is not always an easy rule, nor one that is immediately grasped and completely understood.The monastics and oblates of Benedict's orders take vows, typically being poverty, obedience, chastity and conversion of life (the oblate's vows are modified to reflect the reality of living outside the enclosed monastic community, but the vows are derivative of the same root). It is the last vow, conversion of life, that perhaps at the heart of this book. Conversion in this context is not a once-for-all, 'road to Damascus' kind of experience, but rather a daily decision to continue working toward a new kind of life.De Waal's first chapter deals with healing - we live broken lives in a broken world, and not just in the physical well-being sense. Using images from the biblical texts such as the Garden of Eden and the Cross, prayers from St. Anselm and the text of St. Benedict, she weaves ideas of healing, wholeness, and fullness even as we recognise our short-comings and brokenness. God accepts us for who we are at each point, but calls us to a perfection that we can never really attain. If this seems like a paradox, you're on to something.The next chapter is entitled 'The Power of Paradox'. The monastic movement has always had at its heart a paradoxical call to be individual (the Latin root of the word monastic is mono, meaning 'one' or 'singular') in the context of community. The Christian call to be in the world but not of the world, to resist the world yet work within the world, is another such paradox. De Waal illuminates several such paradoxes, including the primary Christian paradox of the Cross, both an image of death and life, of defeat and of victory.'Paradox' is sometimes considered a fancy word for contradiction. Benedict's Rule seems full of contradiction, just as life seems many times. Benedict looks to today as the primary focus of activity and energy, but also looks forward to the future as the most important. Benedict requires a life of service to others and the practice of hospitality, but also emphasises the need for solitude and withdraw from the world.De Waal explores through the Rule of Benedict what it means to live with oneself, living with others in community, living in the world, and being both together and apart. Each person is endowed with gifts and graces, and has the potential for us to see Christ in them, if we will be attentive ('listen') and lose ourselves that we might also be Christ-like for the sake of others.Contradictions that de Waal highlights include the difference between desert and marketplace (the early Desert Fathers were never quite as removed from the world as they might have wanted; the marketplace is not an 'unholy' or 'ungodly' place necessarily, for St. Paul often did his teaching while plying his trade as a tent-maker in the marketplace). Whichever avenue is taken, desert or marketplace, de Waal emphasises the necessity of prayer as an anchor - de Waal uses the example of Thomas Merton, a man in solitary prayer also completely involved with the world at large.Saying 'yes' to the call of Benedict, to live a spiritual life, to live a life in the tensions of the contradictions, is never a simple intellectual assent, but rather one that has to come with the complete person, body and soul. It has to do with recognising the paschal mystery as both folly and wisdom, and recognising ourselves as having to always repeat the yes. According to de Waal, echoing the idea of conversion of life being an ongoing task, one must say 'yes' every day, repeating the'yes' and asking for blessing each night, and passing on the task to oneself and to others on a constant basis.De Waal's reflections are not simple and easy. A small-format book, if one were reading for the words alone, the text could be completed in a matter of an hour or two, but this would be to lose the richness of Benedict's (and de Waal's) insights and images. This is a book for longer-term meditation, to be read as lectio divina, to be read for inspirational guidance, to be taken in small pieces like rich chocolates, to be savoured and appreciated slowly for the full experience."},{"Title":"Living With Contradiction: Reflections on the Rule of St. Benedict","review":"Initially I was put off from the book until I realized that it contains not a straight narrative bu a series of meditations by the author of how an introduction to St. Benedict and his monastic rule helped her in her faith. It is a book to read slowly and reread."},{"Title":"Translation Power Subversion (Topics in Translation, 8)","review":"Translation, Power, Subversion, an anthology of essays concerned with the political implications of translation and translation studies is an eye-opening and in many ways discombobulating array of research findings. While there were some theoretical writers that I was familiar with. Bhabha, Said and Bourdieu not being the least significant of them, it was invigorating to be surrounded by a theoretical and pragmatic framework that I was, for the most part, unfamiliar with. Javier Franco Aixel&aacute;'s essay on Culture Specific Items was a particularly thorough analysis of those concerns and Bassnett and Carbonell's contributions went a great distance in exposing the colonizing and dominating influence of translation and traductology, though any easy solution to this tendency (or institutional imperative) was belied by Andr&eacute; Lefevre's explication of the explicitly conservative nature of canonization in literature anthologies in the United States.While the text would most likely not be particularly useful for a beginning student of translation theory and/or pragmatics, it provided me with a clear view of another aspect of translation and has started me off in another direction with my research in the seminar in which I am presently enrolled."},{"Title":"Where Reincarnation and Biology Intersect","review":"This is basically the &quot;Reader's Digest&quot; version of a much longer, more technical work. Thus, the descriptions of some of the cases are very sketchy. Nevertheless, Stevenson's reputation is impeccable after something like 40 years in this field, and you can be pretty confident that he isn't seriously skewing the facts. He seems to be more up-front than in earlier works in acknowledging that reincarnation is really the only plausible explanation for many of these cases. The book focuses primarily on cases where birthmarks and other physical anomalies match up with injuries suffered in the prior life. The book is well-illustrated with photographs, and some of the cases are truly weird. Put this book together with something like his Twenty Cases Suggestive of Reincarnation, and your theology will be sorely challenged if it denies the reality of reincarnation."},{"Title":"Where Reincarnation and Biology Intersect","review":"Ian Stevensons book is a superb scientific exploration into the generally more esoteric realm of reincarnation. He has collected over 2600 reported cases of past-life memories of which 65 detailed reports have been published. It is correct, as one reviewer claims, that these reported cases are primarily from Buddhist, Hindu, African or Native American cultures where such phenomenons are more widely accepted than in the West. But this is natural, says Stevenson, as these cultures more openly will allow a child to speak about a previous life without being disbelieved or rebuked as they may be in the Christian West. Young children are very impressionable and will generally suppress whatever his or her parent or the culture does not permit them to believe in. Thus, it is reasonable to assume that there will be more such claims in these non-Western cultures to conduct such studies. One cannot accuse Stevenson of not following a scientific approach (instrumental injunction, direct apprehension, communal confirmation), his book brims with extremly detailed reports from children whose memories have been carefully collected and matched with the data of their former identity, profession, residence, and the way they died. If this is not believable science, what is? If reincarnation is a new concept to you, read and judge for yourself. If you already believe in reincarnation, read and get more rational reason to state your case."},{"Title":"Where Reincarnation and Biology Intersect","review":"This is definitely NOT the best book from dr. Ian Stevenson. The author has lost his skepticism and most of his scientific impartiality. The majority of cases included in this book lacks strong evidence sugestive of reincarnation, with the exception of a few very good cases. Because of these good cases, the book is still worth its value, but overall it is not a great work. &quot;Children who remember previous lives&quot; is a much better book from the same author."},{"Title":"Where Reincarnation and Biology Intersect","review":"This is not a book I would expect to read in one sitting. The author approaches the subject very clinically which makes it more credible, but a little dry. He has included photographs to support his material. Very convincing. An interesting read"},{"Title":"Where Reincarnation and Biology Intersect","review":"In his book \\"Reincarnation--A Critical Examination (1996/2002),\\" the late Paul Edwards quoted Charles Darwin, together with other three well-known scholars, saying \\"To kill an error is as good a service as, and sometimes better than, the establishing of a new truth or fact.\\" Hence, Edwards tried to kill his supposed an error, i.e., the idea of reincarnation, in particular, the scientific lifework on \\"Reincarnation\\" by the late Professor Ian Stevenson. In the last pages he quoted Stevenson's testimony in a BBC program (in 1976); let me quote the part:Professors Cohen and Taylor regarded the notion of extra-cerebral memories as totally absurd. Professor Stevenson vehemently disagreed. \\"Memories may exist in the brain,\\" he said, \\"and exist elsewhere also.\\" The best evidence that they may exist elsewhere, Stevenson continued, comes from his own reincarnation research. On the question of the \\"storage\\" of memories he remarked that there \\"might be a nonphysical process of storage.\\" The memories \\"might be in some dimension...which cannot be understood in terms of current physical concepts.\\"In the last chapter of his book Stevenson wrote \\"In saying this I declare myself an adherent of interactionist dualism.\\" And Cartesian dualism is a notorious idea from the viewpoint of mainstream science as well as mainstream philosophy because the idea supposes the mind exists in a nonphysical dimension (probably, as well as in physical dimension during life, if not detectable physically). The nonphysical dimension for the mind is the problem because it \\"cannot be understood in terms of current physical concepts,\\" as Stevenson stated. The supposed interaction between the mind and body may violate the cherished \\"empirical\\" physical law of conservation of energy. This violation is one of the bases of Daniel Dennett's rejection of Cartesian dualism. Why hasn't any dualist tried to demonstrate the violation to justify his/her being a dualist?? Even the late parapsychologist John Beloff tried to explain a PK (psychokinesis), the table-levitation performed by the medium D.D. Home, without violating the law of conservation of energy! This weak attitude of researches of paranormal phenomena has been one of the reasons to keep skeptics saying what they want to say against any paranormal phenomena claimed by parapsychologists.And, in my opinion, the cherished law was violated a long time ago in 1907 in the weighing the soul experiment conducted by Dr. Duncan MacDougall. One may say: the 21 g of the soul MacDougall reported in his paper is a result of his wishful thinking, as the physics professor Robert L. Park criticized in his book \\"Superstition: Belief in the Age of Science (2008).\\" As a matter of fact no scientists, including Stevenson or any parapsychologists, have ever referred to MacDougall's paper in their relevant research papers or books (though if I should be more precise, there are a few).It is true that MacDougall's paper has been ignored for the past 100 years in scientific community. But this does not mean that his experiment is wrong; it simply means that no other scientist has conducted an independent experiment to verify or refute MacDougall's result, and this simply shows the negligence of scientists' obligation! If they believe MacDougall being wrong, they should show it by conducting an independent experiment. An irritated author, Dan Brown, fictionalizes in his recent book, \\"Lost Symbol,\\" a noetic experiment of weighing the soul, though his writing in the book (in chap. 107) is scientifically completely wrong.Hence, I would like to refer to a scientific paper recently published in the Journal of Scientific Exploration in the 2010 Spring Issue, Vol.24/No.1/pp.5-39: \\"Rebuttal to Claimed Refutations of Duncan MacDougall's Experiment on Human Weight Change at the Moment of Death.\\" (This Vol.24/No.1 is available from amazon.com.) This paper's conclusion is that (1) MacDougall's experimental results (of the four cases) are scientifically very much sound (this is confirmed based on theoretical computational simulations of the experiment to rebut existing scientific criticisms), (2) however, his result must be confirmed by some independent experiments by other scientists to eliminate any possible systematic errors, (3) if confirmed, this means that the cherished law of physics, the conservation of energy, is violated in human's Life-to-Death transitions if we confine ourselves in physical dimension and Stevenson's claim of \\"nonphysical process of memory storage\\" shall be justified, and (4) this type of the law's violation will not be rare but rather common in some psychological transition events (such as in OBE, dreams, trance channeling, alternating of personalities in MPD/DID patients), which most physicists are reluctant to consider seriously because of the involvement of human beings, who sometimes cannot be trusted in scientific experiments as a participant.Finally I would like to say because of my being a non-materialist that I do not subscribe to Cartesian dualism, because modern dualism presupposes the Big Bang theory & the Darwinian theory of evolution in the physical dimension, even if it accepts the mind in the nonphysical dimension. I rather subscribe to the mental monism: Consciousness comes first, not the last as current science supposes!&lt;Added comment on 5 Oct. 2011>In the final chapter (on p. 182), Stevenson wrote about how a rebirthing personality to select his/her parents. He wrote, for example, \\"In addition, we have seen in many cases that a previous personality had strong ties of affection to the subject's parents.\\" Stevenson, naturally, never speculated about such a case that no previous personality selected an embryo prepared by a pair of parents.According to Wikipedia for the entry \\"Stillbirth\\": \\"The causes of a large percentage of human stillbirths remain unknown....\\" \\"The mean stillbirth rate in the United States is approximately 1 in 115 births,...Many stillbirths occur at full-term to apparently healthy mothers, and a postmortem evaluation reveals a cause of death in only about 40% of autopsied cases.\\" Certain psychical knowledge (which is referred to in the abovementioned paper in the Journal of Scientific Exploration) tells that if no soul/personality enters into the embryo until full-term, then results in a stillbirth."},{"Title":"Where Reincarnation and Biology Intersect","review":"Dr Ian Stevenson had reported several cases of reincarnation-type. His experience represents the best scientific evidence suggesting reincarnation as a natural fact. This book is a summary of the best examples, presented in a small brochure, focusing on an intriguing aspect: beyond memories of a previous life, reported by some children (usually between one and five year-old), some of them present birthmarks in their skin, or congenital organ damages, that are related to injuries suffered in the previous life. Some case reports reveal impressive concordance of children birthmarks and autopsy reports of the supposed previous incarnation. Could it occurr only by chance? Or this evidence represents a scientific basis for reincarnation beliefs?"},{"Title":"Where Reincarnation and Biology Intersect","review":"Very Impressive work! This book is essentially a summation of Ian Stevenson's larger, more thorough volumes of case studies that make a very strong case for reincarnation from a medical doctor's perspective. As such, his beginning remarks can be a little tedious, but this is simply an example of how thorough he was in considering all the possibilities of the appearance of particular birthmarks in children-- birthmarks that correspond remarkably with the manner of another individual's death in a previous lifetime. If you are a skeptic or not quite sure what to believe about the existent of reincarnation, this book will definitely give you cause to reconsider. Dr. Stevenson has done us all a great service by helping us to better understand a reality that has been all too easily overlooked by western religions and culture."},{"Title":"Where Reincarnation and Biology Intersect","review":"This is an interesting book. Much of it dove-tails with what Rabbi Yonassan Gershom has written about those who died during the Holocaust and have been reborn as blond haired-blue eyed Gentiles. Except that Dr. Stevenson's cases seem to lose their memories of the events in their previous lives at about age 7 or 8 and Rabbi Gershom's cases seem to be forever haunted by their experiences. One other thing I found disturbing about Dr. Stevenson's work is that the majority of his cases are from India, Burma, and Thailand, where reincarnation has been acceptable many centuries longer than it has been acceptable in our Western culture. It makes it much easier to doubt his cases than if the majority of his cases were from a culture that was less accedpting of the theory."},{"Title":"Building High-Speed Networks","review":"This book falls far short of the claim of the title. It never shows you how to design a high- speed network. A better title would have been, &quot;A Newbies Intro to basic network concepts.&quot; The first six chapters can be skipped by anyone who has worked with networked systems for six months or more. The author chose to pad these chapters with discussions of applications (e-mail, multimedia), server farms, and very basic planning sheets. Chapter seven finally gets to FDDI ! But then the book proceeds to give short chaptered descriptions of Gigabit ethernet, isolan, 100vgAnylan (Is anyone using this? ), and ATM. Chapters 18-20 (less than 100 pages of 364 total) claim to discuss the actual network construction but, are no more than a glorified networking encyclopedia.

That completely ruined the book for me and, although I finished it, I never again enjoyed the author's company, but rather felt a complete disgust at the narrator. He seems to feel entitled to run as a bandit because he had a heart condition and this and that. I'm sorry about the heart condition, but that doesn't entitle him to run Boston and claim the finisher medal that so many people have worked so hard for. He talks about being inspired when he comes up behind an old man with a prosthesis...at Heartbreak Hill. It took him 20 miles to catch an old man running on a fake leg and he still thinks he deserved to be there???Curious how he never bothered to set a long term goal of qualifying for Boston and then running it, which is the respect the marathon deserves. Kudos to anyone who finishes a marathon, but run it for the right reasons, bathe in the glory you've earned, don't steal glory that doesn't belong to you, and for god's sake, don't write a book bragging about your pseudo \\"conquest\\". Qualifying is a necessary prerequisite for \\"conquering\\"; bandits only steal, especially when they finish an hour and twenty minutes+ slower than their base age group qualifying time."},{"Title":"26 Miles to Boston: The Boston Marathon Experience from Hopkinton to Copley Square","review":"Mr. Connelly gives us a unique and entertaining account of the Boston Marathon.

Highly recommended."},{"Title":"26 Miles to Boston: The Boston Marathon Experience from Hopkinton to Copley Square","review":"Never has a book captured the essence of not only running Boston, but mararthoning as 26 Miles to Boston has. The author's account of his run humanizes the event - and puts a face on the Boston Marathon like never before. In my mind any concerns with the runner's running status (non-qualified) are put to rest by the fact that the three greatest runners ever to run the Boston Marathon support the book with personal endorsements in the form of forewords. Also the Boston Athletic Association lends their own quote to the cover of the book further endorsing the author's account of the Boston Marathon. In my mind the Boston Marathon is the greatest race in the world. People come from all over the world to run in this event - some are qualified some are not. What makes it special is the fact that all are provided the opportunity to compete in the &quot;Open&quot; event. The Boston Marathon is not just for &quot;elite&quot; runners, but runners of all levels, nationalities and backgrounds. I love the way 26 Miles to Boston captured the special qualities of the race and intertwined the author's account and the champions' accounts of the race.

Yes, we were bandits as were around 5000 others who wanted to experience running a marathon in the premier marathon of them all. Because most bandits are not hardcore runners, it's a lifetime achievement that brings a level of pride and emotion that most people rarely experience in their lifetime.I'm so glad I read this book. I was a lot like the author at the time I read it. I was a treadmill runner of around 3 miles every other day. After seeing the affect the NY Marathon had on a co-worker, I decided to run Boston. Through this book, the shared experience of running a marathon as a sub-amateur runner, and the struggle to put ones body in the shape necessary to run such a long distance with no prior experience was terrific. An added benefit, which made the process of running the race more rewarding, was the connection to the history of the race and events that occur along the way.The overwhelming majority of running books are written to an audience of experienced runners.

Experienced marathoners, on the other hand, will be able to relate to mental highs and lows described by the author during his run.

Part of the &quot;Boston Experience&quot; is qualifying. The book gives lots of information of the towns and neighborhoods along the course which is great. Skip the author's acount of his run.

I can't imagine a better introduction to subject. It is rich in history, anecdote and illustration. And its mile by mile \\"feel\\" for the course brings the event alive. I suspect it is the closest thing to a definitive book on the subject. But particularly I want to address the criticism (in one of these reviews) that it is written by a participant who didn't qualify for the event -- i.e., a \\"bandit.\\" I agree (with the critic) that achieving a qualifying time is an important part of the experience. Doing a 3:42 marathon in Portland (Ore.), after my most diligent training ever, brought me my greatest thrill as a runner (at age 65!). But as a first-time marathoner, Michael Connelly conveys a delightful naivete and sense of wonder that by definition a \\"qualifying\\" marathoner couldn't. I found myself particularly looking forward to the italicized paragraphs begun with his initials \\"MPC:\\". Secondly, whether the Boston Athletic Association or any of the official runners likes it or not, \\"bandits\\" constitute a regular part of the landscape. It seems significant that the BAA, on the book's jacket, offers an endorsement of \\"26 Miles to Boston.\\" One more thought: Three-time winner Uta Pippig of Germany, quoted throughout, comes across as such a classy, wonderful athlete and human being that her spirit ought to be bottled."},{"Title":"26 Miles to Boston: The Boston Marathon Experience from Hopkinton to Copley Square","review":"The author ran the race as a \\"bandit\\", a fact that you don't discover until you buy the book (it is not stated anywhere on the book cover, reviews, etc.) In fact, Amazon states: \\"About the Author ...MICHAEL CONNELLY competed in the 1996 Boston marathon.\\" This is simply a false statement. Legitimately qualifying for Boston is an integral part of competing, and the author did not do that. He did not \\"compete\\" in the Boston marathon any more than I \\"competed\\" in the U.S. Open by playing golf as a tourist at Pebble Beach (a frequent U.S. Open site). This taints the entire book and made me (as someone who has legitimately qualified for Boston) feel cheated (I am going to request a refund from Amazon on the basis of false advertising).Now, I recognize that the BAA has more or less allowed bandits to run the course over the years. As such, it might not have been that bad if the author had simply stated something along the following lines: he respects the talent and effort it takes to qualify and he recognizes that, since he has not done so, his participation is not the same as a legitimate qualifier, but he is nevertheless giving his experiences as a first time marathoner, not as someone who has properly trained and qualified for Boston. But, the author makes no such statement.In fact, the author berates Marty Liquori for suggesting that bandits should not be allowed to run. Here's an excerpt from the book (p. 43):\\"Listen Marty, you're our guest. So mind your manners, pick up your check, and watch the race. When I cross that finish line some twenty-six miles down the road, not with a number but with the storied history of the Boston Marathon in my blood, then I will consider myself qualified! (By the way, Marty, a little fun fact for you: You and I are tied with the same number of Boston Marathon championships.)\\"Give me a break. This statement is not only completely obnoxious, it also embarrasingly demonstrates a complete ignorance of running, as Marty Liquori was a middle distance runner (and an outstanding one at that), not a marathoner. Here's fun fact for Michael: your claimed time of 4:30 (p. 237) was more than an hour slower that the qualifying standard for your age. (I guess, by Michael's logic, when I completed the 18th hole at Pebble Beach, I qualified for the U.S. Open.) If there was any doubt before, that should be enough for anyone to reject the book.But wait, it gets even worse. After completing the course, the author states the following (p. 261):\\"I had arrived home safe and sound. Twenty-four hours before, I had walked out of that door a different man. Now I was the proud owner of a Boston Marathon medal and all the physical and mental benefits that come with it.\\"That is a flat out lie (or the author is delusional), as everyone knows that only legitimate qualifiers (who finish) are given medals, and again is highly insulting to all legitimate qualifiers/finishers.If anyone is still considering buying the book, there is one other thing that you should be aware of. A good part of the author's description of his \\"experience\\" in running the course involves describing how he faced excruciating pain and/or a nearly overwhelming urge to quit at numerous points in the race, but someone he managed to overcome those and keep going to the finish, and how he was suffering after the finish (e.g., \\"As I walked down the street, with two mylar blankers taped around me like capes, a well meaning girl offered me a PowerBar. I fel like saying 'I don't need a PowerBar. I need to be read my last rites!'\\")First of all, after a while, this stuff just becomes constant whining. More importantly, all of this \\"pain and suffering\\" was likely due to insufficient training on the part of the author. Apparently, up to six months before the race, he had done essentially no running and not a whole lot of exercise of any type (p. 7). Then, in late October 1995, he had heart surgery and apparently nearly died (p. 11). He then starting limited training in about mid-November (p. 12). Plus, the winter in New England was particular severe that year (p. 43). How could he have possibly done the proper amount of training to run Boston in April 1996? It appears that the author simply had no business running the course and, thereby, \\"suffered\\" more than a properly trained runner. Yet, he never admits to his lack of proper training. (Note: he claims to have run 4:30, but he provides no evidence to support that claim.)Again, this ties back to his being a bandit. As a bandit who had not properly trained, his \\"experience\\" is simply not representative of the experience of a properly trained, legitimate qualifier.You wouldn't buy a book about running by Rosie Ruiz. Don't buy this one either."},{"Title":"26 Miles to Boston: The Boston Marathon Experience from Hopkinton to Copley Square","review":"A quick read.
