The six million Jews who were burnt to ash or ground to dust in the Holocaust, like the victims of the bomb dropped on August 6, 1945, belonged to groups whose destruction furthered governmental goals. Their lives as individuals -- their feelings, thoughts, words -- meant little to the governments that would destroy them. By writing poetry that gives voice to individuals, by showing the individual human faces, caught in crisis and despair, Brian Daldorph has done what Elie Wiesel once identified as a writer's truest mission: to restore to the world a portion of its lost soul. Brian depicts individuals stricken by disaster and struggling to survive, making it impossible to demonize or dehumanize. He writes with courage and clarity. This book is essential reading, not only for historians, poets, and philosophers, but for anyone determined to ensure that evil will not walk unchallenged on the earth. Brian handles the terrifying subjects with tender compassion for human frailties, so despite its inherent power, the book never becomes overwhelming. Instead, this poetry enhances understanding of what it means to be human in a world where these things happen."},{"Title":"Modern baseball strategy","review":"Excellent read and insight into baseball strategy.

Many subsequent writers owe a debt to Foundation, which is best read within the original trilogy (Foundation, Foundation and Empire, Second Foundation. It is extremely exciting for anyone with a sense of the 'epic' questions of the fate of mankind, or for that matter, any large society or culture. A staggering achievement.It is hard to get to the end of this work and not want to pick up Foundation and Empire.Now I might add that I did not personally enjoy very much the subsequent \\"interference\\" with the books created by the subsequent novels - Foundations Edge, Foundation and Earth, and Prelude to Foundation. I think Asimov's idea for the story changed as he got older (certainly the \\"robot\\" angle is increasingly emphasised, which I think is to the general detriment of the series) and while I have not read much literary criticism on this topic, I would suggest the original idea was better."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"I first read these books when I was in high school and althoughI almost never read fiction, and don't particularly like sciencefiction (even though I studied geophysics in university andwork as an engineer), these books made an immense impressionon me. As I began to study Judaism, I finally discovered thatAsimov, a non-observant, yet knowledgable Jew, was using theformat of science fiction to describe the Jewish concept of theredemption of mankind. A careful reading of the BiblicalProphets shows that the ideal world that history is leadingmankind towards has universal peace between nations and ade-emphasis of technology in favor of the development of man'sinner, morespiritual side. However, this development of man's spiritualqualities and move towards universal harmony is accompaniedby upheavels and wars. Jewish tradition also says that theworld is sustained by 36 \\"hidden\\" righteous people whosegood deeds and spritual superiority are vital from preventingthe destructive forces in the world, both natural andman-made from overcoming everything and leading the worldto chaos.Asimov used the two Foundations as his vehicle for describingthis cosmic process, and an important part of the story isthe necessity of the Second Foundation to remain \\"hidden\\" toallow the process to work itself out.As far as the story itself is concerned, it is true that it isdated...for example, Asimov places the capital of the GalacticEmpire on the planet Trantor which \\"is at the center of theGalaxy\\". Today, it is believed that the center of the galaxyis full of black holes and lethal amounts of radiation, so itis unlikely there would be life as we know it there. Also,Asimov posits atomic energy as being the ultimate form of powerbut physics has advanced beyond that point to fusion and otherexotic forms of power.On the other hand, Asimov wrote these stories in the wake ofthe Second World War and so he is quite aware of how so manyinstitutions created by men...including governments and religiousestablishments, even starting with the bestof intentions, seems to run into crises. Thus the GalacticEmpire, which brought centuries of peace and prosperity tomankind, is brought inevitably to a point of degeneration, andhow the (First) Foundation itself, founded by idealistic,intelligent people who are at least partly aware of theirimportant role in shaping a better future for mankind, rapidlydegenerates into a repressive dictatorship.As others have pointed out, these stories have almost no \\"action\\",which is fine with me (my favorite movies and TV shows alsohave no action, e.g. Twelve Angry Men) and in spite of thefact that these stories are 60 years old, I recommend themto anyone who wants a deeper look at mankind's natureand its destiny."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"I do not know much about science fiction. For this reason, I read &lt;Foundation> just as I read a fiction. Although so far I read only the first one of the trilogy, I liked it.What is interesting and strange at the same time in this book is that, in every chapter, a new main character appears. It takes time for a reader to develop familiarity with a character and to get interested and affected by the character's thoughts and actions. By the time one forms such a tie with the character, however, the chapter somewhat abruptly ends and the character is finished! The chapters of this book, therefore, could be seen as self-contained short stories loosely connected by the theme of the development of the Foundation over one thousand years.One thing about this kind of way in which each chapter unfolds is that it may well have been inevitable for the author because he had to cover so long a time period. The other thing is that somehow it leaves a lot of room for a reader to think back more about what a character did in each crisis and how history set the stage for the crisis, whether this effect was intended or not by the author.This book was a good read both entertaining and thought-provoking."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"I always enjoy reading Isaac Asimov's writing, and foundation was no exception. The plot is imaginative and original, like much of Asimov's writing. Foundation is set in the future, a time when our galaxy is ruled by a failing empire. Hari seldon, a psychologist, must prevent the galaxy from falling into anarchy and barbarism by creating a foundation of scientists. Foundation is fun to read, and provides ample entertainment. I recommend reading it."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"This is the first book in the famous Foundation trilogy. The story is simple. It's over 50,000 years in the future and humans have spread throughout the whole galaxy, with millionsof worlds and quintillions of people united by an Empire. However, the empire is crumbling.Enter Hari Seldon, the pioneer of psycho-history - a kind of complete, mathematical social science that uses statistical averages and modelling to predict social trends in large populations for thousands of years to come. Hari's studies show that the collapse of the empire is invevitable. However, if he takes action now, the period of suffering before the next empire might be decreased from 30,000 years to 1000. So, he establishes two foundations on opposite sides of the galaxy to follow his master plan. This book is the story of the first foundation.As a work of literature, expect no marvels of prose or metaphor. Most of the chapters are dialogue between people. There is also little characterisation and a blatant disregard for the &quot;show, don't tell&quot; rule of writing. All of these things are there because the trilogy covers hundreds of years. As such, this novel is divided into 5 books with a gap of decades or centuries between each. The whole text is very episodic as we watch an entire civilisation emerge from a modest group of scientists to a powerful force in the outskirts of the galaxy.So, the concepts of the book were what I found interesting. Of course, the whole premise that human history can be mathematically be mapped out as a kind of law of averages seems ridiculous to me. I don't think that Asimov believed that either - he just saw it as an interesting idea for a story. The great Hari Seldon maps out the future history of the Foundation, ensuring that it basically has one cosmic path to follow - one which will end in laying the seeds for the new Galactic Empire.The first book details with around the first 200 years of the foundation, as several crises are encountered by individuals as forces of history. With few military resources, the leaders are forced to rely on their wit. I'm onto the second book now so should find out if that wit was enough.A great read in that you'll find in interesting even if you aren't a great science fiction fan - it has very unique perspectives social &quot;science&quot; and what makes a civilization."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"Asimov was one of the incredible path-breakers for science fiction, and the Foundation books are thought by many to make up one of the best and most far-reaching series of the entire genre. While Asimov was a biochemist by trade, he certainly understood the circular pattern of human history, regardless of the amount of technology available to mankind.Foundation is about the fall of the Galactic Empire that has ruled for times immemorial (so long, in fact, that the memory of the legendary \\"Earth\\" is but a myth). The Empire's fall will obviously result in much chaos as the wheels of law struggle to beat back the inevitable barbarians who rise to loot and pillage (rather than rebuild) the riches of the old Empire. All of this seems a rather bleak future for humanity, yet Asimov is a hopeless optimist (at least in my eyes) in that he sees the resilience of people as ever reaching. The Foundation series is therefore a group of novels about the ways in which humanity restores itself even after all seems lost.&quot;Foundation&quot;, the first novel in the series, focuses on a colony formed by one who foresees the destruction of the Empire, a man named Hari Seldon. Seldon therefore attempts to minimize the effects of the collapse by building a community made up of intellectuals called the \\"Foundation\\". The book is divided into three separate stories at completely different times in the history of Seldon's paradise, one at the formation of the Foundation, another at its troublesome infancy, and the last at the time that the Foundation becomes economically independent (it becomes internally capitalistic and externally somewhat imperialistic). Each story rather stands alone and, while the last is somewhat disappointing, each is worthy in its own right.Highly recommended; if you don't read this book, you can't understand science fiction as a genre."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"Hari seldom, the man who predicted the fall of the empire in the first book, established foundations on each end of the galaxy to prevent the rise of a dark age. The fallen empire from the first part of the book has incresed it's strength and with that strength, it plans to seize control of the foundation. With an ambitious and skilled general, and dozens of battle fleets, the foundation faces it's greatest enemy.Personally, I liked the second part with the mule better then the war with the empire, because the main characters have nothing to do with the foundations victory, which makes the plot not a major factor for the story, but this also leads the reader into more surprises for the end of the section.\\"I am the mule\\". As the reader discovers the identity of the speaker, all loose ends are tied up while creating a great twist for the end. Even though Seldon's predictions guide the foundation to overcome the first four crises, this is the book where his predictions turn the foundation into a disaster. A mutant is born, having the power to fight against any great power of the galaxy, a man that is able to defeat dozens of battle fleets, with the intelligence greater then any scientist of the foundation. .The second part of the book is full of surprises, so please finish the book if you have started it or you might miss one of the best plots in science ficiton. While reading the story of the two couple's adventures, the reader needs to think deeply in their every move. Isaac lets the reader feel the negative consequences in prediction. The more hope the foundation has on Hari Seldon's prediction, the greater fall they will need to suffer. Although the plot of the couple's is resolved, the foundations destiny is discovered in the third book, the second foundation. I believe any reader that has read this book will definitely also need to read, the second foundation, so I recommend buying both books."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"This is truly a defining book for the genre of science fiction. The beauty of this tale is that Asimov began penning it when he was only twenty one years old. The story centers around a falling empire and the many characters throughout its history that define it. It also deals with a sort of scientific prophecy in what is termed &quot;psychohistory&quot;. This is the manner in which the future can be predicted using scientific evidence and the laws of probability. This is truly a masterpiece of the genre. A standard which all sci-fi authors should hope to attain. I would recommend this read to anyone that is a science fiction fan. Many readers are familiar with Orson Scott Card. This is the novel which prompted him to become a writer. That this novel is a cornerstone in the genre is an understatment."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"This was the first book I have read by Isaac asimov and I can say it was worth the wait. While this book is very old it is still an excellent read. Asimov presents a very convincing future for humanity. The book is broken into several sections that were originally short stories in a sci-fi magazine. They gel togethor perfectly and the overall story is wonderful. This book details Hari Seldon and his prediction of the fall the galactic empire and the rise of barbarism for 30000 years. He however thinks he can avert the disaster and only have 3000 years of barbarism in the galaxy. Based on this he sets up two seperate foundations that are supposed so achieve this goal. This book is focused on the first foundation and it's trials as the fall of the galactic empire begins.THe characters in this book are good. While each section is short you really empathize with the characters and their lives. The plot is excellent some of the suprises he throws at you are quite extrodinary. My only complaint is some the terminology in this book is quite old and often times is quite funny to read. However the ideas, characters, and plot make up for the archaic wording in the book.I would recommend this book to any science fiction fan!"},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"The story of Foundation continues in F&E;, with the stories in this book taking us through the final fall of the old Galactic Empire and the power vacuum left in its wake. The most known aspect of the second book however, is the idea that psychohistory is limited in that it is not able to predict aspects caused by wild chance-- and in this second Foundation book, wild chance threatens Foundation in the person of a powerful mutant called the Mule.Well-written, as Asimov always is."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"The trilogy is essential, but since Asimov also capitalized on his own genius by writing what seems to be hundreds of lesser Foundation stories, it can all get very confusing and a bit draining. This is the second book in the original trilogy, so it is from a science fiction point of view essential reading. The trilogy itself comes up with two highly memorable characters, Hari Seldon, the psycho-historian, who uses Mathematics to predict the future and establish a \\"Foundation\\" that will limit the dark ages after the fall of the \\"Empire\\" to a single millenium (as opposed to ten.) He reappears as a hologram at certain points in the story with more or less accurate takes on what is happening in \\"History\\" at that point.The other very memorable character is the Mule. He represents the variable that makes predicting \\"History\\" mathematically a tricky business at least, not to mention impossible. He is a nasty totalitarian character who strangely in Asimov's hands manages to elicit some sympathy. Asimov is playing with the idea of predicting human behavior scientifically (or controlling it scientifically,) but this character is also a humanistic meditation on how masses of people get overwhelmed by evil social forces like fascism and soviet communism. You can see that Asimov lived through the era of Hitler, Mussolini, Franco and Stalin and that these cult of personality tyrants and the submission of masses of people to their destructive and sadistic wills profoundly affected his view of human nature. Foundation and Empire seems to be an attempt to come to terms with that experience, and so has something to say about the specifics of twentieth century history, as well as about historical philosophy."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"The Foundation trilogy (three first books) and the Foundation series (all seven) are often regarded as the greatest set of Science Fiction literature ever produced. The Foundation series won the one-time Hugo Award for \\"Best All-Time Series\\" in 1966. Isaac Asimov was among the world's best authors, an accomplished scientist, and he was also a genius with an IQ above 170, and it shows in the intelligently concocted but complex plots and narrative. There are already 331 reviews for this Science Fiction novel, however, I still believe I have something unqiue to contribute which is stated in my last paragraph.This book and the rest in the series take place far in the future (allegedly 50,000 years) at a time when people live throughout the Galaxy. A mathematician Hari Seldon has developed a new branch of mathematics known as psychohistory. Using the law of mass action, it can roughly predict the future on a large scale. Hari Seldon predicts the demise of the Galactic Empire and creates a plan to save the knowledge of the human race in a huge encyclopedia and also to shorten the barbaric period expected to follow the demise from 30,000 years to 1,000 years. A select people are chosen to write the Encyclopedia and to unknowingly carry out the plan to re-create the Galactic Empire. What unfolds in this book and in the books that follow is the future history of the demise and re-emergence of a Galactic Empire, written as a series of adventures, in a similar fashion to the Star Wars series.Even though this is arguably the greatest set of Science Fiction novels ever written, I do not recommend it to those who are only mildly interested in Science Fiction. Character development is not the focus of these novels and the large amount of technical/scientific details, schemes and plots can become both confusing and heavy for the unitiated Science Fiction reader. If you read this one you will feel the need to read the others which may take a long time. If you are new to Science Fiction start with something lighter and when you are hooked you can continue with this series. Also, in my opinion the second and third books were better than the first."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"[The quotation is from Salvor Hardin, Mayor of Terminus.]Let's say it's around 1940 or so; you're studying chemistry in grad school but your true love is history; you've read Edward Gibbon's _The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire_, but writing a historical novel set in the _past_ would require just too much research; you get the bright idea of writing a historical tale set in the _future_, about the decline and fall of a _Galactic_ Empire, and you suggest as much to John W. Campbell, Jr.Campbell's response: he gets excited and suggests that you introduce some pseudoscientific mumbo-jumbo about \\"psychohistory\\". Do you:(a) drop the idea and write something else?(b) write the story just as Campbell describes it?(c) use a little imagination, make Campbell's idea a bit more intellectually presentable, and crank out, not just a single story, but a Hugo-award-winning series?If you picked (c), congratulations; you're Isaac Asimov.The Hugo didn't come until 1965, when the Foundation series won for best all-time series (defeating even Tolkien's _Lord of the Rings_ books). By then Asimov had long ago tired of the series; you can tell by the first part of the third book. (But the _second_ part of the third book is probably the best part of the original three volumes.)And heck, even in order to keep it going _that_ long, he had to introduce a radical departure from the Seldon Plan, in which the Mule initiates not just another Seldon Crisis but a new element altogether, one that wasn't accounted for in the Plan. (And in even later installments, it becomes pretty clear that Asimov isn't exactly thrilled by either the Plan or the Empire it's supposed to bring about.)But in the first volume, all of it is still fresh. Here we meet Hari Seldon for the first time, get slightly acquainted with his mathematical science of psychohistory, and learn what he's done to keep the decline of the Galactic Empire from leading humanity into 30,000 years of barbarism. He can't avert the decline, but he's got a way to reduce the period of barbarism to a mere millennium.He's set up two Foundations at opposite ends of the galaxy. And he's carefully set the ball rolling so that every so often there will be some sort of sociopolitical crisis, to which there's only one possible resolution. All the Foundation has to do is wait until the crisis narrows everything down to just one option, and then figure out what the heck that option _is_ . . .Well, I think you can see that the pattern leaves some room for the exercise of intelligence, but not a lot for individual initiative. No wonder Asimov let the Plan start going awry; the story might have lasted a thousand years, but the dramatic possibilities wouldn't.Anyway, it's a great, great series. This is where it begins in realtime, although the later novel _Prelude to Foundation_ is \\"first\\" according to the chronology of the Foundation universe. (And the Empire novels -- _Pebble in the Sky_, _The Stars, Like Dust_, and _The Currents of Space_ -- take place even earlier. So do most of the robot stories.)If you haven't read it yet and you think you might be an SF fan, you'll want to get around to it pretty soon. Start here, and enjoy."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"The Foundation Trilogy is my favorite sci-fi book series, and also my favorite work by asimov. The first book in the series, Foundation, is concerned primarily with two concepts. The first is the concept that history repeats itself over and over again, and that just as great empires fell in the past, the same problems will in the future aflict empires once they become too big. And naturally after the fall of a great empire, chaos ensues. The other concept this book describes is the theory that science and mathematics are capable of predicting the trends in complex systems such as large groups of people.I am going to be honest. This book was revolutionary for its time, and a great many famous sci-fi writers were inspired after reading this book. I know that I personally could never look at world governments the same way after reading this book. It truly opens your eyes to tendancy of people to make the same mistakes over and over again, repeating the same patterns on a large scale. And not only is this book easy to read and greatly thought-provoking, it is also great fun. It uses Asimov's trademark style. Little violence, even less sex, but a great plot and lots of cool technology. If you take science fiction at all seriously, you owe it to your self to give this book a read."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"Foundation (1951) is the first SF novel in the Foundation series. Although originally a series of novelettes published separately in Astounding, it was later combined into this novel.\\"The Psychohistorians\\" (1950) was created as an introduction to the series with the publication of the Gnome press novel. It describes the political maneuvering by Hari Seldon to establish the Foundation on Terminus.\\"The Encyclopedists\\" (1942) relates the first of the \\"Seldon Crises\\" when the Foundation is caught between the retreating empire and the growing Anacreon kingdom.\\"The Mayors\\" (1942) tells of the second crisis when Wienis, the Prince Regent of Anacreon, decides to take over the Foundation.\\"The Traders\\" (1944) depicts the third crisis after Askone arrests a Foundation agent trying to spread the Scientism religion.\\"The Merchant Princes\\" (1944) recounts the fourth crisis when a Foundation trader discovers a market for his advanced technology devices.Although the empire portrayed within this novel was actually based on the Roman empire, technology itself became a major force in the story. Thus, slavery was not a problem in this empire until it began to decline and lose its technology. This decline also allowed the Foundation to spread its influence through advanced technology.When these stories were written, computers were only laboratory toys. Thus, the original Foundation series didn't incorporate computers as such. These stories seem strangely old-fashioned without household, business and embedded computers. Nonetheless, the author did foretell the use of electronic hand calculators.The author did include computers in the robot stories written during this timeframe, but they were massive devices used in the factories to design and manufacture robots. The emphasis was upon positronic brains -- something like neural nets -- rather than true computers. Maybe our industry just hasn't yet caught up to his technological projections.This novel is one of the most famous works of science fiction. While it describes future sciences far beyond current capabilities, it still inculcated a sense of the methodology underlying real science and technology. While the author went on to become a major writer of science fiction, he also became one of the best elucidators of popular science in the world.Still, this tale contains all the flaws of Campbellian science fiction. The major characters are always male. The dialogue is somewhat stilted and old-fashioned. In addition, the story contains more ideas than action. Of course, this tale is also outdated because of all the imitations and stimulations resulting from it.Highly recommended for Asimov fans and for anyone else who wants to read classic works of science fiction.-Arthur W.

I am totally incapable of writing an unbiased, objective review of this book, just as I am unable to say unbiased, objective things about my first girl friend. This was the first SF novel that I read (actually, I bought it for a friend and then read it before I gave it to him -- the beginning of a life-long nasty habit) when I was 14.The scope of the story is breathtaking, the pace is good -- especially for Asimov who tended to be pretty wordy -- and the details engaging. Asimov wrote this as a series of connected stories for &quot;Astounding&quot; magazine, and this shows in the oddly repeated facts that allowed the 'zine readers to follow the plot even when they missed earlier stories. It also adds a certain pulpy flavor to the text, which I think works well. SF about grand civilizations that are galactic in scope doesn't need to -- and probably shouldn't -- sound like Great Fiction. I think the gritty, quick style of Asimov's pulp writing works well.One of my favorite things about the whole &quot;Foundation&quot; series (you need to real all three of the originals, by the way, the newer ones are optional) is the way they presaged certain now-routine SF conventions. The most notable, of course, is the globe-encovering city/planet of Trantor, most recently replicated by George Lucas in &quot;Star Wars: The Phantom Menace.&quot; (The less said about SW:TPM the better...)You can also see in my signature above that Asimov has had other influences on me. Salvor Hardin was a character in this novel: a trader and an agent of the First Foundation."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"Asimov had an active and brilliant imagination - truly, a scientist writing fiction. This series is science fiction on a grand scale. When you keep in mind that this story originated in 1951, it is easy to see how much Star Trek, Star Wars and yes even Heinlein's & Clarke's later works borrowed from these ideas.Anyway, Asimov at his best was a creator; he had amazing ideas of the universe, how it worked, and how to structure stories that manipulated the readers expectations.The Foundation series is like a spider web that continues to become more intricate and complex with each chapter. The intricacy of the plotting is amazing, although honestly it's not self-evident in the first few stories of the first novel, given that they were published independantly, as serialized short stories told one at a time.Only with the second book did this change.The basic premise: The rise and fall of the roman empire, told on a galactic scale from a historian living in the 2nd empire a thousand years later.The setup: One man creates a science, called Psychohistory, a fictional precursor to Chaos Math (a real statistical science today). This psychohistorian, Hari Seldon, predicted that the vast Galactic Empire is about to crumble, dropping humanity back into the dark ages. This dark ages was due to last 30,000 years (I believe), and while it is too late to prevent this horrible breakdown of society, Seldon believes he can use this new math to shorten the time period between empires.To do so, he establishes two \\"Foundations\\" made up of scientists, one at the outer edge of the galaxy, and the other at \\"Star's End\\". In advance, Seldon plots out the future (using the math of psychohistory), and sets in motion a series of \\"domino\\" events. The Foundation faces crises and problems, forcing change in both strategy and focus for the next several hundred years. But Asmimov continues to modulate the story throughout each of the books, and building upon the previously-understood structure.In fact, once you think you've read enough permutations on the same idea, Asimov starts tearing the structure down, introducing variables into the story that further complicate matters.A caveat about the most often-touted complaint about Asimov: His writing style (or lack thereof):In 1951, when these stories were first published, Asimov was not a great writer - as in, a writer of literature. His descriptions, characterizations and storytelling technique all left a lot to be desired. His technique got better with the passing years, such that any of his fiction written after 1970 or so reads easily.But that is not the point, here. Asimov didn't create great characters (save for his robot stories) - he came up with mind-bending ideas and subsequent permutations.The litmus test of whether or not Asimov is for you: Read 'The Last Question'. It's a 12-page short story. Not brilliantly written, but a fantastic story with amazing ideas contained inside. When you get to the last sentence of it, you will probably be blown away. If you are, Foundation is for you.Read them - and commit to all of them, because they get better as they go, generally speaking. The first three were written in 1950 - 53. But the fans demanded that he someday continue the story, so he continued with a fourth book in 1983, and the last in 1986. Some complain that the last book is overlong - and I agree - but the last sentence of the last book is...amazing.The books:FoundationFoundation and EmpireSecond Foundation (contains the best story - Search By The Mule)Foundation's Edge (best overall book)Foundation and EarthAfterward, Asimov went back and wrote prequel novels (Prelude to Foundation, Foundation's End) taking place prior to and concurrently with events from the first book. He later admitted that he wrote prequels because the main story had gotten so complicated, he felt he'd taken the story as far as it could go.The prequels aren't too bad, but they are completely non-essential."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"First I should say that this is a great book.

I have reviewed all of them. They're all good. This particular book has two parts. In the first part the Foundation is faced with the dying but still strong Galactic Empire, and in the second, more interesting part, they face the rising Mule. A few words bout him, he's not what or who you might think he is. The next sentence might be considered a spoiler, so choose to read it or not. The Mule is actually Bobo( this word only appears once in the book, and might be missed). Well, have fun reading!"},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"This is the first published volume (which was originally published as four short stories in &quot;Astounding Science Fiction&quot; magazine, 1942-1944, with an introductory section written in 1949) of Asimov's famous trilogy, which affected many later works. This trilogy, which won a special Hugo Award in 1966 for the best science fiction series of all time, was later expanded into further volumes by Asimov (in fact, two prequels are Asimov's &quot;Prelude to Foundation&quot; and &quot;Forward the Foundation&quot;; after Asimov's death in 1992, other authors [for example, Gregory Benford's &quot;Foundation's Fear,&quot; Greg Bear's &quot;Foundation and Chaos,&quot; and David Brin's &quot;Foundation's Triumph&quot;] have contributed to the series [note that there are now five novels that serve as prequels to Asimov's first published Foundation book!]) . In these stories, spacecraft travel over large distances via &quot;jumps.&quot; The ships spend most of their time in a form of hyperspace, each jump being aimed at a certain target star. The central character, Hari Seldon, is a psychohistorian. Psychohistory is the mathematics dealing with the reactions of very large masses of mankind to social and economic stimuli (and the recent advances in chaos theory in advanced mathematics lends credibility to Asimov's psychohistory). His calculations predicts an end to the Galactic Empire (an empire remarkably similar to the Roman Empire on Earth). Two Foundations are set up to ease mankind through the dark area predicted (or else, the dark period will last 30000 years) and, after a thousand years, will join together to form a second Empire. Although Asimov's early writing style leaves much to be desired (recall this was all put together in his early 20s during World War II when he worked for the U. S. Navy and when he was finishing his graduate work at Columbia Univ.), it is still fun reading; I enjoy every time I reread it. It is particularly enjoyable in the context of the other volumes. This first published volume has five parts. In &quot;The Psychohistorians,&quot; an introductory tale (which begins about 46 years after the events described in &quot;Prelude to Foundation&quot; and thirteen years after the events described in the last story of &quot;Forward the Foundation&quot;), Dr. Hari Seldon and a young colleague are arrested on the planet Trantor (the governing center of the Galactic Empire) and tried for treason. Seldon's group are to be exiled to the planet Terminus on the galactic rim where they will form a scientific refuge. Seldon also plans to set up another group somewhere else. We later learn, in Part III, that this other group (the Second Foundation) is located at a place known as Star's End at the other end of the galaxy. In &quot;The Encyclopedists,&quot; taking place about fifty years later, a large number of members of the original Foundation are on the planet Terminus and are compiling a massive encyclopedia to prepare for the upcoming dark age. But, why were no psychobiologists and only one psychologist present among the original colonists? The remaining three parts continue the development of the Foundation on Terminus."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"50,000 years in the future and they are still smoking cigarettes, reading newspapers, the main power source is nuclear energy..and they carry nuclear guns???

Within the fist 50 pages, iwas bored out of my mind. I don't know why everyone think this book is SOOOOO good, don't listen to them. If you like BAD books this is the one for you! I hope Asimov has some better books, cause he has to be acclaimed a good writer for something (or book)!"},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"This book is one of the most overrated books I have ever read. There is very little in the way of plot and character development. There is no climax in this book. The book reads like a historical record, similar to Tolkiens Silmarillion, rather than an actual story. If you like reading historical records, you may like this book. If you are looking for an exciting novel.... better luck elsewhere."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"I tried to listen to this story on CD, and aside from the story not being terribly interesting, I was surprised at Asimov's attitude towards religion. I suppose I shouldn't have been. He is a sci fi writer, after all. But I thought he was supposed to be a smart guy. He's not -- at least on this point.The basic outline of the story (at least the beginning -- I didn't make it all the way through) is that some guy predicts that the galactic empire is going to fall, so he tries to make provision to preserve technology so that the succeeding dark ages don't last as long as they otherwise might. Toward that end he gets a select group of scientists onto this relatively isolated planet where they can carry on their work, which becomes the invention and maintenance of a religion that's supposed to preserve certain technologies through the coming dark ages. In this religion the high priests understand the theory -- the technology and all that -- but the local priests and the people are duped into believing in some mumbo jumbo.It's as if you're supposed to picture some priest waving incense and saying prayers while he adjusts the knobs on the nuclear reactor, believing that it's God doing something while it's really just technology.I know that \\"technology as magic\\" and \\"religion = magic\\" are common themes in the sci-fi genre, but for some reason I expected better from Asimov. It shows a rather alarming lack of thought.Religious rituals are always geared towards the chaotic and the mysterious. There aren't religious rituals to cause the sun to rise, because it's regular and dependable, but there are religious rituals for storms and floods and harvests and childbirth and whatnot. Religion is also used to explain hidden things -- psychology, forgiveness, etc.IOW, religion is subject to criticism (\\"it's not measurable\\") in precisely the area where Asimov is trying to squeeze it. He's trying to make religion the mystical cloak for something that's regular, predictable and logical. It just doesn't work that way.If religious rituals had precise, measurable results, people would suspect that there's nothing religious or mysterious about them and they'd look for a material cause. Anyone who doubts that simply doesn't understand the religious mind, or hasn't been paying attention. Sure, there are gullible religious folk out there who'll believe anything, but the majority have half an eye out for tricks and deceptions.The very idea that you can hide technology behind a cloak of religious ritual is a rather silly science fiction writer's fantasy.Anyway, the story wasn't that compelling, and this \\"religious cover for nuclear technology\\" business was so incredibly stupid, I couldn't finish it."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"What more can I say? The Mule? Give me a break. How can anyone consider this to be great fiction? Go read something else...."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"As an avid sci-fi reader, I felt I had to rectify an oversight and read the book that really is a foundation of much of today's sci-fi. When I started the book, I planned to read the entire series. I was so completely let down that I don't know if I'll ever read Asimov again. Foundation simply failed to ignite any spark in my imagination. The characters are poorly developed, largely because of the huge leaps in time throughout the book. In addition, the inability of a person writing sci-fi -- which by its nature looks to the future -- to envision any role for women in that future is deplorable. I thought Asimov's work trite, boring, and completely lacking in the sort of foresight that makes books by authors like William Gibson and Tad Williams so amazingly captivating. Kudos to Asimov for opening the door for better writers but too bad his work (at least this early work) is terrible. Don't waste your time reading this one. Go straight to the many better post-Asimov authors."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"I hate this book. I don't just &quot;not like it,&quot; I hate it! Such a bad book. Do not read it!"},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"Originally written in the 1950's for serial publication, the Foundation Trilogy (and the additional books written in the series) is often hailed as Asimov's greatest achievement. Certainly, the original trilogy is high on my list of \\"must read\\" science fiction.The Foundation Trilogy presents us with a universe controlled by the Galactic Empire. The Empire has governed the known universe for tens of thousands of years and appears to be at the zenith of its power. But the Empire is burdened by the weight of the bureaucracy needed to govern millions of worlds. Trantor, the administrative seat of the Empire is a planet completely covered by buildings. A vast, planet-wide city, it houses the millions of functionaries necessary to administer the Empire. As wealthy and as powerful as the Empire seems, disaster is just around the corner. However, only one man, Hari Seldon, is able to recognize the Empire's impending doom.Hari is a mathematician who has developed the breakthrough field of Psychohistory. Psychohistory is the mathematical process by which the actions of people can be predicted in advance. This science does not work for predicting individual behavior, but instead predicts the behavior of a mass of humanity (billions of people). By analyzing the Empire with Psychohistorical methods, Hari has determined that the Empire will crumble within 500 years, plunging the known universe into barbarism that will prevent a new Empire from arising for 30,000 years!Fortunately, Hari has developed a plan that, if executed, will curtail the period of galactic decay to a mere 1,000 years. However, it is unclear whether Hari can persuade the Emperor to allow him to move forward with his plan. Can Hari and his fellow scientists save the universe? Or will the shortsighted aims of a greedy, grasping Emperor derail their plans?Although these works are science fiction, they would probably not be classed as \\"hard\\" science fiction. There is some necessary discussion of scientific principles, but not enough to bore any \\"technophobes\\" who may be reading the novels. The trilogy focuses mainly on the people involved in the Seldon plan, as opposed to the technology being used by them. Asimov always enjoyed speculating on how people would evolve and react to advanced technology and he lets his imagination run wild here.Two significant milestones were achieved with this work. First, Asimov became one of the first writers to theorize that atomic power would revolutionize society. Second, I believe Asimov was the first to present a planet that was entirely covered by buildings. The universe he creates is engaging and filled with fascinating, believable characters. Since the books were serialized, many chapters (especially in the first volume) contain complete plot lines and make the book easy to read if you need to break up your reading time into small increments. Lots of political intrigue and maneuvering keeps the action flowing through all three books.Foundation sets the stage for the rest of the series. Hari Seldon is introduced and his theories of Psychohistory are explained. Then Seldon's Foundation is established on Terminus, a remote planet at the edge of the Empire, with the goal of shortening the period of barbarism the universe will experience. However, there are no Psychohistorians located in the Foundation... only scientists. The planet has very few native metals and virtually no defenses. The scientists must figure out how to rule their world and fend off avaricious neighbors as the Empire begins to crumble. The majority of this first volume contains vignettes chronicling the Foundation leaders responding to various crises that Hari Seldon predicted centuries before. The crises are varied and plausible. The solutions to the problems that arise are not solved by any miraculous means, but by tough, clever political maneuvering. Watching the crises and their solutions unfold is very enthralling and keeps you turning the pages at a rapid pace.There is something here for everyone to enjoy. If you have never read this fine trilogy, buy a copy today. You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"Isaac Asimov has always been a better science writer than a science fiction writer. He does not have the turn of phrase, the poetic endownment, the ability to have characters change and grow and become interesting...but, his ideas have always been cutting edge without being over the top.The vision of the breakdown of the future empire, of Hari Seldon and the school of psychohistory, the idea of setting up two Foundations at each end of the galaxy...great elements of a story. There has been talk that Asimov &quot;borrowed&quot; these ideas from Campbell but if so, he gave them a polish and a new direction that completely transformed the otiginal ones.One must grant literary, historical and scientific license to the writer in that many of the inventions we take for granted were only glimmers in the eye of a teenager in the 50's. The ideas are stunning in scope if not in execution. I would have loved to have seen a Heinlein or Pamela Sargent with this material. Still, it retains the reader throughout...and sets up the next novel in the trilogy."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"I first read the Foundation series many years ago and made the mistake of loaning the books to a friend - of course, I never got them back. Recently I decided to buy the series again and once again I was amazed with how ahead of their time they were, considering how long ago they were written. The central premise of the story is imaginitive, and the plot devices by which Asimov drives the book forward are cleverly thought out.I'm not a fan of &quot;laser guns and spaceships&quot; science fiction, and I hold to the idea that people living hundreds of years from now will fundamentally be the same as us. We won't be wearing silver suits and living on a diet of vitamin pills. So it's refreshing to read a &quot;sci-fi&quot; story that doesn't get bogged down with high-tech stuff, but focusses on human development. I'd recommend it to any one, whether you're a sci-fi geek or not."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"The 'Golden Age' of science fiction (typically defined as the period shortly after John W. Campbell took charge of Astounding magazine to the late '40s) produced many of the seminal ideas now taken for granted (and almost cliched) by the SF genre. Foundation was certainly part of this era, defining two major ideas: that the entire galaxy would be populated by humans (no aliens around - an early look at the idea that we might just be unique), and that mass human behavior can be codified in mathematical algorithms and to a certain extent is predictable. These ideas, along with several other lesser ones, form the background basis for Foundation, where the galaxy-spanning Empire (closely modeled on the Roman Empire) is in decline and Hari Seldon has created the initial equations of psychohistory, which predict the eventual complete collapse of the Empire and an ensuing 'Dark Age' lasting 30,000 years. Although Seldon can see no way to prevent the Empire's collapse, he does see a way to reduce the resulting Dark Age length to about 1000 years, by setting up a Foundation in the far reaches of the galaxy, whose nominal mission is to preserve man's accumulated knowledge in a repository called the Encyclopedia Galactica.With this as the background, the story revolves around particular points in the Foundation's existence where it is in danger of being destroyed or overrun. Originally written as separate stories, each crisis episode's (all foreseen via the magic of Seldon's mathematics) resolution progressively moves the Foundation forward from a backwater, isolated, and ivory-tower society towards an active political power, capable of dominating its surrounding stellar mini-empires, becoming an island of light in a sea of darkness and ignorance.Viewing each episode by itself, none of them are representatives of great writing, marred by weak characterization (a typical Asimov failing) and almost hackneyed plotting. The massive shift in viewpoint and background at the start of each episode is also jarring, as the reader must readjust to a whole new set of conditions each time. However, the power of this book and its two successors is in the grand scope of the entire story line, very typical of stories of this era, as they are far more idea centered than character or plot driven. This book almost cannot be evaluated by itself, isolated from the rest of this set, because the full panorama and scale of the complete story far outweighs the individual contribution of each piece of it.As an introduction to the Seldon universe, this first book is adequate, with surprisingly little dating, given that the separate pieces of this book were written almost 60 years ago. Yes, there are places where vacuum tubes still reign, but they sit right next to the use of holographic images, which weren't even on the scientific horizon when this was written. But the technology here is almost irrelevant, as the focus is on how to guide and shape a society of humans, to develop a proper government within which individuals can grow and be creative, while at the same time there is a background thread that asks if all human actions are pre-ordained.Take the time to read this; ignore some of the blatant examples of '40s pulp-level style. Look instead for the great ideas and their interrelationships; feel the sense of wonder. But to fully experience why this is considered one of the best classics in the field, Foundation &amp; Empire and Second Foundation are immediately required follow up reading."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"This is the first book I have read on my own and really fallen in love with. I am in 8th grade, and I found it very easy to understand and tremendously engrossing. I just couldn't put it down after I started it.

A definite must read for any sci-fi fan."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"This is just about the best SF series ever, and this book is the best in the series. If you want to get into Asimov's universe this is the place to start. Just as good are his Robot series. Every one of Asimov's characters are expertly defined and easyly remembered. One of the best reads I ever had. Excellent (that's why I won't spoil the plot)."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"Isaac Asimov's Foundation is one of the most extraordinary books I've ever read. Its brilliant plot, minute detail and far-ranging scope are unequaled. Another plus for this book is that you realised it didn't focus on 1 main character; it's focus was on the evolution of the Foundation as a whole. More, it's the first book in the most famous science fiction series ever. A must-read for any serious SF fan."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"Asimov's entire line of work, and namely the 'Foundation' novels, have long been considered by some to be the gold-standard of science fiction. As an avid reader of the genre, I felt implied to give the series a whirl, to see what all the fuss is about and to finally spend some time with one of the grand-daddies of the golden age. So I bought 'Foundation', along with the other two novels in the original trilogy, and away I went.Very boring. Very dry. Very forgettable. The problem here, I think, is that while Asimov had some very fantastic ideas floating around in that pioneering noggin of his, he was not exactly the best at nurturing them into full-form on the page. Thus, we have a series of novels that read much more like outlines of a stronger and more fleshed-out epic. The setting is grand, the characters are intriguing. The plot is one for the ages. The final product, however, does little justice to these ideas and I found that to be vastly disappointing. All throughout, I wanted more. I wanted more world-building - not necessarily technobabble and meandering Dickenson discription, but at least more insight into the nature of this vast civilization apparently on the brink of collapse. Very much the same with the characters - I wanted to sympathize with Hari Seldon as he worked to keep knowledge alive in the face of ignorance, but it was so hard to do so when he was presented as little more than a piece of animated cardboard. I was thinking constantly about what could have been, and that put a damper on the overall effect.I think the ideas and character tropes Asimov put forth in his trilogy have been worked with by other authors and brought to life far more successfully in the years since its initial release. Novels that come to mind are Dan Simmons's awe-inspiring 'Hyperion' series and Neal Stephenson's bulky 'Anathem'. In these books, great ideas are coupled with great writing. The results, as much as it hurts me to say it, put Asimov's original to shame.'Foundation' is a great series to read if you want to witness science fiction as it was in its infantile and supposedly-golden age. But I think that it#s nevertheless important to understand that pioneering ideas can further develop and be presented in far-superior ways as the years progress. Such is the case here. Imaginative, but slow and dated. Should most certainly remain in print and continue to be read, but I do not think it is the gold-standard classic it has been made out to be. Others have done much better."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"Foundation is set about 12,000 years in the future where the weakening grip of the galactic empire is showing strong signs of decline.Enter Hari Seldon, key figure in the book, whom, as per his psycho-historical mathematics claims to bring 30,000 years of barbarism down to a mere 1000 by setting up two foundations at the opposite ends of the galaxy. The story about the first Foundation follows and here asimov attacks typical sociological issues and how the infant society deals with them.It is more of a series of well-connected snapshots over several decades, rather than a contiguos moving story/time line. The only weakness of the book, if you want to call it that, is the lack of good character development... but it doesnt impede the reader from following the twists and turns of the plot.Foundation is the first book in what is perhaps Sci-Fi's most imaginative and complete series by Issac Asimov.

Asimov was a man of great ideas and scientific knowledge, but I do not believe that he ever took a creative writing class. He was writing back in the days when a writer wrote, rather than talked about writing. So, OK, some of the characters talk as though they are in a cowboy movie. So, OK, some of the dialogic phrasings are awkward or stilted. So, OK, there is only one teeny tiny female character (as a black man myself, I might aslo point out that we of the African Diaspora are noticeably absent from the futuristic roll call). The whole idea of psychohistory is so engaging that you sit there for hours pondering it and thinking, and he was so young when he wrote this. So young.

His visions of the future are as or more astounding then Orson Well's and his story-telling ability ranks among the best. It might be a &quot;Seldon&quot; crisis if you don't read this book.

Hari Seldon realizes it and, using the science of psychohistory, the prediction of the future in broad, statistical terms, establishes two Foundations &quot;at opposite ends of the Galaxy&quot; to cushion the Fall. This, the first of the classic Foundation series to be written (though only 3rd in chronological order), traces the early development of the First Foundation as it struggles first simply to survive in the prescence of powerful, hostile Kingdoms (which had formerly been parts of the Galactic Empire), and then to gradual growth and domination of its area of the Galaxy, and the promise of eventually establishing a Second Galactic Empire.

There are almost none of the crudities of most other American sci-fi. I prefer the Foundation and the first novella of Second Foundation to the latter half of the trilogy; Asimov grew a little tired of his main theme as he progressed, although he still has some memorable scenes, such as the description of Rossem. The French translation of this is itself a classic, and irons out Asimov's occasional 'mass-market' juvenilic elements into a very high level of literate expression. But the English is far from bad to begin with, and has, if not a Gibbonian, at least an H.G. Wellsian flavor. Asimov's later Foundation novels are far below the three volumes of the Foundation trilogy proper. They resemble the common run of American sci-fi - aimless plots, flavorless language, etc. I am always puzzled that some people don't think Asimov has convincing characters. Who remembers, or cares, about the characters of a Heinlein or Clarke? But Asimov has at least a dozen characters that are known to every sci-fi fan. Asimov possesses a masculine vigor of language and an episodical manner of imagination that pleases me very much."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"The best example around of Asimov's work. It is intellectual, interesting, and just plain entertaining. reading it, you can feel the danger that the fledgeling Foundation is in when threatened by its aggeressive neighbors and there are unconventional solutions. I have only two complaints. The book is dated and there is little action. Get past those and you're sure to enjoy the book."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"One of the problems with the original Foundation was that Asimov seemed unsure of where he wanted to go. However, in Foundation and Empire, he finds his way. The story of the Mule is pure genious. With psychic powers being a cliche in SF today, it is hard for the modern reader to appreciate. The part when the Mule's identity is revealed gave me chills, even the second time."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"I really liked this book, but I want to give you some warnings about my tastes &amp; what I found odd about it. First I used to read history books for fun &amp; sometimes I still do. Second there were absolutely no female characters in this one. This struck me as bizarre then &amp; it still does (by the way I'm a male &amp; most definitely not a feminist)The later foundation books ,especially those written in the 80's &amp; 90's, are better characterized &amp; women are much better characterized. Also this is a 1940's view of the future. That doesn't mean it's dated (are Dumas or Poe dated?) it just means you have to put it in context. Why did I like it then? My love of history, the ideas, the grandness, &amp; unrepentant sentimentality. I think if I read it again I might not like it as much, but the memory of it's great. If you know a teenager reading star trek books do what my dad did &amp; give them this."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"I have read every book in the Foundation Series. The First must be read to fully appreciate all the others, but the best one in the series is Foundation and Earth. It's so unfortunate that the publishers who don't have the rights to this novel in the series don't include it in their lists."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"I have read 5 of the 7 foundation books. I find this one to be the least enjoyable, but I still consider it a classic. While Asimov's writing style improved over the years, Foundation is still a great read. Psychohistory is such an interesting idea, that it makes one think if it is possible. Although the books get better as the publishing years increase, the first one is still a great one. One note, though. Asimov's style of &quot;action&quot; here is not excellent, so be forewarned. Personally, I find his Robot series more enjoyable, but Foundation is still one of the best series ever written. I would give 4.5 stars, but unfortunately I cant."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"I doubt I shall ever come across a better writer of history or Science Fiction in this lifetime.Asimov was a great student of history, psychology, and science. Unlike most students and academics, though, Asimov also was a superb writer in each area and could distill the essence of his knowledge into entertaining non-fiction or fiction. Read his books regarding history of civilization or about Black Holes or about religion and I'm sure you will appreciate his knowledge about such diverse topics and his ability to keep you awake at night reading!I'm not saying you will agree with his every point - only that you will be exposed to a well-articulated discussion.In the Foundation series, it is clear Asimov has combined history and psychology to an extraordinary degree. The question is, was this young man of Russian birth writing of Russia's future or was he merely writing of England's past?You see, a great civilization has encompassed all the known world. Then, inevitably, it will begin a collapse. As in other empires, collapse begins in part due to the burdensome administrative hub (Moscow, Washington DC or London?), combined with a recession at a time when the outcast and downtrodden are fed up with unemployment and unfulfilled promises of a better future (Eastern Europe or the inner cities of America or Britain). This dilemma is further exacerbated by revolutionaries and terrorists in the hinterlands.Enter Mr. Seldon. Clearly he is based on the alter ego of Asimov himself, for the man is a student of mathematics, psychology, religion and history, as well as of politics.I could write a book to dissect the brilliance of the writing and the lessons for all leaders, but will simply say that Foundation, Foundation & Empire, and Second Foundation make up my favorite all-time trilogy. No knock against Lord of the Rings intended. LOTR is terrific but not quite as good."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"Having suffered the derision of fellow sci-fi fans for many years, I recently picked up the Foundation Trilogy for the first time; I was actually pretty disappointed by my first exposure to Asimov's longer works. Obviously the man is one of the renowned masters of science fiction because he got there first: he wrote about a Galactic Empire long before it became cliche, speculated about the limits and triumphs of science, etc. That said, what struck me most about this beginning to the Foundation series was that Asimov's story exactly parallels Hari Seldon's theory of psychohistory: only movements, not individuals, are significant in shaping history, and even the main characters in the book are accordingly underdeveloped to the point of being forgettable. I enjoy world-building as much as the next sci-fi/fantasy buff, but I also appreciate well-constructed sentences and good characterization, both of which I found sorely lacking here. Also, &quot;Foundation&quot; is clearly a man's world, setting a tradition of male adolescent sci-fi in which strong and/or interesting female characters have no place.I give the novel three stars only because it sets up the background for the next two in the series, which overcome some (but not all) of the faults in this first effort. But I think that I will return to my personal favorites among the old masters, including Robert Heinlein and Theodore Sturgeon, who have always delivered philosophy, wit, and imagination along with excellent storytelling."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"The story is one of the most detailed, most thought-out stories ever. Covering more than 10.000 pages, this is the most involving story you will ever read ! Make sure to read ALL books !"},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"This is the best Sci-Fi ever. Asimov's Foundation universe was the start of modern sci-fi, Star Wars &amp; Star Trek's ships and technology are both copied from the Foundation. This the start of the best sci-fi series ever. The Foundation trilogy is a must read. = )"},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"Asimov had some interesting concepts in this novel. It's unfortunate that he killed them with his stale characters and unbelievable plot devices. The book (and its successors) read like an episode of Leave It to Beaver set in outer space. The repetitive vault openings became tediously predictable - I felt like I had read the same chapter a dozen times. Read the Cliff Notes, save yourself some time. *****"},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"I know! I'm as surprised as you are that I didn't enjoy this much-touted classic! I added it to my list of summer must-reads, and it was probably the worst of the bunch. After the second or third time an expected dramatic climax was suddenly resolved by a literal deus ex machina, the thrill was gone. Maybe Asimov was being ironic?? I did enjoy meeting a trader who could've been a Han Solo relative, but that was the highlight. Asimov fans may enjoy this one, but I will stick to Clarke, Bradbury, and Heinlein."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"I read this book based on overall good reviews of the series and Asimov in general. The story had some interesting moments and actually started off quite solidly. But then, the politics took over and the Sci-Fi aspect was completely lost. This book felt like a drama class play that could have taken place anywhere and almost at anytime. I never felt like I was in space or that anything related to Sci-Fi was present. I didnt mind the story so much but being a Sci-Fi book means that I expect some technical \\"sciency\\" details and didnt get anything in this book. I also did not like the huge jump from each major chapter regarding time. Just when you feel that the plot and characters are \\"settlling-in\\" you jump 80 years and have to start all over again. Lastly, there was very little scene setup. I rarely knew where the dialog was taking place or what the surroundings were...hence the comparison to a stage play.If you like Arthur Clark's style of Sci-Fi like me and prefer the Science aspect of Sci-Fi to be featured in books you read then I would not recommend this book. It is somewhat over-rated and isn't really Sci-Fi In my opinion...."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"The first time I tried to read Foundation, I was six years old, and it was simply too complex for my developing mind. Just a few months ago, however, I was cleaning out my attic and came across the same old book. To ascertain it's actual nature as interpreted by the adult mind, I read it again. I was amazed not only by the sheer brillance and ingenuity of the ideas contained within it, not only by the grandiose size of the subject matter, but mostly by the writing, which I regarded as absolutely horrid. The plot is clunky, the conversations roll off the tongue like sandpaper covered in peanut butter, and the descriptions could have been written better by some obscure species of mosquito. As a book, it could be improved by changing the title from &quot;Foundation&quot; to &quot;How Not to Write a Book&quot; or &quot;Please Steal These Ideas and Rewrite Them in English.&quot; I highly reccomend it to people for use as a very expensive and ineffective paperweight."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"Foundation came to me highly recommended. I am not new to science fiction, but I have not read that much of this genre. I was looking forward to something that would really blow my mind away. though I admired several things about the book and thought it was a nice read, I am not going to read the other books in this series. Coming away from this book, I felt it was good, but not much more. There were several ways in which I clearly found the book to be lacking. Though Asimov's style is surely concise and highly readable, he views plot as the central element to his writing, at the expense of other aspects of great fiction that really should have been incorporated. I will outline these at length because it appears that the book's praises are already sung widely.First, there is not much character development. Characters are presented merely to accomplish a historical event in the flow of the story. We get a feel for the characters not as real people, but as actors on the stage of world history. Though the reader admires the nerve and intellect behind each of these heroes, there is little else that makes them interesting. While this kind of presentation of characters may work in movie adaptations or history textbooks, I like to view my characters as a little more than men at work. Everybody is always scheming, there's not much downtime or description of what day-to-day life is like with these guys so far in the future, such far-off planets.Secondly, there is a lack of real meaning or symbolism that defines great books. The closest we get to intrinsic meaning is the description of the false religion that Salvor Hardin invents. And this only helps us understand what the author probably thinks about organized religion. The all-importance of nuclear energy also seems like propaganda to get ther reader to &quot;understand&quot; how important it will be in our era, with no attention paid to other kinds of fascinating technology that may exist in the future, such as super-intellect, robotics, biotechnology, etc. I don't know if Asimov was just lacking in creativity, because with the exception of his brilliant description of the mother planet Trantor, the only thing different between this far off future and nowadays is the ability to jump through space.Thirdly, romance does not play a role in the book. There no women in the book, which means there can be no romantic intrigue, or world events influenced by a woman. Also, there is no sense of wonder and excitement that a reader surely hopes to get when they enter an author's imagination. The landscape of these far off worlds is sparesely and hardly described. We spend much of our time in staterooms.On the other hand, if you like books that are centered on brilliant leaders of nation-states and how their decisions affect the course of history, you will like this book. If you are fascinated by the economic, political, and sociological macroforces that shape history, you will like this book. If you're more about the game than the players, you will like this book."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"Foundation consists of five stories separated by several decades each. The Trantorian Empire has lost its hold on the outer perimeter of the galaxy. Hari Seldon, founder of the predictive science of psychohistory, knows that the Empire is doomed to collapse and that thirty millennia of barbarism and anarchy will ensue before a second empire will rise. But Seldon claims to know a way to shorten the dark ages from 30,000 years to a single millennium.The stories in Foundation chronicle the infancy and development of Seldon's Foundation society initially established on the remote planet Terminus. Seldon's psychohistory predicts several crises that the Foundation must survive in order to bring about the desired drastic shortening of the dark ages. Four of the five stories each describe a crisis that confronts the Foundation.So far I've read the Robot series, the Empire series, and the first three books in the Foundation series (Prelude to Foundation, Forward the Foundation, Foundation). I find the epic story so far to be extremely engaging and imaginative. The stories in Foundation are a bit disconnected and not fleshed out enough, but nevertheless do a more than adequate job of describing the fall of the Galactic Empire."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"This book is amazing. After waiting all these years to jump onto the Asimov train I am glad that I am finally here; the book is thoughtful, smart, and paced wonderfully. The solutions to the Seldon problems all provoke different themes the novel wishes to convey.The book is a short easy read and if you like Sci-Fi, I recommend this book to you."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"I decided to reread the Asimov series in order. Asimov's &#34;Foundation series&#34; novels are classics of the science fiction genre. Some of the foundation novels drag on a bit but &#34;Foundation and Empire&#34; moves along well. The Asimov style emphasizes interpersonal relationships as opposed to showcasing gee-whiz science fiction apparatus. If you like science fiction you should read the foundation series novels as they are the basis of a lot of subsequent science fiction novels. Indeed, Star Wars may have been based on the Foundation novels or at least influenced their development."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"I bought the complete series of the Foundation for my husband, because he hadn't read it before.

This series is almost 50 years old but still among the best SF stories ever"},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"Throughout the past 12,000 years, the Galactic Empire has been expanding from Trantor, its capital planet, throughout the galaxy. How humans found Trantor, or where Earth is (and other questions about Earth), are currently unanswerable. All that is known is that this empire, which controls billions of worlds, is in a permanent social and political recession -- in other words, it is dying. Hari Seldon, reknowned psychohistorian (AKA scientist who predicts future trends) has predicted that 30,000 years will pass before a second Galactic Empire will rise. To shorten the dark age to 1,000 years, he has created a Foundation - a group of people dedicated to preserving knowledge - on the edge of the galaxy in the hope that they will share their knowledge after the fall of the Galactic Empire and create a new, and greater, Galactic Empire. Foundation is divided into four stories, which go through history from Seldon's project through the ascent of the Foundation. Taking concepts from Gibbon's Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, Foundation is an extraordinary book and is strongly recommended to all readers of science fiction."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"In a word, story. That's what this is book is meant, story. As a best-class story-teller, Asimov, leads the reader into an intrincated, labyrhynthical STORY, where mathematics play a role as important as human emotions, meanwhile, both are interlaced so closely and deeply, that psicohistory raises up to capitalize human knowledge in &quot;favour&quot; of the final survival of the galactic culture.Despite the general opinion of classical criticism , that Asimov was not quite a good SF writer, but a fantasy one with no base to be considered in the universe of &quot;hard&quot; sci-fi, I should say that it's a long way walk between writing and simply reading a book, and this may not be the most-spectacular guide to science and techno-details, but it's in a way (a very particular one) the best ever writen"},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"Many of the ideas and terminology is very old time, and retro.

The story of the last years of the Trantor Empire helped me understand a lot about our society. Even though I read it in College I still have Harry Seldon name stock in my mind. Isaac uses this story to present his theories on how science and religion influence our society. It is a marvelous saga of a loooong story of a new Empire (USA?) build after the fall of an old one (Britain?). More or less this will be a very entertaining textbook on social science of history. A must for a serious SCFI reader."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"The fall of the Galactic Empire having been foreseen by the great Hari Seldon through his Psychohistory, a colony, of sorts, of scholars was established on a planet far from the center of the Empire.This Foundation, as the colony is referred, is intended to limit the chaos sure to follow from the Empire's eventual fall. Proceeding the fall, various small dominions erupt, and for a time the Foundation treads water as a neutral entity, but things soon come to a head, and action must be taken. Unfortunately, scholars are not the best equipped to handle such situations.From the outcome of these events, the political structure of the Foundation is altered, and from there again does a conflict occur. As there was such a concentration of intellectual beings in the Foundation, there was no decline in technology as in the rest of the former Empire. And so might superior technology aid in the well-being of the Foundation, as well as its regard from neighbors.This book is actually several separate stories, taking place at different times in the early history of the Foundation, as the citizens try to fulfill the goal of Hari Seldon, now long dead, but nonetheless still influential. These stories are very well written, and obviously had a great deal of thought put into them as to how the collapse and restoration of such an entity might proceed. If you like REAL science fiction, I highly recommend this book, you won't regret it."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"The Foundation series is the best ever. True, it is set in the future but you don't have to like sci-fi at all to appreciate the true brilliance of Isaac Asimov. The Foundation is a short book. Give it a try. I'll be surprised if you don't immediately pick up the next in the series when you are done!"},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"Two stories in one, this book is an excellent follow up to Foundation, and a dramatization of the strength of mind over muscle.First the Foundation is threateded by the Galactic Empire. While I disagree with the unimportance of the individual (after all, wasn't Hari Seldon himself one person who changed history), it does show the travails as a small group of Foundationers try to stop the General, when he is stopped by the very corrupt bureaucracy he serves.In the second, he brings in a new factor. The Foundation, secure and dominant but not agressive, is threatened by the Mule, a person who can control the emotions of others, reshape them into whatever he wants. Part of a slightly more fantastic area of Science Fiction, he still pulls it off well. This time it does come down to individual effort again to stop the Mule, by opponents who could not defeat him one on one but do so by their determination and individual organization.This time, he did not labor under the false assumption that he had to write a limited number of pages, so he was able to flesh out the characters more and make the plot twists more intricate, and did a truly excellent work."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"First I will detail the faults of this book. It is too brief. Mr. Asimov was working under the assumption that he had to keep it under a certain length, and so abbreviated it unfairly, cutting certain amounts of plot and character development.That aside, this book is excellent, showing the struggle against adversity and brains versus brute force that is so lacking in most modern literature. It is true that Science Fiction is the Modern version of Romantic (the time period) literature, and Asimov carried the beacon."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"I was so disappointed in the first book, Foundation, I gave it two stars. I've been wanting to read the trilogy for years and I couldn't believe that that mediocre pulp was it! But Foundation and Empire is the saving grace. I look forward to the next book."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"This is the second Foundation Novel I have read in the whole series and it just gets me more excited for the rest. This book really brings into light the tone of the series and where it can go. Honestly Asimov is a genius. :)"},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"SPOILERS AHEAD!!!When I wrote the review for the first book in this series my review was number 336, this time I'm number 90, which probably means that most reviewers said what they had to say about the trilogy in their review of the first book. This is ironic considering this second book is where the real fun begins.I'm assuming here that you read Foundation, I'm HOPING you even liked it. If you did then you will probably notice that there are only two stories in this book as opposed to the five in the previous one. Don't let the lack of quantity bother you though, These stories are longer for the simple reason that they need to be.For me personally, there was always something that bothered me about the premise of this series. Simply put, I didn't like the fact that humanity is reduced to mathematics. That's TOO simple though, because I happen to think that if you try hard enough, you CAN reduce (or perhaps distill is a better word) humankind down to mathematics, but the Seldon plan makes no allowance for the individual.At least, that's what I thought after reading Foundation. As it turns out, these two stories deal with just that theme. Not only that, but they seem to state opposite views on the subject.The first part of the book finds the Foundation taking on the remains of the Great Galactic Empire. The heroes of this part are, as usual, simply the mouthpieces for the various viewpoints and have little personality of their own. They run about and try to save the Foundation with some daring do (but it's Asimov so the said daring do mostly involves people arguing with each other about stuff) while the Foundation calmly trounces the Empire and renders their whole storyline moot.Here, the group wins out while the individual is rendered completely impotent while the group kicks butt. So, group 1, individual 0Then comes the second (and significantly longer) story: The Mule. The Mule is notable for having the first attempt at creating characters that are in any way interesting. For the most part I personally don't think he succeeds, but as I said in my review for the first book, I don't read Foundation for that reason so there's no great loss there.The Mule is a psychic who comes out of nowhere and crushes the Seldon Plan to dust! Since the plan cannot take individuals into account, a weird mutant can do more damage than the old Empire could do. Here, the individual rules and the mighty Foundation is brought to its knees.So, group 1, individual 1. We'll have to wait for the next book to see who comes out on top.As much as I love this classic work, the ideas behind it seem muddled and somewhat contradictory. I would imagine this came from the fact that these were written as discrete short stories and not as a cohesive whole.Despite these criticisms however, this is still very readable if you liked the first book and I'm sure you can find some criticisms of your own in here. Also, keep in mind that there is another Foundation out there... \\"At Star's End\\"So let's head there shall we?"},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"The second book in the Foundation series continues the narrative of the first; it chronicles the defeat of the decaying Galactic Empire by the Foundation, and its subsequent defeat by the mutant intelligence that is the Mule. Asimov's books are an almost perfect blend of suspense, action, dialogue, character-building, world-building, narrative, and plot. He knows how to keep the pages turning. Even the less interesting half of the book (the first-half) is still enjoyable - it's just that the second part is so much more interesting; the twist at the end is especially something to be savored. Like all his books, the joy comes from not just the narrative itself, but the situations that Asimov places his characters in, and how they ingeniously improvise solutions to their dilemmas. The Foundation series is, irrefutably, classic science fiction, and it makes one wonder why Hollywood hasn't taken these literary gems and processed them into something less fine and lacking luster.One minor grievance; some phrases seem to reappear in multiple books of the series. Asimov seems particularly fond of the adjective \\"sardonically\\" - but this can scarcely be deemed a flaw, just something that one might notice."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"The second book in the original trilogy, and the fourth book overall, Foundation and Empire is the great sequel to Foundation. It's really two different stories set many years apart.The first story covers the empires attempt to conquer the First Foundation led by its last great general. The second covers the mutant known as the Mule and his attempt to conquer the entire galaxy. The mysterious Second Foundation comes into play for the first time at the end of this book.Like its predecessor, at only 320 pages it makes a quick and interesting read. As one of the few sequels I've ever read which isn't a let down from the book it follows, I highly recommend it as well as the rest of the series."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"Asimov has crafted a sci-fi masterpiece in this novel. It is this novel that takes the Foundation series to a new level of brilliance. While the original novel is strong, this book is stronger. One advanatage of this book over its predecessor is that it is a single story as opposed to a series of novellas. This yields greater investment in the characters as they develop throughout the book. Asimov displays here all the attributes that have earned him monolithic status among sci-fi writers--unforgettable characters, ahead-of-his-time technology, and an entrancing plot with endless twists and turns. Essential reading for sci-fi fans."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"Great book! Second in the series of three novels, all three are worth the read. I read all three in about two and half weeks. It might be interesting to read them in conjunction with Kuhn's Structures of Scientific Revolutions. Every \\"Seldon Crisis\\" brings about a \\"new world\\". Really fun stuff. Don't miss out!"},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"I first read the foundation triology in high school in the early 60's.Nearly 50 years later, reading it again was almost like reading forthe first time. Asimov added two more books later, but the first threeare the real classics here. The concept of psychohistory may be as importantas the novels are good. I haven't seen any movies made from thesestories, but it seems like they deserve that.Before there was ever an x-man there was the mule;that chance of genetic nature of a psi mutant who could change mens mindsas he pleased. The plan couldn't account for this, but the second foundationwas never found by the mule. I recognized in the mule a manvery like the French Napoleon who could take advantage ofthe weaknesses of others. In later life Asimov became verymuch 'hard science' orientated so that these early space operatype novels were actually rationalized into an artificial unified time linethat really does a disservice to their original intension in my view.I still like this book with age!"},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"If you consider Star Wars as George Lucas's answer to Asmiov's \\"Foundation\\" then this is very much in the mode of Episode V. Asimov spent the first book building up his psychohistory paradigm just to knock it down in Foundation and Empire. A much darker and more intense book, downbeat in mood, and leading to the inevitable conclusion in Second Foundation."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"This is certainly an excellent \\"first\\" book in the Asimov series. Even if one has not read, Prelude to Foundation, you can pick up right up and enjoy the series. Sets the stage for the next books in the series, but also makes one think, \\"What would happen if America lost its power sources?\\""},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"The first book of Asimov's classic Foundation Trilogy. It is a must-read for any true fan of science fiction. Like other great works of the genre, it has held up over time, and is one of those books that you'll find yourself going back to read again and again. I highly recommend it. Be sure to also check out the other two books of the Foundation Trilogy, \\"Foundation and Empire\\" and \\"Second Foundation\\"."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"Here in the second installment of Azimov's fantastic Foundation epic, you have a continuation from the first that at first seems a let down. Then the Mule shows up and the action really gets going.The first part is about the General and the reason I say it's a letdown is that what you think is going to happen, and hope for the sake of action is going to happen, doesn't. It's important that it doens't and makes a good point.The Mule however is where the meat is as others have stipulated. He's a monkey wrench in the whole plan Hari Seldon put together to save humanity during the 'Dark Ages' after the collapse of the Galactic Empire. Well written and a definite must for any who claim to love sci-fi."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"I first read Foundation as a bored teen, with no idea what it was about. Foundation is a book which demands to be read quickly, and thus the impression, amidst the brilliant storyline, is often shallow.I read it this time in a couple of hours; I would've read it quicker without work and cafes and other impediments, but basically I devoured it. And because it read so fast, the impressions of the individual stories flickered past too.The sense of history as pattern is stronger in this book than any single narrative. Having read the brilliant new Foundation trilogy, written by the three Bs (Brin, Benson, and Bear) which tells the personal life story of Hari Seldon, the very brief treatment of Seldon in the first trilogy is more notable for what is unsaid. Hari is just another name in history for Asimov; the hero is the idea, even the fast-flow of the narrative of itself might be called the Hero, because the whole notion of story here is webbed against historical patterns so closely.Briefly, then, Foundation has the setup and three payoffs. The setup is Hari Seldon arranging exile to Terminus.Salvor Hardin's politicization of Terminus is the first payoff, and is especially brilliantly written.Smyrnian Trader Limmar Ponyet's chicanery on planet Askone's closed market demonstrates the limits of religion and is the second payoff.Then Hober Mallow's power grab and abandonment of religion for trade as a means for influence in the third.The story starts and ends with court cases, first against Hari Seldon and last against Hober Mallow. The ideology of the book is anti-violence and pro social and economic measures. In fact it may be the first really positive exploration of what has come to be called \\"soft power\\", of which the European Union is the present example.The great touches of image serve to cast a deeper shadow on the role of public morality in sustaining a civilisation. For instance, the ambassador from Anacreon presents the hilt of his gun as a symbol of peaceful intentions when he visits Salvor Hardin on Terminus.In the context of history the book is extraordinarily complex and sophisticated. Social and economic complexity is reduced and strained free of dense matter and difficulty, like consomme soup, made to be thin yet delicious and easily consumed. The very first thought I had at the end of reading Foundation was \\"how I wish there were a history of Rome so readable and fast and easy to consume!\\"Normally I read Foundation in a great hurry (as I have this time) in combination with the other two books, Foundation and Empire, and Second Foundation. But I only have a copy of the first book of the trilogy and must make do with it.The first payoff is quite brilliant, because it is delayed and played out indirectly, thus deflecting the thrill of emotional rush into intellectual wonder. Specifically, Salvon Hardin delays the confrontation between Terminus and Anacreon for thirty years, years which Asimov summarizes in a bitter and brilliant battle of words between the old Hardin and young Sek Sermak. Thus the reader feels that the payoff is deferred. The reader senses an even bigger payoff at the far end of the section, \\"Mayors\\". And Asimov does not fail us. For Salvor Hardin travels to Anacreon to personally entrap the evil regent there and defeat him - again, inevitably, with soft power. Hardin defeats his enemy on the enemy's territory, at the precise moment when it seems all is lost for the Foundation.One is left with the distinct impression that brains defeat brawn, skilled inaction and insight defeat busyness and boldness, and that the power of wisdom and foresight overcomes even a social collapse on the scale of the fall of the Roman Empire - as indeed they did. For the Fall of Rome resulted in the rise of Christendom, and with it a grand tradition - so Asimov's message, by locating a historical European lesson in the distant future - becomes a timeless affirmation of human excellence.Foundation thus stands virtually alone in the field of science fiction novels in excellence."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"Clear intelligent prose marks this as well as Asimov's other books. The fact that there is hardly any action in this trilogy, and yet it is still fun to read, shows you how good Asimov is at writing just \\"intellectual\\" fiction.But the truth be told, Foundation is not \\"the greatest sci-fi series of all time.\\" Sure, it won the Hugo that said just that. But that was only about fifteen years after the trilogy was published, and, remember, only fifteen years after the Hugo Award was instituted. Fifteen years isn't long enough to be making grandiose all-time statements like that.After Foundation, Asimov was to grow as a writer. He said so himself. He admits its faults: lack of a strong cohesive story; weak characterization; hardly any females. It is also now extremely dated. You can just \\"feel\\" that it was written circa 1950.The books aren't even novels, but a collection of stories. That's how it was executed; he never set out to write a trilogy. It is not as complex as you'd think the \\"greatest\\" should be. It lacks a certain depth. Just look at Dune: how Herbert portrayed the religious mind, how religion and commerce and politics all affected one another. On the other hand, Asimov never really understood the religious. So in the Foundation trilogy, priests are like frightened children, driven only by superstition.It may be a classic, but it is not a timeless classic. Yes, Foundation is definitely not his best series. Try the Robot novels."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"You've already read the publisher's summary for yourself, so let me just add that this is THE classic SF trilogy. Book one, \\"Foundation,\\" creates the future world, its declining culture, and how a group of strong-minded individuals don't want to see knowledge die. How they do that drives this novel. In book two, Asimov introduces the mystery of the mule, and in book three Asimov pulls a rabbit out the hat called the Second Foundation.If you enjoy books that entertain, books that offer good mysteries, and books that make you think about bigger things in life, than this series is for you. It's too bad our political leaders don't read novels like this. Maybe we'd avoid the continual messes they get countries in."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"Asimov is a must read for any science fiction reader. Even though the writing style leaves something to be desired, the pure imagination of his writing is something memorable. It's hard to imagine Star Wars or any other sci-fi without this book. Asimov barrels through time and the universe passing through hundreds of years in the turn of a page in a way that is rich and convincing. He builds many worlds, characters, and ties it all together through Hari Seldon and his psychohistory (a previously worked out map of human reactions, and thus events, for generations to come) and the Mule (a mutant who throws a wrench in the plan and--like most bad guys, or in this case mutants--seeks world domination). What's incredible about this villian is his strange depth which the reader gets completely secondhand. The book goes on and on with one beautiful idea after another. For example, a strange jester/clown character, Magnifico, that the heroes--Bayta and Torie--pick up plays an instrument called the sono-visor. This instrument harnasses the alpha waves of the brain and mixes melody with image in each listener. Now how's that for cool? Asimov wows the reader again and again with clearly explained inventive ideas. This book is the first of a trilogy. A must read for anyone with an interest in literature or science-fiction."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"The Foundation Trilogy is timeless. Asimov is the master. No wonder it won a Hugo for best all-time series.It's the fall of the Galactic Empire and the rise of the Foundation guided by psychohistory (a scientific method of predicting the future) developed by the Foundation's founder, Hari Seldon.Classic Sci Fi!"},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"There are a lot of people reviewing this book on this website who give it low reviews because it's dated. Yeah, sure, it's dated...it was written in the forties, it's going to be dated, but that doesn't lower the quality of the story.Now that that's out of the way: this book is great. Asimov is unbelievably smart, and Foundation shows it. The story to Foundation is interesting: the Galactic Empire is crumbling and its demise will turn the entire galaxy to barbarism for thirty thousand years, if steps arn't taken to lighten the blow. That's where the Foundation comes in. Through a series of crises, the Foundation should be able to shorten the length of time of barbarism from thirty thousand years to only a thousand.Foundation just covers the first few crises, so the book skips forward in time. This causes the trouble with the character development that everyone complains about. When a character is given only a few chapters to develop in, they won't really develop.Asimov really is the master of science fiction."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"Ive been a long time sci-fi/fantasy fan. However, it has taken me many years to finally pick up a book Ive heard so much about. Through the first half of the book, it felt like the average sci-fi novel. However, as I neared the end, I found myself enjoying it. Asimov included some witty political resolutions to the puzzles and 'Seldon crisis' throughout the book. I kept wanting more of these carefully crafted shorts and was very entertained towards the end.Asimov could have executed the story a little better so that the timeline didn't skip fifty years after every short. The lasting effect of this piece is somewhat diminished by this fact. Also the repetition of plot will keep me from reading any more of the series. I think it is the tragic flaw in Asimov, too much of a good thing. He has books published about everything it seems. Search for 'Asimov' and you will see what I mean.Overall it was a good book and I highly recommend it. It was an enjoyment to pass the time with."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"This book sets the stage for the rest of the series. Hari Seldon is introduced and his theories of Psychohistory are explained. Then Seldon's Foundation is established on Terminus, a remote planet at the edge of the Empire, with the goal of shortening the period of barbarism the universe will experience. However, there are no Psychohistorians located in the Foundation... only scientists. The planet has very few native metals and virtually no defenses. The scientists must figure out how to rule their world and fend off avaricious neighbors as the Empire begins to crumble. The majority of this first volume contains vignettes chronicling the Foundation leaders responding to various crises that Hari Seldon predicted centuries before. The crises are varied and plausible. The solutions to the problems that arise are not solved by any miraculous means, but by tough, clever political maneuvering. Watching the crises and their solutions unfold is very enthralling and keeps you turning the pages at a rapid pace."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"Being a science fiction fan for some years, I picked up a copy of Foundation after hearing wonderful things about this series and loving I, Robot. On the whole, I think I, Robot is a better read, largely because I got to know and empathize with the characters in that set of stories more, which is my main criticism of this book.Nevertheless, Foundation is still very worthwhile, and while I wouldn't recommend this book to everyone, there are certain friends who I think would love it - it's for a select audience who loves science fiction and/or Isaac Asimov. I am going to continue on with the series - and we'll see how it goes!"},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"This book was recommended to me for a writing exercise, and I was surprised to find that I enjoyed it as much as I learned from it. I had lumped Asimov in with Clarke as a boring SF writer, and I was quite wrong. This book also works amazing magic with the passage of time and circumstance, and despite how quickly characters drop out of the landscape of the novel, the reader remains interested. A masterful work from one of the great masters.If you don't know much about SF, this is a good book for you; if you are a SF fan who thinks Asimov has nothing to offer you, this is a great book for you. Pick it up."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"People like to throw five star reviews at just about anything. I suppose they feel that almost everything written is as good as it gets. Foundation is one that deserves all five stars.It's a classic. The premise is intriguing. The story unwinds brilliantly over three books. Don't expect to read The Foundation alone. It does leave you hanging. The next two books in the trilogy are a must.This is one of a handful of solid, enduring works that will be enjoyed long after other works fade off the lists..."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"Ah Foundation, this is perhaps one of the best and highly original works of Dr. Asimov. I was impressed that a man of only 20 could come up with such a creative vision of the future, it was not only the very distant future but one aside from most of the common stereotypes. This books plot line was excellent, he sounded like he really knew what he wanted from the get go, and not make it up as he went along. If i had to change a thing, it would be; i would like to see some of these characters come to a complete close, I'm not saying that i would like to put a stop to the big gaps through time, but make the characters have a little more closure.I think that you will get a lot out of this book as far as understanding plain human nature, it shows that no matter how far you go into the future there are some human characteristics that will never go away such as faith and greed. Foundation really opens a door for science fiction, especially in the two books remaing in the trilogy, you should definatly read those, as for the other four, that is your choice, i would read the reviews before reading them.As for Foundation, it is an excellent book, the characters are as defined as well as can be for the time alotted for them to portray the story. This is a must read epic that spans almost a thousand years (if you read the whole series) ENJOY!"},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"Foundation. Arguably the greatest creation of science fiction to date, from the most prolific writer of the genre. Isaac Asimov's tour de force first graced the pages of the May edition of Astounding Science Fiction in 1942. By the time the last instalment of the saga was finished in 1992, (only a matter of weeks prior to Asimov's death), the story had gone full circle so that you finished almost where you had set off from. We are initially told of The Seldon Plan; A one thousand year strategy mathematically and statistically conceived by Hari Seldon, to potentially minimise the eventual downfall of the once almost omnipotent, but now crumbling Galactic Empire. Seldon's Plan is for a group of specially chosen settlers to emigrate to Terminus, an uninhabited planet in a remote corner of the galaxy, from where they will create the Encyclopedia Galactica, a definitive omnibus of information necessary to aide a new and even stronger Empire rise long after the anarchy of it's predecessors demise.Throughout five of the seven Foundation books Asimov wrote, the reader witnesses the unfolding of The Seldon Plan, and how the original settlers of Terminus evolve over the centuries, as the work of the long dead Seldon comes to fruition. The two 'prelude' books in the series tell of Seldon's life, and his initial realisation as a young man, the gravity of what must be done to save the people far into the future, while simultaneously trying to instigate his master plan.Upon reading the end of the last of the books in a chronological sense (Foundation & Earth), the reader is gifted with the biggest jaw-dropping, mother of all twists in the story, which turns almost all of what you have read in the previous books upside down. Read Foundation, and guaranteed you'll read the other six books all in immediate succession."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"I am not a science fiction fan without being a fan of the big idea, but in the Foundation Asimov introduced galaxy-wide empires and a plausible new science. There's no new compelling themes in this book. Without that quality, you are left to Asimov's weaknesses: one-dimensional characters and stark writing style, but hey - its still Asimov and his stuff is always fun to read.Like the last book, this is a hodgepodge of short stories Asimov wrote separately. The first half of the book is about a rising general who fights against The Plan but gets swatted down because he can't fight the mathematical forces of psychohistory. The next part is the fun part. One factor was not counted for in his equation: a mutant who knocks The Plan off kilter. To some the identity of the Mule will be laughably obvious. Personally, I was uncertain whether I was on the right track or not.It reads like a mystery novel , though dry in style and severely lacking in the human quotient. Nonetheless, it is a continuing tale of the rise and fall of future civilizations, telepathic mutants, and psychohistory. This is THE classic sci-fi trilogy."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"In this sequel to \\"Foundation,\\" Asimov continues to channel Edward Gibbon, charting the rise and fall of the Galactic Empire and the subsequent rebirth, like a phoenix from the ashes, of a new and improved federation.On its own, \\"Foundation and Empire\\" suffers from an acute case of Middle Chapter Syndrome--and this is somewhat surprising since Asimov originally published his trilogy as a series of nine novellas. The reader who isn't familiar with the first \\"Foundation,\\" with its extended prologue and four installments, will be at a loss. In the previous book, each chapter details a different interplanetary chess match between (on the one hand) the long-dead \\"psychohistorian\\" Hari Seldon, who had predicted the empire's demise and who initiated events that will accelerate the rise of a second empire, and (on the other) various individuals who struggle in vain to change the course of that inexorable future.\\"The General\\" and \\"The Mule,\\" the two episodes in this volume, will surprise the reader by departing from the pattern in the previous book. The first and shorter story is the lesser of the two; all the \\"action\\" occurs offstage, and the protagonists wait in suspense for a catastrophe that never really materializes. It's a bit of a letdown, but Asimov presents this incident to make a point: those who think they know when and where historical crises will next occur might miss out entirely on the real predicament at hand.The meat of the book will be found in \\"The Mule,\\" which is presented as a mystery of sorts (although I find it difficult to imagine the reader who won't discern the Mule's \\"secret\\" well before its unveiling). More successfully, this novella is an extended chase scene--it would make a great space adventure movie--in which the Mule's minions pursue our heroes through the far reaches of the universe. The unexpected appearance of a mutant species, represented by the Mule, throws into chaos Seldon's psychohistorical calculations--or does it?Asimov's prose style has always been a bane to language mavens, and the experimental qualities of \\"Foundation and Empire\\" serve to spotlight many of his most pervasive faults. Even by the loose standards of pulp fiction, these two stories suffer from more than their fair share of tautologies, pleonasms, comma splices, sentence fragments, and worse. (No chapter should open with a sentence like either of the following: \\"There was reason to the fact that the element known as 'pure science' was the freest form of life on the Foundation.\\" \\"The blockade was run successfully.\\")But Asimov's fans--myself included--don't turn to his novels for their literary qualities. Instead, we enjoy his ability to present a complicated story and tie up all the loose ends, to weave politics and philosophy and science into his fiction, and to make us think."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"I have heard so much about this book over the years but didn't like Asimov's writing so I never read it. Well, I thought maybe this was different but no, it's the same poor writing. I love the idea of psychohistory but that's where the love ends for this book. And Hari Seldon dies before we get to know and like him. Dull, mostly pointless conversations between people you don't know as the story jumps quickly over time ruin this book. And how lazy of Asimov to not develop his ideas. At one point he gets out of this by having a character watch a movie that we can't see which describes something that would have been interesting and clever had it been developed.I guess I'll finish the series because I've heard the other books are better. Phew, glad I got this out of the way."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"Foundation is the first of three books in the original Foundation trilogy. It's a wonderful exploration of what might be if psychology, sociology and statistics could be melded together to predict the future with a high degree of reliability. I found it fascinating as a spiritual analogy, even if that was unintended by Azimov. Read it through the lens of Hari Seldon as a god-type, perhaps you'll find the same interesting subtext that I did."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"Great classic Sci Fi. Loved it. It was fun to notice some of the technology that is already outdated, like microfiche and televisions, how nuclear power was so important, but this didn't affect my interest or enjoyment in the novel."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"I put Asmimov's Foundation series among the finest science fiction ever written. Up there with Lord of the Rings. His brillance is amazing and he takes you into a world of the future that makes sense."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"Foundation is a reread for me (I read it way back when I was in high school), and to be honest, I can't decide if I liked it more then or if I liked it more now. Which probably means that I felt the same way about it both times.Which is that it is a well-written, intriguing work of thoughtful science fiction.When it comes down to it, Foundation is the type of science fiction that I SHOULD love. It takes place in a believable, scary future, Earth isn't remembered or maybe doesn't even exist, the entire galaxy is populated, and there are lots of cool future gadgets. More than that, it is filled with intelligent people who have to think in interesting, convoluted ways to make the things that happen happen. It even starts off with a mathematician - brilliance!And that is why I DID love this book - I loved trying to figure out how the people were going to think or how they were thinking and what conclusions this would lead them to. It was like a mystery, but one in which you just have to unravel intelligence. The narrative flows beautifully, and the plot is just complex enough to keep you exited and thinking without feeling like Asimov was trying too hard.When it comes down to it, Foundation really is the perfect science fiction novel, and it's no wonder that it won the Hugo and was named \\"Best Science Fiction Series of All Time.\\"But (you knew there was a but coming), I'm not the hugest fan of short stories, and Foundation is, essentially, a series of short stories. Granted, the short stories are so well-linked that you sometimes forget, but when it comes down to it, each chapter is a new story. In each chapter, at least 50 years have passed since the last one, entirely new characters are introduced, and the old ones, for the most part, are rarely mentioned again. The thing linking them is Harri Seldon and the Foundation that he created. It is because of this that, even though I loved it, I can't say that I LOVED it.Still, Foundation is one tight piece of work, and I would recommend it to any and all lovers of science fiction. I mean, when it comes to science fiction, this is it! And I know I'll be rereading the others in the series as well!"},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"I've come to start with four stars as I note that no book is perfect; considering this is just a story, it can't be perfect. My giving a book much less this one four stars is no knock on it.Isaac Asimov and Arthur C. Clark are considered the beginning of 'hard' sci-fi. It's not strictly true as there were guys like H.G. Wells Jules Verne and might I add Johannas Kepler? There's also the Frankenstein story. A point I want to make here is that it seems that nobody has been able to follow in their footsteps! Why? They didn't necessarily mean to just be scientificaly accurate. Their message was scientific humanism. It's the philosophy of being scientific that is portrayed in their books and not just robots and spaceships.Something else that needs to be pointed out is the difference between Isaac Asimov and Arthur C. Clarke. Some would suggest that Arthur C. Clark was more technically sophisticated than Isaac Asimov. Was Arthur C. Clark really all that technically sophisticated in his books? He had guys shooting through a vacuum to get to an A.I. computer gone haywire! Isaac Asimov has faster than light travel by means of space folding in his foundation books(a prediction that may not be so far off . . . in either technical accuracy or time; meaning it could happen sooner than you think!); he has mind reading; we have the ability to plus computers into brains and read what they're thinking and saying now; it's not mass produced(yet); but, it's there. I for one only liked Isaac's first volume of his foundation books because he has this mind-reading which I didn't like; well, what do I know?What seems to continue to set Isaac Asimov's Foundation appart is that of a galactic empire and how it dies(human neglect of rationalism). It should be noted that Isaac managed to connect his foundation books with his empire and robot books; so, he shows how intelligence really grows to dominate a galaxy, and then shows social ways that it can crumble(inspired by the fall of the roman empire).Despite Isaac's reliance on nuclear power as the high technology of the day, his foundation books symbolizes the real issues facing humanity and not what you get on the news channels(actual politics channels; they just call them news channels); they seem to argue for the same things each election year but never solve the same problems! Meanwhile, the science world keeps on chugging(word?lol!) along."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"one would be hard pressed to find better sci-fi in the last 60 years than the foundation novels. what amazing insight these books had."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"I like science fiction in a generalized idea, but sometimes in particular it doesn't work. I think this is mainly because I see two kinds of science fiction. One is what are essentially westerns in space. The second tries to give perspective on the current times by creating some sort of objective viewpoint on current events by giving it distance in space or time. Asimov is more of the second one. I haven't read much of his work as an adult, but I did like his short stories as a child in magazines. Genre stories, until lately, haven't had any pull in the academy so they don't get studied or legitimized scholastically. I like this second kind much better.I like this book, the first of a trilogy and the foundation for several others (pun intended). Asimov explores our relation to information and the predictability of the future based on full information awareness. I will read more of these books, perhaps the whole series because I enjoyed and was tantalized by the possibilities of action in the future of the series. However, one interesting thing is that although Asimov was looking to the future, he was still a product of his time. When he was writing, the technology was nuclear and the future was nuclear. Thus, the future Empire is ruled by nuclear technology. Compare, for example, the cyber-punk fascination with computer technology as a driving force. Computers are almost absent from the world of the Empire and the Foundation. Instead, there are still newspapers (96) and messages are transferred physically. At the very least, if you take this as a futurological document, humanity abandoned mythological superstition. So - you have to read this book as both a look into the future and a historical document. Asimov is a fantastic writer, but he couldn't overcome the limitations of his time."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"Parts of the book I really enjoyed. I appreciate the twists played by characters on one another. I felt that after reading through the entire bit, though, that not enough had actually taken place. I didn't feel I walked away with a story I could remember. I did read in one review that this was \\"serious science fiction,\\" so with that in mind, I still give it five stars. I only would have liked that the pace be quicker.I really really enjoyedThe Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy. I would recommend that over this book Foundation, based on my personal taste."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"The Foundation series is one of the most renowned arcs in all of science fiction. Spanning several volumes, and thousands of years of time, Asimov provides us with a blueprint for our own decadent, ailing society--a prevention, if you will, against the society of the 21st century, as realized later by men like Stephen Baxter inTitan.In the billion-star inclusive Galactic government, Hari Seldon, a brilliant mathematician, devised a way to accurately plot the future by analyzing past events, trends, and movements in human history. Branded a madman, he and his followers are given a kind of half-exile, half-grant to the planet Terminus, to found their Foundation, which, it seems, is to be a focal point of knowledge for Seldon's predicted coming galactic catastrophe.But is that all the Foundation is? A glorified university?Asimov is the herald of a new age, filled with robots, spacetravel and weird technologies beyond our understanding, and sometimes, even our imagination. A thinker, philosopher, and theologian, Asimov's books are chock-full of singular personality and wit.I recommend Foundation as necessary-reading to any fan of science-fiction who has somehow escaped it thus far. You will NOT be unimpressed."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"I never imagined it would have been so political. I also never imagined I'd enjoy a political story so much. The characters are brilliant and well written. I was concerned for them despite how quickly Asimov moved on to the next group. It's more realistic this way than to have just one protagonist that you know will make it to the end of the book. This story take place over a long period of time, though it provides for a surprisingly quick read. A good balance of action and brain stimuli. (Not for adrenaline junkies.)"},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"Foundation is the only book I have ever read twice. The second time around, I was shocked to realize that not much ever happens. There is something about this series that makes it one of the best I have ever read but I am not sure what it is."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"Having always been a big Asimov fan, (after readingmany of hisshort stories, along with some of the Robot series) I was very excited to start reading the Foundation series. The Foundation series describes a world in which humans live on planets throughout the galaxy. In this world, the 12,000-year old Empire is in decline, and Hari Seldon has established a Foundation in the corner of the galaxy in order to reconquer and rebuild a new empire after the current one dies -- he estimates the intermediary period of barbarism can be reduced from 30,000 years to only 1,000.Going into the first book of the series, I have to say I had high expectations, but this book managed to exceed them. Many people complain about the character development in these novels, but while each of the five stories introduced new characters, I still found each set of characters to be interesting in very important ways. Throughout these stories, the question of individuality is touched on: are these characters merely following Seldon's plan with no ability to shape events, or are our heroes shaping their futures through their decisions? I have only read Foundation so far, but I expect this theme to continue in the other novels.Also, I have to say that Foundation is very easy to read, entertaining, and I would recommend it without question, even to someone who had never read Asimov, and also to someone who had no interest in the Foundation series. Though, anyone who finishes Foundation will likely want to proceed to the other novels in the series."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"Foundation is the complete book of adventure. Brilliantly written by Asimov (as usual). This book is a must-read for all readers!"},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"A true classic that never grows old. Asimov's highly original plot and concise prose makes The Foundation a facinating experience for young and old. While the rest of the trilogy intensify and make for exciting reading, I feel the first book makes the best impact."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"This book is definetly a CLASSIC of all times(not only in SF).A must read for all SF lovers.I have read the book some 20-25 times so far and its simply mind-blowing.The whole concept is well thought of and pararells can be drawn to imperialism(religion and trade).You are made to realise the futility of trying to avoid destiny and realise that its the best to do the obvious in any situation.Definetly the best of all times."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"I feel sorry for anyone who read this book and felt it wasnt good. They obviously missed the boat big time. This book is not for those who have a short attention span, who need action &amp; blood &amp; guts violence or for people who cannot read between the lines. This book is a powerful commentary on the state of OUR world, that, as a society, we will not stay stagnent forever. It is also a very powerful commentary on the absurdity of religion. Read it if you would like to be educated and you like to think."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"I started reading this series with the original &quot;Foundation&quot; and was very disappointed with it. After all the acclaim it received, I was expecting something truly exceptional. Instead, I got a historical narrative that is closer in style to something you would read in the Brittanica for a school assignment. It is really a kind of &quot;mutant&quot; between a novel and a documentary. What's more, it is exceptionally boring. What kept me going was the Asimov name on the cover and the hope of better things to come. This is not to say that it is a really bad book. I must confess that it has some interesting parts and of course, the series as a whole is an absolute classic. Every other novel in the Foundation series is so brilliant, that they cover for this disappointment. It must also be remembered that Asimov wrote this book in the early 50's when he was still a young and inexperienced writer"},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"This is an awesome book, but if you're looking for battles and Star Wars style action, the sequels to this story have more. This novel spans the first 100 or so years of events that take place after the fall of a Galactic Empire. It's a very thin book and a quick read. Some terms such as \\"Gallopin' Galaxies\\" appear in the book, but be mindful of the times in which this book was written...and the intended audience.What is entertaining and interesting is how the characters solve Hari Seldon's predicted problems throughout the book. How cool would it be to have an entire planet of scientists (make that two)...a tiny portion of the galaxy that is pretty much responsible for running it. As a fantasy, it's as fun to dream of scientists in charge as it is to imagine winning the lottery. You might even glean tactics for handling dopey managers, or solving problems without going into combat. Asimov's wit and intrigue throughout make for an entertaining and thought-provoking read."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"I like Foundation because it's a solid piece of sci-fi from olden days. (George Lucas's stealing of Asimov's city-planet for his Coruscant - tsk tsk, Georgie - amazed me most.) Foundation does have peculiarities. People hundreds of thousands of years in the future speak like us. They use phrases like us. They also have the same atomic technology as people did in the 1950s. Asimov got a bit lazy here; he could've imagined something cooler than nukes. The galaxy is a metaphor for a crumbling Roman empire. Perhaps Terminus is Ireland. As for A's style, I found his use of long adverbs rather funny. In sum, a good book if you can ignore this stuff."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"This story is epic. Asimov shines in The Foundation. Makes you want to read the whole series. (something Im in the process of doing now. ;)"},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"The writing is hard and cynical. Characters are intelligent and clear. There is scant attention paid to emotional content or the softer virtues. The writing is clear and precise. The premise of the story is simple: civilization is decaying in the future. A colony is set up on the periphery of the known universe.This colony emerges as a society and faces challenges to both it's growth and survival. There's a clever premise to raise the stakes a bit; this society is the Foundation of a new Galactic Empire, created to close the gap of a fifty-millenia barbarity."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"Iaasic Asimov is one of the best known Science-Fiction Writers, and for good reason. He wrote this award-winning book at the age of 21. Foundation is one of the best books I have read to this date.Science Fiction is a broad area and can only be defined by these two words, hence the name. Asimov utilizes very realistic facts in a novel placed 15,000+ years in the future. In the year 1951 when the novel was written was just 5 years after the first computer showed its face. Yet Asimov utizlizes the common computer and calculator in many scenes in this novel.The use of nuclear power for showing superiority is also used often. This book was way ahead of its time.Anyone who enjoys science fiction or even one who just enjoys being entertained by realistic facts put into a story will enjoy this book. Foundation is also very suspenseful. Such as life-changing decisions to be made, assination attempts, spaceflight, and the exploration of new worlds in detail, the reader feels like he is in the mix of the action."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"I was trying to find it a long time ago and in amazon it was so cheap.Good quality, fast shipping"},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"I am a huge fan of science fiction and fantasy, and have been reading these books for 20 years. I picked up the Foundation books because Asimov was supposed to be so great, and I really enjoyed his short stories. This book - all of the books in this series - is so amazingly boring it could be used to replace Thorazine. The concept was solid, but the characters made me not care at all. I kept hoping they would die simply so there would be something interesting happening. If you must read it, check it out from the library and save your money. Unless of course you're a chronic insomniac; then, by all means, buy this book."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"&quot;Foundation&quot; is considered by many SF devotees to be one of the greatest creations of the genre. It won the Hugo award to prove it, spawned many sequels, and even a couple of prequels. I was excited to read this book, expecting it to live up to its many accolades.Boy, was I disappointed!The basic idea of this novel is fascinating: Hari Seldon foresees the demise of the galactic empire using the science of psychohistory. He puts a plan into motion to lessen the catastrophic effect of this collapse. Will it work?This is a good concept to work from, and I liked the plot. It's classic SF.What I did not like was the writing.Asimov relies too heavily on dialogue. It reads like a play. The only narration present serves as &quot;stage direction&quot; to indicate that someone moves, or smokes, or exits, or whatever. I was not able to imagine most of what was going on, as Asimov never adequately sets the scene for us. People simply talk back and forth. Everyone talks excatly alike, and none of the dialogue sounds natural. With little attributions (he said, she said, etc.), it's often hard to tell just who is talking, anyway. It's an extremely frustrating experience as a reader.The other problem with &quot;Foundation&quot; (perhaps, its central problem) is that it tries to cover too much in too short a period of time. This is unfortunate, because, again, the premise is so good. A story like this must cover a great period of time to achieve its goals, of course. We have to find out if Hari Seldon was on the right track. Asimov introduces a host of charcters, but none of them stick around. Consequently, there's no one in the entire book that you know or care about. This is a major failing. A great SF novel cannot be just a clever idea. The great books of the genre have great characters who help us to understand and appreciate the clever idea. Look at &quot;Rendezvous with Rama&quot;, &quot;Ender's Game&quot;, &quot;Stranger in a Strange Land&quot;, &quot;Dune&quot;, or &quot;Brave New World&quot;. Each of these features great ideas and great characters.If this book were fleshed out a bit more with better descriptions and deeper characters who were actually given time to develop, I would like it much more. As it stands, it feels too thin -- it's the kernel of something really great.I recommend this only to die-hard SF fans who are getting back to the genre's roots, or those who value ideas over writing quality.I believe you must have both to be a true classic."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"A good solid beginning to a stunning series."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"Well, here goes. You mention that Foundation is dated. Of course it is, it's 60 years old! You'd be surprised at how badly dated some of the stuff being written today is in 60 years. You say a galactic empire can't be made with 'atomics'; you call it good old nuclear fission. Well, not all nuclear power is fission; there is also fusion, which was not a bad idea for space travel in 1941. Strike one. You also mention that Asimov writes in the old 60's detective style of writing. So this dated book is writing in a style popular 20 years in the future. Strike two. You ask if anyone edited the corny dialog; you call it tripe. Of course it was edited; it was made into the editors idea of what would sell in 1941! Remember science fiction wasn't taken seriously then; it was supposed to be rather childish. One need only read later Asimov work (something you admittedly haven't done) to see that he wrote for the market at the time. Books such as 'The Gods Themselves' even have (gasp) sex in them, something that would never have gotten past any editor at the time of Foundation. And guess what? It was written in 1972, a time when society as a whole was more tolerant and ready to accept such topics. 'The Gods Themselves' would have been banned as obscene in 1941. Strike three. To answer your query - Why in the name of antimatter would a galactic civilization be organized along the lines of a fuedal system as were the Middle Ages? - why not? Just because it isn't very popular nowadays on Earth doesn't mean it can't work elsewhere. Besides, the story is a retelling of the decline of Rome - shouldn't there be obvious parallels? Strike four. You mention that the plot doesn't go anywhere. How would you know? You've only read one book. Asimov does a brilliant job of reconciling the original trilogy with the robot novels - especially considering he began the fourth novel 40 years after the original trilogy was written. At a minimum, to really understand the story you would have to read at least the next two books. Strike five. You say the book is pointless. Well, ask yourself this. If that were true, would it have near-unanimous rave reviews? Are you one of a select few that have been able to see the book for what it truly is - a piece of junk? No, the reality is that the state of science fiction in 2001 is that it is generally read by intelligent people - thoughtful, well-read and informed. The wool hasn't been pulled over their eyes, it has been pulled over yours. Strike six. And you misspelled premises and neutrino - Strike seven. You lose."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"Start here then go to The Gods ThemselvesThen bring on Heinlein and all the others."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"Interplanetary conflict and scientific religion dominate this wonderful SF world created by a diverse knowledge of writing and our history to mesh Isaac Asimov's knowledge into a symbolic tale.\\"Psycho historian,\\" Hari Seldon predicts that the city of Terminus will be destroyed, as well as the entire Galactic Empire. This Armageddon is foreseen into 3,000 years of barbaric emptiness. Dr. Seldon comes up with an idea that a group of psycho historians will need to work together with Seldon so that they can compose an Encyclopedia of the Galaxy's history to prevent about 2,000 years of political unrest. A Foundation is created. This Foundation represents the community of these historians to produce enough updated volumes of this Encyclopedia every 50 years so that the rivalry that will occur between the time Seldon dies and this Galaxy destruction occurs, it's ready to be of service to those struggling in the future. I found that the most interesting piece of this whole story is that as the struggles get stronger between the Foundation's cycle leaders and the surrounding planet's \\"prefects,\\" the leaders of the Foundation start to create this religion amongst the science involved with the Encyclopedia. These religious \\"high priests\\" become the power and influence amongst these interplanetary societies. It's so great to see how the higher power called the Galactic Spirit is slowly becoming a widespread belief amongst the psychohistorians and their counter parts.I keep thinking about the impact of these thoughts and ideas on our own society and how similar some of these reactions would be. I see a lot of conflict between our country, the United States, and Middle Eastern countries where we are planting ourselves on other's territory so that we can suck from their few and far between plentiful resources that are of high value to us, so we make these deals that are appealing to 2nd and 3rd class countries and once that is started we ultimatley have all of this say over what that country is up to. I feel like Foundation shows how this peaceful and well- intentioned planet is working to create righteous things and there are these outside planets wanting control over how they are going about this and need some sort of power over a smaller community in a self-serving way. The character development is my favorite part of the book because of the different personalities that Asimov creates to work out the story line of the book. The different leaders are these very he-men type characters that are young and self-righteous, working towards the destruction or protection of their homeland.Clashing righteoussness is all over this book and I think that it definaltey symbolizes some of the conflict that exists in our own country today. I did not however feel like Asmiov gave women any role at all. I can't think of one woman that played ANY major role in this book, and when there was a mention of a woman she was nothing but a secretary or a mediator of some sort. I felt like there were just too many hormones flying around this book and I kind of wonder what this says about Isaac Asimov and his life. A great writer but maybe needs a love life? All around this was a great book and I recommend to all of you die hard SF fans!!! If you're a hardcore gal that is in to SF I would pass on this book."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"The first book in the series is NOT Foundation. It's Prelude to Foundation.

I found the characters to be flat and one dimensional. The story uses unrealistic plot devices. Yes I understand that it's science fiction, but I find it strains credulity to think that the characters were able to invent a religion worlds-spanning religion in 30 years. It also didn't seem very likely that a 12,000-year-old empire would so quickly crumble into the stone age (I'm exaggerating slightly). I realize that this book was written in 1951 but the high tech stuff in the story was hardly high tech back then, much less in an empire spanned the galaxy.Bottom line: not an especially great read."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"While the book does offer a promising premise, the necessary jumps from one point in time to another do not make for a pleasant read. The very first time I attempted to read the book, I was unable to get much further than the first part (The Psycho- Historians). As soon as you begin to get used the characters, a shift takes place. Unfortunately, this happens again and again. When you read Foundation, it becomes neccesary to think of each of the five parts as a short story.While the story was displayed in the best way I could imagine, the classic simply did not live up to my expectations. The emphasis is on the plot, and very little is put into the characters. While the book has it's flaws, I find it simply amazing when the date it was published is taken into consideration. Put simply, it's like the majority of 'classics' out there; while they were astounding in their own time, they simply can't stand up to the best of modern modern literature out there."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"I first read this book when I was young, perhaps in my early 20's. I remember it as astounding, but recall little of it's content. In my early 30's, I went through and reread the entire trilogy straight through, which by then was a total of seven books. I believe Isaac is a true genius beyond most any man of our age. His insight into politics, religion, society, hope, hatred, love, friendship is beyond most anything I have known. And how he was able to incorporate these things into a series of books about the future of humanity nearly overwhelms me when I consider it. Most of what happens in the world, especially in the world of technology, has been shown in his books. It seems as if he must have has a direct link to the future."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"Fifteen years ago, this book was the zenith of SF to me. Today, I know there are many better books. But you should read it anyway, it's a classic. You can't be taken seriously in any SF discussion if you aren't familiar with the great Foundation.Isaac Asimov is, of course, a very skilled writer. Most SF writers allow themselves embarrassing blunders that make their universes physically absurd. In this book, you're not likely to find anything like that. To really appreciate Mr. Asimov's genius, you should read other SF novels written in the same time. Nearly all of them look ridiculous in the year 2000. Mr. Asimov's books don't. If you wouldn't know, you couldn't tell that the book was written half a century ago."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"After the Seldon Plan was followed, without its followers actually understanding what was going on, the Empire, although falling, is still the mightiest force in the Galaxy and the only challenge to the Foundation.

A masterpiece... Isaac Asimov is the master writer. As for the book's plot itself, Hari Seldon's psychohistory plan, which can predict the future of humanity, is being used as the Galactic Empire falls. The Seldon Plan, if followed, predicts that the 30,000 years of barbarism with no Empire can be reduced to 1,000, but the Plan takes utmost wisdom to keep on track, long after Seldon is dead."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"Despite all the hype and negativity due to popularity backlash none can honestly admit that Asimov made a mundane focus for his writing passions when he wrote and then published the stories that comprise 'Foundation'. Since I read this epic book in eighth grade it has stuck with me due to the relation of structural decay and rebirth in a future universe that mirrors our own rather perochial existance. The serendipity and foresight combining thought and action to build a better future for mankind in the Milky Way galaxy will leave the experienced, educated readers feeling they have witnessed the true future of our reality. This is a truely brilliant effort of science fiction as are many of Asimov's early works. Shame on the nay sayers."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"A trilogy consists of three books so, even although &quot;Foundation&quot; (one of the true classics) is good enough to be a trilogy by itself, formally &quot;Foundation&quot; needed two more volumes to make up a trilogy. In these two volumes the level does not fall off too badly, although &quot;the Mule&quot; is rather weak.Unfortunately Asimov, one of the truly greats of SF, later succumbed to undue pressure and combined his Robot-series (already in itself continued too long) with the Foundation, with outright embarrassing results.

Never mind that this book was written many decades ago - It is absolutely timeless and you will not regret reading it."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"I feel that this is Asimov's best book. He is not known to let you get too close to any of his characters to feel for them in any sense of the way, EXCEPT the Mule. Out of all the Asimov books, I feel that this one is closest to being ready to become a movie (I am not sure why I, Robot and Bicentennial Man were before this one). If you have not read this one, you are in for a treat. If you have read this one, then you know it should be added to your collection."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"Foundation is the first book of the outstanding Foundation Trilogy. Asimov builds drama with believable characters struggling against bureaucracies and political manipulations on a grand scale. As a central government weakens, planets often show less respect for the core authorities and go there own way, sometimes forming their own alliances. Hari Seldon, master of Psychohistory, uses Psychohistory to make predictions far into the future. Hari Seldon does more than predict outcomes--he has a plan. Seldon does not expect to alter the eventual course of huge historical events, but constructs a strategy to minimize the length of time of the darkest days for the Galactic Empire.The emphasis of the book, and what makes the book a true science fiction classic, is the imagination that takes the reader through mind whirring possibilities for the future."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"The great thing about Foundation is it's scope. It's a bit unsettling at times that you don't really get to know a character considerably well as the parts of the book break down over the span of several generations, but reading everything unfold and the implications that the events have in the long term is really fascinating.Asimov's writing is a mixed bag. It's imaginative and has a great vision. But at times the people seem too... squeaky-clean to be people. Every character seems unrealistically eloquent and proper and the dialogue doesn't fall too far from what I'd imagine Asmiov may say himself. There are few differences between the characters in regards to linguistic tendancies. Also, and I know the book was first published in the early 50's, but there are hardly any women even mentioned in Foundation and they certainly don't play significant or visible roles.It's still quite imaginative and quite good, in spite of these flaws. I understand Asimov was my age (21) when he began writing Foundation, so taking that in consideration it seems like an even more awesome literary feat."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"\\"Foundation and Empire,\\" the second in a trilogy of classic science fiction novels by Isaac Asimov, is a must read for historians of science fiction. For those who like science fiction itself, this volume is also valuable. Asimov can madden, especially in his early novels, but his imagination is wonderful. His strength is conceptualizing systems (whether empires or cultures) and he often plays with big ideas.I first read the trilogy while in college, and was fascinated. This triggered a long-lasting interest in the fiction of Isaac Asimov (and some of his non-fiction works, as well).Those familiar with this trilogy know that the key character is psychohistorian Hari Seldon, who believes that one can predict the behavior of large masses of people via mathematical equations and, thus, predict how events will develop in the future.This book is a bridge between the novel \\"Foundation\\" and the third in the series, \\"Second Foundation.\\" And, of course, later in his career, Asimov returned to the Foundation well--with more interesting and literary results. Indeed, in one of the great tour de forces in science fiction, he ends up linking two classic series--the robot works and the Foundation series. But I'm getting way ahead of myself.This novel focuses on two instances--one, the rise of a youthful and talented military leader who goes after the Foundation. And, just as Hari Seldon's mathematical equations predicted, he failed. The logic for this is classic Asimov, and is why he was so entertaining to read, even though his characters have little life in these works and even though his writing style is, at best, functional in these works (he improved with time).Then, there is the case of the Mule, where Seldon's equations failed in prediction. And that itself is fascinating, as explained in this novel. Thus, the comparison of the correct prediction and the failed prediction add some real heft to Asimov's tale of the rise of the Foundation as the Empire slowly descends to its end.For those who have never read Asimov, the Foundation trilogy is a good place to get a sense of his talents, of seeing big pictures. His writing style is not great, but the images of this future that he developed are compelling. I still enjoy going back to the Foundation series, the Robot series, and their fusion as Asimov's vision evolved."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"Any fan of science fiction needs to read this series.

The creative and unique story line presents the reader a sensation of the future. In the beginning of the book, Hari Seldon was introduced as a psychohistorian and mathematician who could chart the future of the human race for tens of thousands of years. He predicted a decline of the Galactic Empire, which had lasted for twelve thousand years, into a state of disorder and barbarism for the next thirty thousand years. Hari Seldon then established the Foundation to serve as the purpose of shortening the period of chaos into a single millennium or less.The book was extremely enjoyable and the pages went by fast. However, the only problem I had was that once I got to know the characters, the story went on to a situation a couple decades later with new characters. Though it bothered me, the way the author wrote his novel was necessary to put a whole century's plot into a book. Despite the many characters in the story, the author created a distinct personality for each. Yet, each of the leaders in the different parts of the book were similar in a way; they all dealt with conflict extremely calmly and ingeniously. They cleverly manipulated their enemies with their words and were always prepared against threats or opposition. They knew how to win the people's votes even when they were in a weak position to run for a government position. I could not help but to ponder about what I would have done in each of the situations. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone that likes science fiction or anyone who likes reading about how characters cleverly solve their problems."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"I think this is a great book by itself and worth the time in reading it but if you have time I would recommend reading the whole series.

The overall plot, such as it is, betrays the novel's origins as separate short stories, and the characters tend to be wooden. Foundation and Empire, the next book in Asimov's original Foundation trilogy, is a much better novel, especially in its depiction of the character of the Mule. However, the concept of psychohistory introduced in this work is fascinating and the key to the other books by Asimov and others describing past and future developments in the Foundation universe."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"For beginners into this serie of Asimov, know that their are other books before Foundation, and they are all tied-up.-----------------&lt;Robot serie&gt;:I, Robot/ The Caves of Steel/ The Naked Sun/ The Robots of Dawn/ Robots and Empire&lt;Bridging novel&gt;:Tyrann&lt;Foundation series&gt;:Foundation/ Foundation and Empire/ Second Foundation/ Foundation's Edge/ Foundation and Earth----------------Some highligths:-I, Robot: The beginning of the robots themselves-The Robots of Dawn: Early mention of psychohystory as a possible new field-Robots and Empire: The Earth starts becoming unlivable-Tyrann: A view between the two series ('Robot' &amp; 'Foundation').

But all three books were in one volume, so I kept reading. I'm glad I did! Every time I've read them since, I discover something new to love. The ending of this book blew my mind! If there is such a thing as a literary high, I was on one for a week after reading this eight years ago. No book or movie you can name comes close to this kind of thrill or scope. And just when I thought Asimov couldn't take it any further, he does, with a character's last statement. By now the Foundation has gained dominance over its surrounding enemies. All part of Hari Seldon's (the Foundation's founder) Plan. And they are strong enough to face the Empire. The first half of the book is a power struggle of the leaders of the Empire, more politics, and a small band of traders, rebels, and scholars, who wait for the coming of the &quot;magicians&quot; to someday be their saviors. The second half of the book follows a small group of people belonging to the Democratic Underground who expect major political changes for the next Seldon Crisis. They hear of a man who calls himself the Mule. Generals surrender to him without a fight. His worst enemies become his most faithful subordinates. They seek him out, thinking he can help their cause. No one can explain the success of the Mule. Where did he come from? Was he planned by Hari Seldon? Hari Seldon appears, as before, as a hologram, explaining the crisis and the course of action. But he makes no mention of the Mule. Everything has gone awry, and Seldon's plan is out of whack, and the galaxy might revert to the 30,000 years of barbarism Seldon was trying to avoid. Hari Seldon counted on several things, that there would be no major changes in the galaxy's technology, such as something that could withstand any bombardment, or strange neurobiological weapons; and, that human reaction to stimuli would remain constant. If it's not the first, it must be the second-- the Mule has mental powers. How do they fight him? By seeking out this Second Foundation. Hari Seldon mentioned it vaguely, but there is no record of its purpose, and no proof of its existence. This same small band from the D.U., including a psychologist (as the Foundation considers one), set off to the center of what's left of the Empire, The planet/city Trantor, to search Seldon's records. The whole time managing to stay out of the way of the Mule's path of destruction, and ends with the awesome climax I mentioned. Does the Second Foundation even exist? What is their purpose? The psychologist, working on overdrive, seems to have found its location. &quot;It was so simple,&quot; he said. But he doesn't live to reveal his discovery. Did he really find it, or was his mind too distorted to make any sense? There are more surprises and excitement to come in the trilogy's third installment, Second Foundation. Some people have the gall to call these books wordy or boring. Keep in mind that Lord of the Rings had its slow parts, too, but the few exciting parts are what you remember and hold it all together. It's better to take these books as a whole. For that, one is not necessarily better than the other two, they are all essential to the whole story line. Perhaps someday we can look forward to a mutilated Hollywood version, then go back and re-read the books, and hold them dear to our hearts."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"I thought the book was somewhat dull compared to the first &quot;Foundation&quot; novel, because there are no brilliant characters such as Salvor Hardin or Hober Mallow and no great accomplishments. The first part of the book about Foundation's struggle against the Empire is not impressive. The second part about the Mule was moving sort of slow until a brilliant ending. I was absolutely shocked at it and I thought that it was definitely worth reading the entire novel for the ending. In fact the emotion that I experienced must have been something like what people influenced by the Mule felt! I also realized I had a great affection for the Mule, it is fabulous that a person who is predicted to be a pathetic loser in life makes it beyond all expectations. I know that the Mule is supposed to be a bad guy, so now that I am reading &quot;Second Foundation&quot; I hope that its ending would not be overly dramatic for him."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"This story is a very detailed, accurate and plausible one, with enough depth and complexity to remain entertaining even after many re-readings."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"This is one of the best developed and interesting books I've ever read"},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"This book is astonishing!

The moment when everyone found out that Hari Seldon's plan had gone wrong in the Vault was one of the series' finest written moments, and the end, oh don't even get me started about the end of the book.

Even though Isaac Asimov (my favorite sci-fi author) has nuclear power be able to do anything, it doesn't take away from the story. It's the best book of the foundation series for sure. If you read sci-fi, you've got to read this."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"Asimov continues with his narration of the history of the interregnum between empires in pretty much the same anthology format used in Foundation. Actually, upon further thinking, there's probably no way really to tell the story of a 1,000 year journey on the part of humanity without doing it in snippets. More and more the series begins to read more like a history book with some dramatic events being highlighted for their importance as turning points. These turning points are called Seldon Crises, foreseen events by Hari Seldon, Psychohistorian, which impel the people of the Foundation forward to galactic dominance. Throughout the first book and a half, Asimov establishes a bit of fatalism - nothing can stop the foundation by historical imperative, and for that reason the people of the Foundation, especially it's leadership, become apathetic.Asimov throws a wrench into the status quo with the rise of a mutant, a statistical improbability and anomaly that could not possibly be accounted for in the creation of the Seldon Plan and therefore the first truly unknown quantity with the ability to destroy the Foundation. This mutant, called the Mule, has psychic ability and the great revival of technology in the Foundation is powerless to stop him from manipulating people and working his way to dominance. The Mule consolidates his power, takes over the Foundation and destroys the remnants of the former galactic empire and it looks like Seldon's prophecies could be wrong. That a single individual upset the 1,000 year plan to turn the Foundation into the Second Empire, in only 5 years.Asimov again explores the themes of individuality, stagnation, complacency and religion. Choice and free will are major foci for the novel. If the Seldon Plan is mathematically and psychologically accurate like a prophecy, if certain things are meant to happen, just because human beings will predictably react in the same ways in given situations, do we really have free will? What is the role of the individual in society in in the historical process? Asimov treats history like a Marxist, influenced by Hegelian dialectics. Conflicts and crises between opposing forces give birth to a third new status quo until it comes into conflict with an opposing force. These moments of intersection are the Crises predicted by Seldon and the focus of Asimov's 1,000 year narrative. But the Mule changes that. He challenges the notion of inevitability and proves the fallibility of Seldon's prophecies. But by doing so he introduces another free will paradox. The Mule has the ability to modify emotions and create complete loyalty in people. He wins victories by converting the opposing sides' generals and leaders into giving up and then serving him, destroying free will again by creating it out of the tight confines of the Seldon Plan. It's truly and interesting concept. How will the Mule be stopped? Enter: the Second Foundation. Established on the other side of the galaxy as a failsafe in case of the failure of the Foundation. But no record exists of where that foundation is or what type of society it will become. Will the Mule find it and destroy it? Does it exist after 300 years?My major problem throughout the narration is that it is assumed that the Seldon Plan represents the ideal in some way. Seldon was a human being, capable of manipulating and creating situations a millennia in advance and manipulating the fate of quadrillions of human beings. Who says his plan needs to be fulfilled? What if people don't want Seldon's future? What if they don't want to live in an all-encompassing empire? I would maybe believe Asimov wants you to question that, but he gives himself away in little asides in the narration, inserting emotional declamations against the upset of the Plan."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"I read this as a youngster. I loved the idea, and the time vault opening at various times was brilliant. It's a bit slow, however, and there wasn't enough fighting for my tastes. I like the vast scale. This is space ships of the grand era, with galaxy-spanning empires. There aren't enough of these kinds of stories written these days."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"By now you should be familiar with psychohistory, and the exploits of Hari Seldon, Salvor Hardin, and Hober Mallow. If that first sentence just left you slightly confused then go pick up Isaac Asimov's \\"Foudation\\" before reading \\"Foundation and Empire\\". \\"Foundation and Empire\\" picks up where \\"Foundation\\" left off, with the First Foundation rapidly expanding throughout the galaxy. In \\"The General\\" (the first half of \\"Foundation and Empire), Foundation space bumps up against what remains of the old Empire, and the Foundation must square off with Bel Riose, the last great Empire general. This story is basically a continuation of the ideas started in \\"Foundation\\". \\"The General\\" is definitely the weaker of the two stories in \\"Foundation and Empire\\", however it is a necessary story to show the growing strength and influence of the First Foundation, as well as the decline of the Empire.\\"The Mule\\" (the second half of \\"Foundation and Empire\\") tells the story of the Mule, a mysterious galactic superpower who begins conquering planets in Foundation space. The leaders of the Foundation struggle against their new enemy, and try to figure what it is that makes the Mule so efficient and effective. Meanwhile, a small group of characters working for an underground group try to find the all important location of the Second Foundation before the Mule can beat them to it. The ending of \\"The Mule\\" is absolutely amazing, and the grand reveal at the end can be foreseen by an observant reader, which makes it all the more satisfying.In short, \\"Foundation and Empire\\", along with the rest of Asimov's Foundation Series, is a great science fiction story, beautifully blending advanced mathematical and scientific ideas with good ol' fashioned adventure. Some readers complain that Asimov's characters are not as deep as they could be, and they do have a point, but Asimov never wrote the Foundation books with the intent of having deep, realistic characters; it was all about the story and the ideas. If you are looking for strong characters in your science fiction then go read Heinlein, however if you are looking for a drop dead fantatic story propelled by great scientific speculation, then you can't go wrong with picking up \\"Foundation and Empire\\" and the rest of the Foundation Series."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"I have similar reactions to all of IA's books... that is simply that they are great fun, an easy and enjoyable read, but not terribly challenging in any respect. I would wholeheartedly recommend any of his various books to friends and family, but I wouldn't expect them to come away really grappling with social issues or anything afterwards. Don't get me wrong- he does go after social issues and examines some things in interesting ways that can be somewhat eye-opening if you're the kind of person who never thinks that way, but it's just not earth-shattering.This sounds horrible... but I don't mean it to. I love this books. I really do. :)"},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"This is tied for first place in all books I have read (other book is Atlas Shrugged). The series in all is great but this book tops them all. Imagine a combination of psychology and math used to predict the outcome of population mobs and how a man would apply it to an empire he sees falling apart (not really a spoiler cause that's a bit of what they tell you in first 2ish chapters). This book is great not just because of the idea but because the characters are relatable, face extremely difficult situations, and yet take what seems to be the only logical way out. I highly suggest you read this book and the whole series."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"The original Foundation trilogy is today revered as one of the best works of science fiction, by a veritable giant of the genre, Isaac Asimov. Begun originally as a series of eight short stories published in Astounding Magazine between 1942 and 1950, the first four were collected and published for the first time in 1951 under the title of Foundation.The Galactic Empire has ruled the galaxy in splendor, magnificence, and domination for the last twelve thousand years, but now its significant chapter is coming to a close; only no seems to realize this, except Hari Sheldon. Through the revolutionary science of psychohistory, Sheldon has calculated that in five centuries the empire will come to an end and the galaxy will devolve into a hostile, barbarian world that he has predicted to last thirty thousand years. But Sheldon has a plan to cut this time of the dark ages down to a mere millennium. It will take decades and centuries of planning, with the initial creation of the galactic encyclopedia, where all knowledge and record will be stored and kept for the future. To make this happen, he creates a small civilization on a remote planet that he names Foundation. Only through the years and decades, warlords rise up around the galaxy, looking to take down the Foundation, and it is up to Sheldon's planning for the encyclopedia and this small civilization to survive.In Foundation, Asimov doesn't focus greatly on complex character development (or female characters of merit, for that matter), but takes the sociological made-up science of psychohistory and has fun with exploring just what one can do with a world over a period of decades.Originally written on February 4, 2011.Go to[...]for over 500 book reviews and over 50 exclusive author interviews."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"The second of the first Foundation trilogy, Foundation and Empire was originally published in 1952. Originally published as two novellas in Astounding Science Fiction, \\"The General\\" and \\"The Mule\\" cover the next two periods when the Foundation receives its first full-force attacks.In \\"The General,\\" the Galactic Empire is well on its way to its inevitable end, but under the command of General Bel Riose, an attack is planned against the Foundation. Bel Riose has gone mad with power and will stop at nothing to obliterate the Foundation, somehow believing they are behind the fall of the empire. He amounts huge forces if armored gunships with plans wipe the Foundation from the galaxy. But one man from the Foundation knows about this, and he also knows knowledge is power, and since the Foundation is soon as that which has all the knowledge, he knows Bel Riose can be stopped, so long as he gets to the Emperor before the general attacks.In \\"The Mule,\\" the Galactic Empire has fallen into a selection of barbaric kingdoms, while the Foundation has become strong and powerful, but also full of corruption, composed of approximately thirty outer planets. But there is corruption within the ranks and things are stirring within the Foundation's empire. Meanwhile there is a new leader who has rise, an enigmatic mutant known as \\"The Mule,\\" who has only known scorn and suffering and is a hardened creature who respects no one, but he also has the ability to read and control people's emotions. It is up to two Foundation citizens, Toran and Bayta Darell, along with the Foundation's only psychologist, Ebling Mis, and a strange, refugee clown \\"Magnifico Giganticus,\\" to search for the Second Foundation, set up by Hari Seldon originally when the Foundation was created, and stop this \\"Mule.\\"Originally written on February 5, 2011 Alex C.

It begins a thousand-year project that, through the cleaver acions of the protagonists, attempts to save humanity from a prolonged and chaotic interstellar Dark Age that was bound to follow the collapse of the Galactic Empire. Through the use of a mathematical application on history(as well as psychology and sociology) called Pschohistory, the founder of that field of study (Hari Seldon) developed a plan to truncate the Dark Age period from 10,000 years to 1,000 years.He begins this plan by setting up a colony on a planet at the rim of the galaxy called Terminus called the Foundation. From then on the inhabitants and their descendants of Terminus choose certain actions and follow certain policies that do not always make sense to the reader until or to other characters. Sometimes the Foudation seems to be self-desctructing or that the leaders are being treacherous. But not is all that it seems. Every once in a while, sometimes after 50 years, or 30 years, the Foudation is in a situation that either spells destruction or conquest by a neighboring kingdom. This is referred to as a Seldon Crisis. This is usually a turning point in the Foudation's path of history that was calcutaed by Seldon and part of his plan to bring about the New Galactic Empire after the fall of the old one. The important part is that Seldon Crises or the events thta bring them about are done through clever acts of political, economic or diplomatic manipulation. (Even psychological) What is most important to the plan is that Seldon needed the Foundation to be unaware of the path the people of Terminus must take. Thus, there are few social and psychological scholars to notice the trends and provide warning. THis way the actions taken are contolled for the sake of executing the Seldon plan.I did enjoy the book and will be reading and reportin on the sequels in the future. I thought it was cleaver and insightful on human nature as wellas a good understaning of history without hitting me over the head with it. The collapse of the Galactic Empire, which stretches into the sequels, is a clear reference to the long (relatively) fall of fthe Roman Empire. It seems that just like the Romans, the Galactic Empire will not be comquerds in on campaign liike Alexander did to Persia, but instead eveolve into another form of civilation with competeing factions comparable to the Catholic Church, the absolute (so-called) ruling kings, the nobles, the equestrians, and the outside threats such as muslim caliphs. The book was originally published in 1951 AD so it did not anticpate specifc technologies and the referce to nuclear power as \\"atomics\\" is a bit outdated. I would have hoped for nuclear fusion or the equivalent of such an epic transfornmation. Also, a bigger role for women characters other than the harpie wife of a foriegn aggressor in the book would have been nice. Maybe because I was reading Steig Larsson and some Star Wars novels recently I had gotten used to female protagonsts and antagonists. But FOUNDATION was written long ago and the audience for this genre was and may still be male dominated. There are sequels and prequels to for me to explore and for Asimov to redeem himself. JK. (Observe, I wrote one of those texting acronyms.) I just hope every character does not have sound like Isaac Asomov. (as much as love him) Out of a galaxy, I give it 878,124,550,100 stars. That is fairly good."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"Slow on the pick up as many of the early characters are not developed very well making it difficult to sink into. However, about midway through, things begin to get going and characters are finally given time enough to develop. After that point is really when the book becomes a classic and hard to put down; even if it has aged. A classic by any accounts even with it's few bumps."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"I liked this book. I don't really have anything profound to say, I'm only writing a review because for some reason Amazon is not giving me the option of rating the book without a review.Asimov seems to have an interesting twist on European history in this book, as the events that occur in it seem to parallel the fall of the Roman Empire, the successor Germanic kingdoms, and the rise of the merchant class in the Renaissance. Understanding the history of Western Civilization probably has given me a fun comparison to Asimov's fictional Galactic history."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"I'm not a fan of sci-fiction, but really enjoyed it. I agree with other reviews that environment wasn't deeply described and there weren't any sophisticated characters, but this didn't disturbed me, because the storyline was fast-paced and interesting.

I picked up the first one I found and it happened to be this one, so why not give it a go?I was intrigued right from the beginning, drawn into the story easily. Asimov's style of writing is fluid and engaging, easily allowing the reader to picture and understand everything. In addition the plot came together nicely and, in a simplistic complexity (oxymoron?), you were able to see the growth of the Foundation from a fledgling world to... well I won't reveal anything, suffice it to say the natural progression that Asimov portrayed fit together very nicely.My only complaints with Asimov, though, was that it did come together to nice and neat, never really engaging the reader to the extent of wondering, thinking, feeling and diving into the story. Instead you are almost lead from A to B to C without any guessing and wondering, without any involvement, with everything almost being a foregone conclusion. Add to this his style of writing is a bit simplistic, in that there isn't anything too complex, which isn't altogether bad because he backs it up with a fluid and believable plot that is more than enough to add credence to the story. In fact we've seen this in fantasy as well as David Eddings wrote simplistically but backed it up with a story that was enjoyable to read.I will definitely read Asimov again, especially the rest of the series, if only to what Asimov would do, being a pioneer of the genre. I would certainly recommend Asimov to anyone looking to start reading science fiction and/or a light, quick read. A recommend.3.75 stars."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"\\"Foundation and Empire\\" by Issac AsimovTwo hundred years have passed of the 300 Hari Seldon predicted it would take for the Empire to fall. All things have gone according to the Seldon plan and the Foundation is one of the most powerful states in the galaxy. This might change though because there are 2 more Seldon Crises on the horizon.This is another good addition to Foundation trilogy but as is typically the case not quite as good as the first. Foundation and Empire covers the next period of time for the foundation when the Foundation is finally brought back to the attention of what remains of the Empire. The Empire has heard of the power the Foundation now wields and views them as a threat and two different generations of Empire men seek to remedy that threat...The Good: The same aspects that were good in the first are present in the second. The idea overall and the way each story unfolds is good. Foundation and Empire ends with a Cliffhanger of sorts or at least without true resolution which would appear to lead into the next book.The Bad: The characters are a little flat and though it isn't as problematic in Asimov's stories as it would be in others it is a little more problematic in this than in the first. It was a non issue in the fist book because there are 5 Seldon crises and hence 5 different groups of characters. The stories are event driven and not character driven so when 5 events are spread across one event driven book it works out. \\"Foundation and Empire\\" is similar in length to \\"Foundation (Foundation Novels)\\" but only covers 2 crises so we are forced to deal more with the flat characters and less with events in an event driven story. This in no way ruined the book as it was still very good but is just a highlight of one of the weaker points.Overall: If you liked Foundation you will probably enjoy Foundation and Empire. If that is the case pick it up and give it a try."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"Isaac Asimov's \\"Foundation\\" was my favorite book in high school. I read the other 2 books afterwards, \\"Foundation and Empire\\" and \\"Second Foundation\\" right after, and by then Asimov finally finished what he started so long ago by writing new books to the Foundation saga, more Robot novels, and prequels. I am re-reading Foundation right now, only this time on my Kindle. It's just as good now as it was 20+ years ago. Asimov's novels remind me of Star Trek because the stories could probably fit in any time or place, including right now. My only issue is that Asimov is deceased for a number of years now. Other writers have tried to take on the challenge of continuing his stories but no one tells a story like Asimov!"},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"Over the years I have read a great many books from many, many authors and yet the \\"Foundation\\" series pops back into my head somewhat regularly. I often wonder why it has not been made into a series of movies. After all in my mind it would rival \\"Star Wars\\" or \\"Lord of the Rings\\". Isaac Asimov was a gifted writer and I was fortunate to know his works while he still lived. Unfortunately I never got to meet the man. This series is some of the best stuff he ever wrote. It delves into humananity and how our unique abilities may sometimes stand out. In the case of \\"Foundation\\" it centers around one empire and it's unusual ruler that expands their domain beyond any other into the far reaches of space. It looks closely at how a handful of people truly make a difference in the scheme of things and what becomes of that empire. Another great series, the \\"Robot\\" series was later linked to this series and although I enjoyed the link not everyone may enjoy it. Nonetheless you should read the \\"Robot\\" series as well if you get the chance. I will be very surprised if after you set the \\"Foundation\\" series aside, it doesn't make you reflect on it the rest of your life. Excellent read from a master of SciFi."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"To me, the Foundation series is the greatest sci-fi series of all time. The earlier books are the best, as the latter books aren't as good. This is favorite of the earlier books.It's broken into two halves. The first half is pretty good, but it's really the second half, called The Mule, that's incredible. It's fantastic.It's style isn't like modern sci-fi, which is usually dark and action-packed. If that's what you're looking for, you won't enjoy this series. This series is much more about imagining a universe with a certain set of rules and how those rules might play out over time. To enjoy it, you have to think and imagine along with Asimov. If that \\"golden age\\" style sci-fi suites your taste, you will love this book.Obviously you can't read this book in isolation. You really need to read the Foundation before it and Second Foundation after it. The three togother make the best triology I've ever read. After those three, you can continue, but the quality of the books trails off from there.If you're a \\"golden age\\" sci-fi fan and somehow haven't already read the Foundation series, get the first three Foundation books. You'll really enjoy them, especially The Mule."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"You cannot help but be amazed while reading this book. A story than can hold 60 years and still feel like a believable future is simply astounding.This is the base and start point for many later science fiction stories, including Star Wars.Asimov was simply a genius.

The book is so witty and so indepth. The story is great the writting is great, i strongly recamend this book."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"The original Foundation trilogy won the Hugo for the best series of all time. It deserved it. For those who like &quot;hard&quot; (science-driven) sci-fi as opposed to emotion-driven sci-fi, this is a must. Actually, the premise is not as outrageous as it first appears... We can all vaguely predict the general reaction of the human race to a certain idea, which means it does follow some rules. It would be difficult, but not impossible, to find some generalised maths to describe it, but the rewards would certainly justify it."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"This review is intended for the entire Foundation trilogy and as such this series of books even though written in pieces in Science Fiction magazines is woven together in an astonishingly complex web of ideas and mystery. This series stands as the epitome of the science fiction classic, what science fiction should be about and how it should be written. As a classic it is only superseded by &quot;Dune&quot; and only a few others come close eg &quot;Ender's Game&quot; (Orson Scott Card) series and the &quot;Galactic Milieu&quot; series (Julian May). The whole series is epic and yet does not loose sight of the characters or the story which is all important in science fiction, without it the wizz-bang effect takes hold and the whole thing collapses, eg Terminator could not have been held together without the excellent storyline. Other examples of great science fiction stories include &quot;Blade Runner&quot; and &quot;Alien&quot; both of which had great stories without a reliance on effects which some films have done eg the extra added graphics to the original Star Wars and too much graphics in Episode 1.These stories also provide a fascinating tale of science yet to come such as psychohistory which totally fascinated me when I read about it and some other physicists I have known. The possibilities are incredible a science of probabilistic mathematics used to predict the future given historical events. In addition we are of course confronted with the politics and the usual human weaknesses including greed, corruption and the like, much akin to the degenerate aspects of the Roman Empire. The new mathematics of psychohistory developed by Hari Seldon working on Trantor and trying to set up the two Foundations to at least control the eventual collapse and fall of humanity into a dark age and the Mule the one person not predicted by the original theory who is the defeated through remarkable twists and turns in the story which is full of intrigue and mystery, simply unputdownable. I have read the books many times and will do so again although psychohistorical mathematics is beyond current attainability I believe, but then maybe not.Other books are judged next to this."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"I've seen a few bad reviews of Isaac Asimov's Foundation and it grieves me, really grieves me. When Isaac Asimov first came up with the idea for his Foundation series it was planned that he would write the future history of our galaxy. It could be said that it was an experiment in a method of writing fiction.If Asimov's characterizations or scenery descriptions seem bland or garish to some readers, that's because Asimov's focus was on the story. Despite Foundation's original ad hoc nature, I have read no other series which has so intricately weaven the elements of the plot so finely together. Alone, the novel Foundation may seem mundane, and it may not be your best bet if you're seeking instant gratification. But together - together with the other two books in the trilogy, together with the two later written sequels, together with the later two written prequels, together with his other bodies of work which have been woven into an expansive interplay of stories and plot, together with three &quot;pre&quot;prequels written posthumously by outside authors, I know no greater complicated work that brings with it such depth and expansiveness.In short, Foundation, serves as a sounding board for a series of future historical accounts. And Asimov never fails to deliver suspense, drama, and surprise throughout them.But that's just my biased opinion ;)"},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"So, you're thinking about delving into Science Fiction and you just don't know where to start.Start with Asimov's _Foundation_. Simply put, this is where science fiction starts. You will be introduced to the concept of a vast, complex history of a civilization which is certainly not Planet Earth... and, get this, it was written several decades before we sent anyone to the moon.And there's more... Foundation leads to an entire trilogy which leads to another trilogy which, get this, actually leads you back to Planet Earth.Five stars. Possibly more."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"I would recommend this series to anyone. Asimov is a great writer, who's very prolific (He's written over 400 books! ) This is the start of his Foundation series which is a well-developed series detailing the fall of a Galactic Empire and one man's attempt to shorten the dark ages that are to come after the fall.

I'll give the next one a try."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"Right where a character talks about his old age of sixty-two years.Yeah, right. An advanced galactic civilization, thousands of years old, with FTL travel and turnkey exoplanets just right for human habitation everywhere, never bothered to find medical treatments for aging. That might have sounded plausible in science fiction 60+ years ago, but much less so today. The novel also suffers from a lot of faults which other reviewers have noted. Perhaps Asimov's stories blew geeks' minds in the 1940's and 1950's, but his work hasn't aged well.BTW, Asimov, Heinlein, Clarke, Carl Sagan and a lot of other scientifically knowledgeable people in the mid 20th Century accepted the existence of exoplanets based on NO evidence at all until the mid 1990's, while at the same time criticizing similar claims without evidence as woo-woo. Just by coincidence the exoplanet faith position happened to resemble observable reality somewhat - but it didn't have to. Even then, the existence of so many \\"hot Jupiters\\" surprised a lot of astronomers involved in the hunt for exoplanets. Exoplanetologists may not find plausible earthlike planets for many years."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"Political space tales aren't really my thing, but I must say that, politics aside, I was astonished that Asimov was so young when he wrote this. Few writers can write such good prose before middle-age. The story itself is rather mundane for a true sci-fi enthusiast. You'll not find any great discoveries by astronaut explorers or the like, but what it does do, it does well. His treatment of religion is silly though, and like most atheist writers, it's not very well thought out. I've not read anything else by him, but one hopes his later novels were better developed in that area. The mystical hints that run through nearly all of Arthur C Clarke's stories are the most intriguing thing about them. Asimov would have done well to have studied them."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"I couldn't wait to read the first of the Foundation novels, having got such great reviews, and having heard that it's been such an inspiration to so many other sci-fi authors. But I could barely finish it. The book is flat-out boring. There is no action, choosing rather to focus mostly on matters of political intrigue. If you like watching CSPAN, then you'll love this book.There is also no continuity of storyline or characters. The book constantly jumps ahead in time right about the time you've wrapped your head around the current characters and plot.It's like a set of boring short stories, loosely stitched together with an single underlying theme."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"The time frame in which the book takes place can best be described as &quot;A Long time ahead, in a galaxy far far away&quot;. Yes, that is a cheesy Star Wars cliche. However, readers expecting anything star warsey about this should expect to be sorely disappointed. This book focuses primarily on politics. There is not one ounce of violence in the book, which is a good thing, it is a nice break from almost everyother contemporary scifi novel, which all seem to impress people with their space ships 'n' aliens. The book is very good, but sometimes does get a little boring. I suppose this may be my fault, as I do have a short attention span. Anyhow, this book does a few twists in it, as everything may not be what it seems with Hari Seldons dream!So if you've been on the fringe of being a sci fi fan, but detest the embarassment of carrying around a book with giant robots on it, this book is for you."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"This book is my all-time favourite book. It is so amazing, especially the science Asimov created. And it made sense too! The story is awesome, and leaves you wanting more. This book (and the next two) beat of Lord of the Rings for all-time sci-fi/fantasy trilogy. Hopefully it will be made into a movie one day. Might even beat out LOTR with oscars too. It is a must read for anyone who loves sci-fi."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"This seems like awfully shoddy science fiction to me. The old complaint about thin characterization isn't even the worst of it, nor are the crazy anachronisms [rampant cigar smoking, newspapers and casual misogyny]. But so much of this plot develops in the form of uninteresting local political maneuvers between slightly AynRandized heroes and buffooning villians, with no sense of place or grandeur whatsoever.The timeline of the novel is suddenly too breif after introducing the vast concept of a 40,000 year swing through history, and neither the future society Asimov has envisioned nor the apparant brilliance of the plan at the heart of this series are ever portrayed convincingly. Whatever powerful effect this book may have had in its day, it is bereft of it now."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"... but that didn't prevent me from intensely disliking it. The characters are flat, the story is contrived, and why are all people of power in this world men? Very realistic idea of the future."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"I first read these books when I was in high school and althoughI almost never read fiction, and don't particularly like sciencefiction (even though I studied geophysics in university andwork as an engineer), these books made an immense impressionon me. As I began to study Judaism, I finally discovered thatAsimov, a non-observant, yet knowledgable Jew, was using theformat of science fiction to describe the Jewish concept of theredemption of mankind. A careful reading of the BiblicalProphets shows that the ideal world that history is leadingmankind towards has universal peace between nations and ade-emphasis of technology in favor of the development of man'sinner, morespiritual side. However, this development of man's spiritualqualities and move towards universal harmony is accompaniedby upheavels and wars. Jewish tradition also says that theworld is sustained by 36 \\"hidden\\" righteous people whosegood deeds and spritual superiority are vital from preventingthe destructive forces in the world, both natural andman-made from overcoming everything and leading the worldto chaos.Asimov used the two Foundations as his vehicle for describingthis cosmic process, and an important part of the story isthe necessity of the Second Foundation to remain \\"hidden\\" toallow the process to work itself out.As far as the story itself is concerned, it is true that it isdated...for example, Asimov places the capital of the GalacticEmpire on the planet Trantor which \\"is at the center of theGalaxy\\". Today, it is believed that the center of the galaxyis full of black holes and lethal amounts of radiation, so itis unlikely there would be life as we know it there. Also,Asimov posits atomic energy as being the ultimate form of powerbut physics has advanced beyond that point to fusion and otherexotic forms of power.On the other hand, Asimov wrote these stories in the wake ofthe Second World War and so he is quite aware of how so manyinstitutions created by men...including governments and religiousestablishments, even starting with the bestof intentions, seems to run into crises. Thus the GalacticEmpire, which brought centuries of peace and prosperity tomankind, is brought inevitably to a point of degeneration, andhow the (First) Foundation itself, founded by idealistic,intelligent people who are at least partly aware of theirimportant role in shaping a better future for mankind, rapidlydegenerates into a repressive dictatorship.As others have pointed out, these stories have almost no \\"action\\",which is fine with me (my favorite movies and TV shows alsohave no action, e.g. Twelve Angry Men) and in spite of thefact that these stories are 60 years old, I recommend themto anyone who wants a deeper look at mankind's natureand its destiny."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"The greatest sequel ever!

I got lost in the pointless dialog and was unable to finish."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"The book is written about an empire in the future. I'm not really sure why Asimov thought that the future galaxy would be ruled by an emporer, which is a dying system of government, instead of a democratic republic. I know this is nit-picking, but I didn't like this book.Apparently, the future can be predicted with a high degree of accuracy using math and statistics. Anyone who works as a mathematician or statistician, as I do, knows that it's difficult to predict what's going to happen in anyone's life tomorrow, much less the entire world 500 to 1000 years into the future using statistics.This book is intellectual worship, which is something I can't stand. Intellectual worship is when people think they are intellecually superior to everyone else, so feel they should rule over everyone else, if only you would listen to them. This idea drips off the page as event after event is predicted by some really smart dude. This smart dude predicted a collapse of civilization and treated it as inevitable. Another idea that's patently absurd- that any event that occurs is inevitable.If this guy was so smart as to predict, with a high degree of accuracy, the downfall of civilization, and the rising of a new one, along with the traumatic events this new civilization would go through, why wasn't he smart enough to avert the downfall of the original civilization. Surely, with his predictive ability people would listen to him, but he decides to let it crumble for whatever reason.And Asimov is a mediocre writer. The story is only moderately interesting because no character really gets developed. I read this book because as a sci-fi fan, I felt obligated."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"I enjoy Asmov's science books. They are informative, clever and witty. But his science fiction is another matter. They are poorly written. And worse, I didn't believe a word of Foundation. Such accutate prediction is impossible. It's not only extremely difficult to predict the major trends, but to have his character predict such minor details as well is absurd. Just one example of the difficulties of prediction: Isaac Asimov, a well informed and very intelligent man, missed the computer revolution, though it was already under way when he wrote Foundation."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"So many people like this book and have called it a \\"classic\\" - I felt I had to read it. I am not a hard-core sci-fi reader, but I did enjoy reading books by Herbert, Heinlein, Bradbury, and the like. So I though I'd give Asimov a chance. To my surprise, I didn't like this book at all.I have read some bad books in my life, but this is the first bad book I bothered to read all the way through. I kept waiting for it to get better. I kept waiting for the \\"eureka\\" moment when I finally understood why everyone likes this book so much. It never happened, and when I finally came to the end of the book, I realized that Mr. Azimov stole a good two hours of my life and gave me NOTHING in return.The story sounds interesting, and in the hands of another writer it may have bore fruit. Unfortunately, in Mr Asimoz's hands, the story falls flat in the implementation. Had the writing not been funny, I would have been completely bored. Of course, Mr. Azimov did not intentionally make me laugh - sadly, his understanding of the human condition appears to be based largely on old, cheap pulp fiction novels. The characters are completely one dimensional and unconvincing. I truly cannot understand why anyone would like this book - but calling it a classic is simply unbearable. I can only assume that most of the people reviewing this book favorably are children. In any case, they are certainly not familiar with truly good writing. My advice: avoid this book."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"Being a sci-fi fan myself, I decided I wanted to try reading some of the works by the giants of sci-fi. I had always heard how great &quot;Foundation&quot; was, so I thought I'd start with this one. I was thoroughly disappointed! Asimov used way too many large words (&quot;using dollar words where dime words would suffice&quot;). The story seemed to jump around from one time to another. The characters were very one-dimensional and very flat...I didn't have that &quot;I wonder what's going to happen next to ---&quot;. I just didn't care what was going to happen next to the characters or in the story. There didn't seem to be anything to propel this story along; nothing to develop the characters or the story. I read over 100 pages and I still had no interest in what was happening. (Even Stephen King, who can be pretty tough to get into his stories, has me hooked within 50 to 60 pages!) I just don't get what all the hype is over this book. Could someone out there PLEASE tell me! I will try to get into his Robot series...maybe he has better character and story development in them...I hope!"},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"The Foundation is completely undeserving of the fame accredited to it. Had it been more eloquently executed, the collage of textbook style narrative and bad dialogue might have been sufficient to generate a bearable story. All the social concepts Asmov brings up are well worn and ill-portrayed on the backdrop of a generic, illogical sci-fi universe. His writing style is bland and every one of his characters can be found by an other name in star wars."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"This has to be one of the most over rated books (and series) of all time.The dialog and character development is horrible. The characters have about as much depth as paper dolls.

Actually, I didn't have high hopes going into it, as I am not a big fan of Asimov's writing. While his technical approach is always entertaining, he tends to become very stilted and ham-fisted when it comes to characterization. It was this quality that turned me off of &quot;I Robot&quot; and almost got me to give him up completely; however, seeing as the Foundation trilogy is regarded as a classic of the genre, I had to give it a shot.As everyone has said over and over (and I'll do it, too), the Foundation trilogy is a futuristic parallel of the fall of the Roman Empire and the following Dark Ages. Hari Seldon, father of Psychohistory, sees the writing on the wall and establishes the Foundation in order to buffer the fall of civilization and technology. The first book of the series, &quot;Foundation&quot;, does a good job of setting the stage for what is to come. The book is told in 5 parts, each one focusing on a different character or time period in the early history of the Galactic Empire's fall. Surprising to me, Asimov actually does a fairly good job with his characterization. There's very little melodrama, and the story is evenly paced, holding up pretty well for a tale begun in 1941. The only complaints I have with the story are that the main characters always seem to be overly confident in themselves, as if they are holding all the cards and can easily handle any adversity while blindfolded (presenting a tense situation fails if the protagonist has no concern or doubt for how things will be resolved). Also, as the different parts of the story skip a hundred years here, 30 years there, etc., it may take some imagination on the reader's part to develop a &quot;big picture&quot; of what the Empire is really going through. These are minor issues, however, and should not detract from enjoying the book.One last observation - I have noticed that Hari Seldon appears to be getting younger with each new printing of this book. My copy of &quot;Foundation&quot; from the early '80s, with cover art by Darrell Sweet, shows a decrepit, bent, wizened Seldon (as I feel he should look). The next cover, by Michael Whelan from the early '90s, shows a more healthy and happy Seldon. The cover of the latest edition, shown on this page, features a Seldon who looks like he's about to jump out of his wheelchair and punch you out. You have to love that artistic license..."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"Keep in mind: this is the first book in a trilogy. Even though each book stands on its own as a classic of science fiction, you have to take them as a whole, I think. Besides, once you've read Foundation, you'll want to read the others. That said, I first came across this trilogy in the library and was reluctant to read it. On first reading, I was weighed down and a little turned off by the politics, and I almost lost interest. Hari Seldon, a mathemetician, predicts that the mighty Empire, centered on the giant planet/city Trantor, will be destroyed in 500 years, which will be followed by 30,000 years of barabarism and social decay. Only after that will a new Empire emerge. He devises a plan to shrink that dark period to 1,000 years, and new rulers of his design will take over. After a trial, Seldon and his band are exiled to a backwater planet, Terminus, surrounded by stronger and more resourceful enemies. What band? Those working on a great Encyclopedia to preserve the knowledge of mankind once the dark period strikes. They wouldn't travel to the other end of the galaxy on their own accord. Forced exile was the only way Seldon's Plan would work. Soon the true purpose of the Plan is revealed. Seldon was dead before the Foundation established itself on Terminus. But he appears as a hologram during times of crisis. It turns out Seldon predicted these crises, and the Foundation's actions are forced down one path. The Foundation slowly gains advantage over its enemies. It will still be centuries before they are strong enough to take on the Empire. The Foundation gains these advantages sometimes by heroic acts of its leaders. But according to Seldon, the actions of the individual are unpredictable and can't be counted on. So is there some greater power guiding this whole scheme? The question is not approached until the next book, Foundation and Empire. We and the men of the Foundation know that Hari Seldon formed two Foundations, and that's all we know. You might spot elements that George Lucas borrowed for his Star Wars movies: Empires, small versus the mighty, parsecs, blasters, and as you read further, mind control. Foundation sets up the series strongly. Read it, and keep reading. The politics don't bother me so much anymore. They are a necessary part of the story. That's why I say to take the trilogy as a whole. All three books are essential to the whole story, one is not necessarily the best, but the real excitement and surprise endings are saved for the next two books."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"\\"Foundation\\" by Isaac AsimovIn the distant future: humanity has spread to the stars and it has been so long that most have forgotten which planet humanity originated from. All of the inhabited planets (almost 25 million) owe allegiance to the Empire, a gigantic centralized government that is located on the planet of Trantor. Hari Seldon is a scientist and the utmost expert of new science known as \\"Psychohistory\\". Hari uses psychohistory which is mathematics based to map out the future in detail. He has determined that the Empire will fall within 300 years. Hari knows that he cant stop the fall but wishes to minimize the dark ages that follow in which he predicts that most science will be lost and that it will take humanity over 30,000 years to get back to where they currently are. Hari thinks he can minimize this amount of time by forming the Foundation whose job it will be to compile all knowledge into a galactic encyclopedia.........This was actually a very good and well thought out story. The story unwinds in an interesting and unique way that is very different from most sci-fi stories I have read.The Good: The story was well thought out and unfolds interestingly. Asimov is a great world/universe builder and his take on the emerging society of the foundation and its purpose driven evolutions is excellent. The story is well paced and never really felt like it had time to slow down. It is surprising that Asimov managed to tell his tale which covers an expansive amount of time in just under 250 pages and still make it feel fleshed out.The Bad: Some say the characters in \\"Foundation\\" are flat. This isn't untrue however as surprising as it may sound this doesn't have an extreme adverse effect on the story. The reason it doesn't is because the story isn't character driven. The characters act more as small pieces in a large extended chess game and merely serve to move an event driven story along its path.Overall: Foundation was a great and unique read. Pick it up and give it a read!"},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"The foundation is setup to secretly monitor mankind through its darkest hours. It reminded me a little of Orwell's 1984. In placing humans away from the central government on a planet with few resources. They are forced to develop quickly. This is a novel more about political machinations than about action. The contradictions in human nature are here to analyze. The characters use guile, spirit, & cunning to survive. Some 80% of the book is dialogue & the character development is a bit shallow. Nonetheless, Mr. Asimov portrays the future in poignant & diverse ways. The predicted conflict makes the story of galactic history entertaining, especially since this was written in 1951. Some 7 years before Sputnik was launched. The author deserves praise for his imagination that was well ahead of his time."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"I personally enjoyed ever word of this particular work. Many other reviewers have gone into the plot, etc. so I will not do so here to any depth. This is one of those works of SiFi that will appeal to certain taste, while others may find it not to their liking. There is a great deal of politics (almost Pre WWI European) involved in the story line. As the story covers (all books included) over one thousand years, there are many, many characters to track and keep track of. This is indeed a series of short stories, all linked. I personally enjoy this sort of thing but can see where some might not. That being said, it, the book, can certainly be regarded as a classic in this particular genre and certainly should be read by any student of such. You certainly cannot fault the author's story telling ability and imagination. I enjoyed this one a lot and do highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"Foundation is an amazing story about the ingenuity of one man whose quests bring him to the brink of barbarism-- in a time a million years from now.

I recommend for anyone with a likeness to math, history, or science, or anyone who has read anything by Asimov, Brin, or Bear."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"With all the rave reviews about this book, perhaps I set my hopes too high. I just really didn't care for this book. There is almost no character development (since every chapter spans huge jumps in time) and the \\"science\\" in this novel takes a back seat to the political ideas of the author. With endless pages of dialog and few reasons to care about any of the characters, I had a very hard time getting through this one. And while I know it was written years ago, the author's science-fantasy was pretty much limited to \\"nuclear powered devices.\\" That just didn't feel like much of a stretch of the imagination, all things considered.I thoroughly enjoy sci-fi when told by authors such as H.G. Wells and Ray Bradbury. These authors know how to paint a picture in your mind and bathe your imagination in colorful imagery. In Foundation, however, I was thoroughly unimpressed by the style, context and story as told by Azimov - it was boring, unimaginative, and I never even had the pleasure of painting the scene being played out in my mind. I would definitely not recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"For its time \`Foundation' by Isaac Asimov was a tale that predicted futurism as the calculation of the eventual outcome of each technological economic progression that mankind could, and would, go through, if it stuck to certain paths, especially the implementation of the concept that \\"small is better\\" with an economic drive that produces its best results when under stress, such as wartime. This model is pretty much the way the world works today with technology leaps made when there is a demand for it to do so and at no time is this demand greater than when a nation is faced with a possible crisis. Asimov's \`Foundation' is a story about a society of colonized scientists that have been chosen by Hari Seldon, the creator of psychohistory, who sees a crisis developing in the cosmic empire that can only be avoided if certain conditions are met for each impending emergency that is predicted through psychohistorical analysis. He sets up an off world colony at the unknown edge of the galaxy, the foundation, that goes through several generations, with each generation reaching a hidden 'Seldon crisis' point that becomes the focus of several successive stories in the book. Futurism was actually an artistic movement originating in Italy around 1910 whose aim was to express the energetic, dynamic, and violent quality of contemporary life, especially as embodied in the motion and force of modern machinery. Nowadays it means to believe that the meaning of life and one's personal fulfilment lie in the future and not in the present or past. Foundation symbolizes these ideas. Although not the most exciting or action packed SF you could read, is also somewhat limited in its SF feel, is more of a revelation of economics and is the kind of literary material that would impress the business and politically minded reader more than the seasoned SF reader. None-the-less this is still an important work that remains relevant today as it did in the early 50s, but the sequels might be a bit of a hard sell on the bases of this educational SF novel."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"I love this book and now fully understand why Asimov is considered one of the grandmasters of this genre. Over the years I have read a considerable amount of Science Fiction; books ranging from military exploits to technological exploits, but never have I read one that I would consider high literature.In this book Asimov deals with issues such as religion, politics, economics and the control that they all grant in such a deft way that it in no way detracts from a riveting and page turning novel. Take, for instance this quote from page 210.\\"The religion we have is our all-important instrument toward that end. With it we have brought the Four Kingdoms under our control, even at the moment when they would have crushed us. It is the most potent device known with which to control men and worlds\\"In regards to the power of economics\\"The whole war is a battle between those two systems; between the Empire and the Foundation; between the big and the little. To seize control of a world, they bribe with immense ships that can make war, but lack all economic significance. We, on the other hand, bribe with little things, useless in war, but vital to prosperity and profits.\\" - Pg. 231My one complaint is really based on a personal preference. I really enjoy a novel which has one central character that I can get to know and even identify with. I think that it helps to draw the reader into the story. However, Foundation covers several hundred years in just a couple hundred pages thereby making this impossible. This is a small point, but for me detracts slightly from the story.That said I adore this book and am eagerly looking forward to finishing out the series. If you have not read it then I say move it to the top of the list. This is truly one of the great SciFi stories of all time.Leave a comment below and let me know what you think!"},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"Foundation surprised me. I had been expecting dry, hardcore science fiction with hard to grasp worlds and characters. I couldn't have been more wrong. Foundation takes politics, psychology, statistics and survival and showcases them in a galaxy far, far away.Time passes quickly in the novel, so you don't get very attached to any of the characters. The focus is the big picture, the future, and the steps taken to prevent the coming anarchy. More than that, the focus is on the plot. Clean dialogue and a lack of heavy description keeps the plot constantly moving forward. The pace the plot progression sets makes the book very hard to put down. Foundation is a smart and easy read that deserves its label as being the best science fiction books of all time."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"Comes this novel, given to me on Christmas, by my dad, on the recomendation of one of his co-workers. I am not a big science fiction fan, not that I've read dozens of sci-fi books and hated them. It's just that besides what I run into in the occasional Koontz or King, I have little interest in sci-fi.So after Christmas, a month or so goes by, and I finally open \\"Foundation\\". Doing research before reading this, I am quite impressed at how popular this series is. After reading the book, I clearly see why. The first few pages took a re-read, as I was very confused. Before I knew it, im onto part 2 and not able to put this book down. All I can say now is I can't wait to get my hands on the rest of the series. I was in the mood for something different than my usual reading, and this really delivered. Asimov writing is intelligent, yet simple. His character's aren't deep, but the plot amazes. His imagination is amazing.What I especially enjoy about this book, is that each of the five parts takes place many years after the previous part, so you really feel as if you know the whole empire's history.All in all, this book took me from not caring much for sci-fi, to at the bare minimum reading the rest of this series, and eventualy, probably reading alot if not all of Asimov's work. A book that's on the short side never contained so much in opinion. I am now an Isaac Asimov fan. Recommended HIGHLY!"},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"After reading the whole trilogy I must say that the first installment still has the biggest impact for the single reason that this is where the whole grand idea was conceived and presented for the first time.The best aspect of this story is, of course, the awsome interplay between technology, politics, religion, economy, and culture within the galactic periphery in the immediate vicinity of planet Terminus, the location of the so called First Foundation. This interplay is cleverly woven into a series of plots propelled by a handful of characters. That focus upon a few key characters in a sense brought the whole story down to earth (and for the better).The founder himself, Hari Seldon, is already long dead by the 2nd chapter but the plan he and his co-conspirators set in motion lingers on.Couple of problems are evident with the story and some suspension of disbelief is required to overcome them.First is the time scale in which the changes are set in. To put it simply, descend of parts of the galaxy encompassing hundreds of planetary systems into that sort of technological and scientific barbarism\\" within mere 50 years is not belivable. Establishing a religion based on technology within 30 years after that is still kind of on the less belivable side but it depends strongly on the magnitude of the technological difference between barbarians\\" and the foundationeers, so there is room for interpretation.Second is the technology itself. Nuclear fission has been known and used for 60 years and lost most of its appeal as the ultimate energy source of the future.In the meantime there has been countless ideas about alternative sources of energy much greater than fission and entirely possible (notably: nuclear fusion and matter/antimatter annihilation). To put it simply, the idea that nuclear fission will be powering everything at the point in time 12 millenia from now is archaic.Besides nuclear power, there are number of minor ideas introduced in the book that also did not hold well or at all since its writing (prevalent smoking, for instance). Together, the whole technological and cultural setting of the book has sort of a retro feel now... kind of like the Fallout games.All that, however, can be forgiven for the most part since it is often impossible to write about technology of the future merely decades from now let alone whole millenia from now. Asimov was a writer and a scientist, not a psychic.Striking is also the absence of biochemistry or genetics, since one would assume that those would be Asimov's strong points for the fact that he majored and worked in biochemistry.Third, while the passage of time had appropriate atmosphere of scale (more or less), the galaxy felt kind of small. The distances weren't shown or explained very well so a trip from the Periferies to Trantor or Kolgan(sp?) seems like a trip to an amusement park only some 100 miles away.Nevertheless, the best what Foundation has to offer more than makes up for its shortfalls."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"Imagine an empire so humongous it stretches across the Milky Way galaxy. Imagine a mathematical formula that can actually prove future events. Then imagine that formula predicts this galactic empire will soon crumble and a new dark ages lasting at least 30,000 years will follow.If you can imagine all that, you get the gist of Foundation by Isaac Asimov and the beginning of a highly regarded series of books in the science fiction genre.What happens next is a group of people try to find ways to circumnavigate, though not necessarily halt, the new approaching dark age.Asimov isn't for everyone, and I can't admit to loving his prose. But his ideas for plots are top notch. This book, and the series of books that follow it, are proof of this.Asimov's writing is often considered too dense for the casual reader, and there's some truth to this. If you like your science fiction with lots of action and ray guns and alien spaceships flying about, Asimov isn't for you. But if you like hard science fiction based upon hard, indepth science, this Asimov is probably right for you, especially the Foundation series."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"Foundation is a great book to read. The Foundation trilogy is a great series to read. That being said, there are little elements within the story that date some of the points of reference Asimov ascribes to his characters, but it's actually charming to read the references to 'atomics', etc. Asimov is a master at story-telling, and this series certainly helped to cement his reputation."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"I'd like to begin this review by saying that I typically don't particularly like most science fiction. In fact, I hate most of it. What Asimov did here was create an outline of continuity that seamlessly followed a logical progression, displayed memorable characters that begin and end as heroic figures, and never once does he insult the intelligence of the reader.The primary difference between Asimov and the Sci-Fi writers that I loathe so much, is that Isaac does not stoop to create melodrama; he doesn't exaggerate his descriptions or dialogue in order to convince the reader that the heroes are great, rather he let's their actions demonstrate their greatness.The only thing that does bother me about Asimov, is how many terrible authors who have clearly attempted to emulate his ideas and writing style only to create abominations of thought and literature. I'm looking at you, L.R.H."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"When I was a teenager, I was stunned by \\"The End of Eternity\\". When later I started reading the Empire and Foundation novels, I was unpleasantly surprised by the style simplification that seemed to accelerate with every novel.

Somehow, it resembled Federico Fellini's movies - same feeling of creation of the worlds just in front of you."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"A science fiction book where the science is more political than technological. Psychology had advanced to the point where mathematical models of mass psychology could predict large group social behavior far into the future ( rather like the meteorological models attempt to predict weather several days in advance). The predictions in this case extended over several centuries and predicted the galaxy would undergo a dark age in which civilized learning and behavior would decrease and collected knowledge could be lost. A Foundation was formed at the far edge of the galaxy with the sole job of organizing and saving all knowledge. Since the book takes place over a long period of time we follow the adventures of several heroes involved with the Foundation's effort to not only maintain knowledge (for the time when civilization will return) but to do so while maintaining peace. This was done first by creating a religion based on the fact that only the Foundation had technology, most importantly nuclear power. This source of power, needed by all, then became an object of worship, and priests were trained in how to present the dictates of the Foundation (Source of Power) as a reason for good behavior. When this sham began to fail, it was found that trade between the high tech Foundation and the low tech other nations was more profitable than war, and could maintain peace. This is the first book in a series of three, so most likely the next book tells how the trade idea worked out. Although my description does make it sound boring, I found it to be an interesting book, the politics of which sound familiar in today's world - I may read the next in the series."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"Oh how avidly I read these long ago.

Set far in the future, Hari Seldon's goal is to shorten an impending period of Dark Ages from tens of thousands of years to one thousand years. To do so, he creates an organizational entity, the Foundation, and maneuvers to create circumstances so that the Foundation will recreate the Galactic Empire amid a blossoming of science and technology.This book is the first in a series that will keep you happily reading for days. In Foundation, the stage is set for the problem, and you will begin to understand the plan that Seldon has employed by examining the first 150 years after the Foundation is established.The book is built around four crises (Seldon Crises) that shape the potential of the First Foundation to fulfill its goal. In the first crisis, the Foundation is viewed as being a traitorous activity by the political authorities. Seldon explains that his purpose is to create an encyclopedia to encompass all current knowledge before it is lost. The crisis is survived when he agrees to take the project into exile on a planet with few natural resources at the far edge of the galaxy.Fifty years later, that fledgling is threatened by its powerful neighbors who have greater resources and military power. The Emperor can no longer protect the Foundation. Thirty years after that, another attempt to militarily capture the Foundation occurs. Another seventy years later, a fourth crisis occurs when remnants of the Empire start funneling advanced weapons to planets at the edge of galaxy that oppose the Foundation.Each crisis is overcome with a different approach, by a different leader. And the Foundation continues to develop towards its eventual form.These crises are much like a good mystery story. You know there's been a crime that needs to be solved, but you haven't quite figured out how yet. Because there are four crises, you get to enjoy that problem-solving experience four times in one book! Pretty neat!The Foundation's advantage in all of these crises is that it has advanced knowledge and has applied it, while the rest of the Empire is losing knowledge. Pretty soon, things are falling apart technically for those outside the Foundation. The key technology is built around atomic power (as it appeared it would developed in the 1950s).Reviewing Foundation is a challenging task. This book has become a science fiction classic, yet many will see little value in it because the science fiction perspectives and forecasts about science are dated. The book has to be read in the context of the books that follow to be fully understood and appreciated, but how does that help the person who has just finished Foundation? Isaac Asimov used a most unusual style in the book, as though you are a historian uncovering bits of primary and secondary sources concerning a long ago period in time (that occurs in our future). That either makes the book more authentic (if you like that) or annoying (if you don't).At bottom, these contrasts require the reviewer to attempt to capture for the potential reader what makes this book an enduring classic.First, Foundation squarely asks a fundamental question: How should knowledge be built, maintained, and used for the benefit of all? A subset of that question is: What are the appropriate uses of knowledge? These are questions that we do not wrestle with nearly enough today. Many people enjoy thinking about these questions, and welcome their introduction by this book.Second, Foundation suggests that progress is faster with the benefit of planning that takes into account human nature. Seldon's discipline is the reliable behavior of large groups of people (psycho-history). Those who like to plan and those that do not will equally enjoy Asimov's scenario for making his point that we should build from our understanding of human behavior. You can debate the point and have lots of fun forever, based on what is here.Third, many social thinkers have been inspired by the Foundation concept to structure their own changes. Nonviolent political movements match the Foundation concept in many ways, for example. This book gives you a lens to consider many of the global agencies that have been created by international organizations.Fourth, what should be the relationship between knowledge and power? Usually, they are united. But the Foundation posits a world in which they can be divided, and that division could have some benefits. A current example would be the unharnessed knowledge of the Internet. No government will probably succeed in trying to hold dominion over it.Science fiction has long played a useful role in helping society to examine its most important scientific questions in advance. Then the concepts that seem useful become the early paradigms of scientific and social progress. In the case of Foundation, that paradigm here is applied to social progress primarily . . . not scientific progress. So think of this as a book about the science fiction of governing.Foundation suggests a world where knowledge has more power than today, and is also more effective at curbing harmful exercises of power than currently. That shining ideal, I believe, is at bottom the key to understanding Foundation's lasting and broad appeal.Whether you like, love, are indifferent to, or hate Foundation, I suggest you read the initial trilogy before making up your mind about this book. Much of the genius of Foundation (the first book) isn't apparent to most readers until the trilogy is read and grasped.One word of caution: Asimov wrote lots of one-draft wonder books, and was certainly not a great craftsman in his writing. Look past that writing quality to the conceptual brilliance of the picture he is painting.After you have finished the trilogy, ask yourself the question of how you can make knowledge more effective in promoting human moral and economic progress. I think you will find that to be an intriguing question well worth the attention you give to it. And you can think of Foundation to remind you of the question."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"Foundation is the epitome of the ideal of the pessimistic technocratic utopian. Strange as it may sound, the plot is as follows: pseudo-science finds a way to predict future, politicians banish scientists, scientists establish new citizenry, trade flourishes, scientists gain control through pseudo-religion. This supposedly tried-and-true pseudo-science is a way to predict the future by way of studying human behavior (an oddly fatalistic view of a scientific universe). However, I disagree with the notion and invest my interest in the rival fund of the \`Crazy Eddie' effect of Niven's Motie series where an individual can make the most drastic difference.I must further state that I was born in 1980 and began reading SF in 2007 with the likes of Niven, Bear and Brunner. I like my complex Iain Banks, voluminous Alastair Reynolds, mind-bending Greg Egan and ever-changing Brunner. Now while many of the so-called \`old timers' have proclaimed Foundation sacred like the novels of Dune, I am of the new generation and of the new voice, which can't be held to the same standard as the last generation (or two). Times changes, ideals change, perspectives change, terminology changes, tolerable prefixes change and personal development changes. While Dune may have been impressive in style and scope, it did not satisfy me in content, interest and follow through. To these effects, I wish to express my dissatisfaction with Foundation.To paraphrase an excellent book about the relationship between psychology and musical composition entitled \`Of Mind and Music,' the author states that repetition is an exploit of human emotion causing the listener (or in this case, the reader) to fall into a collective primal rhythm with fellow listeners (read: readers). Like in Foundation, the amount of repetition is akin to the acute attack of bass at a rave; theories are repeated endlessly, idiosyncratic allegories are scattered through every chapter and the word \`atomic' was shotgun blasted, litter strewn, scattered to the winds, chucked without consciousness onto nearly ever page (sign of the times, I presume?). Here is the alphabetical list of \`atomic' phrases found in Foundation:Atomic blaster, atomic drill, atomic drive (also the hyperatomic drive), atomic fire, atomic force, atomic force-shield, atomic gadgets, atomic generator, atomic knife, atomic power, atomic shear, atomic ships, atomic specialists, atomic techniques, atomic washing machine (bwah!) and atomic weapons.If \`style' could mean the expressed use of repetition, the Asimov has easily seduced the science fiction reader of the early 1950s. With the blossoming (pessimists read: destructive radiation) of the atomic age, the dream of an atomic future must surely have seemed to be an optimistic fantasy. Nowadays, the equivalent would be novels which saturate their content with micro- and nano- prefixes. Thus, it seems as Asimov had the initial bug of beginning of the \`atomic' prefix fixation? Did Asimov overdo it? In these regards, I stand to say that Asimov had a single-tracked mind.While reading the sciences and unfolding plot of the pseudo-science, I was constantly remained of the \`Seldon crisis' and the mightier-than-thou proverb \`Violence is the last refuge of the incompetent.' As an educated reader, I only need to be reminded once to have the full effect of conveyance and depth. Throw in the tame pre-sensor curses of \`Oh, space!' and the cringe-worthy \`Great galloping galaxies!' and you have for yourself a novel which is mildly aggravating, almost maddening. Repetition doesn't mean a solid follow through. Rather, it just means the author is either under-evaluating the reader of filling up word space.Additionally, the characters were as bland as cardboard for breakfast. Everyone seemed to be a utopian plutocrat or an idealistic capitalist in a struggling capitalist society. Scientists know best, so scientists so rule, right? It's ONE vision of style of government but the path Asimov takes is one of superiority and, ultimately, disagreement. The approach is too preachy to the benefits of an ideal technocratic civilization. Throughout, I understood the relationships and the dealings between opposing parties, but I found the unraveling as tedious as the usage of the word \`atomic.' Politico scenes compounded by feudal titles bored me to bits, much like Herbert's Dune, Tepper's Grass and some of Wolfe's Long Sun series. While the over-all feudal scene works well with the future technocratic/religious society, I find the kowtowing to be overwhelming (more so considering I already live in a fairly visible feudal society).Inevitably, as the word and review suggest, I must say that the novel has failed to impress me in the year 2010 after 30 years of mortality and four years of reading science fiction. Surely, many modern novels must have been based off the ideals presented in Foundation, but from my standpoint in the ear 2010, I fail to see greatness which was intrinsically embossed upon it during its publication and further years of intense readership. In the year 2010, the novel does not stand the ultimate test of time."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"In his Foundation Trilogy (later to be extended in additional books), the prolific science fiction/fact writer Isaac Asimov told a story of a small group of people who secretly steered the course of history using technology that we would now recognize as an outgrowth of memetics.

The ending gives the reader a broad prespective on Hari Seldon's plan and theory. I would rate the first stroy as very good. The second story is even better.

Furthermore they were written out of order, Foundation was the first, and the other two, Prelude to Foundation and Forward the Foundation were written 35-40 years later. Also, the stories were not &quot;tacked on&quot; each of the first three books is actually a collection of connected novellas, which orignally were published seperately in magazines."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"While reading this book, I couldn't help exulting on the philosophy of the book and the characters' conduct. Though the Foundation keeps confronting belligerent forces, the heads of Foundation's government and those in charge do not resort to violence! Instead of the automatic jump to use violence in a threatening situation, they use civil disobedience, embargos, and gentle ways of subjugation. Even though some warhawks (the Actionists of Terminus in Hardin's time) agitate the Foundation to go to war, in the end, the doves prevail, using their tactics of nonviolence. Since Asimov (genius) published this book in 1951, three years since the assassination of Mahatma Gandhi, I could tell that it was influenced by Gandhi's nonviolent philosophy. Albert Einstein recognized the enlightened mind of Gandhi, who advocated nonviolent tactics and change without shedding blood. Throughout Asimov's Foundation, published three years after Gandhi's assassination, Gandhi's teachings are very evident. Most readers probably didn't recognize this, but Foundation was probably influenced by one of the major figures of our century--Gandhi. Also, the nonviolent philosophies of Leo Tolstoy and Henry David Thoreau are also somewhat present."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"I really liked Foundation. Then I really liked the first part (&quot;The General&quot;) of this. And then the Mule showed up... First, Asimov always had trouble writing a mystery. I identified the Mule the first time he showed up, and I figured out the basics of his mutation as soon as the Visi-Sensor was described. And that leads me to my second nitpick. The Mule didn't need to have such a powerful ability to affect others. The ability to read minds plus high intelligence would give the Mule the same ability to predict reactions as a trained psychohistorian, and the Visi-Sensor would give him the tool to exploit it. The story itself would go much the same way, with the Mule's ability to force predicted reactions replacing his ability to force actions, but with a tighter integration with the ideas of the previous book. Furthermore, it would have meant none of the psychic conspiracies which proceeded to dominate in the books Second Foundation, Foundation's Edge, etc. The ability to twist minds transforms psychohistory from the powerful science of Foundation to simply a method of forecasting the societal impact of psychic manipulation. It also transformed the Foundation series from moderately hard SF stories about the impact of a new science to just another set of stories about mind control magic. BTW, I like fantasy and soft SF -- I just wish Foundation didn't change genres in mid-trilogy."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"Very briefly, to the pair of one-star reviews below, keep in mind that these stories were written in the 1940's! Must you blame Mr. Asimov for &quot;inaccuracy&quot; in a time where much more mainstream sources felt that by 1980 we'd all be zipping around in flying bubble cars? Obviously you missed the point here. The Foundation series is about our own humanity, not about where we will be technologically in the year 15000. No, I can't prove that there could actually be a Mule, but why waste your time trying to? The Mule is probably one of the best literary constructs to grace the world of science fiction, one that isn't decked out in gadgets and laser beams. There's something to be said about a writer that can make a sci-fi villian without resorting to hi-tech hijinks. You didn't like the Mule?

I have two degrees inmathematics, and am working on a Ph.D. in mathematics as a DIRECT RESULT of these books. Asimov explores the whole notion that human behavior is predictable on a very large scale, but completely unpredictable on an individual scale.

It's all here in abundance."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"Though \\"Foundation\\" was later tied to many other novels and stories that Isaac Asimov wrote, many of us considered this story to be the first of the Foundation Trilogy. We meet Hari Seldon and learn of the beginning of psychohistory. Hari has predicted, using psychohistory, that the 12,000 year old galactic empire is facing eminent collapse. Hari determined through this calculations that the collapse of the empire will lead to 30,000 years of chaos before a second empire forms. Hari also determined that by taking certain actions that the 30,000 years of chaos could be shortened to 1,000 years.Considering that this novel is only 256 pages long it covers a lot of ground. The novel begins on the ultra-urbanized planet Trantor and then heads to the edge of the galaxy. We watch the empire collapse and then the struggles of the Foundation as they attempt to re-start civilization. We also watch as the Foundation changes from a religious organization to a scientific one.This novel is the best of the first three Foundation books. Part of the reason may be that these stories were originally short stories. Also, Asimov was not trying to form a single cohesive story lasting 1,000 years; at this time he was just trying to launch an idea. I sometimes think it is easier to launch an epic adventure than it is to evolve the epic over hundreds or thousands of pages. Certainly Asimov's launch in this book was grand and is one of the best classic science fiction novels.The next two books in this series are \\"Foundation and Empire\\" and \\"Second Foundation.\\"Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"My 14 year old loves science fiction and fantasy and I've introduced him and reintroduced myself to some of the Classic Works of the Genre that Predate Star Wars and Serenity.Its been at least 20 years since I first read the trilogy.

Some are solved by trickery, some are resolved by Religion, and some by economics.I didn't notice until this reading that each \\"crisis\\" that emerges is resolved by someone thinking 'outside the box' of the people who resolved the previous crisis and are now controlling the reins of the Foundation.Classic scifi from the Golden Age before Star Wars.

He was NOT, however, a great writer. At times it is difficult to separate the brilliance and scope of his imaginative ideas from the pedestrian and awkward manner in which he presents them.\\"Foundation,\\" the first novel in the ever-lengthening Foundation series, is a collection of short stories originally published in \\"Astounding\\" magazine. The first couple are very good, but the last few are pretty uninteresting. The writing is uneven, dialogue is unrealistic, and characters are wooden and one-dimensional.

An edited version of it was published by Ace Books in the 1950s under the title \\"The Man Who Upset The Universe\\". It consists of two sections which are taken from shorter fiction that was published in \\"Astounding Science Fiction\\" in the 1940s. While better than the first novel in the series, there are still some weaknesses as a result of age. Asimov himself wrote in 1982 that the knowledge of astronomy at that time was \\"primitive\\" and that he could now take advantage of electronic computers in his stories, which hadn't been invented until he was halfway through the series in the 40s.The two sections of \\"Foundation And Empire\\" are:\\"The General\\" - In this story, the Foundation is attacked by what is left of the Empire. The Empire, though much weaker than it once was, is still stronger than the Foundation. This was first published as the novelette \\"Dead Hand\\" in the April 1945 edition of \\"Astounding Science Fiction\\".\\"The Mule\\" - Perhaps the best of the Foundation stories; in this one the Seldon plan is destroyed by its inability to predict a singular event. The Foundation is threatened by a person known only as The Mule. He is mysteriously able to defeat more powerful forces, with inferior forces. This was first published as the novella \\"The Mule\\" in \\"Astounding Science Fiction\\" in November and December of 1945.The trilogy has been recognized by readers and critics alike over the years.

Asimov has this clever idea that extensive control of the population requires religion, technology and the guise of freedom.In reading the introduction by Asimov he reveals the Foundation story was created after completing Gibbon's Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire.The story is full of political intrigue and religious power-plays.Some of my highlights from the book:\\"...religion-controlled commercial empire\\"\\"Violence is the last refuge of the incompetent.\\"\\"...so that we could incubate art, science, and technology, and form the nucleus of the Second Empire.\\"\\"Now any dogma primarily based on faith and emotionalism, is a dangerous weapon to use on others, since it is almost impossible to guarantee that the weapon will never be turned on the user.\\"I'm looking forward to the second and third books in the trilogy, Second Foundation and Foundation and Empire."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"I had never read any of the foundation novels and yet, considered myself a science fiction fan.

Even the smart ones do dumb things, they just do them for smart reasons."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"Really an enjoyable book to read. Asimov had such a hard task in this book, introducing his readers to a large span of history. Most of the book maintained immersion, but the smoking of the characters threw me off a bit (I wish someone would go through and pull the smoking out, as well as the newspapers, and change them to something else). Many people complain about character development being non existent in this book, but character wasn't the point of this work. I have never seen another author try in under 300 pages to cover the span of time covered in Foundation. For the constriction he put himself under, the characters are developed as far as they need to be with broad strokes.For people who are critical of this work, read contemporaries of Asimov, and you will find that only he, Bradbury, Herbert, and a few others even bother to develop characters. Most Scifi doesn't even bother to develop the science enough to stand on it's own. In this case, Asimov simply developed what he knew on the time through scaling the size, and using hyperspace to solve distance problems, so it was easy to accept every premise he laid down (well except for the smoking...)The whole point of the premise is that the main characters all have an inkling that there CAN BE NO HERO for Seldon's plan to work. If at any point, someone had acted with rash heroics, his mathmatics would be rendered null, and the decay of the galaxy would last for ten millennia instead of one."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"This book is simply way out of this scarry scarred annoying world we are forced to live in called earth, with all its stomach aches and dripping joints and footsores and boredom. But old Asimov gives you a chance to go way out of this into just plain gigantic empires and it's all so way past any human imagination it keeps you satisfied, your poor little soft skin human body satisfied, so long as you keep reading it. Asimmov knows really how to keep you out of it all as long as your nose in his pages. But what is too much a puzzle I just don't get is how so many people want to take a good fanstasy like his and say he is actually realistic, this is the world we are going to make ourselves in a few hundred years or even sooner. But these people are totally missing the point, I don't care even if Asimov himself wanted to make all this Foundation real oine day or hoped people would, beause then if we are actually living in this sort of Foundation Empire then, if you think about it, we'll all actually just be back in boring old scratchy reality again that always feels sort of uncomfortable like velcro. They just don't get how the whole genre is called \\"science fiction and FANTASY.\\" The two halfs go together like the inside and outside of your face. Keep reality out. Hooray for unreality and yummy unreality like this one."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"Breathes there a teenager of the md-20th century with a love of science fiction who was not weaned on the Foundation series? All that sweeping drama, testosterone-laden but basically non-violent (all the violence is simply swept into summarizing references to ships destroyed and cities ransacked) marching through decades without concentrating on anything really boring, like character development, emotional entanglements or the trappings of society. Not a single reference to such trash as classical music, or stage shows, or pop music, or romance, just sweeping views of a distant future (or could it have been the distant past?) with the means of traveling between stars in the galaxy in the flash of a gnat's eyelash.And yet . . . revisiting the beloved Foundation, reading through the filter of a lifetime of experience, cracks appear in the plaster, and beneath them one finds that the lath is too widely spaced, the bricks behind that lath are often without mortar, and one can see the trees where bricks are missing. We live already in an age where technology has bypassed this particular Universe. Computers have become infinitely more pervasive than Asimov might have dreamed in his wildest fantasy, for at the time of the writing they were mere collators of stacks of punched cards, the transistor had yet to be introduced or shrunk to the size of a grain of sand, much less a sub-microscopic speck imprinted by the millions on a tiny wafer of silicon.Asimov had enormous faith in the future of Humanity, but he had no idea of how rapidly that future would approach - or how slowly humans would react and adapt to the challenges posed. No Empire can be established when information is instantaneously available to three-quarters of the population. Will an army composed of humans indefinitely repress an entire population composed of their friends, family, relatives? We see the answer in Libya, in Egypt, in Syria, in Africa - where the mobile phone has allowed guerrilla tactics to be employed by any group, whether terrorist or freedom-fighter or mall-invasion gangs or \\"mothers against the death camps of dog pounds.\\"Human society has been transformed by 24/7 information availability - but the universe of the Foundation proposes a populace of ciphers acting in ignorance of facts that would already be generally available in the 21st century. \\"Just Google it\\" or \\"look it up in Wikipedia\\" is nowhere to be found. There is a project of the First Foundation to write a \\"Galactic Encyclopedia\\" - yet it already exists in 2012.And yet that universe is immensely attractive, reduced to comic book simplicity, perfect for any adolescent (whether 14 or 74) to immerse himself - or very infrequently herself, as this universe is truly misogynist: the strongest female is just a papier mach&eacute; accoutrement.The psychobabble of \\"psychohistory\\" which is the very premise of the Foundations is wholly implausible, of course. The introduction by Asimov of \\"The Mule\\" is his admission of the absurdity of such a concept, which he probably didn't consider when the first book was written. Man has mutated more rapidly in the past 10,000 years than Asimov's populace has in 50,000 - a highly unlikely probability in the event that man actually progresses to interstellar colonization.All that said - I downloaded the trilogy on Kindle whilst in America, read it through lovingly, and was again transported to that clean, technologically impossible universe, forgetting all the travails of real life at present, putting the horrors of terrorism, the Hunger Games, the beheadings of \\"infidels\\" and the lies of politicians to one side for too brief a span. It isn't great literature, not even great Science Fiction - yet it is riveting to any adolescent male who enjoys reading as opposed to or in parallel with the escapism of cinematic action films like the \\"Matix\\" or \\"Terminator\\" trilogies.For some reason, Europeans aren't allowed to download the books. No doubt the vagaries of copyright laws, tax authorities and those %^&* politicians - as well as the accursed lawyers (who are blissfully absent from the trilogy, undoubtedly bred out of existence due to their total lack of humanity).Asimov was the supreme techie of his time - and it shows in his use of language - sparse, precise, technically impeccable, but occasionally impenetrable without a modicum of concentration.I heartily recommend it to you !"},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"Asimov is incredibly easy to read. His sentences are perfectly formed, neither too long, nor too decorated, nor too sparse. He strikes the perfect balance for his type of story, driving things forward consistently through description or dialogue whenever each is appropriate.This story takes place over a rather large time period and could really be considered a collection of closely related short fiction instead of a novel. It works well that way. We're only given information on the most exciting periods of time in the Foundation's history, and we're left to fill in most of the blanks on our own.On the downside, there wasn't much time to get to know any of the characters. I, Robot follows the same two characters through several situations and you get to know something about them by the end (even if they are almost cardboard cutouts, it works). In Foundation, nobody lasts long enough to really care about.Despite that flaw, it did what any good book should do- it made me interested in continuing the story. Luckily, this is a long series. I'll have plenty of time to finish it."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"WHY CAN'T I BUY THIS FOR MY KINDLE?????

We start out with the psychohistorians with their leader Hari Seldon who has predicted a 10,000 year Empire is about to crash to its knees and herald in a new Dark Ages. Hari can't stop the Dark Ages but he can shorten it.Interestingly he creates a priest class that runs the \\"nucleonics\\" of the Foundation, its erstwhile goal of creating an Encyclopedia Galactica set aside by stemming the tide of losing technology.You see, the Empire is losing its grip on the other sectors of the galaxy. More and more are dividing and becoming their own little kingdoms. The book centers around several characters who, through inside and cleverness, make things happen to keep the Foundation and create an insidious society that keeps it going.Asimov as an author, I have always been impressed with. His ability to create and predict (micro-miniaturization), parodies and criticism of religion and science, trade and technology, is throughout the book.Near the end, we find that The Foundation is set to expand. Each chapter stands on its own and can be difficult for some to follow. But each chapter expands decades, some more, and as such can be hard to keep up.Highly recommended. Not \\"hard core\\" sci-fi so much as character-driven sci-fi.Recommend:The Foundation Trilogy Boxed Set (Foundation, Second Foundation, Foundation and Empire)"},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"The foundation novels are superb!

Somewhat erratic and hard to follow."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"I highly recommend the time to read \\"Foundation\\"...it just may convince you to continue on with the rest of the series. I believe it was the forerunner and main idea behind the concept of a galactic empire as has been expanded on by Star Wars and Star Trek. If you would like to see the genesis of the idea behind those phenomena then you'll very much be rewarded by reading the Foundation series...besides, anything by Asimov is worth its weight in gold and this is the zenith of his space operatic writings!"},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"I cannot recommend Foundation, and its entire series, highly enough. When it comes to worldbuilding, and examining the possibilities of earth's future, Asimov does it best. His entire basis is that intelligence, learning, and confrontation of the unknown will be our salvation, instead of ignorance or seeing who carries the biggest gun. A welcome change."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"The book doesn't really need yet another enthusiastic review, so I'll keep this to the point.The stories in this book are really enjoyable. You get to learn about characters in the beginning and then spend the rest of the time reading about the legacy they created and the later events that they had a hand in shaping. I find this satisfying in a way similar to the Dune series but I didn't have to read 6 books.As with every Asimov book I've read, the plots in this book are forged and hewn into complicated machines that are disassembled before your eyes at just the right climactic moment. It makes for a hard book to put down."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"The Foundation is a series of books about two Foundations at the end of the Galaxy, at the rotting fringes of the Galactic Empire. Psychohistorian Hari Seldon has predicted the fall of the Galactic Empire, and 30,000 years of barbarism that will follow. The Foundations are established at two opposite edges of the Galaxy, little settlements that contain all human knowledge. The problem is that there are certain crises that the Foundations must overcome, with as little guidence from Seldon as possible.This was the first Asimov book I've ever read, so I didn't know really what to expect. I found I loved it! It was full of interesting characters, and each novelette showed a different point of time in the Foundation, so instead of slowly going through each year in the 1000 years of barbarism, you actually get somewhere. The characters had pros and cons to them, and seemed well rounded. It also showed a change in character through time, such as characters that were once sharp become dull and characters that used to rebel fall in line. Instead of telling you all about the character on the first page, it gave a general idea and then let the story tell the characters. One part I really liked was that it had plot twists that I didn't see coming, and the plot wasn't completely transparent.In the end, this book was a very interesting sci-fi novel that kept me going, and held my interest until the end."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"I realize that it is a fairly arrogant thing to think that I have something new to say about this classic work that the 335 people who reviewed it before me haven't said already, so if you are reading this, you must REALLY be interested in this series.The only reason I'm bothering is because I tend to write personal reviews with personal musings, a habit which has cost me more than a few \\"helpful\\" votes here and there.My purpose here (really) is to be a sort of compass for people, especially newer SF fans who are just learning about the genre.If you are a member of this group then you need to ask yourself a question. That question is: Are you interested in rich, well drawn characters that develop over time and make you love them? If the answer is yes, for God sake, go read something else. This is no insult to these books, they are great, but if you want character development, you really need to look elsewhere. SF in this time period in general tended to be rather, um.. what's the word... DULL, THAT'S THE WORD. Notice I didn't say bad, I said DULL. SF books of this period read more like philosophy tracts then what we would think of as novels.NOW!! With all that being said, when I first read this book in the 8th grade I thought it was the best thing since Dune (I didn't have a real sense of copyright dates so Dune came first.The reason I liked this book so much had something very much to do with my love of history and the underlying idea that you could use math (another interest of mine) to predict it. For me that was great, my fellow 8th graders thought I was In-SANE. They didn't get it, as they didn't get most things I was interested in and so I sluffed them off like the useless intellectual baggage they were.Now, at 34, I reread these books, and now I think they may have had a point. This book (and the ones after it) are just people having long political discussions as time goes by in a series of increments. Because the book is comprised of short stories that are set decades apart, you get all the grandeur and scope of a great epic with almost none of the action.To make this clear and simple, this book is about politics. There is absolutely nothing wrong with a book about politics, but if you read the description and you think this is a grand epic full of action and war and complex politics then you are going to get one out of three. If you want ALL three, I suggest that you read the original Dune series instead.It should be noted that when I was reading Foundation, the normal children were reading The Pigman and their idea of SF was William Sleator's Interstellar Pig and Jane Yolen's Dragon's Blood. These are all good books, but it just so happened that I wasn't normal and so I was reading Dune and Foundation.My point is this: your average run-of-the-mill younger reader will probably find this incredibly boring, but if you are one of the odd ones, the geeky ones, the ones who watch TV Sci-Fi and think \\"There has to be more than this,\\" you know, the kind who actually don't think that a movie being old doesn't automatically equate to a movie being BAD and/or isn't afraid of a book because it has more than 24 pages, this one just might be for you.If on the other hand, you think Star Trek or even Star Wars are the peak of SF (I did at one point) you may not be ready until you have a couple of years on you. Lucky for us the people immigrating to print SF are growing up with much more mature SF then I had on TV. Babylon 5, Firefly, Battlestar Galactica, the first season of Heroes and the British New Wave shows like Doctor Who and Torchwood, completely and especially Torchwood are ensuring that the people who change over to print SF are much more well balanced then I was at that age. I had Robotech as my big Sci-fi epic and that was IT, and anyone who is a fan of THAT show knows that blueballs is no myth, we've been waiting for the end of that story for 25 years and.. but that's a different review.These books are a cornerstone of SF because they deserve to be. That doesn't mean you'll like them, but I hope I've given you a clue as to whether you want to pick them up. I hope so, but make sure it's the right time.Good Reading.P.S. If you still aren't sure, try to get your hands on the very cool BBC adaptation of the Foundation Trilogy. It's rather spacey and is more like Doctor Who meets Foundation, but if you can deal with that, you're probably a fan :)"},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"You would be hardpressed to point to another of Asimov's work and name it better the Foundation."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"Over a decade ago I checked this book out of the library, only to return it later having read only a couple of pages. I bought a copy the other day and was pleasantly surprised.Asimov started writing the Foundation series when he was 21 and this novel was first published in 1951. In some ways the time period in which it was written can be seen. Nuclear power is envisioned as the be-all, end-all of energy. People smoke (although the cure for cancer was apparently found, so any carcinogenic effects would be annulled) and there's talk of \\"microfilm records.\\"That said, the story was well-written and the reader can clearly imagine the events depicted as plausible.

He placed these at oppposite ends of the galaxy, one known, one unknown. Things were going smoothly until the periodic prediction (when Seldon appears holographically) was obviously wrong.The cause is the Mule, a mutant of incredible mental powers who no one has ever seen. The introduction of this character was one of the best plot devices used in a long time and it gave the fledging story a much-needed boost. Who is this mutant and why does he do the things he does? What caused his mental powers? Can he be defeated? But most important, what is to happen now that Seldon's plans cannot be followed with accuracy?Stay tuned for book III."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"Foundation by Isaac Asimov is an excellent read for any fan of literature, not just readers of science fiction. It is the first novel in what is known by many as the greatest science fiction trilogy of all time. The story envelops the reader from cover to cover and never stops. The characters are real, with great development from the author.The story itself is about the trials gone through by a small group started by the great scientist Hari Seldon. The goal of the group is to rebuild the Empire after its inevitable fall. The characters are actiive, and the plot is always moving, never letting the reader go for a second. Asimov also uses his great knowledge of science to his advantage in the novel.

However as we know you can't predict the future and eventually things start to go wrong. A new character arrives to totally disrupt everything he has planed out for the future, The Mule.Humans are so unpredictable."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"This is truly a defining book for the genre of science fiction. The beauty of this tale is that Asimov began penning it when he was only twenty one years old. The story centers around a falling empire and the many characters throughout its history that define it. It also deals with a sort of scientific prophecy in what is termed &quot;psychohistory&quot;. This is the manner in which the future can be predicted using scientific evidence and the laws of probability. This is truly a masterpiece of the genre. A standard which all sci-fi authors should hope to attain. I would recommend this read to anyone that is a science fiction fan. Many readers are familiar with Orson Scott Card. This is the novel which prompted him to become a writer. That this novel is a cornerstone in the genre is an understatment."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"Unlike the first Foundation book, which was a series of related but not inter-connected stories, Foundation and Empire has two longer stories. This lets Asimov flesh out the stories more, adding detail and plot intricacies. The first story, The Big and The Little, is not one of the series' strongest. However, the second story, The Mule, is the masterpiece of the series. It tells of a muntant, The Mule, who falls outside the scope of Hari Seldon's psychohistory as one supremely powerful individual. The story is told in almost detective story fashion similar to the first two Robot novels. It's quite as suspenseful and involving as Asimov at his best and one of his utmost classics. There's quite a lot of plot tangling and twists, and the ending is a shocker. It's not quite a cliffhanger but will definitely make you want to read the next book, which is great also. The whole series comes highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"...P>The story was very unique.The world he creates and the society therein is fantasic and dangerous.The protagonist is a mathmatician running around just doing his thing not realizing that destiny awaits him.I really, really recommend this book and the next. By the middle of the third book I did begin to loose interest as my male testosterome began to scream for more violence and suspense.Characters are likeable and the story resolution is very satisfying. This book was great and enjoyable in and of itself even if you don't continue on with the rest of the series."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"Let's get started with one of the most celebrated science fiction sagas of all time: Foundation. originally Asimov wrote it in form of a trilogy: Foundation, foundation and empire and the second foundation, to be read in that order. Then Asimov expanded his \\"foundation universe\\" to tie it with his \\"robot universe\\" by adding 2 more novels to the series: Foundation's edge and foundation and earth. All these 5 books are a must read if you consider yourself a sci-fi fan. Besides there are 2 more books: prelude to foundation and forward to the foundation, which must be read before actual 5 novels. It's quite a complex maze. It will also help if you are familier with Asimov's robot series. But you can nevertheless read only the 5 foundation books as a standalone and still enjoy them greatly.So what is foundation (as in neo asks in matrix)? Well foundation is the fictional name of a futuristic society, which is founded by a great scientist called hari seldon. In Asimov's foundation, humanity has expanded over the galaxy, hyperspace travels have advanced and an \\"empire\\" rules over millions of planets in the galaxy. The \\"empire' has seen its best days and is living in the relic of its past glory, a.k.a. it is crumbling. However all phegmatic rulers, the rulers of the empire refuse to accept their weakness. However Hari seldon, through his scientific and mathematical eyes, predicts that empire will soon crumble and humanity will be reduced to abject barbarism for a long time.On the preset of this plot, hari seldon establishes \\"foundation\\" to save the humanity.Ok, let us not delve too much into the plot as I am not playing spoiler. Why should you read Asimov? Apart from foundation being one of the greatest sci-fi saga, you can find several refreshing ideas, which have been adopted ubiqutously by most sci-fi series later. Take star trek, star wars, dune, even the most recent matrix, everyone borrows heavily from Asimov. Asimov not only introduced scientific concepts of hyperspace travel, he also introduced the concept of \\"control\\", which is used heavily especially in matrix. throughout his foundation saga, one is left wondering \\"who is the ultimate master?\\" the answers come as you keep reading through the novel.Asimov also explains a futuristic society in its sociology, politics, power struggle and human nature. No other sci-fi writer has cared too much to explore how a society will behave in future. Asimov stands unique in that respect.I would highly recommend all 5 foundation books."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"This was probably my fourth reading of the book and what can I say? I highly recommend it.My brief review is this. The book is a lot of fun to read, has some excellent characters, and a very intriguing plot. For a little more detail continue reading.I'll start with three specific observations.FIRSTGeorge Lucas was impregnated by the Foundation prior to the birth of Star Wars.Let's check off some parallels. Decadent empire in decline? Check. Deep space religion? Check. Traders/smugglers with a wild-west attitude? Check. Central planet is entirely one city? Check.If you are a Star Wars fan and have NOT read this book these little hints alone should be reason for you to check it out.I'm not discrediting GL for his development of Star Wars, simply identifying a primary source of his inspiration.SECONDThese short stories which became this novel were originally written in the 40's. Given that the stories are written before the computer age it's really easy to forgive what technologies he didn't anticipate and appreciate the development of his futuristic world and its own technology.However, it is interesting to note that the technological innovations of the Foundation anticipate to some degree the technological phenomenon we see everywhere in that devices get smaller and smaller but more and more powerful. The main difference is that the Foundation's limited resource was metal while our real world limitations are more related to energy.THIRDThe scary point? That even in decline certain civilizations can produce their most advanced achievements. These achievements are however quickly lost as the downward impetus of that civilization is too great to escape its destiny with implosion.Yikes!I think I'll end with that. Have a nice day!"},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"I love classic sci-fi, in all it's wondrous unbelievability. I like stories where humans go to venus and find rainforests and go to mars and establish colonies and can breathe for no reason at all. It's way off science fact. but it's awesome. There's a nostalgic feeling to it that makes me feel comfortable and happy.I've never read anything by Asimov before, so i thought i'd start with his multi-part epic classic. The Foundation series takes place in the far, far distant future when humanity has spread itself across the entire galaxy. They live in a political empire, quadrillions of people on billions of planets unified for millenia under one system, advanced, strong and stable. Enter Hari Seldon, a psychohistorian (aka a mathematician who can use advanced formulas and sociology to predict the future with absolute certainty). Seldon predicts the demise of the Empire and a period of chaos, a new dark age, that will last for 30,000 years, unless he takes direct action to preserve all of human knowledge and make subtle changes to reduce those 30,000 years of disunity to a mere 1,000. I know. A 1,000 year long story. Epic. Seldon is tried for treason and disruption of the peace of the empire, but convinces the leadership of his theories and sets up the Foundation, responsible for the construction of an encyclopedia galactica to preserve all human knowledge on the rim of the galaxy, away from the turmoil about to unfold.From this introduction, Asimov proceeds to tell his story in almost like an anthology format. We see major figures and major events from each generation and how the members of the Foundation deal with crises that lead them to the forging of a new empire, conquering the darkness, chaos and barbarism that spreads across the galaxy in the wake of the fall of the first empire. There are wonderful themes explored from fate, predestination, individuality, change, and religion. This last is probably the most powerful for me. In the wake of the collapse of civilized society and it's technological wonders, the Foundation finds itself the only group of humans with advanced technology (mainly nuclear power). The other bands of humans whose tech has fallen into disrepair looks upon this advanced technology and science as magic, and the Foundation is quick to seize upon this and make a new religion out of the science, teaching \\"priests\\" how to repair and use the technology to further their own power and domination in the galaxy. An interesting concept.Asimov is a brilliant sociologist and finds interesting ways to resolve immense political and economic crises. The series is well thought out and brilliantly executed. So why four stars? Well, the scope of the story is so large that there are innumerable characters to keep track of and develop. Asimov does a fantastic job at that, but I never really identify with anyone, and just when I start liking someone, they die and we move on to the next generation. This is more of a personal quibble than anything serious. Asimov forsees a great many modern technologies from the early 50s including video conferencing, the internet, and miniaturization of a lot of the gadgets available in the 50s, a trend we see continuing today. Looking forward to the second book."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"Asimov was one of the founding fathers of Sci-fi and to him we owe a debt of gratitude for making the genre worthy of the literary title. His messages and considerations give the reader a lot more than just something to kill time. It makes sci-fi an avenue to real soul searching."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"I buy a few and the others are missing. Why? Is Prelude to Foundation an &#34;obscure&#34; book? This is absurd."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"The second book in the Foundation series and by far the strongest of the three, and my personal favorite.The book is divided into two parts giving the characters ample time to develop (compared to the first) and the story itself will grip you and never let go. It will very easily keep you on the edge wanting more and the final conclusion will leave you wide eyed. Both parts of the book, especially the second, create some incredibly strong and memorable characters that will immerse you so completely in the universe you'll not want it to end. Asimov created a master piece with the Foundation series and this second book is the staple that holds it together."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"Isaac Asimov's Foundation series portrays a tremendous sweep of future history. Published in 1951, Foundation is the first book of this series (however, Asimov would later write prequels to Foundation). Set many thousands of years into the future, this book opens with a description of psychohistory and its founder Hari Seldon. Psychohistory is a branch of mathematics which deals with the reactions of human conglomerates to fixed social and economic stimuli. Mathematician Hari Seldon predicts a series of crises which will impact the Galactic Empire. Wanting to preserve knowledge Seldon sets up a foundation staffed with scholars and scientists.As Asimov wrote Foundation he was influenced by Edward Gibbon's multi-volume work History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire. In fact, Asimov read Gibbon's book not once, but twice! It may be inferred that the emergence of Christianity during Roman times and the emergence of a new religion in Foundation are parallel events. What struck me about this book is that it is primarily composed of dialogue. I also found it interesting that Asimov has newspapers and tobacco still in existence so far into the future. I did like this book and I look forward to reading additional volumes in this epic science fiction series."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"Notetably one of the finest chapters in the Foundation series...the \\"original triology\\" is still the best."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"I read this book after coming blind to the foundation books - I've never read Asimov in a novel before. I've noted how Asimov, when writing the books, was very much a part of his time. When a character doesn't smoke, it is a character trait to point out where everyone else smokes by course. Also, sexism is taken for granted, and when a female character assumes to be treated with equal rights it is a place for comment. I had hoped that we would have found better ways to get high and allowed more equality that far into the future, but I suppose smoke 'em if you got 'em.Anyways, I like this book better than the previous one because there are characters that you can root for and unexpected jerks in the plot-line and a more linear narrative based on the fact that a lot of the exposition is out of the way from the first book. I now cannot wait for the finale of the original series and debate weather to read the other three ancillary books that Asimov wrote later."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"These are just a phenomenal set of books.

Once I picked up Asimov's &quot;Foundation&quot;, I could not put it down. To write a book of such imagination and complexity, and yet to capture the mind of the reader as it did mine, is and extraordinary feat. Asimov is a brilliant writer. I have now begun reding the fourth installement of the series, titled &quot;Foundation's Edge&quot;. He has been able to keep the same level of intensity throughout the entire series, and is still able to keep the reader guessing. Asomov is truly a mastermind.

Another one of The Greats."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"After somehow assiduously avoiding Asimov's seminal \\"masterpiece\\" for over 50 years since I began reading sci-fi, I decided to dip into this ponderous tome.Oh, forsooth, the ancient bard's Shakespearean language came alive once more, only this time, more than 12,000 years into the future.But, lo, some things have never changed: women are little more than pawns to the men who run the Galaxy -- still concerned with \\"housewife\\" duties.Distance is still measured in miles; microfiche and paper still reign supreme; the priesthood flourishes; folks still haven't learned that smoking kills.Not one to espouse elucidation, the new bard Asimov floods pages with convoluted dialog that fails to eschew obfuscation.The five barely connected stories that comprise this mess are loosely thrown together in homage to Hari Seldon, as we are seldom harried by logic.While I realize that it's easy to criticize the grand master of sci-fi after his passing, someone must raise the cry that the emperor was born with no clothes."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"The book starts with an enticing psychohistory idea, but then it dives deep into politics. It is quite interesting to read the ingenious solutions for the crises taken by the great leaders of the Foundation, specially for resigning war whenever it seemed the most sensible way out.The problem is that this book is supposed to be science fiction, yet the story seemed to have happened back in the mercantilism period in the XVII century, with its priests, kings, viceroys and merchant ships trading raw materials for manufactured goods. The gadgets used by the traders to fool the other empires are a bit silly as well, for a far future based science fiction."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"When I was in junior high school, Asimov's Foundation Trilogy was my favorite science fiction. Recently, I picked it back up, and have had to revise my opinion somewhat.First, in terms of character and plot development, Asimov certainly hadn't hit his stride when he wrote these books. The characters are cardboard cutouts--especially the female characters.More importantly, Asimov uses the basic idea behind the series...that Hari Seldon created his &quot;psychohistory plan&quot; and launched it, invisibly determining the future of his Foundations for centuries...as a kind of magic box from which he pulls plot developments. This drains the story of dramatic tension. One knows from the get-go that it'll all work out in the wash. (In the second half of &quot;Foundation and Empire&quot; and &quot;Second Foundation&quot;, Asimov had found a way out of this problem, by introducing a wild card in the deck.)Finally, the book hasn't aged well. The technology forseen for his far-future galactic civilization seems positively &quot;retro&quot;. Normally, this wouldn't be a problem...Orwell's 1984 is still an effective piece of fiction, even though it's 2002, and the world is far different from the world Orwell envisioned...but the Foundation books' other flaws just seem to make this worse."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"The Foundation novel is very dated, which I suppose is a function of the time it was written. Women are almost entirely absent except when they turn to putty over pretty pieces of jewelry. A gun is an \\"atomic blaster,\\" and other quaint 50s relics.The one dimensionality of the characters is problematic. I have to admit that although I don't read a lot of science fiction, I know priority is never put on characterization. However, since nearly all of the ideas of the book are no longer relevant, this shortcoming becomes glaring. The book is more of a time capsule than a living book.There is actually a single main character who re-occurs as 3 different personas (Seldon, Hardin, and Mallow). SeldonHardenMallow is calm, calculating, and always right. His opponents flail around until the denouement when SeldumHardenMallow has maneuvered them into exactly the right position and emerges victorious. It's so predictable that there isn't any dramatic tension.The biggest problem I had with the book is that the politics seem very nave. This novel was supposedly based on Gibbon's \\"The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire,\\" but Foundation seems to have only to most primitive understanding of that work.I don't really understand the love generated toward this book. It seems particularly flat. A lot of people seem to enjoy it -- just not me, I guess."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"Just writing this to provide moral support for anyone who reads this book and is thoroughly underwhelmed.Asimov's prose is clean but his tone seems uneven in this installment, as opposed to the tighter first book.The book is essentially two disconnected adventures... not very appealing.There's a female character in the second adventure that's quite problematic; she's dull, and Asimov spends a lot of time and effort on the fact that she's (gasp) not male.Finally, this series feels very dated, in terms of language, attitudes, and even vision of the future. \\"Nuclear\\" is the buzzword; everything's like the '50s, but nuclear-powered.I liked Foundation but Foundation & Empire tends to wander away from the idea of the Foundation as the main character, and instead can't seem to decide whether to focus on galactic-level events or protagonists. This would be excusable if the protagonists were interesting.Go read Jack Vance or Gene Wolfe if you want masterful sci-fi!"},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"I just finished reading Foundation and was extremely disappointed. Maybe I was expecting too much, something grander along the line of the Dune series. But the book in of itself is an extreme disappointment. I realize Asimov was young (21) when he wrote this, but his style leaves a lot to be desired. I'll take an early Arthur C. Clarke book over Asimov any day. This is the first book by Asimov I've read and I'm not sure I want to read another. His style is very dialogue driven with very few, if any, detail given to what the characters think. Everyone is very two-dimensional. And he never describes any of the scenes were all of this dialog takes place. Part of the interest in science-fiction is exploring new places, seeing different things. This entire story could have taken place on an empty stage. In fact, it seems like it's written more for a play than a novel. As for the story, it starts out interestingly enough. The Empire is going to crumble and to avoid thousands of years of dark-ages, a Foundation is set up to preserve the past learning's of the Empire. Well, that's what the original thought was at least. Soon we discover there's an alternate motive to this. Once we learn of this motive, the story goes straight downhill. Asimov skips decades from one page to another. Characters are introduced that we know practically nothing about, and he never tells us anything about them. I've read history books that had more character development than he gives the people in this book. By the time I got to the end I found myself saying &quot;So what&quot;? Am I supposed to continue on reading this series because it's been called a &quot;classic&quot;. I've seen the word &quot;classic&quot; thrown around a little too much sometimes. This is definitely one of those times."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"I ordered this book 2 weeks ago and it just now came today. What's worse, it's in absolutely terrible shape.

It's a work of genius! There are two sections of the book. The first is a seemingly typical war story of the conflict between the Galactic Empire, led by a strong emporer and a firebrand general, and the dumb-luck, mediocre leadership of the Foundation. It illustrates how, under the Seldon plan, it is virtually impossible to defeat the Foundation. The second part is just phenomenal. Word spreads of a mighty mutant, the Mule, who is conquering the galaxy with unprecedented mental powers. The Foundation is astonished when they don't beat him;the Mule is the .001% that the Seldon plan left room for and dismissed. The Foundation falls, and only a small group of hopefulls dare to go to the library of Trantor to find the Second Foundation and defeat the Mule. This book has it all;plot twists, philosophy, and colorful, memorable characters. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"This book has all the Asimovian trademarks: intriguing ideas marred by utterly forgettable and indeed interchangeable characters, cringe-inducing dialogue, and a plodding storytelling style and pace. Later in his career Asimov fixed these problems *somewhat*, but at this point he was very young and they are present in full force. The unfortunate truth is that this book simply doesn't deserve the praise heaped upon it; it's some kind of herd mentality that leads to so many people venerating Foundation. If you are seriously into science fiction, then by all means read the entire Foundation series: it has historical importance and there is enjoyment to be had there. But I hate to think that there are people who are introduced to science fiction by this book."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"Let's face it: Isaac Asimov was not a very good writer, especially this early in the game. We read 'Foundation' not because we are interested in reading some fantastic literature but because the ideas in this little book became the tropes that have thrived in science fiction even to this day. If you're interested in sci-fi, 'Foundation' is a must-read.The importance of 'Foundation' in the genre may force us to allow for the blandness of its prose; however, it does not excuse it. The characters are ciphers, the style is blunt and ugly, like a sledgehammer, and there are plenty of minor but annoying infelicities of grammar. It's a good thing the novel is pleasantly short; whatever Asimov's faults, long-windedness was not one of them."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"This series sets the standard for excellence. This demonstrates a master of the craft of writing. Asimov was brilliant and when he turned that intellect to writing, he created amazing works, none better than this."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"That's not saying much since I thought that \\"Foundation\\" was pretty poor.\\"Foundation and Empire\\" was pretty good, but still lacked in certainareas - mainly character development and also the first third of thebook had a very weak story line. The whole battle with the Empire bythe Foundation was very very weak, I cannot stress that enough. Maybe Iwas just hoping for an epic battle between the renegade Foundation andthe dying Empire. Nothing really happened to spur the victory of theFoundation, there wasn't even really a battle. But I guess that mightbe the point that Asimov was making since Seldon predicted the choicesand decisions of the Emperor about the passion that the characters hadfor the battle. It wasn't even a battle between the Empire, it was somemission designed and orchestrated by some general in the navy thatthought it would be a good idea to take over the Foundation.This book also lacked in strong characterizations, but not as much asthe first \\"Foundation\\" by a long shot. The last two thirds of the bookstick with the same characters the whole time. It also enters apowerful mutant, the Mule. I won't give much away about the Mule andhis plans because I don't want to spoil the book but it sets up for thesequel, \\"Second Foundation.\\" Once again the idea of the Mule is a goodidea but is somewhat poorly executed until the ened when everything isexplained about the effects the Mule has on the Foundation and thepeople in the main storyline.Get ready for \\"Second Foundation\\" because it will probably be the bestof the first trilogy. This book is worth reading and if \\"SecondFoundation\\" is better than this book then I will recommend the\\"Foundation Series\\" to anybody who can persist in their reading anddoesn't mind a long slow beginning."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"The Foundation Trilogy, one of the touchstones of Science Fiction, began as a magazine serial in John W. Campbell's Astounding Science Fiction in November 1949. Respective stories were gathered together into the three volumes: Foundation (1951), Foundation and Empire (1952) and Second Foundation (1953). Finally, the whole shebang was published as The Foundation Trilogy in 1961 and in 1966, won a Hugo Award as the best science fiction series of all time. I don't know that this last is still true, but it is certainly one of the seminal works in the history of Science Fiction and remains extraordinarily influential.Oliver Morton, in The New Yorker of May 17, 1999, had an excellent essay about the books wherein he pointed out that Asimov is really responsible for the concept, so prevalent in science fiction, of the Galactic Empire. He particularly demonstrates the debt that the Star Wars series owes to Asimov's vision, a vision which apparently in turn owes a debt to Edward Gibbon, whose Decline and Fall of The Roman Empire Asimov had read twice as a young man.He also draws one important distinction; where the main foundation of the Star Wars series is speed (iconified by the image of the accelerating starship), the Foundation series is built upon size. It is the epic scope, spanning thousands of years and worlds and incorporating billions of people, that really made Foundation so groundbreaking. It enabled Asimov to apply historical themes to a genre that, virtually by definition, lacked history.All of this is certainly true, but it strikes me that the epic scope as utilized by Asimov presents a political/philosophical problem. Asimov posited a future science of psychohistory, a discipline which would bring scientific cause and effect certainty to the field of human affairs. The Trilogy traces the fall and reemergence of a Galactic Empire with the entire process having been predicted by and, to some extent guided by, Hari Seldon, the Founder of Psychohistory. This premise manages to combine two of the worst ideas that human's have ever had--first, that history is deterministic and follows some kind of iron clad pattern; second, that there is any merit to psychology, particularly as a predictive tool when applied to large populations over a lengthy period of time.The whole thing is sort of creepy in so far as it dismisses free will and the impact of ideas and individuals on man's development. The quest for discernible patterns and laws in human existence is nothing new, most religions are predicated on the revelation of such hidden patterns. And it is natural for scientists to be attracted to the idea that there are certain universal laws that will eventually explain our behavior, everything from why we love or why we kill to why I just typed the letter r. But I for one, do not believe that our lives are predetermined. In fact, I find such an idea pretty bleak and antihuman.I still recommend the series, particularly in light of the influence it has had on the genre and for the massive scope of Asimov's vision, but, for me at least, the Freudian &amp; Hegelian overtones are a little bit off-putting.GRADE: A-"},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"Foundation was by far one of the best science fiction novels I have read. I especially loved his take on religion, and actually making a parody of it! Through the Foundation's organized religion, Asimov showed how science can possibly and really be equated with a new religion, or a set of superstitions and preternatural phenomenon. Asimov also showed how religion can sway the minds of the masses, as the subjucation of the Four Kingdoms illustrated. Asimov wrote his wonderful opus as a parallel of the Roman Empire, and the historical allusions show. However, there was something in the book that was surprisingly missing. There were no female characters! Except for the Commdora of Korell, most of the figures holding real political, social, or economic power in this society of the future, thousands of years ahead, were male. I find this hard to believe. I reasoned, though, that because Foundation was written by Asimov in the 50s, during the &quot;Golden Age&quot; of SF, female characters were a scarcity in most science fiction anyway. There were no female writers of SF either. Other than this glaring omission, Asimov has done a brilliant job with Foundation."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"I can see why Issaac Asimov is consider the king of science fiction. To be honest this is the first book I read by him. When I read this book I was flabbergassed that this book was written back in the early fifties. He was so ahead of his time!!! I was amazed of how much this book was mostly all dialouge usually I would of been bored if the book was mostly dialouge but the theories in this book can they be all real one day!! The thought of psychohistory should be a considered science of future and politics. Most of the books I read that are consider science fiction I feel is mostly influence by this man. I know there are more to this series but after I read this book I felt I needed much time to absorb of what I just read because it was such a mind opening experience."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"Asimov's Foundation Trilogy is seen as classic science fiction. Shockingly, Foundation is hardly a classic. Its theme of history repeating itself is drilled into the readers head. However, Foundation and Empire, the second book in the trilogy, continues with these themes with better fluency and character.\\"The General\\" continues with the stories of Foundation. General Bel Riose of the old empire tries to conquer the Foundation, and Asimov, once again, reassures that Hari Seldon's plan can never go wrong. With this setup of reassurance and the death of the first empire, Asimov raises the reader's hope that the Foundation will never fall.Immediately in \\"The Mule\\" Asimov rattles his audience with the fear that the Foundation, like the empire, will fall. The Mule, a mutant with psychic powers, was not seen by Seldon's Plan. The conquest of the Foundation is unstoppable. The second part of the novel allows readers to actually know the characters. They are not just people who act, but we can see their motifs. The end of the book is supposed to have many plot twist that shock the reader, but with foreshadowing, many revelations are undermined. Bayta, one of the main characters, has a deep dread every time something happens with the Mule. This gives away the identity of the Mule.Foundation and Empire is a great read through its despair and hopelessness. It left me on the edge of my seat scrambling for the next book."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"How can this be considered a classic? It's fun, it's entertaining, but it lacks so much qualities all classics have!The Mule was a disappointment. I knew from the beggining who he was. I found myself skimming sections of this novel because I got bored with it. When I got to page 50 I was ready to give up on the novel and put it down, but I thought this book has to be good it's consider a classsic! So I decided to read the whole novel. A classic novel is suppose to convey a message to the reader about life, the words and writing style is suppose to be superior to the average writer, and the story should stand out as one of the more creative stories. This novels main lesson about mankind is not a unique one : The idea of history being preditced by math ,science, and psychology. People will never change, civilization will always end up destroying itself. Nothing is for certain even if science says so. I have heard this all before he did not invent this idea I want to hear somthing new and original. The great writers have superior writing skills. Askimov writing skills are just average. I expect to see in a classic novel a lot of symbolism, carefully crafted prose, well thought out sentences, better play on words, and better dialog! The dialog spoken by the characters is 3rd gradish and dull. Finally the author lacks the creativity the classic writers have. I expect to see a detailed lay out of how each creation works. I like an author who invents hi-tech gizmos and then educates the reader with all the scientific details of how it works. I like to learn a little physics when I read a science fiction book. --Main point: I liked the robotic novels better. Askimov went into details of how the robots worked. His robot books were good,not classics, but much better I thought."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"...The first book (excluding PRELUDE TO FOUNDATION) in a five-book series introduces the idea of pyschohistory. Pyschohistory is simply the mathematics and variables in predicting the general future since it cannot predict an individual's.

Hari Seldon must rely on the future (Salvor Hardin and Hober Mallow) to provide each step in shortening the amount of years. FOUNDATION covers the first 100 years of this chaotic period following the life of Salvor Hardin and Hober Mallow, the key players in the book. Though somewhat lacking action and fast-pace suspense, it's a very good book nonetheless. Asimov is able to find clever ways to conquer each &quot;Seldon crises&quot; so ingeniously that it makes up for the lack of action. Infact, Asimov writes with a &quot;cause and effect&quot; basis. The book also ends in a way leaving the reader somewhat satisfied yet will want to read the rest of the series.I recommend this book to sci-fi fans or anyone looking for a great read, but the lack of action can bore some.

I hunted down the hardback version because I know that this is one series I will want to re-read."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"previous reviewers hit on the my main gripes. no character development or insights. predictable plot development. no women at all. i understand it was written as a series of shorts, but it is really just a political drama played out in space. it could just as easily been set on earth in any era. some interesting moments, but far from gripping.i much preferred early heinlein, clarke, and later ellison, pangborn, farmer, pohl, cordwainer smith, et al.dont think i'll bother with the rest of the series."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"I respect Asimov as a writer of science fiction. However after reading all of the Foundation series I wish it had more humanity in it. The book was overly complex. The characters did nothing for me. The Foundation series is over rated in my humble opinion. It falls in the category that I call dry sci-fi. Asimov's Robot series was better than this."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"Three stars is a bit generous, but this certainly isn't a bad book. In fact, it is easy to read, always interesting, and often exciting. But that's all it is. It is not deep or meaingful. It is not profoud. It is not thought provoking. It isn't even particularly well written. But it's so easy to take and has enough good qualities that it can't be disliked.The plot center's around the creation of a Foundation, a place where mankind's accumulated knowledge can be protected from the approaching collapse of civilization. This is an interesting enough premise and very original in its day, but the blending of mathematics and psychology into a science that can accurately predict much of the future is hard to take seriously.If you come across a copy of this book, read it. It won't take long and you'll probably enjoy much of it even if your not a SF fan, but I don't recommend anyone by this book. There is to much out there that is much much better."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"The book, Foundation, by Isaac Asimov, has promise but leaves the reader without satisfaction upon completion. Though having what initially appears to be a gripping plot, the grip loosens throughout the book. While philosophers may enjoy the lack of action and adventure, other readers who crave that amazingly described action sequence, will find that this is not the book to get. Taking place beyond the year 12,000 A.D, the Galactic Empire, spanning galaxies, is predicted by the revered physcohistorian, Hari Seldon, to crumble. On a mission to shorten a period of 30,000 years of barbarism after the fall of the Galactic Empire, to a mere millennium, he establishes an association, the Foundation, to preserve the Universe's knowledge in a giant Encyclopedia. Foundation takes place on many different planets in many galaxies across the universe. This book spans many generations and involves many characters, as the book covers in different plot lines that converge at the end.Foundation is a book that focuses on political issues, thus making the book void of action and adventure. This can make the book extremely boring and aggravating to some readers. The story focuses on conflicts among activist parties and groups conspiring against the political leaders of the Foundation's home world, Terminus, as well as diplomatic and religious conflicts between the Foundation's home planet, Terminus, and neighboring kingdoms such as Anacreon and Smyrno, along with greedy kingdoms bent on conquest of their neighbors. But out of the 285 pages of the book, there is only one significant action sequence, which is between the kingdom of Anacreon and the Foundation. The sequence involves a mass riot and uprising of priests on Anacreon's home world, along with the total emancipation of the Anacreonian naval fleet by a priest who threatens to curse the fleet. When characters, like the mayor of Terminus and his advisors, discuss war or the inevitability of a war, there never is an explanation of what occurs during the fighting, just a summary of the war, and who is the victor. An example is at the end of the book, when there is a war between the Foundation and the world of Korell, because of disagreements over religious beliefs and the tolerance of missionaries. The war is only summed up in an excerpt from the &quot;Encyclopedia Galactica&quot;. Another noticeable point about Foundation is how confusing it is in many aspects. The book is broken up into &quot;Parts&quot; that separate time, setting, and characters. A part entitled &quot;The Mayors,&quot; which takes place mainly on Terminus and involves the mayor, Salvor Hardin, and the relations between his world and the kingdom of Anacreon, is then followed by one entitled &quot;The Traders,&quot; which takes place many decades later and involves totally different characters in a different part of the galaxy. When and where each part takes place is not answered until later into the chapters of the part. Also confusing is the fact that new characters are introduced quickly in every part, thus making it harder for the reader to grasp. If the reader gets attached to a character or really likes where the plot and characters are going in a certain part, he or she will be unpleasantly surprised when those characters are never talked about again in the novel, after that part.One good thing about Foundation is that it expresses new and intriguing ideas about predicting the future through the science of psychohistory and what the human race and universe will be like in ten more millennia. This includes the idea of having a Galactic Empire that controls millions of planets. Along with ideas of nuclear power still being the most advanced power system, man-sized force fields able to block any nuclear handgun's blast and giant space ships with the capability to destroy planets are discussed. Also the ideas of monarchy being the prime governmental system is included in the novel. These may seem like interesting ideas that would make Foundation a great book, but the reader may find that these ideas also make the story harder to understand because they are either seemingly too primitive for the time period, or too far-fetched to be logical. This book could be someone's favorite book, if they happen to like philosophical books without action. It could also be the bore of a lifetime for some people."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"A decent series, but none of the books really stood out for me. The first, as is usually the case, was the best. A very fascination premise."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"Foundation, and all the other books that complete the extense colection are wonderful. I remember when i read this book 8 years ago, and as you see i still love it. If you don't want to read all the books of the series, you don't have to do it, the saga of foundation it's only three books (foundation, foundation and Empire, and Second Foundation), but if you want to read a good, good, GOOD,GOOOOOOOOOOD series of books, read them all, you won't regret it. I really loved all this books."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"When I first read The Foundation book, I was pretty dissappointed and I didn't finish it.

Asimov is a fabulous writer, no doubt."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"Yes, it's got some truly lovely ideas. But, no, I didn't especially enjoy reading it. Gripping storyline, anyone? Not here..."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"After reading Prelude (which I thoroughly enjoyed), I began FOUNDATION with much anticipation. Unfortunately, the book did not meet my expectations. First, it was really boring and predictable. Second, you never stay with a scenario long enough for any character development. As soon as the reader gets to know one of the characters, Asimov rushes ahead 50 years and a new cast of characters enters. My final complaint about FOUNDATION is that most of the characters are presented as simple minded. I might read the rest of the books in this series only because I have been told they get better. However, FOUNDATION is just an average read."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"I admit it, I am an Asimov-phile. This is yet another book by Asimov that is very hard to put down. I rate this, and all of Asimovs books with the highest regard. Quite simply buy it now, or you are a fool. ;-)"},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"A nod to the greatness of this book, on a recent episode of Deep Space Nine, a group of genetically altered humans got together and used mathematical formulas to predict the outcome of the Dominion War.

The movement in time for each section is very effective and interesting in moving the story. I found that at each part, the radical, the person immediately disliked, turns out to be the savior of the Foundation during that crisis. I've been exposed to a lot of Science Fiction and while reading this book, I saw pieces of almost all of them in here. The Galactic Empire of StarWars originated here, the personal shields and the control of the spice guilds from Dune, to name a few. I must say, in my humble opinion, Foundation deserves the high placing as one of Science Fiction's greatest works."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"This book, the first in a series, is all about the origination of the Foundation, an orginization based on the idea to shorten the period of decay of the galactic Empire. Everyone who likes Prelude to Foundation MUST read this."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"I certainly do not sound quite as intellectual as other people who have reviewed this novel. All I have to say is that I found this book extremely interesting and thrilling. When my teacher recommended this book to me, I was skeptical, however, Foundation turned out to be one of the best books I ever read and I can't wait to read the other ones. Psychohistory and Hari Seldon rock! Whoever doesn't read this book is missing out on one of the best ever."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"(If Amazon allowed fractional reviews, I would have given 3.5) While I enjoyed &quot;Foundation&quot; and found some of the concepts intriguing, it seems that Asimov had a lot of maturing to do as a writer at this point. The characters don't seem to really reach me the way they should, but one has to bear in mind that this book is actually a collection of shorter stories published in serial format, and the writer could not be bothered too much with deep character development. I still reccomend this book, in part because it leads into the rest of the series, which tends to improve stylistically as the books advance. However overrated &quot;Foundation&quot; may be, it firmly holds ground simply because it is so integral to the foundation trilogy and subsequent additions."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"Asimov takes the reader on a journey that is thought provoking and entertaining. It's probably his best work of all the foundation series.&quot; Foundation and Empire&quot; is one of those books that you simply can not put down."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"I have just read all the volumes in the &quot;Foundation&quot; series. Because the basic ideas of society and its control (&quot;psychohistory,&quot; &quot;Foundation, &quot;Gaia&quot;) are cleverly and skillfully constructed, I could grasp these highly abstract ideas much easyly. Forever Asimov's Galactic genious! Of course this series planned as an entertainment, it can be recommended to the academician, who has his/her major in social science or its related area."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"This book does not need action to be great. Mr. Asimov was a profound writer. I do NOT mean swears or grownup matters. His words go beyound the sci-fi plot. This is why I give it five stars. This book may be hard to follow. This is because Mr. Asimov wrote it in sections for a magizine. Just be patient an you will lovvvve it."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"Before &quot;Foundation&quot; i'd read somes short-storys from Asimov, so i become insterested in his style. And what can i say now about this book? Really is a excelent piece of scifiction: Asimov united 4 independent stories in a book with lifely descriptions, a strong main-story and credibles characters in incredibles situations,...the result is just epic. So, with this book we become in eyewitness on the monumental development and fall of the human civilization... becoming it in a surrounding journey trought our future and past."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"This book is the best book I have ever read. Issac Asimov shows off his expertise in what is probably the best series ever. Hari Seldon is a psychohistorian and can predict the future. He sees the impending collapse of the Empire and establishes two Foundations to prevent that."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"Foundation details the fall of the Galatic Empire and rise of an island in the midst of desolation - the Foundation. Not full of starship battles, but I have never seen a more clever story in its use of thought. The three Seldon crisises and the solutions have an intellectual beauty to them in that 1) the crisises are believable and 2) the solutions are also believeable and in retrospect obvious. I have noticed this about other Asimov books, espically &quot;The Stars, like Dust,&quot; and it is my favorite part of his style. Very higly recommended."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"This book is a highly cereberal study of history. I you want a lot of action look somewhere else. (I suggest David Drake or S.M. Sterling) If you want something to ponder this is the book. Asimov's ideas have been borrowed by other works so some of it will not seem new. The science is somewhat dated (nucleur light bulbs and economical transmutation). This book does give an excellent veiw of the forces of history. If you want to understand what causes nations to fall read this book. Just don't expect Star Wars style entertaiment."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"Foundation is a good book, but is only a must read because the 2 books, Foundation's Edge and Foundation and Earth, are must-reads. It's a shame that few lists of his books include Foundation and Earth, but if you like science fiction, that is the best novel ever."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"this is the first book i read by asimov. of the 7 books in the &quot;trilogy&quot;, i found it the most gripping. (this is where i start to digress and spell words wrong) i am happy that i read it before the books that he wrote after but take place before the action in this one. i believe that the first two books ruin some of the suspense in later novels. ah, the book... my first venture into sci-fi, and i am so greatful that i took it. although it is in the future, i never got the impression that it was unrealistic. well, i hope i helped. live well and for yourself."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"Unlike a lot of other sci-fi books, Asimov has the ability to include not only the sense of futuristic complications and inventions, he has the unrivaled ability to also include a dramatic and intense showing of personal interactions, which is what makes him such a master.Its more than an idea, Asimov makes it a story. Great book and possibly the best of the three foundation novels."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"Get this book! One thing that may help is that the farsighted hero, Hari Seldon, sets up a plan that supposedly needs no individuals to make it work, forces of humanity and all that, but the stories repeatedly show the importance of individuals. If you know this ahead of time, you will appreciate each story even more."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"Asimov, remember, wrote this initially as a series of short stories for a sci-fi magazine. Only later were the stories combined as a book. That is why of course no great character development occurs and the stories seem tidbits rather than grand scale work. Granted there is not much science in the book, but I have always felt that sci-fi is a form of fiction to allow the author to write freely on a subject and be able to mask what he is really talking about. Think about it, change the story to another world and have strange names for planets and suddenly nobody sees it as an attack against their country or their people. I have also felt science fiction to be more political than science (even though we call it science fiction). Politics are immense in Foundation and the style of having conversations to tell the story vs. having lots of action and space battles is fantastic. I read this first when I was 18 and did not appreciate what Asimov is trying to do. At 39, I get it. Asimov is looking at society in general and commenting that no society can be perfect and ideal and all wonderful and that dirty tricks and greed and compromise and working with others (including our enemies) is the only way a society can survive and the rest is simply propaganda. It's a direct attack against all societies that foster the idea that we're the best and the greatest and we stand for freedoms and love of country. Instead he states that what all societies become are survivors finding their strengths to counteract the enemies weaknesses. It's a great reality check which is why this should be required reading for all political science majors."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"Asimov participated in American science fiction's golden age, helping to convert pulp fantasy stories into realistic predictions of the future based on current science. It isremarkable that he wrote the Foundation while a young man, barely 20 I believe, a work with grand themes and the cornerstone of his massive and sprawling future history of mankind, which I believe went into more than 50 volumes. The basic plot is that a scientists created a new discipline, psycho-statistics I believe, that could predict the future behavior of huge masses of humans. He then attempts tomold - or at least influence - man's fate over the next 30,000 years. What is truly amazing is that Asimov succeeds in this and the two following volumes. In a way, he should have stopped here with the series. The ideas are crisp and not yoked into a determined framework, so are fresh with lively characters. Later novels in the series - the overwhelming majority - feel more stilted, bound by concepts more than by a plain old good story.A sci fi classic."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"I liked Star Wars. But for those of us who knew and loved the Foundation trilogy as one of the greatest masterpieces in all of science fictiondom, it was galling to hear the misplaced accolades heaped on the movie lauding its originality.Asimov's seminal universe was created decades before Lucas's derivative one, and Lucas shamelessly lifted whole passages of ideas, themes and settings from Asimov. The idea of a galactic empire; the conflict between an established empire and a fledgling but vital upstart; a world-girdling city at the heart of galactic government; a noble elite with incredible mental powers; a mysterious antagonist possessing the same mental powers but directed towards dark conquest; even the robots are there (albeit from a different Asimov source).I mention these things not to disparage Star Wars but to elevate Asimov. Today, it is too easy to forget just how original and inspiring the Foundation trilogy was when it first appeared in print. In the intervening decades, lesser imitators have copied, twisted and diluted the original story so often that its brilliance has been buried under mountains of mediocre muck.This trilogy has so much going for it that it is hard to know where to begin. For one thing, it is tautly written. Asimov would tend towards bombast later in life, but not here. For another, it sustains bold visions and landscapes of truly cosmic proportions. It also strikes the right note in setting the lives of a group of protagonists against a backdrop of immense historical forces. In so doing, it attains the weight of epic.Mostly, it astounds us with the sheer power of its imagination. I have already alluded to its many firsts, but it is what Asimov does with these firsts - the subtle way he folds them into the very substance of his story - that distinguishes this work. Take the theme of psychohistory. Asimov coined this term for his premise that all of human behaviour is reducible to a complex set of mathematical equations. He translates this abstraction into a storyline that is so compelling that we never think to question the outlandishness of his premise.This is science fiction at its finest: the marriage of science with fiction, all done with such consummate skill - the one merging so seamlessly into the other - that we are never aware of where the one ends and the other begins. Do not pass up the opportunity to read this trilogy. In the science fiction universe, it is the work of a grand master at the height of his calling."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"This book is a well written science fiction classic. While not a major action-adventure story like many science fiction novel really makes you think about the plot, the characters, and all of humanity.It is truly one of the best scienc fiction books I have ever read and encouraged me to read the whole, equally enthralling, series."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"Foundation is the first book of Isaac Asimov's aptly named Foundation Trilogy. Foundation presents the premise that when examining large enough populations of people it becomes possible to predict their behavior stochastically (and sociologists become statisticians). The great psychologist of the day, Dr. Seldon, finds from his statistical data that there is going to be a great social collapse; and he creates two colonies (or foundations) that are designed to shorten the period of chaos the universe will experience before a renaissance occurs. Without giving too much away, this novel is the story of the early years of one Foundation and its' experiences with the universe around them. This book makes one wonder just how much people act of their own volition and exactly to what extent we are all the same. Is it possible to predict the behavior simply by examining a large group? Another interesting sub-theme with this book that I found extremely interesting is that eventually there won't be any original thoughts; the example given is of archeology; the archeologists of Seldon's age assumed that there was no point in examining ruins; they simply read books written by the archeologists of earlier generations; it was assumed that there was nothing else to find. As people explore, explain, create, and discover more and more of the universe, will there eventually come a time that there is nothing else to find?"},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"The books in Asimov's universe are by far the best scifi to date. I enjoyed the Foundation and Robot books so much I collected all 45 books that are set in the Foundation universe, written by Asimov and other authors. While not all authors live up to Asimov, their contribution allows his loyal fans a chance to slip back into the universe he created. If anyone is interested in Scifi books, the Foudnation series is a wonderful place to start."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"Folks, till foundation happened to me, I had for some inexplicable reasons never got introduced to world of science fiction (SF).(unless you call hitchhikers guide to galaxy as one) Based on influence of the die hard coterie of Asimov's fans, I decided to start my journey with Foundation...........and I have really found it cool stuff............worth reading and excellent investment of time..........since it rejuvenates you with fascinating ideas and terrific narrative. Looking forward to picking up the next one."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"I would recommend this series to anyone. Asimov is a great writer, who's very prolific (He's written over 400 books! ) This is the start of his Foundation series which is a well-developed series detailing the fall of a Galactic Empire and one man's attempt to shorten the dark ages that are to come after the fall. For those of you who like hard sci-fi this is the series for you."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"Isaac Asimov's \\"Foundation\\" was not conceived as the beginning of series of novels. It was not conceived as a novel. It was not even conceived entirely by Isaac Asimov.Beginning in the late 1930s and for decades thereafter, the editor of the most prestigious and far more important, the best-paying monthly publication in science fiction was John W. Campbell of Astounding Science Fiction (now known as Analog.)Before taking over the editorship of the magazine, Campbell had been a popular hack writer of unabashed, wild-eyed space opera. A typical Campbell plot involved a couple of young American go-getters who whomp up a superduper space cruiser in their garage, set out on a test flight around Saturn, find themselves hurled into another dimension by a short circuit, and stumble on a planet inhabited by humans who are at war with some interplanetary Nasties who display unusually bad table manners. They forge an alliance with the good humans against the bad Nasties which, a few hundred pages later, inevitably leads to the utter annihilation of the world of the Nasties, not to mention the Nasties themselves and every vestige of their million year-old civilization and culture. By the literary standards of pulp magazine science fiction in 1936, this was pretty sophisticated stuff.When Campbell took over the reins of the magazine in 1938, he raised his sights. In short order he dumped the old stable of writers whose collective knowledge of science could have been stuffed into a peanut shell with room to spare and began cultivating new ones. A. E. van Vogt specialized in social science mumbo-jumbo that actually sounded like it meant something. L. Sprague deCamp had a sense of humor. Robert Heinlein possessed a literary spark that might be carefully fanned into a flame. And Isaac Asimov was a college kid from Brooklyn who wrote stories to stretch out the limited income generated by his father's candy store.All these and many others were overawed by the wondrous fact that the godlike JWC deigned to accept their humble stories--after he mercilessly picked apart their flaws and demanded re-writes, pronto!Those were the heroic days of magazine publishing. Editors in general and Campbell in particular did not wait for undisciplined and slothful writers to hatch ideas. No, JWC would call in his disciples and hand out plot lines and devices to be made into short stories, novelets and serialized novels. To van Vogt he tossed the idea of a totalitarian society whose tyranny was leavened by weapons shops that sold guns which could only be used in self defense. From deCamp, citing Mark Twain's \\"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court,\\" he demanded to know what would happen if a contemporary American were hurled back from Mussolini's Italy to post-imperial Rome. Of Heinlein he demanded a series of stories that would collectively outline the history of the next few hundred years. For Asimov he reserved a far larger patch of history. What, he queried, would happen when a galaxy-spanning empire finally decayed and began to fall?Asimov pondered. Then, in his own words, \\"With a little bit of cribbin' / From the works of Edward Gibbon / And that Greek Thucydides,\\" Asimov took the Roman Empire of the Fifth Century and cast it into the stars as the expiring Empire of Trantor. From Eighteenth Century France he took the Encyclopedists and renamed them the Foundation. Finally he spiced up his literary gumbo with blather about \\"psychohistory,\\" a mathematically-based fortune telling system which yielded valid results when the human population achieved the vast numbers only attainable in a galaxy-spanning civilization.Campbell bought the first story. The fans--at the time, a demographic aged 12-25 and virtually all-male--loved it. Campbell ordered more stories. The Trantorian Empire fell, but slowly and reluctantly. The fans loved it. The Empire blazed up under the last great imperial general, Bel Riose. (Gibbon's Belisarius, get it?) The fans loved it. A Napoleon-like conqueror appeared to muddy up the predictions of the psychohistorians. The fans loved it. Darkness and barbarism followed the collapse of civilization across the Milky Way. And the fans loved it. On and on it went, to book, to trilogy, beyond--even to new books written by other hands long after the passing of Campbell and Asimov.The fans still love it."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"Foundation is not a novel, but a series of stories which had been published separately. The entire trilogy was written in nine stories which were completed in the period between 1941 and 1951. Asimov notes himself in the foreword that part of what he intended with the fourth book _Foundation's Edge_ was to have a chance to write an actual Foundation novel.I actually like the effect that the story-based approach gives, particularly considering that Foundation is meant to be covering the fall of galactic empire and the rise of a new power. Having chapters based on discrete periods, I think the reader gets a better sense of the sheer time involved in politics than any 9000 -page space opera could ever achieve.One of the things I like about Foundation and its subsequent other parts is that it isn't an action-packed adventure. There isn't high romance. It isn't really about individual heartache and success, although the role of the individual is important. It's a meditative look at both politics and the future, and a darned sharp one at that.An excellent read, even worth the time for people who don't think that they like science fiction."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"Personally, I don't like &quot;classic&quot; sci-fi. It can be preachy, dated, dry, corny or just not as &quot;mature&quot; as modern science fiction. However, Asimov gives just enough characterization, not too much science and the right amount of action adventure and conceptual gems to keep your mind racing. He truly is the grand daddy of science fiction.Quirky lines like &quot;Galaxy knows!&quot; or &quot;By Seldon!&quot; evoke nostalgia for the time of space rangers and laser guns. So what if nuclear power is a thing of the past? Asimov doesn't beat you down with tecnobabble. You just know that thats the prime power source in his idea of the future. Remember, this was written in 1941. Furthermore, the writing style and dialogue don't seem dated at all. Asimov's writing is simple, clean, and doesn't get bogged down with excess ramblings. His true talent is in plotting unexpected twists and turns that make this book a pageturner.Hari Seldon created psychohistory. It is mathematics applied to the development of human society on a grand scale. Seldon's new science predicts the path of human civilization with no regard to individual actions. Religion has given us fate vs. free will. Asimov poses a perhaps even more frustrating question, what if science tells us that one man's will cannot change the path of history?You're not going to get soliquoys droning on and on about a lost love or a crumbled courage; But what you do get is a brilliant collection of short stories Asimov wrote separately that later were compiled as one novel.The four(?) stories are brief yet cohesive glimpses into the developing stages of the Foundation's rise amidst the decay of the Imperial Empire. Each character driven event propels the Foundation through its first stages of development: political autonomy, technology protected by religion, and economy. I think Asimov did a great job in breathing life into these characters. After I finished the book, I remembered Hari Seldon's mystic wisdom, Salvor Hardin's determination and Hober Mallow's money hungry practicality and what remains is an overwhelming sense of awe and satisfaction. You will get that too."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"The Foundation trilogy is really a rebinding of stories published serially in Astounding Magazine, so each part really stands on its own, making only passing references to previous stories and explaining anything necessary to the current plot.Asimov's writing is rather dialog-heavy, and evolves slowly enough that I couldn't get past the first book when I read it the first time (in high school). Coming back to it years later, I've really enjoyed these three volumes, and am looking forward to reading the extension novels by Greg Bear and David Brin, two of my favorite authors (and the reason I picked up Foundation again). It's not as slow as Lord of the Rings (also worthwhile for those with patience).The story is very interesting, and lets you into the psyche of the characters only through their words and actions, so your understanding of them builds slowly through your reading.I definitely recommend Foundation. I also read Bujold's &quot;Warrior's Apprentice&quot; recently, which I find to be similar in style, and I recommend that as well."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"This is the second volume published of Asimov's classic Foundation series (originally published as two novellas in 1945). Part I is titled &quot;The General.&quot; A military leader in the Old Empire sees the Foundation as a threat (about forty years after the end of the events described in &quot;Foundation&quot;). He gets permission from the emperor to wage a campaign. The Foundation must find a way to stop him. Fortunately, the mathematics of Hari Seldon has already considered a course of action. In Part II, called &quot;The Mule,&quot; a mutant with unparalleled power (power never considered in Hari Seldon's psychohistory; he can control the emotions and commitments of others) fights and defeats the Foundation about 300 years after the start of the novel &quot;Foundation.&quot; But, now the Mule has to go in search of the Second Foundation which is made up of psychologists and psychohistorians (the First Foundation had been set up primarily with physical scientists). When &quot;The Mule&quot; appeared in magazine format in 1945, it wowed the readership. With these stories, the series really began developing a following. I am in my 50s and have read the books a couple of times. But, my father has read them ten times!"},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"Asimov's classic series has a quaint, nave simplicity about it that never fails to entrance this reader. For all its episodic construction (unavoidable, considering the unparalleled scope) and its rather flat, exclusively male characters, the Foundation Trilogy takes readers back to a time when America was making the world safe for democracy, personal freedoms were a given, and science seemed to be the salvation of a fallible humanity.The first volume, Foundation, sets up the whole idea of the Seldon Plan, a mathematically based view of sociopolitical forces that enables one brilliant scientist to mold a new galactic empire from a foundation of one hundred thousand scientists and their families. After the introduction, whose final paragraphs subtly lay out the whole structure without our knowing it, we get to see the Plan in action as the Foundation faces a series of political and military crises. Because the scientist/hero is long dead before the second chapter, the heroes are the political and economic, rather than scientific, leaders who must resist the temptation to take direct military action, and instead allow events to proceed until Seldon's Plan points out the answer. The magic of this book is the exquisite means the Foundation uses to defeat its enemies without resorting to force, and the convincing arguments Asimov uses to make these solutions seem inevitable. As such, each chapter is like a sociopolitical puzzle that challenges the reader to find the move that will defuse each situation, and taken together these stories comprise a virtual primer in diplomacy.Countless millions of fans have enjoyed Asimov's Foundation Trilogy, consisting of Foundation, Foundation and Empire, and Second Foundation. Other Foundation novels, written by the master in his later years, lack the simple charm that makes these earlier works so popular. They were tacked on solely because the power of those first three created a demand that Asimov felt obligated to try to fill, but they have an entirely different feel, and don't possess that single-minded surety of artistic vision that marked the original series.This book is about political maneuvering, not action, so it may not be a favorite of action/adventure fans, although the next book in the series, Foundation and Empire, is a little more dynamic, and reading the complete Trilogy is a must, since the first two volumes don't so much end as just leave off. Still, the vast historical vision begun in this book is so sweeping, it should not be missed by any fans of speculative fiction."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"Many consider Foundation a Sci-Fi classic, while others concider it a poorly written, boring piece of something I really shouldn't mention by name.I personally fall within the first category, I liked this book a lot. But although I myself loved this novel and its sequels, I do can imagine why other people simply hated it.Those who don't like it usally refer to the fact that there is virtually no character development, no action of any kind whatsoever, and that the technology used seems outright \\"retro\\" (nuclear trashcans and the like).All of this critism is undoutably true. Since this book is actually a collection of a series of short stories, and all of those are about different eras in the history of the Foundation, Asimov has to replace most of his characters every 50 to 100 pages which leaves room nor reason for descent characters.And since the story focusses promary on events in the future \\"history\\" of mankind and the reasons they take place, most of what happens is people talking to other people, with only small references to battles, wars, and sofort.Finally, lest not forget that these stories were written when the last century was only halfway over. Nuclear trashcans, atomic guns, and typwriter-isch computers were perfectly plausable back then.The point I am trying to make with this review is that this book is about a subject that simply isn't everybody's cup of tea. Foundation is nowhere near as accessible as Sci-Fi series such as Star Wars, Star Trek, or Babylon 5 (all good series in their own right). Or even like the more famous classic Sci-Fi novels such as \\"2001: a Space Oddessy\\", \\"1984\\", or \\"Dune\\".If you like juggling with logic and stories of people trying to make sense of their situations, then you're probably going to liove it.However, if you're more into character development, scientific discovery, or action, I wouldn'd recommend reading this novel. You'll probaly just get bored to tears."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"Foundation is a landmark in science fiction, and epitomizes the best of what Isaac Asimov stood for. This book proves that you don't have to have a lot of sex and mindless violence (\\"-the last refuge of the incompetent\\") to make a book suspenseful and a page-turner. The book is entirely without action and romance in the normal sense, and consists almost entirely of dialogue. What makes it so interesting is the ideas (and reversals of ideas) that it presents, in all their aspects, subsequently debates, and solves. It has an aura of almost detective story fascination with regards to political ideas. What is interesting is that the book takes a pacifistic approach to politics, and thereby forces itself to present a plausible solution to occurring problems (say, rebellion, anarchy, and war) without degrading into violence. Each self-contained story (the book is not a novel, but a collection of stories that were originally published stand-alone) is therefore a sort of logic puzzle (much the same, in principle, as Isaac's Robot stories) that you must delve into and accede all its ramifications, and come out with an answer that will work, without using violence. It's a credit to Asimov that he could not only achieve this, but make it interesting, and, indeed, arresting. This is an essential science fiction read, and perhaps Asimov's apex."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"I had read a great deal of Arthur C. Clarke, Peter F. Hamilton and H.G. Wells before finally coming upon Issac Asimov.I really hadn't heard of him until a friend of mine recommended him to me. I was looking for a new author to read after coming off 4,000+ pages of Peter F. Hamilton, and decided to try something different.In the beginning, I was a little worried that since the books were written in the early 50s that they would be technologically dated and not have the technological appeal that newer scifi books had.I was TOTALLY wrong. The concepts that Asimov illustrates in his writting are still used today, and were probably their original origin.Asimov's writing style does take a little getting used to, however, but in the end, I appreicated it more than hated it. It's so different that it seems to give the characters an entirely different feel. With long, descriptive, deep dialoge and a very schemish design, you don't really fully understand the ENTIRE story until the end, when it finally clicks in one of the character's heads what is really going on, after meeting the supposed opponent and hearing his side of things.I think, in the end, the best part is how you can really see the evolution of the Foundation right before your eyes, and see how things happen and how some little thing that happened a hundred years ago set off some other thing that was HUGE in the present in the story.If you do not read Asimov's Foundation series, you cannot call yourself a scifi buff, remember that, always. Now GO and read!"},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"I first read this book maybe 20 years ago, when I was more accustomed to 'action' sci-fi replete with ray guns and space ships and trying to guess how such technology shaped society (a la Larry Niven, to name one). This book is more like an historical novel, or a future history, like reading Gibbons or Kennedy. What is particularly astounding about this work, which he first published in 1951 at age 31, is Asimov's ability to scale- from the drama of a handful of individuals to the seminal events of the last decades of the ancient, galaxy-wide empire (which does not even remember its Earthly origin!). Unlike Heinlein's _Citizen of the Galaxy_ or _Friday_ (or many others) we do not follow the story of a single person or family in the backdrop of a civilization, but rather, the original Foundation trilogy makes both the individuals as well as the whole history of the galactic empire come alive in an extremely concise work. Here, the context is just as important as the characters, a scaling rarely seen elsewhere. This is the book's greatest strength- which becomes one of its weaknesses: To be sure, and Asimov himself admitted as much about sci-fi in general, the characterizations are not terribly deep. Much time, he has written elsewhere, is required to build the context of the worlds that sci-fi writers create, with little time left to build characters to any depth. But we are watching the fall of worlds, so the relatively shallow characters may be overlooked.A must read among the classics of sci-fi."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"Ultimately, the hardest decision about the Foundation books is to decide how to read them. Maybe I'm being ridiculous, but I think you will enjoy them more if you read them in the order they were written. If so, this is the second book. If you have not yet read Foundation, then you need to go back and do so before tackling this one.Your other choice is to read the prequels first, then go onto Foundation. In that case, this is the fourth book you should read.Whichever choice you make, don't read this book first.On the surface, Foundation and Empire will seem like an uninspired playing out of Hari Seldon's vision for the future. Ah! But there's much more happening, so pay attention. When you get to the end of the book, you may find you have missed the mainstream and will have to go back. Don't worry, almost everyone has that reaction.Asimov is a brilliant conceptual writer, but not someone who slaved over every word (in fact, he was famous for writing most of his many books in only 1 or 2 drafts, with little editing after that). This book begins to develop the full Foundation concept in all of its stunning beauty.In many ways, you will be reading this book from the eyes of the first Foundation. But that's the unimportant one. The real action is with the second Foundation. Be sure to keep that in mind.When you meet the Mule, don't think of him as an aberration but rather as an extension of today's potential. That will make the book more interesting for you.Many people find this book to be the least interesting one of the Foundation series. Let me warn you that reading this one will greatly increase your pleasure in the following books beginning with the Second Foundation (which is your next pleasant reading assignment).Enjoy this irresistible series!"},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"I found the politics of this novel interesting enough to disregard the dated scientific references. Seldon and his science was fascinating to behold, and the plot was masterful. What concerned me was (dare I say it?) the fairly amateurish use of dialogue tags and the fact that each character seemed pretty much to speak with the same voice. Asimov wrote this as one of those authors who are at pains not to repeat 'he said'. So it must be a new tag each time, no matter how ridiculous, often paired with an adverb that makes you cringe: ('spluttered angrily', 'cried sternly', 'mumbled grumpily', so on.) Sad this very basic trick of writing lets down passages of vivid description and intriguing plot.Also, some things seemed implausible to me, such as: how was the foundation, which exported its technology across the galaxy, able to keep its technology secret?Nonetheless, this is a series every sci-fi fan has to read - its attributes outweigh its faults by a fair margin."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"\\"Foundation and Empire,\\" the second novel in Isaac Asimov's landmark science fiction series, is a definite improvement on the first novel. The first novel was hardly a novel at all, but rather a loose and uneven collection of short stories. \\"Foundation and Empire\\" is actually two novellas, and more care has obviously been taken with writing style, pacing, and character development.The second story, \\"The Mule,\\" is perhaps the best of the entire Foundation series. The characters are enjoyably real and likable, and there are two masterful surprises at the end.The entire Foundation series is essential reading for any science fiction fan."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"You can read the publisher's summary for yourself, but let me just add that this is THE classic SF trilogy. Book one, \\"Foundation,\\" creates the future world, its declining culture, and how a group of strong-minded individuals don't want to see knowledge die. How they do that drives this novel. In book two, Asimov introduces the mystery of the mule, and in book three Asimov pulls a rabbit out the hat called the Second Foundation.If you enjoy books that entertain, books that offer good mysteries, and books that make you think about bigger things in life, than this series is for you. It's too bad our political leaders don't read novels like this. Maybe we'd avoid the continual messes they get countries in."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"I have not readf the Foundation series in years. However, the other day I was thinking about how much fun the trilogy had been. One has to remember that most of the scifi you read today has at least some of its roots based in Asimov's work, Asimov was not the best writer, nor was he the most creative. What he did accomplish was selling you another time and world that you could believe in. So, taking it for what it is, not a great piece of literature but a really enjoyable trip, i need to give the trilogy 5 stars."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"I always prefer to think of the foundation Trilogy as one book.They are meant to be read one after another and are also written that way.While the first part(Foundation) gives us the historical perspective and a sketch of characters who influence the events,this book is where it gets better in a serious way!!There is not much of a point in discussing the plot-lots of other people have commented on that.But i'll tell you this - the 2nd part of this book- which talks about the Mule and his rise to power is THE best part of the ENTIRE FOUNDATION series ( Yes all the 7 books!!).IT ends with the most famous twist on paper it will make your mind reel!! It sets up the things nicely for the Second foundation - the 3 book in the series.I have read almost everything that Asimov's written.The foundation series and the End of Eternity are my favourites.The difference between Asimov and the other Science Fiction writers is that he makes the Science Fiction believable.Asimov is also a very good mystery writer(no kidding!! - he's right up there with the authors who write mystery alone).It's easy to write a Sci Fi book with an amazing amount of Science and imagination- but how well you can bind it to a story and make it real, that is the deal.Apart from the idea the story has to be told well. This is where the good doctor excelled.Trust me if you have not read the Foundation Series you are missing something which in indelibly written in the records as the one of the best books on paper.Asimov's written it so that you are sufficiently intrested for more at the end of the book one , by the time you finish the second book you are thinking this is great stuff - desperate for more you go the 3rd book. By the time you are through you think this is soooo cool - it might be the best thing you ever read.Do yourself a favour go read the Foundation and Empire , follow that up with the Second Foundation.You'll be glad you did when you return to it over the years!!"},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"Welcome to the second book in the Foundation trilogy (although Asimov did write further books, it was a trilogy originally). The book picks up where Foundation left off - the Foundation has established itself as a formidable force in the Periphery of the Galaxy. Of course, everyone is too well aware that gaining control of the local warlords is small potatoes compared to what's to come. In Foundation and Empire, the inevitable comes.As the previous novel, Asimov has divided this into books, however here there are only two. As a result, he gets to explore the characters at more length then in Foundation. But again, expect wonder, amazement and enjoyment at the themes, issues and grandeur of this book, not the characterisation and &quot;literary&quot; qualities.In the first book, the conflict between the Foundation and what's left of the Empire develops. This however is a much bigger game - in the past, the warlords barely out-war-powered the Foundation, while here the Empire dwarfs it even in its twilight. As always, something must be done other than a brute force tactic. Furthermore, the &quot;heroes&quot; of the Foundation are no more, in the conflict there are no Mallows or Hardins to guide the political intrigue, so it is here that Seldon's plan is put to the ultimate test.In the second book (not to give away too much), a new threat to the Plan arises. A man known only as the Mule comes to light. And for the first time, an individual drastically changes the course of history. Indeed, he consists of the biggest threat to the plan thus far. What's so special about him?.. Personally, I found this book the most enjoyable in the whole trilogy - it reminds me of the little cryptic &quot;detective&quot; plotting from other Asimov works I read, such as I Robot and Steel Caves. However, here, it's an almost perfect melodrama played out (and unlike many detective elements in novels includingthose of Asimov - this one doesn't seem contrived or make you feel at all &quot;cheated&quot;), as we follow some Foundationers in their quest to find out what the Mule is and how to deal with him.This is a great continuation of the saga and will also bring out many interesting questions - like whether an individual can change the course of history. It will also shake up your conception of the Seldon plan - overall, a great book."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"I just finished Foundation and Empire and so far it is my favorite in the series....Foundation presented us a struggling organization of scientists on the Planet Terminus who must deal with the newly formed barbarian kingdoms that arise from the retreating Empire. Important figures within the Foundation use religion, trade and technology to dominate over adversarial planets....In Foundation and Empire, we are given a new perspective on the Foundation. Before, we were lead to believe that the Foundation must survive and that no one could hinder its progess; that Hari Seldon's predictions of the Foundation were infallible; that the 1,000 year plan was set in stone and that a new Galactic Empire will arrise in such time thanks to Hari Seldon. However, these beliefs are put into question when an individual calling himself 'The Mule' threatens to destroy Hari Seldon's 300 year old project. He is a mutant of considerable mental powers who can seemingly convert anyone into his cause, even the greatest opponent. Thus, we are asked, \\"Does Hari Seldon's precious Psychohistory take random genetic mutation into account? If not, then is it possible for the Mule to destroy the Foundation?\\"...I loved the ending to Foundation and Empire. Like Empire Stikes Back, it leaves you hanging, desperately wanting to find out what happens to the main characters (and the galaxy) after the book ends....I've always loved enigmatic characters in books. The Mule fits this catagory, which, in my mind, makes him even more sinister and evil. We never see him or hear him speak (for all those who have read the book, don't say anything), and yet we experience his destructive force. It reminds me of Sauron of The Lord of the Rings. At the end, however, we are given a profound revelation of the Mule that adds a new dimension to his character....All in all, it was the dispair and depression in the book that captured me. There was little hope and yet the human spirit was still evident. I applaud Asimov for creating a believable story in which death, destruction and dispair overshadow an entire galaxy but hope and determination remain. This theme, I think, is present throughout the series and, in my opinion, is the most important human quality that makes us who we are. The foundation is ultimately an exploration of this theme. Clearly, Hope is the most formiddble force that human history and, according to Asimov, the galaxy has ever seen."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"The second book of the original trilogy, this book is an amazing follow on to &quot;Foundation&quot;. The seven books of the Foundation series together form what I consider to be the most complete and astonishing blend of deep reality with science fiction. The septet, for the uninitiated, include (in the order I believe they should be read in): Prelude to the Foundation, Forward the Foundation, Foundation, Foundation and Empire, Second Foundation, Foundation's Edge and Foundation and Earth. Do yourself a favor, buy them all. If you don't drool over the books by the time you're done with them, read them again."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"I give all 14 books 5 stars!For those of you who would like to read the Foundation story in it's entirety, from beginning to end, chronologically, then I suggest following this course. There are 14 books in the series! In the end, it was R. Daneel Olivaw who designed and created the Trantorian empire in the first place, and so the robot novels--which introduce the cradle world of Earth before the dawn of the empire--come before the Foundation Trilogy:The Caves of Steel, The Naked Sun, The Robots of Dawn, Robots and Empire, Prelude to Foundation, Forward the Foundation, Foundation's Fear, Foundation and Chaos, Foundation's Triumph, Foundation, Foundation and Empire, Second Foundation, Foundation's Edge, Foundation and EarthNow some of you might not recommend that one read the Second Trilogy before the first. True, but they come chronologically BEFORE the first Foundation Trilogy! I do recommend that you at least read Foundation's Edge and Foundation and Earth AFTER you have read the second trilogy (Foundation's Fear, Foundation and Chaos, Foundation's Triumph) because the subjects in the last two (chronological) books are more interesting that way."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"Still a great classic! Got to read the rest of the series now. Why do they make me type more words for a review than I feel like saying at Amazon?"},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"I'd say that you will probably be a bit lost if you don't start with foundation and plan to continue with second foundation after this book. Reading this as a stand alone would be a bit like reading Tolkien's two towers without having started at the beginning of the series. You could probably do it and get something from the story, but the beauty of the foundation series is that it is a series telling one coherent story. This book shows it's age with some of the technology it discusses, but it is also vividly imaginative and full of timeless lessons."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"If you pick this book up, i would plan on getting the rest of the series. I decided not to start with the prequel, but with what are considered to be some of Asimov's best novels. I am currently on second foundation, the third book in the series, and i am looking forward to finding out what happens next. I can't remember any other book that i've ever read that covers such a large time span in the way that this book does. Characters are introduced, they play their parts and then fade into history as a new set of characters is introduced. As a fairly well read individual i would recommend these books to anyone."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"when I was child we read this story and did essays in high school ... today I find it hard to follow the story line or read more then a few pages at a time."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"Foundation and Empire is the second volume in Isaac Asimov's Foundation series. Originally published as two novellas, Foundation and Empire the novel is made up of \\"The General\\" and \\"The Mule\\".In \\"The General\\", as the Galactic Empire crumbles, General Bel Riose launches an attack on the Foundation. Although the Foundation is theoretically stronger than the Empire, General Bel Riose has access to greater resources and personnel and so his attack does begin to threaten the Foundation. A Foundation citizen named Devers intercepts a communication that details the General's double dealings and attempts to escape to Trantor so that he can show the communication to the Emperor and hopefully stop the attack.\\"The Mule\\" is set roughly one hundred years after \\"The General\\". The Empire has crumbled, Trantor has been sacked by invaders, and most of the galaxy has split into barbaric factions. Due to its extensive trading routes, the Foundation is now the major power in the galaxy. Until, that is, a new threat arises in the form of a growing army of barbarians led by a mysterious individual known as the Mule. Once it is discovered that Hari Seldon has failed to predict the existence of the Mule, Foundation citizens Toran and Bayta Darell, along with psychologist Ebling Mis and a refugee clown named Magnifico Giganticus, travel the galaxy attempting to locate the Second Foundation that had been established by Seldon.Although a much darker and more intense book, Foundation and Empire is an excellent follow up to Foundation. Asimov's writing is excellent as ever, with his descriptions of the alien worlds and his characterisations being particularly strong. The whole Foundation series is fantastic and Foundation and Empire is further proof that Isaac Asimov is one of the greatest science fiction writers of all time."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"Foundation, a collection of five short stories, is the first book in Isaac Asimov's epic century-spanning science fiction masterwork known as the Foundation Series.The first of the collected stories, \\"The Psychohistorians\\", takes place on Trantor, the capital planet of the 12000 year old Galactic Empire. Mathematician Hari Seldon has developed a new science known as psychohistory which equates are possibilities in large societies to mathematics, allowing him to predict long-term outcomes. Using his psychohistory, Seldon discovers that the Galactic Empire is decaying and that it will collapse within 500 years, the collapse being followed by a 300000 year period of barbarism in the galaxy. When his findings are declared to be high treason, Seldon and a group of hand-picked scientists agree to go into exile on the planet Terminus, where they intend to create a mammoth Encyclopaedia Galactica as the repository for all human learning. In this way they hope to limit the period of chaos that will inevitably follow the collapse of the Empire.In \\"The Encyclopaedists\\", having progressed 50 years into the future, the planet Terminus is facing its first Seldon Crisis. The Foundation on Terminus is caught in the middle of a power struggle between four neighbouring planetary systems and the scientists are ill-equipped to deal with military matters. Luckily, Mayor Salvor Hardin is quick to realise the danger and attempts to work out a solution. Hardin receives guidance as to the way forward for the Foundation from an image of the now deceased Hari Seldon that appears in a specially created Time Vault and confirms that psychohistory has predicted a series of crises that will occur on Terminus.\\"The Mayors\\" takes place 30 years later when the Foundation has used its scientific knowledge as the basis for a pseudo religion that keeps neighbouring planets in order. However, the Prince Regent of Anacreon seeks to overthrow the Foundation and so Salvor Hardin is once again called upon to avert a Seldon Crisis.In \\"The Traders\\" another 55 years have passed and a trader by the name of Limmar Ponyets is sent to the planet Askone to retrieve a fellow trader who is facing execution. The leaders of Askone are determined to avoid contact with, and contamination by, Foundation technology so Ponyets must employ devious methods to secure the release of his colleague.The final story is \\"The Merchant Princes\\". The Foundation has expanded and grown powerful through the use of its science religion and economics but three Foundation vessels have recently disappeared in the vicinity of Korell, a civilisation trying to develop their own variety of technical superiority. Trader Hober Mallow is sent to uncover information on their technology and hopefully find the missing ships.Foundation is clearly an epic undertaking, especially since anyone who reads this first book is pretty much guaranteed to want to progress on to the further books in the series, but it is well worth the effort. The Foundation Series is perhaps more esoteric that Asimov's Robot Series but is still a rewarding read. The characters, planets and indeed empires that Asimov has created are truly immense and his storytelling ability is outstanding. Foundation is a fantastic book by one of the greatest science fiction writers of all time."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"I hadn't read this since I was a teenager. I had forgotten what an excellent writer and fantastic mind Isaac Asimov was. It was refreshing to see character and idea development that kept my interest and actually made me think. Read this and enjoy all Asimov was to the Science Fiction genre."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"Isaac Asimov is an exception author in any genre, he just happens to write in science fiction. His Foundation novels are at the apex of classic science fiction. If you are going to read only one book in this genre then this is the one to choose. The universe he creates is so vivid that the book is difficult to put down. In case you couldn't tell.....I am a fan!"},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"As is all Issac Asimov Novels this is good reading! The 4 star rating is that the story does not seem to come to a complete end, I did expect more."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"While I believe that Asimov was a great science fiction author I was disappointed in this book and the whole series. To me science fiction is about new ideas of the future and an exciting story. While the idea of a falling society, where some foresee the downfall of its society and plan to minimise the impact, is interesting, it could have been staged as well in the past. One can tell that the book has been written some while ago and it is missing the action and technologies I want to read about in a science fiction book today. For me personally the book is also very slow paced and not engaging enough to make me want to continue reading it, but rather read some chapters at a time and then I can put it down for weeks, since I am not engaged enough to read further. Still I am kind of interested in how the series continues and finally ends, but not interested enough that I have to use every free minute reading it. I find it hard to judge this book and if you are into science fiction I believe you just have to give it a try. Yes, I rated it only three stars, but rating this book in a one dimensional fashion doesn't do its justice, since I believe it is still a very good book, but just not what I was expecting of a science fiction and wanted to read. I personally prefer a Peter Hamilton, Stephen Baxter or Andreas Eschbach for example."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"In a preface written in 1982 for a volume collecting the original \\"Foundation\\" trilogy, Asimov recalled the sources of inspiration for the series and boasted, \\"Why shouldn't I write of the Galactic Empire and of the return of feudalism. . . ? After all, I had read Gibbon's 'Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire' not once, but twice.\\"Edward Gibbon's influence is certainly obvious in \\"Foundation.\\" A galactic empire, centered in Trantor (a celestial Rome), is on the verge of collapse. During the Dark Ages that follow, the surviving remnants at the extreme borders of the galaxy initially maintain control by creating a religion that hides scientific knowledge behind theological mysteries and by training a caste of priests to monopolize this learning. Asimov, however, goes beyond the period covered by Gibbon (who ended his masterwork with the age of the Crusades): when new and powerful rulers challenge the priestly authority, an upstart mercantile class--the Medicis and Borgias of the galactic future--gain the upper hand.Yet \\"Foundation\\" is hardly a history lesson; Asimov simply channeled his understanding of medieval and Renaissance Europe into a series of intriguing stories, what might instead be described as \\"psychohistorical\\" and sociopolitical thrillers. In the opening chapter, during the dying days of the Empire, Hari Seldon studies \\"psychohistory\\"--a kind of societal (but not individual) determinism based loosely on the idea that broad historical trends are cyclical and predictable. Aware that he cannot prevent the fall of the Empire, Seldon uses his learning to chart a course for the preservation of knowledge and an accelerated re-creation of a Second Empire. (Asimov had no way of knowing, of course, that psychohistory would later become a legitimate field of academic research by such scholars as Peter Gay.)Each of the five episodes in the book reads like a tautly played game of political chess in which the winner is inevitably the visionary who is not wedded to traditional moves and who is patient enough to wait for his opponent to make the first mistake. The suspense is developed almost exclusively from the \\"cold war\\" tension between rival forces: there's not much action in \\"Foundation,\\" and (as other readers have noted), the lengthy dialogue is spotty and the \\"character development\\" is pretty much nonexistent (although the same could surely be said about such sci-fi classics as \\"2001\\" and \\"The Time Machine\\"). But if you like your science fiction a tad cerebral, you'll find much to admire in Asimov's first major work."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"Asimov's Golden Age classic Foundation Trilogy is one of the early milestones of the science fiction genre. This second installment is less episodic than the first volume, focusing on just two specific stories. The first volume, &quot;Foundation&quot;, sets up the whole idea of the Seldon Plan, a mathematically based view of sociopolitical forces that enables one brilliant scientist to grow a new galactic empire from a foundation of one hundred thousand scientists and their families. &quot;Empire&quot; starts off in the same vein, showing how the Foundation staves off annihilation at the hands of the currently decaying, but still dangerous Galactic Empire. Once again, the magic of this section is the subtle means by which the Foundation overcomes impossible odds, and the convincing arguments Asimov uses to make the solution seem inevitable. Part Two involves an internal struggle between the Foundation's authoritarian central government and the Independent Traders who spread that government's economic power. While the Foundation is threatened with civil war, the rise of a new warlord on Kalgan poses a danger to the entire human race.Because each story is substantially longer than those in Foundation, this volume focuses more on individual characters. In fact, it is not too much to say that a major theme is the historical question, \\"Do individuals matter?\\" As a result, the characters are developed slightly more, and there's even a wistful love triangle, and considerably more action than was featured in the first volume, which tended to be distant and impersonal. If you liked Foundation, you'll surely enjoy this and the climax to the series, Second Foundation.Although these books will strike many as hopelessly dated, Asimov's sweeping historical vision should not be missed by any fans of speculative fiction. They have a directness and honest charm about them that is rare in contemporary science fiction. Later additions to this series, both sequels and prequels, don't adhere to the tone of these original novels, and really add very little except bulk."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"If you have the patience to read the first 100 pages you'll not be able to put this book aside.The first time I read this book I was 14. I've probably read it a dozen times by now. The plot is extremely good. The outcomes of every event (since the group leaves Trantor) are surprising, the way the main heroes solve the problems are exciting and satisfying (to me at least). The good amount of dialogues keeps the book from becoming boring and overly descriptive.Asimov's imagination is as yet unsurpassed!"},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"The classic Foundation trilogy continues on pace in this second installment. The first half of this book is rather flat with uninspiring political wrangles and a story of the Empire's last general who is defeated by the Foundation and is never mentioned again. This episode has little effect on the overall flow of the story and is a curious piece of filler in this otherwise strong trilogy. However, the second half of this book, taking place many decades later, more than makes up for it. Here we learn that Hari Seldon's once flawless predictions on the course of humanity throughout the galaxy are starting to break down, because of the passage of huge amounts of time and the introduction of an unforeseen variable. This variable is a mutant known as The Mule, who has strange mental powers that are outside the realm of Seldon's psychohistory and throw his ancient predictions out of whack. Soon both the Foundation and the Empire are in ruins, and barbarism reigns throughout the galaxy. Only the mysterious Second Foundation, which has not been heard from since Seldon's day, can possibly help. Whether or not the Second Foundation can save the galaxy from the dark ages, and whether this is all really a part of Seldon's plan after all, are questions that arise in this book but are not answered. Thus we have an excellent intellectual cliffhanger that gives a great reason to continue to the third installment of the trilogy.There are two strange occurrences in this book that speak volumes on the time period in which Asimov wrote it, that being the 1940's. First, there is a prominent female character in this book, which was nearly unheard of in the sci-fi of that area. Furthermore, Asimov writes as if this is an amazing occurrence, and other characters are shocked and uncomfortable with this woman's status as an \\"equal\\" among the male characters around her. This sure seems strange today. Was Asimov slyly commenting on the state of women's rights back in mid-century, or did he think he was making a grand statement about the future? Either way, the sentiment is oddly outdated and even more oddly takes place in the distant future of humanity, where I would hope things would have progressed. Finally, in the second-to-last line of the book, Asimov inserts a rather sick dirty joke through the use of a sly double entendre (the key word is \\"mule\\").. Back in 1952 Asimov probably thought he was making a goofy in-joke to his learned friends that would not be caught by the general public. If that's the case, the joke in question seems extremely silly and predictable today, and brings the book to a close that is rather difficult to take seriously."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"Normally I need lots of action and suspense to keep me interested in a book. This book had some level of suspense (not like Koontz's, The Watcher) but focused more on the growth of the main character. Very intriguing plot that had me wondering what was going to happen next. I liked it enough to read the next two books in the series."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"I had read Foundation when I was in High School and I decided to revisit the book later. Last summer I revisited the book and by the end of the summer I had read all of the books in the series. Asimov had combined 3 series into one leading to 15(?) books. I can't remember how many I read. I even checked out the Foundation books written by &quot;the Killer B's.&quot; Read this book. It is a pillar of Sci-fi as is his &quot;I, Robot.&quot; There is a reason that these books were in contention with Tolkien for the Sci-fi series of the century. Foundation is a wonderful starting point for an engaging series.If you decide to read the &quot;series.&quot; Understand that he took 3 different series, his robot series, foundation series, and the empire series and combined them to create a vision of future history. Few authors have tried to create a series in such a grand scale and Asimov is the master of grand scale. Only the empire series (which is currently out of print) feels outdated. Yet, all parts must be read to truly enjoy the second foundation trilogy.If you want to get your feet wet with Asimov, start here or with his &quot;I, Robot.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"Besides his Robot stories and novels, Foundation stands as oneof the greatest science fiction novel written by the late IsaacAsimov.By mixing properly the future, humanity and the sociopoliticaldevelopment of our race on a galactic span using the decline ofthe Roman Empire as a base, Asimov tells us a story of one man'sstruggle and the product of its stubborness in following stories.This book is a must for anyone, genre fan or not, I guaranteeyou will read it more than once in your lifetime."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"The Foundation series is Sci-Fi's grandest and most accessible epic. Asimov's writing style focuses on the story, not the jargon, so you never get bogged down. The hero is Hari Seldon, who is able to scientifically predict the future (don't ask how), and he knows that the vast Galactic Empire is soon headed for the dustbin of history...Hari, the prophet that he is, endeavors to shorten the time before another Galactic Empire can restore civilization to 1,000 years instead of 10,000 or 20,000...surely a worthy goal. This book will amaze you, will excite you and have you wanting more. It's fun and thoughtful at the same time...And, IMHO, these books get even better later on in the series.This book, which is later linked to the Robots series, may also be one of the most influential sci-fi books ever. (The galactic empire of Dune shares a lot of similarities)...Great stuff from the Grandmaster!"},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"Isaac Asimov captivates the reader in this book, the &quot;unofficial&quot; start to the Foundation series. The story revolves around 3 major characters, Hari Seldon, a famous psychohistorian and predictor of the Empire's demise, Salvor Hardin, mayor of Terminus, home planet of the foundation, and Hober Mallow, a Master Trader who rises through the ranks. I found the 3 separate yet interweaving storylines appealing, much like The Martian Chronicles by Ray Bradbury but not nearly as divided. Each character has their own opinion in how to accomplish a goal and presents each in a logical and realistic way. The thing that's amazing about the Foundation is that it doesn't have to rely on epic battles, hyperdetailed sensory imagery, or ridiculously long monologues by static, stereotypical characters. The characters are real, they get afraid, they make mistakes, and they change throughout the story. The writting is paced just perfectly so that it doesn't tire you out yet it provides enough details about any given situation. Asimov is a literary genius and I can't recommend the whole Foundation series enough to anyone who just has a little free time on their hands. And remember, &quot;Violence is the last refuge of the incompetent&quot; - Salvor Hardin"},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"A GALACTIC EMPIRE IS PREDICTED TO LIE IN RUINS IN THE FUTURE BY THE GREAT PSYCHOHISTORIAN- HARI SELDON.the commission of public safety approves of the seldon plan to minimise the worst of what was to come. two foundations are set up at opposite ends of the galaxy.the first guards the secrets of psychohistory -of this planet nothing could be told. the second -TERMINUS- is the pawn in the master plan of hari seldon. the inhabitants of TERMINUS are busy writing the encyclopaedia galactica.and going on with their lives. in the 50th year of the landing of humans on the planet, the first crises is faced...the first SELDON CRISES. this is when the high &amp; mighty of planet terminus sees seldon appear in the time capsule. other crisises follow and they are dealt with great diplomacy. this story is the story of a disintegrating galactic empire,and that of a lone planet on the outet rims of the galaxy trying to survive in a hostile world of barbaric planets with dictators as the rulers.it is the story of a planet inhabited by the best brains in the galaxy and how they emerge as diplomats from their original occupations of scientists and scholers. asimov is brilliant in sketching the slow but steady evolution of a world of scientists into a world of future rulers. though the jump between great lengths of time makes us feel as if we've experienced a jump through hyper space. a good book to lay one's hands on, if one likes to zoom into the future. a book for all, no doubt asimov's foundation is the perfect start for the following books of the foundation saga. happy reading."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"First, I read quite a bit from all genres, primarily to expand my world. Foundation is a very good series, but here's a few reasons why this book might not expand *your* world: 1) you were a statistics/religion/philosophy major in college (it may annoy); 2) you want a book for entertainment, not to ponder (it may bore); 3) you really think character development is important in a book (it spans generations, hence little/no development); 4) You're already a scifi buff (most of the books you've read have already assimilated the ideas of Foundation -- credit where due!). Biggest reason to read: its robust, well-crafted universe. Other tidbits: I've tried to read this series a second time, but it can't sustain my interest quite like other 5-star selections."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"I always liked Asimov, but finding series books in sequence is difficult with print books. Kindle makes it easy! Now they're all cataloged in order and I don't even have to get out of bed for the next one.Reading the \\"Foundation\\" series in order rather than by availability makes a great writer even better."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"All I can say, for warm start, is that Isaac Asimov is a genius. Acclaimed Hugo Award winner, he really makes you feel a part of the future, as he proves to be a genius not only in a robot way of thinking, but also in politics, economy, religion, mass manipulation and, of course, in every way that makes a human, human. And I am pretty sure this characteristic of him is really connected to his also great robotics series.Imagine yourself in the future. Now imagine yourself in a further future where you are studying the chronology of the future. Remember your history classes in school? Yeah, that's where he's taking you. Analyzing the Galactic Empire from a distant and omnipotent way of view, he sets a pattern in the development of mankind that repeats itself various and various times, that's why this book could be written set in Middle Age. But it isn't and that's one of the most fascinating things about it.Everything starts when Hari Seldon, a famous psychohistorian - a new science developed by himself based in history, statistics and mathematics - predicts the fall of the Galactic Empire. To save mankind from thousands years of darkness and restart, he suggests setting a new colony at the fringe of the Galaxy - Terminus System - to develop the greatest literacy work of history and regroup all knowledge ever acquired: the Encyclopedia Galactica.Set as a scientific colony and lacking natural resources, the Foundation, as it is called, starts to suffer of politics and diplomatic issues and that's just where all the greatness starts coming. As it's well more developed in technology and science than the rest of Periphery - as they call the region of the galaxy containing the Terminus system - other colonies start trading natural resources, such as gold and iron, for scientific gadgets to control their masses.Based on science, there is created a new religion in which priests are, actually, researchers and technicians. It was Arthur C. Clarke who once said that high level technology is indistinguishable from magic, though it makes perfect sense for this novel, except we are not taking magic in consideration, but religion (although they are equal if you look from a different angle, but this is not to be discussed in this review). To control masses in the Four Kingdoms of Periphery, they sell science. And it works pretty well until there's a crisis, and another, and another. In each of them, those called Seldon Crisis and taken in consideration when the psychohistorian predicted the need of Foundation, he appears and hints a new period of development.But it is not only religion that control masses and it is not only faith that is needed in human race, but also trading, protection, food, gadgets, industry and, of course, a stable economy. Nuclear force moves everything in the future, that's how Asimov puts it and he puts it so well that he really makes us think if isn't it the power we should explore - consider this book was written in the beginning of nuclear power.The book is well-split in five sections: The Psychohistorians, The Encyclopedists, The Mayors, The Traders and The Merchant Princes. In each of those, Asimov explores a deep wound in human civilization, psychology and sociology, based on a few dominating aspects, and shows that it is even easier to overpower an entire society poking only its foundation.It is a masterpiece, well-thought from the beginning to the last word. That's all I have to say.95/100"},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"Clever twists, incredible imagination, and a fun, quick read. Some of Asimov's ideas of future civilizations invoke awe even decades later. My only complaint is that the reader only gets to experience each generation for a single chapter, so character development is tricky and brief. Not as good as Ender's Game, but still worth reading."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"Foundation is completely a story of ideas, the characters are completely servants to the scifi galaxy Asimov has created.

I read this one in record time. A great read, and highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"The Foundation Trilogy is a \\"trilogy\\" of thirteen books. This review will mainly talk about book one. The Foundation, a group of scientists and engineers writing a galactic encyclopedia, starts before book one takes place. The prologue is about an apparently irrelevant person. Nonetheless, I think it is important to read the beginning because it sets up the story. The main story takes place much later, when the actual Foundation is formed at the edge of the galaxy. This entire group of people are the main character, though at time other people take the spotlight.During the book, challenges arise to meet the Foundation, and at each challenge, the Foundation uses a different and unique method of dealing with the task at hand. As the book progresses, the Foundation gets more and more technology, while the empire at the center of the galaxy dies away. The Foundation was created to start a new empire after the old empire is destroyed. To make sure this would happen, Harry Seldon used psychohistory to predict the future and lock the foundation in a path that will reach its goal.I think that this book should only be absorbed by people in college or beyond because it has very advanced ideas."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"Foundation And Empire, by Isaac Asimov is the second book in the original Foundation trilogy, which won a Hugo Award in 1965 for Best All-Time Series. It follows much the same narrative structure as the first book, Foundation, save that the book has only two \`books', to the original's five, which allows for less epic scene setting, and much more character development. And don't let some of the books' critics fool you. The characterizations in these books are wonderful, deep, and complex. They simply are not done in the usual ways. They use a characterization style I term \`silhouetting', wherein characters are portrayed not so much by what they do as the important things they do not do, or that which is not described in \`on stage' actions. This book, though, is not merely a continuation of the first book, but an expansion of its themes, which includes some more detailed characterization.The first book set up the history of a senescent galactic Empire on the verge of tottering into oblivion and thirty thousand years of barbarism. A scientist named Hari Seldon attempts to shorten that Imperial interregnum by establishing two Foundations on either end of the galaxy, ostensibly to compile an Encyclopedia Galactica. In reality these two Foundations will be the cornerstones of the Second Empire, which Seldon's Psychohistory- a deterministic pseudoscience, predicts will cut the interregnum down to s ingle millennium. By the first book's end the first Foundation, on the planet Terminus, has survived several \`Seldon Crises' via his holographic intervention, which helps the Foundation outwit its enemies, and the work of legendary leaders- Salvor Hardin and Hober Mallow, and a few centuries in to its existence seems poised to actually take on and destroy the ruined Empire.This is where Foundation And Empire starts....the book is relatively easy to get into- even if you've not read the first book. That's because Asimov's style of the pseudo historical work allows for quick recaps (in the old movie serial vein), and the fact that each chapter within each book has new characters and situations means that they can stand alone, even as they add to the overall tapestry. Asimov also makes a wise dramatic choice in The Mule section. By spending a book and a half showing Psychohistory's upside, and proving its internal \`validity', the second half of Foundation And Empire shows the downside of lulling oneself into a false sense of security, as well the consequences that coyuld await the Foundation if it falls the same way the Empire did. The funereal descriptions of Trantor contrast vividly with the awesome complexity that opens the first book of the trilogy. Then, the Empire seemed impervious. Yet, Asimov is so good a writer that he rarely lapses into caricature. Even The Mule is sympathetic, when we understand his drive to prove himself. Even more interesting is that he seems no worse than the old Emperors, nor even the dynastic heirs of the current Foundation. With his powers his Second Empire might even be better than the Seldonian one. Yet, lacking an heir- due to his sterility. and his own powers, it would seem likely that even greater chaos would befall the galaxy upon his death.This begs the question that seems to be central to the trilogy: \`What place does the individual have in the overall scheme of things?', or, more succinctly, \`Does an individual matter?' The Mule seems to be a resounding answer of YES! He also seemingly cuts to the dubious heart of Psychohistory, which is based upon the well known Fallacy Of Uninterrupted Trends. Because of these philosophical depths, wonderfully concise and spare writing which does not bore one silly with extraneous detail, but a lean, clean narrative line, excellent characterizations, and an ability to deliver a twist ending many mystery writers would envy, Foundation And Empire ranks as a truly great novel, even outside its genre. Only readers addicted to the modern need to reveal why everything is, in excruciating detail, and to have mere action, action, action on every page, will not recognize this as not only great sci fi, but great literature. Asimov, too, deserves the label as a great writer. As The Mule might say: On to Second Foundation!"},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"Asimov's Foundation books are well-crafted, masterfully imagined, and peopled with fascinating characters. Spanning some several thousand years, and multiple generations of characters (often more than one per book), the author does a fantastic job keeping each set unique and captivating. The stories follow the progression of Psychohistory, a technique for predicting the future behavior of masses of people, and the people set up to use its information to further the birth of a greater galactic empire. Space battles, intrigue, mutants, telepathy and mind control, as well as personal triumphs and failures run throughout all the novels. They are, in my opinion, among the best crafted series in the sci-fi genre ever produced."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"What else can one possibly say about one of the greatest science fiction novels ever written?? A terrific beginning to a beginning series. I can hardly wait to read the rest of them."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"For those of you who would like to read the Foundation story in it's entirety, from beginning to end, chronologically, then I suggest following this course. There are 14 books in the series! In the end, it was R. Daneel Olivaw who designed and created the Trantorian empire in the first place, and so the robot novels--which introduce the cradle world of Earth before the dawn of the empire--come before the Foundation Trilogy:The Caves of Steel, The Naked Sun, The Robots of Dawn, Robots and Empire, Prelude to Foundation, Forward the Foundation, Foundation's Fear, Foundation and Chaos, Foundation's Triumph, Foundation, Foundation and Empire, Second Foundation, Foundation's Edge, Foundation and EarthNow some of you might not recommend that one read the Second Trilogy before the first. True, but they come chronologically BEFORE the first Foundation Trilogy! I do recommend that you at least read Foundation's Edge and Foundation and Earth AFTER you have read the second trilogy (Foundation's Fear, Foundation and Chaos, Foundation's Triumph) because the subjects in the last two (chronological) books are more interesting that way. Note also that I do not consider Asimov's early &quot;Empire&quot; novels to apply to the Foundation series. Interesting that they were included in Foundation's Triumph, but not relevant. It was cheesy in my opinion that the &quot;time machine&quot; was included in that story and then not even used for any practical purpose. Again, another plot-joiner there (Triumph was filled with them!). So, 14 books in all, in my estimation. The three galactic empire books are so cheesy, just don't read them...nothing to do with Foundation at all."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"I was expecting so much more from this book as it was once awarded best sci-fi series ever. It was good, but not that great. Maybe in the 1950's it was the best of sci-fi, but compared to today's standards it was a little boring and out of date. It contains long dialogs and a lot of politics wrapped in a sci-fi environment. It doesn't contain fascinating worlds and interesting glimpses of the future. There's not a lot of action but I have to admit the dialog is pretty good. If you're into nostalgia, politics and interesting dialog this book is for you."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"In reviewing the book Foundation I am recommending that you read all of the Foundation books by Asimov. Just get started and read them all. Even though each book can be read individually, do yourself a favor and read them in order. I won't be reviewing any other books in the series. I want you to do the whole series.One of the most interesting ideas that Asimov gives us is the ultimate form of self defense. No, it isn't karate or jiu jitsu, boxing or wrestling. It's touching the other person's mind.There are enough circles within circles, things that aren't what they seem to be, surprises that put the theories into a cocked hat, to keep you on your toes.Don't deprive yourself of the best sci fi series ever written."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"From everything I've heard about this book, I was really excited to read it. After reading the first half in a few days then forcing myself to finish the second half after taking a two week break, I can honestly say that I found it to be a real let down.The main theme was about the only part I liked. Humanity has colonized the stars and controls everything blah blah blah but a really smart guy and his friends do some math equations and figure out that the currently all-powerful and all-encompassing Empire is doomed to collapse and thrust mankind thousands of years back to a &#34;barbaric&#34; state. His solution is to gather all the great minds of the day and create an educated stronghold on the edge of the galaxy to serve as a becon of hope and enlightnenment to supposedly shorten the time mankind has to spend in the dark ages.Their main goal is to create an encyclopedia that pretty much contains every biit of information ever learned. Ever. (wikipedia)Well it turns turns out that several years after the creation of Foundation, the shallow characters are riddeled with &#34;crises&#34;. Good thing the late creator appears via prerecorded videos at strategic times to offer advice to the indistinguishable residents and assures them that he did some math problems fifty years ago and discovered that everyting with work itself out. This is the basis for the rest of the book.The characters are dull, boring and super confident in everything they do because some dead guys math and future predictions will save them all.The second half of the book proved to be slightly more interesting, but not much"},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"The first thing to understand about Foundation is that it isn't really a novel. It is a collection of 5 connected short stories (The Psychohistorians, The Encyclopedists, The Mayors, The Traders, & The Merchant Princes) written in the 1940s for publication in Astounding Science Fiction Magazine. The first story in the book was actually written a few years later for repackaging the stories as the first novel in what would eventually become the Foundation trilogy (later expanded with additional books).The galactic empire is rotting. After it collapses, there will follow 30,000 years of barbarism. Nothing can prevent the collapse, but Hari Seldon believes that the subsequent dark ages can be contained to 1,000 years if the proper steps are taken. To achieve this he sets up the Foundation at the very fringes of the empire. The first two stories are far and away the best in the book, and are worth the price of admission by themselves. This is because they deal directly with the central premise, which is a fantastic idea.Things go downhill with the next two stories. In particular, The Traders, seems completely unnecessary. Things pick up a bit with the final chapter.Taken as a whole, Foundation is less than the sum of its parts. I don't think it is the unrivaled masterpiece that many make it out to be. I would definitely go in with an open mind and lowered expectations.However, as I mentioned earlier, the idea is fantastic and promises much more and better to come. I will definitely be checking out the next book in the series."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"I have no idea why I hadn't read this series until now.

The premise and scope of this novel are staggering and the plot develops at a blistering pace. You will not be able to put this book down once you start. The only minor critique I have of this book is that, as a series of novellas that continually advance into the future, characters you have grown to care about are quickly whisked away and replaced by new ones. Therefore, it is helpful to approach this book as a set of separate, though interconnected stories. When all is said and done, this book sets the stage for one of the greatest sci-fi series of all time.

Even if your taste is for other styles, Asimov's \\"future history\\" has rightly become part of the science fiction canon of great books.The first episode in \\"Foundation\\" appeared about 50 years ago as a stand-alone story in Astounding Science Fiction under the title \\"Bridle and Saddle.\\" At the time, Asimov had no idea where it would eventually lead. Hari Seldon, Salvor Hardin, and the Galactic Empire emerged in that single story to shape all the \\"Foundation\\" novels that were to follow. It's all the more remarkable, then, to read that story today with the realization that none of the sequels or \\"prequels\\" had yet been thought of.The original \\"Foundation\\" trilogy is written in a style that may seem quaint or even prim in comparison to the baroque convolutions found in some novels of the '90s. And, at the time, one reviewer had trouble with the episodicity: \\"The bare bones show.\\" On the other hand, many readers find those early Asimov stories to be quite refreshing.If I had to choose, I would rate \\"Foundation\\" as the best of the entire series. Outside the \\"Foundation\\" series, I think \\"Caves of Steel\\" is his very best, closely followed by \\"Pebble in the Sky,\\" although, as Asimov himself said, the latter was written at a time when almost nothing was known about the hazards of nuclear radiation.Some critics have questioned the logic in Hari Seldon's \\"psychohistory.\\" Deterministic as it is, how can Asimov's clever heroes count for much in the grand scheme of things? Perhaps, in some as yet unwritten novel, \\"psychohistory\\" will be revealed to be a kind of secular religion where the mathematical trappings are a faade behind which a happy few labor heroically to save the galaxy."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"Although Asimov's Foundation Trilogy is over 40 years old, his overall writing is still top notch. There's just something about it that draws you in, and then you can't put the book down. Unfortunately, many people get unhappy when they read this first book alone.

By use of the science of Psycho-History of which he represents the apex, Seldon atempts to establish the foundation, and reach beyond the grave to shape the forces of the future, but to what end? Sort of a stripped down Dune, it reads like a Steinbek re-write of The Scarlet Letter. With religious, psychological and political intrigue, Foundation and its subsequent works are the perfect stepping stone to Herbert's monumental series. If you like epic tales that span centuries in scope and content you'll enjoy this book and its companions. With short chapters and smoth flow it's perfect for the commuter or busy reader, and is a must for those who want a grouding in classic sci-fi."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"An excellent science fiction novel, probably one of the best ever written.

I read all 296 pages in less than 12 hours. This book is so much better than more modern sci-fi (for the difference between SF and sci-fi, see Isaac Asimov Gold) because it actually has a story, rather than a colection of all the stupidity the author could think of. This book is the best book I've ever read."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"The Good Doctor himself was a genius and the Foundation series is the best parts of that genius. Foundation is interesting, believable, funny, and loveable. Perhaps its greatest feature is that this book makes you think. You can spend hours just thinking about the concept of psychohistory. I cannot reccomend this book and the other Foundation novels more. This is pure science fiction at its greatest. You must read this or be forever deprived."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"This book was hilarious. I read it yesterday, and I am still laughing my Asimov. Get it? Hahahaha. Huh. Okay.

It wasn't quite as gripping as some other books, but after I read it the first time (and every time after) I felt changed. It is very. The other books in the series aren't as good, but they still are very interesting. I recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"This is the first of the three novels in the original \\"Foundation Trilogy\\". The trilogy is similar to \\"I, Robot\\", in that the novels are created out of shorter fiction that was first published in \\"Astounding Science Fiction\\" in the 1940's. It was first published in novel form by Gnome Press in 1951. A trimmed down version was published under the title \\"The 1,000 Year Plan\\" by Ace books in the 1950s.While certainly a classic and important to setup the series, \\"Foundation\\" is easily the weakest of the three novels. Consisting of five parts, four of which are taken from the shorter fiction from years before, it covers a large period of time in a relatively short amount of space. In addition, the stories are fairly short, and it is rare for a character to appear in more than one. As a result, there is little in the way of character development in this book. The subsequent novels (\\"Foundation And Empire\\" and \\"Second Foundation\\") are each comprised of just two works of shorter fiction, and thus do not suffer as much in this area.The sections of \\"Foundation\\" are:\\"The Psychohistorians\\" - This is the story of Gaal Dornick who has come to the capital of the Empire, Trantor to work with Hari Seldon. This story introduces the key concepts of the series; introducing the reader to Psychohistory, the Empire, and the purpose of the Foundation. It is unique among the sections of this book, in that it was written specifically for the novel and was not published previously.\\"The Encyclopedists\\" - In this story, the Foundation becomes separated from the Empire, and is threatened by its neighbors, the Anacreonians. It is in this story that the citizens of the Foundation find out their real purpose, having believed before that they were sent there to create a Galactic Encyclopedia to preserve man's knowledge. This was first published in part as the novelette \\"Foundation\\" in \\"Astounding Science Fiction\\" in May of 1942.\\"The Mayors\\" - This story is closely tied to \\"The Encyclopedists\\", and there are some of the same characters. Once again the Foundation is threatened by the Anacreonians; however, this time the Foundation uses its technological expertise to avert the crisis. This story also introduces the use of \`Priests' to spread the influence of the Foundation. This was first published as the novelette \\"Bride and Saddle\\" in the June 1942 edition of \\"Astounding Science Fiction\\".\\"The Traders\\" - This story is about the use of trade to expand the influence of the Foundation. More specifically, it is about an agent of the Foundation who has been imprisoned on Askone, a planet that prohibits the use of the Foundation's devices. This was first published in the October 1944 edition of \\"Astounding Science Fiction\\" as the short story \\"The Wedge\\".\\"The Merchant Princes\\" - This is a more complicated and involved story than the others included in this book. A merchant trader, Hober Mallow, goes in search of several missing Foundation ships, discovering evidence of the old Empire. More important though, is the struggle for power within the Foundation which results in the abandonment of religion in favor of economics as the source of expanding the influence of the Foundation. This was first published as the novelette \\"The Big And The Little\\" in the August 1944 edition of \\"Astounding Science Fiction\\".The trilogy has been recognized by readers and critics alike over the years. In 1952, it was rated as the 15th best book overall by the Astounding/Analog All-Time Poll. It moved up to 12th on the same poll in 1956, and then to 1st in 1966. In 1975 it was ranked 6th on the Locus poll for All-Time Novels. In 1987 it was 6th on the same poll for SF Novels. In 1998 it was ranked 4th on the same poll for novels before 1990. It also received the 1966 Hugo for All-Time Series, beating out Tolkien's \\"The Lord Of The Rings\\", Smith's \\"Lensman\\", Heinlein's \\"Future History\\", and Burroughs' \\"Barsoom\\" series for the award."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"I think asimov truly showed his ability in Foundation and Empire. Whether or not Foundation was better is debatable. But to create 2 knockout novels is pure gift. All the people who say it is bad are wrong. they say you should read a classic. It is a classic! A modern classic! the series deserves a place among Dune and other SF greats. The Mule was stroke of genius. The surprise ending was wonderful. whatever they charge you for this it is a deal."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"I recently read Foundation, all I can say is Wow!. First let me say this is not STAR WARS and it isn't STAR TREK, This is what Science Fiction is all about. Truly epic in every sense of the word, Foundation offers us a window into a future so far away Earth is forgotten completly. And like any good epic, their is no main character, instead the story is a series of short stories. Each story features new characters and plots decades, sometimes centuries apart. The best part of this book is that its only part one! I can't recommend this book enough! If you consider yourself a serious Sci-Fi fan then get this book today."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"Foundation and Empire is the second of the original Foundation trilogy written in the 1950s. The first book is Foundation and the last is Second Foundation. I enjoyed Foundation but I liked F&E; quite a bit more! Foundation consists of five disconnected short stories, too short for adequate development of the settings or characters. F&E; is much more focused, containing only two stories, the second of which really impressed me.A quick refresher on the background: The psychohistorian Hari Seldon was able to mathematically foresee the future of human society in the Milky Way. It wasn't pretty. Socio-economic forces were to cause the total collapse of the Trantorian Empire and lead to 30,000 years of anarchy and barbarism before a new empire restored peace and order. However, Seldon saw an \\"alternate path\\" that could reduce the duration of the Dark Ages to a single millennium. He established two societies (called Foundations) to bring this change about.In Foundation, we learn how the fledgling First Foundation established itself after Seldon's death and how it grew powerful. In F&E;, Seldon is long dead and the First Foundation faces much more serious threats: a war with the dying but still powerful Trantorian Empire and a war with a mutant leader called The Mule who possesses incredible powers. The part about the war with the Empire is a straightforward narrative with a couple interesting twists. The second part about The Mule takes place a few decades later and is written in the style of a mystery, sort of like the first two Robot novels.Since The Mule is an individual of extraordinary power, Seldon's psychohistorical predictions for the First Foundation are in jeopardy because they deal only with masses of people and large scale socio-economic forces. Hence the second part is a more exciting read. :-) Also, until the end of the second part the Second Foundation is a mysterious society on the other side of the Galaxy about whom we know next to nothing. Although I guessed the nature of The Mule's powers, I did not guess his identity and it was a great surprise for me when it was revealed at the end. The events of the last two chapters are stunning and really make you want to rip into the third book. Yet F&E; doesn't end on a cliffhanger and is quite satisfying in and of itself. This unique blend is a testament to Asimov's genius as an author. Also, you'll learn why the mutant calls himself The Mule and it's quite enlightening!With novels written later, Asimov tied together three series into one huge one! I recommend reading the entire 14-book series in the following order: the four Robot novels, the three Empire novels, and the seven Foundation novels (the original trilogy plus two prequels and two sequels). So far I've yet to read the last three Foundation books (Second Foundation, Foundation's Edge, Foundation and Earth), but so far most have been excellent and all have been well above average."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"As in Foundation, this is actually not a single story. Here are presented two separate episodes in the development of the Foundation toward the establishment of the Second Galactic Empire.The first details the encounter between the growing Foundation and the still-very-powerful Empire. At the forefront is an Imperial General of outstanding ability and charisma. Unfortunately, Hari Seldon, the architect of the Foundation, predicted all this with his psychohistorical calculations. While the general is very successful in his opposition to the Foundation, his very nature ensures his downfall.The second story is quite ingenious, in that the single large failing of Seldon's psychohistory is brought to light. An individual beyond the predictive nature of psychohistory has appeared and done the impossible. While there is a type of mystery presented, Asimov either wanted the reader to know the answer before the characters, or he didn't try very hard to obscure the nature of things. But this is a crucial moment in the Foundation's development, as they seem to be vulnerable after all. This story depends heavily on a plot element present in all the Robot-Empire- and now Foundation Series: psionic abilities. Clearly this was a favorite concept for Asimov, and he never seems to abuse it; that is, it never seems there for its own sake but always represents a fundamental encounter when it appears, and you can bet there are severe ramifications.While I have noted a few complaints about the second of these two stories, this book is still very well written, with action and suspense as good as any I've read. Asimov did such a wonderful job crafting this future history that I can only applaud having had the pleasure to read it. If you like S-F, you will love this whole series, chosen as the Best Series Ever Hugo winner. Need I say more?"},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"When Isaac Asimov was writing at his best, he was the one of the best science fiction writers to ever heft a typewriter.He wrote the orginal short stories to make up the Foundation novels in the 1940's for John W. Campbell's Astounding Science Fiction Magazine. In large messure, he modelled the history in the stories after the fall of the Roman Empire.Hari Seldon, Salvor Hardin, Hober Mallow are names that stand in the history of Science Fiction like the names of real people in many ways. &quot;Violence is the last resort of the incompetent&quot; and &quot;Never let your morals get in the way of doing what is right&quot; are quotes that every reader of SF knows well.Only names like Jubel Harshaw and David Bowman (who came to life from the pens of Robert Heinlein and Arthur C. Clarke) rank with these characters created by Isaac Asimov. I'm not positive if this is the best SF/F novel ever written, but it definitely makes the top five list of best SF novels ever written.It is a great loss to the world that Asimov slipped off his mortal coil back in 1992. His writting is great. At least we still have his books."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"The key to enjoying the original Foundation trilogy is to understand that the three novels which make up the \\"trilogy\\" are not really novels. They are a series of interconnected stories written over time. Foundation is actually 5 short stories. Because of this the stories vary in quality.The second book, Foundation and Empire is actually two stories. The first is called The General, and tells the story of the empire's last ditch effort to conquer the foundation. The weakness of the first story is that all the action takes place off page. We never see any of the actual combat, we just read the characters talking about it. Also, the resolution comes way too quickly. It feels like Asimov had reached his page limit and decided to end the story as quickly as he could.The second story, called The Mule, is the real draw here. All the previous stories presented a challege for the foundation to overcome. However, it was always expected that the foundation would triumph based on the long term scientific predictions of its founder. The Mule throws in a variable that was not predicted. The appearance of a mutant who swiftly moves to conquer the various planets left in the wake of the old empire's collapse. Ultimately, he sets his sights on the foundation. The best part of the story is a visit to the ruins of the planet Trantor. Former capital of the galactic empire.Having finished this second book, I have come to realize that the Foundation trilogy, while entertaining is certainly not Asimov's best work. Time is not always kind to science fiction and all of these early stories were written before 1950, when Asimov was still a young writer. I plan to continue on to the next book, but I no longer expect to be overwhelmed by the classic status these stories have achieved."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"The original Foundation series was released as a series of three books: Foundation, Foundation & Empire, and Second Foundation, in 1951, 1952, and 1953, respectively. Some datedness to this series is to be expected, but I've read SF stories written 40 years after these that felt more dated, and personally I think the concept, the sweeping distant future galactic empire Asimov writes, far outweighs any datedness one might expect. So much so, that for serious science fiction readers this series is almost essential reading. Not essential in that you *have to*, nothing kills interest faster than making it some classroom prerequisite to SF, but more in that it would be hard to consider that you wouldn't find some aspect of this series worthwhile at least and absolutely fascinating at best. Several reviewers had said that this trilogy is really a series of shorter novellas that were published earlier thus leading to some incohesiveness. Until a few days ago, I wasn't aware of that and when I read this series and discussed with friends afterwards that never came up. This is a sweeping series, where if an *only* 1000 year dark age is the *best* case scenario, you realize that a lot of time may have to be covered leading to chronological jumps.The idea of psychohistory is a fascinating concept and I haven't seen anyone else really copy it. With that said, it could also be considered a far fetched concept. To predict the history of a huge civilization statistically, albeit in large numbers to offset individuality, but still made up the most irrational entities in the known universe, human beings, is pushing credibility. But that's what also makes this a powerful concept as well. This idea has also been considered in the United States, for what else, economic theory. Statistically there had been too many variables, basically risk. Then in the 80's some economic theorists came upon the concept of eliminating the variable of risk, by forming a mutual fund of as many diverse economic sources as possible. The more the better (like Seldon's the larger the group of people the better) because any worldwide effect causing one economic segment to go down would be offset by some other economic segment that wouldn't. This concept was considered revolutionary and massive amounts of money were poured into this mutual fund from numerous financial institutions. And it worked and paid off well... for a while. But like the Mule of the book series, the theory couldn't account for a single element that would take a large segment of the economy with it. In this case, it was the financial meltdown of the Asian economy that was so sweeping, it took down so many markets that this mutual fund plummeted. So many institutions had poured money into the fund that the US government actually had to help bail it out, because it's collapse threatened the US economy and possibly the entire world economy. (PBS did a fascinating documentary on the events.) So the theory of psychohistory is difficult to consider viable, but is still a fascinating theory and the inventor of it in the series, Hari Seldon, is the Albert Einstein of the empire and is successful at it. Until, that is, a powerful individual comes along, The Mule, which the theory cannot account for and the Seldon Plan fails. The Seldon Plan is so visionary at first that every once in a while long after his death, a prerecorded holographic speech of Seldon would occur stating would should be occurring in the universe at that time and indeed it is occurring. The Foundation realizes they're in big trouble when, after the emergence of The Mule, Seldon returns in one of his recorded messages and the events of the time isn't what he predicted. Asimov writes this section brilliantly.Thus Seldon had secretly instituted a Second Foundation (which is essentially a Backup Plan). I cannot call myself an Asimov fan. I don't really care for his robot series in general and the endings of Asimov's novels tend to be anticlimactic. But with the Foundation series he turns this into an advantage. The final book of the series deals with the confrontation with the Second Foundation. By this time the reader is aware of the power of the Second Foundation and thus the confrontation doesn't need to be with laser pistol or light saber, and is over in minutes. What a brilliant conclusion.I've considered the original Foundation trilogy a stand-alone series. Asimov's Foundations Edge, written 30 years later, is different as to be expected. Since the Foundation series was sufficiently concluded (and stood for 30 years), Foundation's Edge has to add a new element and I've always mentally considered it the Third Foundation. The entire Foundation series is now a seven book series (septology?) and some might say that the post-trilogy novels have corrupted the original series. If you decide to read on, Foundation's Edge is a good book, and did win the 1983 Hugo Award, deservedly so, it helps to keep in mind the real-world chronological differences between the two."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"Recently, I picked up a copy of the first book in Issac Asimov's Foundation series, for which this review is written. I will not spoil the book in this review as some others have done.The theme was quite interesting. Essentially, one man somewhat manipulates humanity into protecting its knowledge and creative abilities by setting them apart from the &quot;masses&quot;, so that they can weather the coming dark ages. The great joke of this book is that Asimov almost makes it seem as if history is pushed forward by the &quot;masses&quot; themselves but in reality, his apparent humanism and rationality comes through as he shows that it is always the &quot;individual&quot; who in the end can save or destroy humanity.If you are a man (or woman) who cares about how ideas move history, if you believe in the sanctity of the individual, if you love life, then this is a book for you.Asimov is a man of reason and he shows it well throughout this first, in what I hope to be an excellent sci-fi series. Often times, contemporary authors infuse their lack of values into their books and characters, making one wonder who one should be rooting for. Asimov paints a clear picture of the values within man that make him worthy of praise (or not) - reason, justice and a love of life.This book can proudly stand side by side with Ayn Rand's Anthem and Orwell's 1984 as a warning to society about the dangers of the &quot;irrational&quot; in all its glorious forms."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"One of the BEST science fiction books I've ever read, as written by one of the best science fiction authors to live, Foundation is a wonderful look into a completely different universe than our own.Foundation is based on a community of planets who have formed and Empire- A large collective society... One mathematician claims that it will collapse into the dark ages, and take 10,000 years to recover and rebuild... The foundation is formed in an attempt to reduce that time to 1,000 years by maintaining the knowledge of the present. While acting as a terrific science fiction setting and story, Foundation also serves as a very deep look into society as a whole, and how predictable a society is. The social implications of each major crisis as it occurs is aptly predicted and accounted for, which proves largely entertaining and intriguing...This is a must read for any science fiction fan, historian, or sociologist... It's well written and imaginative with engaging ideas and concepts true only to Asimov."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"This novel, the first in a (50's) series of three, has not dated one bit since its first appearance. Like The Lord of the Rings, it should really be read in combination with its sequels, but the book contains its own strong moments, especially the first section on Trantor. I was amazed and moved by the cleverness of Asimov's plots, something he is of course well-known for. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"If you had bothered to read the entire series, you would know that one of the major heroes in the book is a young girl, Arkady. In fact, once the Foundation books tie in with the Robot series, you will find another woman hero, the &quot;mother of robotics&quot;, Dr. Susan Calvin. So your comment about the &quot;deplorable&quot; lack of women in the Foundation books is off the mark. And the characters are not poorly developed - what you learn about characters like the Mule is staggering - but you wouldn't know that because it is in the second book. I hope you don't do this with all literature - try getting the facts first, then give an honest opinion. You will be well respected for it, even if most people disagree with you."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"The first book in Asimov's Foundation Series is actually an anthology of stories tracing the formation of the Foundation to its growth into a competitor of the Galactic Empire. The premise is simple, its execution complex: the Galactic Empire has started to decay even though the Empire itself denies the truth. Hari Seldon is a psychohistorian whose mathematical theories of historical psychology have allowed him to determine when the Empire will crumble and the probabilities of the aftermath. To avoid a Dark Age, he sets up the Foundation at the outer edge of the galaxy to preserve the knowledge of humanity. The stories in Foundation deal with the formative years of the Foundation and its growth from an (outwardly) academic's and historian's interest into a power on (and behind) the galactic stage guiding humanity's redevelopment.Cleverly written and plotted with quick-moving events and the interesting theory that humanity's future for hundreds and thousands of years can be predicted based on probable outcomes. This is the foremost intellectual, yet generally accessible, science fiction series ever written. The lone drawback is that Asimov did not finish it before he died."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"I am making my way through the original Foundation trilogy for the third time now, and I'm still gaining new appreciation for it. Fifty years after it first appeared, Asimov's Foundation series can still justifiably be called a classic. A clear influence on the Star Wars saga, and probably Star Trek as well, along with a large chunk of all science fiction that has come since. Sure there are a few things to quibble about with this series, and with this first book in particular. Asimov's vision of the distant future, with its nuclear reactors, microfilm communications, and picture phones, all seems ridiculously quaint today. As the story blasts through several decades, interchangeable characters come and go without making much of an impression, and this first book is so obviously part of a trilogy that it doesn't have a chance of standing on its own. But that's not the point, and by focusing on these quibbles you're missing the forest for the trees. Here Asimov has created a tremendous masterpiece of the imagination that is larger in scope than just about any other literary creation. The saga is built around the intriguing concept of psychohistory, in which the movements of huge masses of people can be accurately predicted over thousands of years (while it is still impossible to predict the actions of any one person). An ossifying empire, obviously based on the Roman Empire in its death throes, is on the verge of horrific collapse when the Foundation is created to subtly change the course of history behind the scenes, and gradually rises to prominence and tries to usher in a new golden age. The entire saga (not just this first book) takes place over a thousand years across a whole galaxy, while Asimov believably incorporates a full palate of psychology, politics, and sociology to lend the story credence. Still a masterpiece after all these years."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"Disclaimer: I am judging this book as a standalone piece of work.Isaac Asimov's Foundation is the first of a series that would eventually be considered a cornerstone of the Sci-Fi genre. While it is certainly a solid piece of work, I don't quite understand how it is deserving of such praise. In my opinion, it suffers from an abundance of poor storytelling techniques, which reduce what is a great concept to a finished product that left me feeling empty. In fact, I struggled to finish the final pages, nearly racing through it solely for the sake of completion. I have rarely, rarely done this before. I'll start with the good aspects along with plot setup type-stuff first, and then finish with the overwhelmingly bad.The ideas and concepts behind Foundation are wonderful. The basis of the book is the work of Hari Seldon, the master practitioner of a discipline called psychohistory. If executed correctly, psychohistory has the ability to predict behavior of human beings thousands and thousands of years in advance through a combination of many disciplines, including mathematics, statistics, and psychology. It is, in essence, what modern day economics aspires to be. Being an economics major who currently works in the field, I found this to be highly compelling. In fact, it was from a blog post suggestion by Paul Krugman that I picked the book up in the first place.A bit more of the plot: Hari Seldon, the well-known psychohistorian, seeks to avoid an extended Dark Age, a period of 30,000 years in which barbarism runs rampant and tons of information is lost. His work in psychohistory leads to the establishment of the Foundation, which send ripples through the universe and ultimately attempts to shape its fate for the better. Hari Seldon is the first of a string of highly intelligent characters you'll meet, and Foundation is saturated with clever and thought-provoking dialogue amongst these characters. This, unfortunately, is where the good stuff ends.To say that this book is saturated with dialogue is a vast understatement. This book is 95% dialogue and it is the vehicle through which the story is told. This, I found to be abysmal. Even with an omniscient narration technique at hand, rare are the thoughts of characters, their descriptions, or an inkling of the settings on which these dialogues are taking place. One of the largest structural weakness of this storytelling style is that Asimov must infuse important details into his conversations. The problem with this is that these are details that would never come up in normal conversation. Thus, they come off as very awkward and ultimately serve to cheapen the dialogue. Not being able to get into the minds of characters leaves too much unsaid, which is the part of the cause of every section having the same structure: Person A is the plotter, Person B is the questioner. Person A knows something that Person B doesn't, Person B continually questions Person A about his plans, which all finally ends with a \\"Don't you see?\\" moment by Person A in which he explains his elaborately constructed conspiracy to Person B. This is the essence of every single section. By the time you get to the end, nothing is unexpected.And worse still, every single character is similar (except for one, who speaks with an accent and makes for a very comical section of the book). They are all intelligent, but not wholly different. Their lack of physical descriptions and thoughts serve to make them feel like the same lifeless replica of one another. The nature of the story, which causes there to be major gaps in time, make this even more egregious because just as you are getting used to one character, his section ends and a new character has replaced him. I felt zero emotion for these characters. As for the setting, this universe is not a living, breathing world. It is merely the outline of one, a skeleton of what could have been something magnificent. This bothers me. I am confident when I say that this book would have been absolutely stunning if Asimov had included 100 pages more of thoughts, descriptions, and settings.Some other small gripes: Asimov is prone to overusing adverbs, usually considered a literary sin. Foundation also has not aged well in terms of technology, as Asimov really misses on a lot of advancements that it seems other Sci-Fi authors were able to catch. I do not take any points off off this review for that, however, because the predictions he did make were far better than any I could have ever fathom, and I commend him in that regard. All I'm saying is that these misses, relative to other authors, aren't helping."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"The Foundation saga is one of the most widely-known sci-fi series ever published. Started in the 1940's with this book, Foundation, Asimov continued the series up through the 1980's, at which point he was being basically threatened by fans to continue writing to satiate their reading interest.Foundation's setting is in the far-future, when planets have not only been discovered and colonized, but millions of planets have been organized into a Galactic Empire that spans thousands os star systems. Hyper-industry and nuclear power form the core to this civilization, which seems to have an endless grasp on the future of civilization.That is, until Hari Seldon, a scientist, discovers the science of psychohistory, by which future events can be predicted based on calculations of human behavior. He foresess the collapse of the Empire based on inevitable social, political, and economic forces. He devises a plan to save humankind from an imminent dark age by instituting a scientific Foundation at the edge of the galaxy.This premise is what drew me to the read the book. What exciting prospects! The opportunity to plumb the mind of the genous Hari Seldon. To get a closer look at this Galactic Empire, whose proportions were mindboggling. To understand, at a more nuts and bolts level, this &quot;psychohistory.&quot; To see what Hari Seldon has up his sleeve.Unfortunately, though the book provides an historical fiction that encompasses 300 years of life after Hari Seldon, and introduces leaders of his Foundation that are memorable for their nerve and intellect, some of the imaginative possibilities, such as most of those mentioned above, are not fully realized. I am not sure if they are realized in other books of the series, but I guess that's for someone else to comment on.Foundation came to me highly recommended. I am not new to science fiction, but I have not read that much of this genre. I was looking forward to something that would really blow my mind away. Though I admired several things about the book and thought it was a nice read, I am not going to read the other books in this series. Coming away from this book, I felt it was good, but not much more. There were several ways in which I clearly found the book to be lacking in addition to the brevity of focus on Hari, a good discussion of psychohistory, or much emphasis on the Galactic Empire.Though Asimov's style is surely concise and highly readable, he views plot as the central element to his writing, at the expense of other aspects of great fiction that really should have been incorporated. I will outline these at length because it appears that the book's praises are already sung widely.First, there is not much character development. Characters are presented merely to accomplish a historical event in the flow of the story. We get a feel for the characters not as real people, but as actors on the stage of world history. Though the reader admires the nerve and intellect behind each of these heroes (there are 5 heroes that are portrayed in the generation following Hari), there is little else that makes them interesting. While this kind of presentation of characters may work in movie adaptations or history textbooks, I like to view my characters as a little more than men-at-work. Everybody is always scheming, there's not much downtime or description of what day-to-day life is like with these guys so far in the future, such far-off planets. The dialogue is great, though, and that's part of the reason the book is a quick read.Secondly, there is a lack of real meaning or symbolism that defines great books. There's not much refelction on the part of the narrator, or poignancy. The closest we get to intrinsic meaning is the interesting description of the false religion that a protagonist, Salvor Hardin, invents in order to undermine the economy of a neighboring state. Religion is also used to manipulate other planets. Hard to swallow, this helps us understand what the author probably thinks about organized religion. The book is also full of cute phrases that portray the all-importance of technology in Asimov's future: characters say things like, &quot;What in the name of space?&quot; or &quot;Thank space!&quot; The all-importance of nuclear energy also seems like propaganda to get ther reader to &quot;understand&quot; how important it will be in our era, with no attention paid to other kinds of fascinating technology that may exist in the future, such as super-intellect, robotics, biotechnology, etc. Not only are technology and politics the deepest material this book touches, but even the technology the book introduces is not very interesting. With the exception of his brilliant description of the mother planet Trantor, the only thing different between this far off future and nowadays is the ability to jump through space.Thirdly, romance does not play a role in the book. There are no women in the book, which means there can be no romantic intrigue, or world events influenced by a woman. Also in the true spirit of what the word &quot;romance&quot; conveys, there is no sense of wonder and excitement that a reader surely hopes to get when they enter an author's imagination. The landscape of these far-off worlds is sparesly and hardly described. We spend much of our time in staterooms. Though, admittedly, Asimov's grasp of political personalities is astounding.On the other hand, if you like books that are centered on brilliant leaders of nation-states and how their decisions affect the course of history, you will like this book. If you are fascinated by the economic, political, and sociological macroforces that shape history, you will like this book. If you're more about the game and the moves than the players, you will like this book."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"I know I'll take some major heat in saying this, but I wasn't that impressed with this beloved classic. Oh, the idea intrigues me, surely, that of humankind eons in the future existing across the galaxy on a multitude of worlds, so far removed from earth that eminent masters of science themselves debate whether earth was even the planet where human life began, but once the dust settled from an idea that lofty, what did Asimov really DO with it? He used it for unexciting little tales of science v. military might. I love the parallel between the fall of this vast space empire and the fall of Rome. The way bands of scientists struggled in a dark age to keep the light of knowledge alive was thought-provoking (which is high praise in my lexicon) but this was backdrop, and the plot Asimov employed in telling the story of all this was (sorry to say) dull, slow, simple, and unworthy of the imaginative concepts he thought up in his setting for this tale of knowledge overcoming strength of arms. I haven't read the later Foundation novels, so maybe they're the ones where the brilliance of the series exists, but I found this book from Sci-Fi's golden age so demanding on my patience that I didn't finish it the first time I tried to read it and barely made it to the end the second time. I wish I shared the glowing praise for this classic that millions of others claim they feel, but to be honest, I just don't."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"Foundation is great science fiction for the scientific minded, no deus ex machina here. The only fault I find with this 1st book is that the 3 main characters are exactly the same person. Seldon, Salvor Hardin and Hober Mallow are the exact same character. All calm, cool and collected. Perfectly confident and perfectly logical. No difference in dialogue and problem solving skills, you wouldn't be able to tell from Asimov's writing that these characters are from different time periods and are from different cultures. For that matter, every character in the book seems to be of the same culture and dialect. I realize Asimov uses a minimalist style of writing, like Hemmingway, there are good and bad sides to this. No fleshing out of characters has to be considered weakness in Asimov's writing. It may have made for a longer book, but his characters would have been better served if they all didn't behave as robots."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"Isaac Asimov is one of the few popular science fiction writers whose fame is derived mostly from his intriguing story line and character interactions as oppose to pure imaginative science. In fact, given that this series takes place 50,000 years into the future, one could easily argue that its incredibly short sighted given how little science has evolved; yet this detracts very little from just how entertaining this book and the series is. Asimov is a fantastic writer in terms of creating intrigue, wit, and believable dialog, and the result is he has developed a very enjoyable series.Foundation is the first book of the original three that Asimov wrote in the Foundations series, and although the series is now quite a collection of books with some even taking place before the period of this book, Foundation still represents a terrific point to enter the series. The premise is that a science exists that is able to predict the downfall of an empire that ruled the galaxy for 20,000 years, and as a result a foundation (two in fact) is set up to ultimately shorten the period of anarchy that will result in the empire's downfall. This of course leaves open plenty of intriguing possibilities and Asimov does not disappoint.Asimov is very straight forward in his writing and leaves little open to interpretation. He has often been criticized for this style, yet in place of open ended complexities the book contains a quality that fully immerses its readers and satisfies them with clear and definitive answers. Reading the foundation novels is somewhat akin reading a history book that that highlights specific elements of importance. This style may not appeal to everyone, but once you are engrossed in the story line you will find it hard to put this book down (as well as many others in the series).***For those new to the series, here are the specific seven books tied directly into the Foundation story line and their original date of publication. I read these in the order they were published and was very happy to have chosen that order. Asimov also tied in some of this other book series into this one (specifically his Robot series) thus making the entire story line a much larger volume of books.Prelude to Foundation (1988)Forward the Foundation (1993)Foundation (1951)Foundation and Empire (1952)Second Foundation (1953)Foundation's Edge (1982)Foundation and Earth (1986)"},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"Foundation is a classic of the Sci-Fi genre, and that is nearly everything you need to know. If you like Sci-Fi, and are willing to put up with some of it's common shortcomings, this book will appeal greatly to you, for it truly deserves its place in the Sci-Fi canon."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"Foundation and Empire is the second book in this series. If you have not read the first one yet, you should. Still, because of the rare and very clear writing found here, you can read this book and never be confused. Since both books are so good, why skip the first one?In this book, we return to the future. A small empire, the Foundation, is on the edges of a greater one. The &quot;Empire&quot; currently encompasses thousands of worlds. Still, compared to its past, it has been shrinking. One of its most able generals, aware that the Empire is less then it once was, decides to expand the Empire. Unfortunately for the Foundation, he has choosen the systems occured by it, as the best direction for his expansion.Like the first installation, this book continually talks about the &quot;inevitable&quot; victory of the Foundation. Since they are being systematically destroyed by the Empire, such predictions ring hollow. How the book solves this problem seems to make sense. But this war is only the prelude for a greater conflict - a Civil War in the Foundation itself.Here is a really interesting dilemena. Since the Foundation is &quot;fated&quot; to survive, what will happen if it wars with itself? And, to make things more interesting, a third party joins the conflict. This mysterious entity, the &quot;Mule&quot;, leads forces that beats both foundations back. What is happening here?Again, like the first book in this series, Foundation and Empire is as much a mystery story, as science fiction. How the author solves these problems are great fun. The ending, actually the middle of the book, is a great surprise on your first read. What happens afterwards, and the new developments, make for a great twist to this story and a powerful new development in this series. A great story. It is great fun and easily as enjoyable as the first book which, on its own, was a classic. Read and enjoy."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"&quot;The Foundation&quot; by Isaac Asimov is a very thrilling science fiction book. This book takes place so far into the future that they do not know which planet humans came from! This book spans over 160 years and shows the developments of the Foundation. The Foundation is a group of people sent to a remote planet to preserve information and to secretly start a new empire. When the old Galactic Empire begins to crumble, Hari Seldon starts the Foundation. He and his followers work on an encyclopedia to help shorten the barbarian age that results from the destruction of the empire. Seldon's true plan for the Foundation is to raise the next empire that would control the galaxy. As the book continues, the Foundation grows and tries to spread their beliefs across the galaxy. Powerful neighbors become jealous and try to conquer the foundation and destroy it. The Foundation wins usually using non violent means unlike their violent foes. When the Foundation starts to conquer the other surrounding worlds, they expand and send out traders. Traders hold the Foundation together and keep up the economy by trading with the inhabitants and bringing them the Foundation's beliefs. Much of the galaxy is unaware of the Foundation's secrets and the power it holds! This book is divided into five sections, starting at different time periods with new characters and conflicts. The beginning of each section is difficult until you learn the new characters. However, the books flows well since the ideas of people in the past sections are presented in each new section as historically important. Each section is exciting with descriptive characters and a suspenseful plot. The book is a fast read, written for pure enjoyment and entertainment. It does a terrific job of both. I would highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for a good book."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"Prelude to Foundation describes the young mathematician Hari Seldon's flight from an entrenched galactic bureaucracy bent on destroying him and what he represents - a threat to the established political order.Foundation opens with Hari Seldon having successfully escaped his old enemies, and having refined his new mathematical theory of statistically predictable human behavior (modeled on similarly ponderous equations of statistical mechanics): \\"Psychohistory\\".Already old but still intellectually formidable, Seldon deftly masters the waning political intrigues still seeking his life. His new project is development of a galactic knowledge repository (similar to the Great Library of Alexandria or the US National Archives) where all knowledge will be stored for future generations against the impending collapse of galactic civilization, (which Seldon's psychohistorical equations have predicted accurately). Building on his psychohistorical knowledge of the future, Seldon establishes two \\"Foundation\\" outposts in opposite and extremely remote corners of the galaxy. He does this with galactic government financial backing - ostensibly to create \\"dictionaries\\" - but the galactic government is only told of one of these Foundation outposts; the other outpost \\"is not on any of the star charts\\", (which becomes significant in later volumes of the Foundation tales).As usual, Asimov's poor ear for dialogue never gets in the way of his rich storytelling. These books are outstanding and a perfect introduction to science fiction.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"The Foundation novels of Isaac Asimov are the standard by which I judge all science fiction. The stories center around the mathmatical mechanics that allow for the prediction of the future in a statistcal manner- individual lives remain unaffected, but humanity's future can be charted and directed. All this comes to pass as the great galatic empire slowly but surely fades into chaos. Only Hari Seldon, creator of this science of prediction, can save the universe from a galatic dark age. The short stories contained in this volume set the stage for the rich universe that the other volumes fill and explore. This is the series that testifies to the genius of it's author and is perhaps his greatest legacy."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"The Galactic Empire is crumbling, and only one man can save the universe from chaos. That man is mathematician and historian Hari Seldon. To minimize the effects of the fall of the Empire, he sets up the Foundation, a group of people following his carefully laid plan to preserve the achievements of humanity. So begins the reader's journey through hundreds of years of history and turmoil, watching as Asimov paints his picture of the tiny Foundation and its struggle to keep Seldon's plan alive. Asimov's characters are first-rate, grabbing the reader's interest with their intelligence and charisma. The plot is solid and fascinating to watch as it unfolds, taking twists and turns, every one guaranteed to surprise. Originally published as four short stories, Foundation is the beginning of the classic science fiction epic, and is not to be missed by any sci-fi fan."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"Foundation is a must buy, by writing this Asimov opened a gateway for other science fiction writers, none, in my opinion who have been able to better him yet. Issic Asimov doesn't just give you one set time period but 5, jumping 50 years or so into the future, each one with rebelious and revolutionary characters, adding colour and flavour to a already brilliant plot. If this wasn't enough, and the books well worth reading for just for that you are introduced to a new kind of warfare- giving the enermy something that they want and become dependent on, then when they become too mencing.... well you can read it for yourself.

Subsequently I purchased and read multiple times, every Asimov sci-fi book. All but one of the Foundation Series I have in hard-cover in addition to paperback.Reading Asimov is for me a pleasure. How he wrote in conjunction with his rich and diverse use of English I have found unequalled.A must read without which the stage for the rest of Foundation remains unprepared.True it is not his best book, but how do you decide between Masters from The Master."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"Foundation has been called by science-fiction lovers all over the world as a cornerstone for science fiction. Isaac Asimov's all time best, this book tells the tale of the crumbling of the Galactic Empire and is only the beggining of a 7-book series. The way Asimov uses the analogy of the Fall of the Roman Empire has pleased readers for decades. Asimov tells the story of a planet alone at the edge of the galaxy awaiting a future already planned for it. Leaders struggle for the planets survival, for this planet, Terminus, holds the future of the Human Race in its hands. Isaac Asimov tells the thrilling tale of human survival in an environment that is against it."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"Few doubt the power of these novels, and no one mildly competent in the realm of science fiction would at all. I don't remember ever being so sucked in by any book or set of books before. I think that Foundation and Empire was the best of the set, with &quot;The Mule&quot; being the best single story of the nine-story set. This is Asimov in his purest form-- no pomp, no ornation, no flowery aspiration to a false literary quality; just plain, simple prose and story: a mix that earned this set the honor of Best Science Fiction series, an honor I believe is well deserved."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"I never would have made it through this book if I hadn't read the other foundation novels first. Because this was originally published in magazines, this book is very fragmented and hard to follow if you don't already know the story. Still, I love Asimov. This is just so early, he isn't excellent yet"},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"This book is the second in the original Foundation Trilogy. The first book was \\"Foundation,\\" which introduced us to Hari Seldon, psychohistory and Hari's plan to reduce 30,000 years of chaos to a mere 1,000 years. This book is two novelettes combined into one book, and tells how the Foundation struggles to survive against the remnants of the galactic empire and then against a mutant, whose coming Hari Seldon failed to predict.In the first part of this story we meet the General, Bel Riose. I enjoyed the story, but I kept getting the feeling that Bel Riose was being manipulated for most of the story. I assumed that Riose was being manipulated by the Foundation, though it was also possible that the Second Foundation, which we learn much more about in the second half of this book, was also manipulating Riose. In spite of my perceived lack of suspense as I waited for Riose's inevitable defeat, I did enjoy this half of the book while longing to get into the second half.In the second half of the book we meet a unique and unpredictable mutant called the Mule. The mutant is called the Mule for biological reasons. We also learn that the Mule was unpredicted by Hari Seldon. The Mule realizes that the Second Foundation is his only true nemesis as he quickly conquers the Foundation. The Mule follows the exploits of researchers as they seek, and find, the Second Foundation. How can the Second Foundation be discovered? Has the Second Foundation been discovered? Is Hari Seldon's plan truly out of control? The reader must move on to \\"Second Foundation\\" to learn these answers and more!I enjoyed the second part of this book immensely. I had to read about the Mule until I learned whether he had truly destroyed Seldon's plan. Unfortunately, I had to wait until the next book in the series to learn the truth, but I was still on the edge of my seat.This book carries on nicely from \\"Foundation.\\" If you liked that book you will enjoy seeing the challenges the Foundation faces as it tries to help create a future that remains hundreds of years away. This book is a worthy second book in the original Foundation Trilogy.The final book in the original Foundation Trilogy is \\"Second Foundation.\\"Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"Not surprisingly this is a second reading - I first enjoyed this classic about twenty years ago.There's much to enjoy. Or, rather, there's the central idea to enjoy: Asimov is generally at his best in short stories with a single \`what if' notion. What's unusual about Foundation is that he managed to successfully spin his workable \`psycho-historian' idea out into a (wisely short) novel. The series even kicked along OK for a while, but by the time we get to the dreadful fifth Foundation and Earth Asimov had spun out of control into event horizon of his ego.One way he gets away with a whole novel here is by basically telling the same story three times (only the character's names have been changed to protect the word count). Hari Seldon, Salvor Hardin and Hober Mallow are all puppet master politicians who keep their master-plans carefully hidden, pulling a clever rabbit out of a hat at the last minute to thwart their thug foes: I can't really remember who's motto was something like, \\"Violence is the last resort of the unintelligent,\\" but it works as well for any of them. The latter two are a bit annoying in their reiterated, \`Look, it's obvious how to solve this crisis - Seldon's plan means there's no other way', when it's no such thing, but the joy of fiction is never having to say your wrong. I mean, Asimov's quasi-Marxist political theory of historical progress is, at heart, flapdoodle, but he can have the fun constructing his universe to confirm his protagonists' convictions. We can have fun to: it's a nice idea competently realised.The leading men are arrogant, spurning or using public opinion with machiavellian disdain while they manipulate enemies with the same Trojan horse technique. Oh, and they are, of course, leading *men*: Asimov's SF futuristic orientation didn't stretch as far as women being any more than pantomime caricatures, if indeed they exist at all. His only female character is execrably predictable: vain, pretty and shrewish. People are basically divided into three groups: realists (successful scientists, businessmen and/or politicians); greedy amoral militaristic imperialists; and sheep."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"It had been quite some time since I had read Asimov, so I was relatively excited when I picked up Foundation. I was not disappointed in the least. This novel is an absolutely fabulous piece of psycho-political drama that is perhaps most enjoyable because of its suspenseful trill as well as its political/sociological considerations.The entire text, built on the theories of the fictional character Hari Seldon, is driven by the concept of psycho-history. This is primarily a form of mathematical sociology that allows for the statistical prediction of galactic masses, given a set of variables. As the Galactic Empire is beginning to crumble, Hari Seldon perceives this fall and takes the precautions to insure a quick return to a Second Empire. The development of his Plan spurs him to create two foundations at the ends of the galaxy to promote this return.This text chronicles the early founding and rise of the first foundation. Given the nature of psychohistory, most events unfold in such a way that a critical moment, at which the probability of success is nearly 100%, always arrives for solutions to the problems facing the foundation. This drives the story in a suspenseful manner, as Asimov pursues the interrelation of individual freedom and the \\"mob psychology\\" of psychohistory. The text is also an interesting exploration into the rise of power by a means of a variety of factors, concealed in this review for the sake of not spoiling the story.Foundation deserves the accolades of the Sci-Fi community and truly should be read by anybody who has any latent interest in science fiction or fantasy. It is an exciting, and fulfilling read."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"This is the unabridged audio cd version of Isaac Azimov's book foundation.

There really isn't a new plot, just new problems for the Foundation to deal with. Foundation and Empire is pretty good, but without the novelty of the new ideas presented in Foundation, it is a bit flat. About the only reason I could think of to recommend this book is so you can see what else happens to Seldon's colony."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"I first tried reading this book when I was 11. For me at the time, it seemed boring at that age, and I had trouble reading it. Next year, I picked up the book again, and couldn't stop reading it. Asimov sets up a realistic structure for how to contain millenias of combined information from across a galaxy, and build a stable, remote world to contain the falling Empire's scientific knowledge. But especially after reading the entire series, I always must ask, is psycho history scientifically possible? It states that the actions of an individual doesn't affect the flow of the universe. Later int he series though, you will learn of the mule that broke this rule, and even later after the trilogy, where he came from. But how could mathematics, and the general pschology of people,possibly predict when specific crisis's happen. Even though in Second Foundation, where the reader learns more about the second foundation, which is based not on science, but on pschohistory, helps maintain the course of the Foundation. You can get lost in thought trying to discover the possibilities psychohistory could bring, if it could work.????"},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"It is astonishing to realize that science fiction consisted of a relative humble portion of Isaac Asimov's ouevre. While most of his time was spent on nonfiction work, his contributions to science fiction proved so monumental that there is not a single science-fiction writer today who has not been influenced, in some way, by Asimov's writing. His intellectual and engaging fiction has produced some of the finest short stories and novels in the genre, in classics such as \\"The Last Question\\" and \\"Nightfall\\". But his seminal work is the top-of-the-pyramid, groundbreaking, and famous \\"Foundation Trilogy\\". He is to SF what Tolkien is for Fantasy.\\"Foundation\\" is an entertaining piece of sociopolitical SF in the backdrop of a space opera. This book is the foundation of SF for the past six decades. Asimov's prose is clear and concise, without any room for ambiguity or vain style. Asimov's words, though pared down and stripped of subtext, are not any less true or beautiful or witty.Set thousands of years in the future, after humanity has colonized millions of planets in our galaxy, \\"Foundation\\" introduces the Galactic Empire is in its waning years. One man on the capital planet of Trantor, Hari Seldon, predicts the cataclysmic and chaotic decline and fall of the Empire. Seldon has developed the science of psychohistory, which aims to calculate the behaviour of mass populations over the course of events using, among other things, socioeconomic trends. Seldon has predetermined not only the demise of the Empire, but that thirty millennia of barbarism will follow, unless his organization, the Foundation, is able to finish its gargantuan mission of cataloguing and preserving all accumulated human knowledge and history. The act would serve to lessen an inevitable thirty-thousand years to a mere thousand.Asimov portrays the epic grandeur of the galaxy through the unyielding arc of time and history. Individual lives are ineffectual, though not inconsequential, in the grand scheme of things. Throughout the stories, there is a pervading sense of \`greater good' or \`the bigger picture'. There is only one recurring character in each of the five tales: the Foundation. It stands in the background, an entity both mysterious and arresting; a godlike presence that shaped religion and ruled a city. The story of the Foundation is portrayed through the periodic snippets of human life throughout the growth of the First Foundation from an indefensible, dependent, colony in the backwaters of the outskirts of a great empire to a massive political juggernaut with commercial and technological prowess. The central characters: Hari Seldon, Gaal Dornick, Salvor Hardin, Linmar Ponyets, and Hober Mallow are seen in flashes as their importance and contribution to the longevity of the Foundation is waxes and wanes.Asimov has an arresting flair for conjuring up a methodical, articulate, and complex history. In the battle for free will over determinism, Asimov's \\"Foundation\\" falls securely into the side of the determinists. Psychology and economic trends and the insurmountable turn of time dominate the short stories with a sense of inevitability. But it the tone of the story is far from pessimistic. There is only ever the slightest indication that they should lose hope, or that individual lives are meaningless. As one character says, \\"Seldon's laws help those who help themselves.\\" Asimov appears to advocate forging a better future through the sole and collective action of the present.Unquestionably, \\"Foundation\\" is an intellectual treat that tends to emphasis the background scenes as opposed to the ones that illustrate more action. Most of the book is exposition and dialogues between characters in a meeting over smokes. The third story, The Mayors, provides the most exciting, and arguably cleverest, climactic confrontation in the book. It is a scene between Mayor Hardin and Prince Regent Wienis. Hardin, in a stroke of brilliance, has manipulated events to stave off a rival political party's attempt to impeach him and end the threat posed by the Four Kingdoms.\\"Foundation\\" is a significant to the genre in more ways than the ideas it challenged us with. It is the culmination of science fiction into a literature encompassing reason and ideas. It reinvigorated the genre and turned it into a platform of higher ideals and concepts. \\"Foundation\\" steered it away from the pulp swamp creatures. It did for science fiction what \\"Spiderman\\" (2002) did for superhero movies, or in particular, what Christopher Nolan's \\"Batman Begins\\" (2005) reboot did for the franchise. Asimov gives us excellent characters, complex sociopolitics, and a good story that never wanes."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"This book is far and beyond one of my favorite books of all time. Anyone who enjoys scifi must read this book."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"Foundation is an interesting technological/political science fiction. A very famous book, obviously. The Galactic Empire has lasted 12,000 years, but it is predicted by Hari Seldon, a genius scientist/psychologist/mathematician that the Empire will fall within 300 years. So he takes a large group of people to the distant planet of Terminius, to create the Encyclopedia Galatica, a book of knowledge. It won't save the Empire, but at least will prevent the world from falling into chaos for too long. At least, that's what I got from the purpose. The various parts of the book skip from generation to generation of people on Terminus, and their various political problems.The political element of Foundation was very interesting to me. I hadn't read much political science fiction before. I don't think the world was that well developed; there wasn't a lot of description of it, it was more focused on the various power-plays and intrigues going on. Also, the way that each part is a different time period was a little off-putting; I really would have liked to know more about Gaal Dornick and some of the other characters. But you can't really narrate 300 years of history without skipping many years. At first, I thought Gaal Dornick was going to be the protagonist. I was wrong.Anyway, Foundation was an intriguing science fiction with an interesting plot, and I'm certainly glad that I decided to read it.

The first book was required reading for a college SciFi literature course and I liked it so much I read the other two. They were my introduction to Isaac Asimov. Grand in its sweep, Foundation explores societal disintegration and renaissance. The trilogy is dated; Asimov wrote it before the computer revolution.

So I won't.This work takes you back in time so you can see the future, a future that is yet beyond tomorrow, in a different light than you can see it in today.A future visualized as having similar morals, social interaction and ideals based on and somewhat similar to those held by Americans of the past.A dark future, full of bright possibility."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"As the second book in the original three of the Foundation series, Isaac Asimov picks up with the last efforts of the Empire to root out the Foundation. Those familiar with the first of the original three in this series will recognize the characteristics of the first book in this one immediately; a mixture of science and technology with a lot of wit and intriguing conversation. The second half of the book introduces the Mule, a mutant that Hari Seldon's models could not account for. Anyone who enjoyed the original Foundation will surely enjoy this sequel.For those new to the series, this should not be the first book you pick up. Based on order of publication the original series is best read in this order:Foundation (1951)Foundation and Empire (1952)Second Foundation (1953)Asimov extended the foundation series further in the 1980s and included two books at the end and two prequels. I believe the best idea is to read the books in order of publication, but any reader will do fine reading them in chronological order as well (shown below).Prelude to Foundation (1988)Forward the Foundation (1993)Foundation (1951)Foundation and Empire (1952)Second Foundation (1953)Foundation's Edge (1982)Foundation and Earth (1986)"},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"In my initial read of this book, I stuck with it because it is a classic and everyone loves it.

I haven't even read this story in 37 years, and it STILL stands out in my mind as one of the best I have ever read. Second only to \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" by JRR Tolkien. It matters not that \\"Foundation\\" is SciFi.. it is just a darn good read! You will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"It's kind of funny when i think that less than 3 months ago, i had never heard os Isaac Asimov, and i had not much interest in reading science fiction. Then i get some book called \\"Foundation\\" for christmas, and it kind of interested me although i didn't read for over a month after i had it.Well since then, not only have i read it, and not only have i done alot of research on Asimov and science fiction in general, but i've also bought and read \\"Foundation and Empire\\". Quite a difference one book can make.I can not get enough of Asimov's Foundation series. I own over 100 books that i've found at thrift stores and second hand stores by many different authors. However the second day that i owned \\"Foundation and Empire\\" i dove right into it, and it did not dissapoint. The only negative thing i can say is that it's just barely not as good as the first book (although that book really blew my mind and was my very first sf novel).Regardless, \\"Foundation and Empire\\" is another solid tale by Asimov, filled again with great characters (even a clown!), and written with top notch imagination and imagery. Particularly amazing is how Asimov created the character of Hari Seldon. He appears in this book for about two pages, and yet the man's presence is a highlight. I did question if Asimov wasn't skilled at creating solid character's with real depth. However, when a man who was only in 40 or 50 pages of the first book makes an appearance in this one, it was easily my most anxious moment of the story, and i truly felt just as eager as everyone else sitting before the vault for Seldon to appear. Consider my question withdrawn haha.I am really loving the Foundation series, just the whole creation of, the many planets, the talk of ships, the different classes of people, everything! Not only am i very antsy about continuing this series (which i will definitely be doing soon), i am dying to read his robot novels and his stand-alones as well. Great book!"},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"Good: I really liked this book. The plot was solid and the characters good. I can highly recommend this one!"},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"This book is a great scifi read but it is essentially a series of short stories. So you shouldn't expect a typical \\"novel\\" story. They are set around the same theme of the Foundation, a group set up by a man, Hari Seldon, who is brilliant at something called psychohistory. He predicts that the galactic Empire will fall and sets up the Foundation as way to prevent the knowledge of man from being lost. The first section details this storyline. later storylines are about the trials of the people of the Foundation.

I am very much enjoying this reread! But the world (and I) have changed a LOT over the last 50-60 years (or in my case 40 years). Rereading the books that we loved when we were younger gives us insight into who and what we are today...Foundation and Empire (Foundation Novels)Isaac Asimov; continuing the 12,000 years-in-the-future saga of cigar chompin', blaster-totin', space-faring men and women (yes the women also lovingly smoke cigars... much to the consternation of the men) as they attempt to unravel the mystery of The Mule and The Second Foundation.I cannot imagine anyone reading this series for the first time having any flicker of comprehension as to why it was so popular and how it garnered a lifetime Hugo award... but again.. kids these days have little appreciation for The Beatles and Elvis... so there you are."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"This book is fantastic! The first time I read it, I wanted to read it again immediately upon finishing it. There were so many twists, turns and details that you just don't catch the first time through. Love!"},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"The big brain of Isaac Asimov composed this series and it shows. This book contains more characters than a fifteen-act Shakespearian play and still manages to unfold as one impressively coherent space-saga. This is by no means a detriment, and characters as well as past events are periodically referenced in later chapters.I'm by no stretch a science fiction aficionado, but upon reading summaries of the plot I couldn't wait to read this book, and it verily meets my expectations. The most interesting thing about this work is that it can be read as pure-science fiction or as social-commentary/social history. Without revealing too much, the sections of the book are dedicated to describing certain \\"Crises\\" that invariably occur due to the events of an imperialistic planet - planet Terminus, home-world of the Foundation - and it's attempts to reestablish (or supplant) a dying Galactic empire. The Foundation uses religion, politics, and economics to spread it's influence across the periphery, or \\"outer-edge\\" of the galaxy. Most of the book centers on characters who possess an aptitude for politics or are just plain cunning, and it's extremely entertaining to see how each character handles the crises and mini-crises laid before them.This book is, surprisingly, heavy on politics - but not politics as usual...that is to say, not any politics that you and I would be familiar with, but politics of fictional worlds and fictional people. However, the political theory behind it all is strong...I was hoping for a little more description when it came to the actual \\"science-fiction,\\" but I guess it was Asimov's intention to leave most of the work to the imagination, and this actually works-out beautifully. Your imagination can truly run wild with this book - Asimov gives only the most cursory descriptions of the characters, but what he gives is enough to get you going. Besides, who wants to spend time reading about a character when there is a good chance that he or she will no longer exist a couple pages down the road? You can infer much of the characters content from their actions and dialogue. Foundation is an entertaining and ambitious book, and I'm looking forward to the rest of the series. Classic for a reason."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"This book, Foundation, is a very detailed fictional book that place in the future. Isaac Asimov wrote many books and series in his lifetime and this book along with the series was one of his first books written. This story is mostly about the First Galactic Empire and its fall. Hari Seldon was a psychohistorian, and, using his advanced mathematics, was able to conclude that the Empire would soon fall in 500 years, and then be followed by 30,000 years of barbarism. Hari, however, could limit the 30,000 years to only 1,000 years, by having the people on a planet called Terminus follow an Encyclopedia Galactica that Hari Seldon had made. They followed this for 50 years until they found out it was a fake. Many years pass, and there are many different people who try to do something to help. Each person had a crisis to get past in order to keep doing what had to be done to limit the barbarism to 1,000 years. This continues until the end of the book, and is then continued in the sequels. I think that this book was very interesting and I enjoyed it a lot, but the only problem about it is that it is very difficult to follow because each chapter, new characters are brought in and it take place 50 or more years later in time. Other than that, if you are a good reader and enjoy fiction books then this is a great book to read. Also, if you really like the book, there are a ton of other books that he wrote, including several other sequels that you can read."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"Few works of literature merit me acquiring several copies and I must say that the Foundation series is one of those. Whenever I find an old edition of this series I tend to pick it up and now I own several copies of this series of books ranging from decrepid old paperbacks to some of these newer copies.Here are a few spoilers about the story but I hope not too many:Overall, the premise for foundation is quite intersting. The books take place in a far away future where humanity has colonized the galaxy. In this far future, a scientist discovers that he can tell the future...not for any particular person but for the aggregate of humanity as a whole and then only over long periods of time. The future that Hari Seldon, our scientist, sees is grim: the galactic empire and the society that billions upon billions of people depend on will fall. Nothing can stop this decline and fall.The scientist though figures that his formulas and computers can find key inflection points in history when the future can be altered or \\"helped along\\" and if the right decisions are made, the empire can be restored much more quickly than if history was simply left to run its course.So, the Foundation is created to safeguard human knowledge and especially this concept of psychohistory and every few millenia or so - whenever the computers predict that a \\"shove\\" is needed to get the empire back ot its glory - the Foundation \\"speaks\\" and tells people what to do to fix things.Overall, this is a fantastic series that Asimov at some point winds up tying into with his whole Robot series...you know the laws of robotics?...which winds up being just fantastic.This book was written in the 50s or 60s so there is quite a propensity to use nuclear technology powered gadgets of all kinds and people smoke quite a bit and the characters don't tend to have that heavy gravitas that you find in some modern TV like Battlestar Galactics: it was a more innocent time and that comes across int he writing. It is quite interesting to read science fiction from this era as it shows some of the cutting edge thinking of the time, but Asimov was so good that his writing transcends through to today and in many ways is better than some of the overly complex baryon/tachyon hard sci fi of today. This is smart sci fi - and it is smart sci fi because Asimov is so well read. So please as you pick this up, put it in context - you're not going to get Stephen Baxter or even Gregory Benford and you're not going to get David Brin -- you are going to get Asimov and it just tastes different from modern sci fi. These words are 50 years old.Now, Asimov was very well read and that comes across in his writing and if you read carefully you will find Machiavelli, Gibbon, Plato, and a slew of other writer's concepts interwoven into some of the very original thinking of Asimov.Asimov was truly a giant and the Foundation series is required reading along with the Robot series. A couple of things, one - there is quite a bit of mythology and gravitas associated with Foundation as one of the foundational works of science fiction and that causes people to approach the work with different emotions. Some people have their hopes way up. Others, like me approached Foundation with a bit of trepidation, I was a bit scared as a 15 year old whether I'd be able to read this book - my literature teacher recommended it to me. I must say that Foundation reads fast and it is a rather engaging story, so you get sucked in pretty quickly and there aren't a ton of turns or multiple branches like in Zelazny - Foundation is straight forward....and refreshing in many ways.The second parting item I leave you with is regarding this edition. I found it to be more of a collectors paperback than a mass market paperback - a bith higher quality. It does give you the feel that you're reading something special...but if you want to save yourselves a few bucks go for the mass market edition or if you want to dress it up a bit, get this one --- or if you really want to get an old copy, go to some antique book shop and pick up a leather bound edition with the gold trim (yes such a beast is out there).In any case, enjoy - this is \\"classic science fiction.\\" Those are loaded words and I offer them as consideration before you pick this book up."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"This is the first book of the original trilogy, but the third book overall.

Foundation4.Foundation and Empire (Foundation Novels)5.Second Foundation (Foundation Novels)- Later Works -6.Foundation's Edge (Foundation Novels)7.Foundation and EarthThere are other books written by other authors called the Second Foundation Trilogy, but I haven't read those (and don't plan to).The plot centers around a psychohistorian named Hari Seldon who can predict the future using his newly invented science. He realized that the empire is failing, and the galaxy will be propelled into a 30,000 year stretch of barbarism before a civilized government is established. To reduce the time to a mere 1,000 years, he establishes two Foundations at each end of the galaxy.This book focuses on only the First Foundation, the Second Foundation makes its first appearance in the sequel, Foundation and Empire. The First Foundation expands to take over the edges of the receding empire using its superior intelligence instead of force. They win conflicts through technology, religion, and trade.The theme that reason can overcome brute force is cleverly illustrated in this science fiction classic. It's a relatively short book at 320 pages, and a very fast read. The first book of the original Foundation trilogy is the beginning of a truly great series, a must read for any sci-fi fan."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"This book is one of the original science fiction novel of all time. I read this book as an outside reading assignment for my English class. First of all, I chose this book out of all the other books because I didn't want to read something that sounds dull and unexciting. I wanted to read something more innovative, and I certainly made the right choice when I picked this book from the library shelf.Hari Seldon, the protagonist, develops a area of study called psychohistory, which allows psychohistorians to predict future events in big pictures. According to psychohistory, the Empire will encounter decay in the future and an age of collapse will follow. This book portrays how our civilization tries to shorten the age of collapse by preserving all human knowledge.The book is divided into five section, each with different settings. First section explains the psychohistory and sets up the stage. Second section takes place 50 years after the first, and the new Empire starts encountering conflicts with resources. Third section starts 30 years later, and it deals with religion. Fourth section takes place 55 years later and the new civilization gets involved in a trade conflict. Last section takes place 20 years later and involves merchandise matters. Each section has different characters. Each experiences different conflicts, but they all pile up to show us how a civilization grows and how history is made.I liked how the writing is terse and straightforward. It is hard to follow the story because of the change of settings and many characters, but they do come together. I liked how I could observe the history being made. It is fun seeing a civilization encounter conflicts, digress from religion to economics, and so on. It feels like I'm experiencing a century of history. It's easy to read because there isn't really any complicating science that you need to understand or in-depth character conflicts into the story. Definitely a book to read if you want to know how it feels like to be a god looking down at human civilizations and how they behave. Read it if you want to know what Hari Seldon's true plan is!"},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"I can't say enough about this book, weather you like SF or not this book is a MUST READ!!! It's more about people/civilizations/political systems than SF but either way I highly recommend it.As for SF it is simply the best SF book ever written!!!!"},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"By the end of the thirteenth millennium, mankind had populated millions of planets scattered throughout the galaxy. The centre of the imperial government was located on the planet Trantor, in effect a single planetary city some 75,000,000 square miles in extent. Every conceivable square foot of habitable space was occupied with a teeming population well in excess of 40 billion souls. Its internal problems were so vast that it was all but inevitable that its grip on the outer reaches of its dominion should weaken. The empire, like every other empire that had preceded it, was in the throes of decline.Hari Seldon, a brilliant mathematician and psychologist developed the science of psychohistory - the use of mathematics and symbolic logic to evaluate and predict the future behaviour of statistically large segments of human population. When he applied his analysis to the Empire, the conclusions were bleak and inescapable. The stagnating Empire would imminently fall and collapse into a galactic dark age - a period of anarchy and chaos and a loss of art, culture, knowledge, technology and science that would last for thirty thousand years.When he knew that imperial collapse was inevitable, he created the \\"Foundation\\" and implemented what was later to become known as the Seldon Plan. He couldn't stop the dark age but he could shorten its duration to a mere thousand years and give civilization the ability to start over again.Asimov, known to his millions of fans merely as the \\"good doctor\\", certainly didn't stint when it came to the scope of his ideas and the size of the canvas on which he chose to paint. \\"Foundation\\" is a classic sci-fi novel that leans far towards the left side of the sci-fi spectrum. Hard sci-fi, technology and advanced science are touched upon only to the extent that they are necessary to make sense of an Empire that spans an entire galaxy. Quaintly, much of the science is seriously dated - data storage is on microfilm, atomic power is the norm even in spaceships that are expected to travel galactic distances - and could hardly be considered brilliantly prescient.So it is clearly the ideas that Asimov deals with that have elevated \\"Foundation\\" to its status as one of the most loved and most read science fiction novels of all time - science as religion, the authoritarian nature of religious dogma, the insidious Machiavellian nature of political diplomacy, the inevitability of the decline and collapse of a major empire and a powerful discussion as to whether violence is a necessary tool to resolve differences or whether it is merely \\"the last refuge of the incompetent\\".While I will happily acknowledge that \\"Foundation\\" was interesting and thoroughly enjoyable, I was somewhat disappointed to discover that it did not have the same thrill or excitement that I experienced when I first read it thirty years ago. The level of science in the book seems almost lack-lustre and in my mind did not live up to the grandiose scope of the novel. Like so many of his peers in the 1950s, women were stoutly ignored and played no part in \\"Foundation\\" at all.Dickens wrote at the turn of the century so one expects his prose to be different. Asimov wrote \\"Foundation\\" in 1951 so one certainly expects it to be a product of that time. But, unlike Dickens (and I'm not really quite able to put my finger on the reason why), the prose simply didn't age quite as well. So, in the full knowledge that many will disagree with me, I'm unwilling to accord \\"Foundation\\" the 5-star rating that many will expect. Four stars only from this reader and a high recommendation that this book must be read if you claim to be a fan of the classic sci-fi genre.Paul Weiss"},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"I won't bother you with much detail about the book, just know that this is one of the best (if not THE BEST) Science Fiction books I have ever read. I highly recommend this book to everyone. If you plan to read only one Sci-Fi book in your entire life, please make it this one! Asimov pretty much established the grounds for all space odysseys' that followed (think Star Wars, Star Trek, Hitchhiker's Guide, etc.). You wont be let down.The book is actually a collection of 5 short stories published together in one volume. It all begins at about 30,000 years after our time, and about 12,000 years after the Galactic Empire was established. Hari Seldon, a brilliant mathematician, has developed a theory (psychohistory) that can accurately foretell the behavior of immense human populations to the tee. Using it he placed the Empire's demise at 300 years, with an added bonus of 30,000 years of struggle in a chaotic and barbaric galaxy, until the Second Empire is established.What are you waiting for,get yourself a copy!!!"},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"Foundation is a masterpiece, bar none. It is not only great science fiction, but great fiction. Asimov does a truly wondrous job of painting a large picture, much in the way that the Hudson School of painting did in the 19th Century, while also giving compelling characterization, like a Rembrandt, and selecting the \`right' moments that the reader can zoom in on, in this compelling account of future history. Asimov leaves Clarke in the dust in terms of characterization, and most of this is achieved via dialogue, while still painting a big picture. Asimov wrote wonderful dialogue, and one can read the tenor of a character's soul simply by how they react in words to other characters. That said, I am very surprised that Asimov did not take issue with George Lucas's Star Wars films, because without Foundation there would simply not be Star Wars. Everything is there to be plumbed and looted- a galactic Empire, rebels, space jumps to circumvent the speed of light, the Galactic Spirit (aka The Force), and so on. Even Star Trek took a heavy load of its mythos from this book, as the human dominated Federation and human-looking and human-derived aliens that dominate most of the Star Trek universe have much akin with the Empire that rules Foundation at novel's start....Foundation was first published in novel form in 1951, but consisted of a number of short stories published throughout the 1940s in magazines like John W. Campbell's Astounding Science Fiction. Book One, The Psychohistorians, was written specifically as an opening for the novel; Book Two, The Encyclopedists was published as Foundation; Book Three, The Mayors, was published as Bridle And Saddle; Book Four, The Traders was published as The Wedge; and Book Five, The Merchant Princes, was published as The Big And The Little. Each of the Books within the novel functions almost as an autonomus story, much the way Bradbury's Martian Chronicles, or Sherwood Anderson's Winesburg, Ohio do. Yet, it all ties together, and though it has always had a reputation as a space opera, even if the ultimate or original space opera, it transcends that label. Yet, those sorts of labels can be offputting to casual readers of a genre, like I am. For I am not a sci fi nut by any means, yet I sense that many people have avoided this book because like, say, reading a Rilke poem or watching Orson Welles' Citizen Kane, they have felt that something so overpraised and hyped is bound to be a letdown. It's not. It earns its praise and labels, like epic, for, even though the book is less than 150 pages long in my version, probably 250-300 pages in paperback, it is certainly epic- the timescales and range of the Empire demand nothing less. And although that term is grossly overused, in this case it is spot on. The very title of the book has, in the decades since its first appearance, taken on another connotation, though- that of not only referring to the Foundation within the tale, but its place as the Foundation upon which modern outer space sci fi is based upon.This is not to deny the books flaws, which are there. But, given that most of them have to do with technological things, they are not truly literary flaws, merely those of the nature of the sci fi genre. Among them are anachronisms such as typical hausfrau-like portrayals of women, who apparently still worry over household domestic products, an addiction to nicotine, an over-reliance on atomic power, the use of parsecs rather than light years as a unit of distance, the galactic Empire being at the center of the galaxy where we now know only a supermassive black hole exists and makes life as we know it untenable due to radiation, and other minor points. Other flaws are less anachronistic than what in film would be called continuity errors, such as being able to transcend the speed of light, but recording information in actual books, and on microfilm, rather than digitally, or quantumly, yet being able to teleport that information; the Empire possessing holographic technology, yet it all being powered by vacuum tubes; or civilizations possessing interstellar ships but having economies dependent on fossil fuels- which means that dinosaurs and the like must have appeared on millions of the other worlds. Then there are just the plain odd things, such as Asimov's faith in capitalism being the solution to the galactic ills, even though in his universe it's what ails all the worlds. The idea that even were an Empire to arise and dominate a galaxy that such a massive thing could ever stagnate, seems odd. Diversity argues against that, but this shows Asimov's pessimism regarding the human ability to evolve. That these future men also have life spans akin to ours, smoke, and suffer cancer, bespeaking there seems to have been little in the way of medical breakthroughs (this was pre DNA discovery), also seems a bit of an imaginative lack.But, perhaps the greatest flaw of the book is Asimov's love affair with the Freudian Psychohistory (although I'm told in later books Asimov redacted the mythos to reveal it all a fraud), which reeks of determinism, exalts psychology to a \`hard' science, damns free will, plays to the Fallacy Of Uninterrupted Trends, and has been totally demolished in the wake of chaos theory. Still, even though Psychohistory fails as science, it's still far easier for a writer to predict human nature than scientific advances.But, again, these are mere quibbles, relatively speaking. Let me look at the pro side of the ledger. The very Psychohistory that, in reality, is specious, allows for the very drama of the tale to exist. While poor science it makes for excellent drama. To watch the various Foundation leaders grapple with their own will versus their faith in Seldon is the essence of existentialism. Asimov's use off offstage action is not just a condensing device, but clues the reader in to what is really important- the human moments and confrontations, not the comic book like blowing up of great interstellar vessels. A third device that works well is the use of select epigraphs throughout the story, culled from the fictive Encyclopedia Galactica. They unify the tale, lend it grandeur, and ground this future history as if it were already in the reader's past, much as Edward Gibbons' real and influential The Decline And Fall Of The Roman Empire did, and which Asimov acknowledged as his main source of ideas. Wisely, there is not too much technobabble, which helps date a work more than anything else. Also, as stated before, the book is rife with humor and sparkling dialogue, as well as plausible catchphrases like \`Galaxy knows' or \`By galaxy!' It is also worth re-stressing that the book's focus is not on scientific progress but social progress, and this predicates a number of major existential queries, such as what is progress? How does progress reconcile with human nature? Is progress ever expanding, cyclical, or helical? What is knowledge? How do the two square? Should knowledge be commoditized? Should knowledge be mysticized? What is free will and ethical agency? But most of all, how can all these subjects and ideas be best related?Yet, most of all, despite the ideas and the narrative, is the wonderful fact that Asimov is just flat-out a damned good writer. His prose is sometimes muscular, sometimes poetic, but always lucid and clear. His plots are not overly Byzantine, yet quite complex, his sentence and paragraph structure not ornate, but subtly seductive. How Hollywood has never optioned this book for a film is beyond me. Wait, no it's not. Why would they want to do compelling, human-based science fiction when they can pump out the pseudo-intellectualism of a Philip K. Dick, or the vapid &uuml;r-mythography of Star Wars, and make a fortune? Perhaps Asimov might be re-thinking his faith in Adam Smith's invisible hand in the great beyond?"},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"The main plot of the story copies the evolution of every human society. The decline and fall of empires, followed by the rise of others, depends on the same phenomena as those described here.

To minimize the effects of the fall of the Empire, he sets up the Foundation, a group of people following his carefully laid plan to preserve the achievements of humanity. So begins the reader's journey through hundreds of years of history and turmoil, watching as Asimov paints his picture of the tiny Foundation and its struggle to keep Seldon's plan alive. Asimov's characters are first-rate, grabbing the reader's interest with their intelligence and charisma. The plot is solid and fascinating to watch as it unfolds, taking twists and turns, every one guaranteed to surprise. Originally published as four short stories, Foundation is the beginning of the classic science fiction epic, and is not to be missed by any sci-fi fan."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"Written how many years ago?

It is filled with action but not like pulp. Read it!"},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"This is a MUST for any Sci-Fi fan. Unbelievable! It was written in nineteen fourty something and it's as modern as ever! This is the first part of the trilogy (Foundation, Foundation and Empire, Second Foundation), but not the first book chronologically (Prelude to Foundation, Forward the Foundation, Foundation Trilogy, Foundation's Edge, Foundation and Earth). Also read the robot series connected to Foundation (The Caves of Steel, The Naked Sun, The Robots of Dawn, Robots and Empire)."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"This is the best Book in the Fondation secuence. It is grate, and once I started to read it, I couldn't stop. Read it!!! and you will become an Issac Asimov Fan like me."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"Foundation was a great book. It had an excellent plot, I was almost always on the edge of my seat when reading. Some moments in the book strike you as pure guniess, the way the characters got out of a tight situation. The only complaint I have wold be that the time jumps. It needed a date as to when you were, and not having to pick it up from conversations."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"The &quot;Foundation&quot; is one of the best book I have ever read (and I've read a lot of science fiction books). The plot sparkle and shines throughout and the reader is never left alone and bored."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"Set more than 10,000 years in the future, at the edge of a failing galactic empire, this book isn't a story so much as a series of vignettes spanning decades. The book starts by detailing the effort to create the Foundation, which will try to preserve civilization from total collapse as the Empire continues to decay. With each jump to the future, we see the members of the Foundation confront a series of crises that threaten both the Foundation and the very fabric of civilization.Asimov has done a remarkable job of creating a believable far future, with a human civilization that spans the massive space of the galaxy. His descriptions of the decline of the Empire, and of the resulting chaos at its edges extrapolates nicely from history (particularly the decline of the Roman Empire). Though written half a century ago, very little about this book feels particularly dated, except possibly for the prevalence of characters that smoked. This book deserves its reputation as a science-fiction classic."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"Asimov's Foundation books are well-crafted, masterfully imagined, and peopled with fascinating characters. Spanning some several thousand years, and multiple generations of characters (often more than one per book), the author does a fantastic job keeping each set unique and captivating. The stories follow the progression of Psychohistory, a technique for predicting the future behavior of masses of people, and the people set up to use its information to further the birth of a greater galactic empire. Space battles, intrigue, mutants, telepathy and mind control, as well as personal triumphs and failures run throughout all the novels. They are, in my opinion, among the best crafted series in the sci-fi genre ever produced."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"this book is one of the most important books in science fiction historyand a must for all science fiction lovers."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"Ah, Isaac Asimov. A god, some would say, in the sci-fi genre. I picked up this book at the urging of a friend, trusting in its reputation.At first I found Foundation unusual to read, it covers large swathes of time at once. However, Asimov does this extremely well. He gives us little anchors of information or characters that we can recognize, so we can figure out where we are in the time line without him having to come out and say it.Much of the book is dialogue, which is something I have not encountered before. Most of the story and characterization is carried in the dialogue rather than through plain description. Asimov doesn't tell you what the characters are thinking, he *shows* you what they're thinking as they explain it to other characters. This rather prevents us from growing too close to the characters, but that is rather the point because the time line goes so fast.Foundation was an unusual novel, but I can see why it is still a classic. It may be a little dry for some, but I enjoyed it."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"It's my third read of this book. First two I read about ten years ago, when my English hasn't been that matured, so after reading the book in original, I immediately found a copy in my native language. Now I decided to read the whole saga and of course started from the very beginning.Just as addictive as before. And with fair certainty I can say that this is the saga that has inspired George Lucas or whoever he took his ideas from. And yet it all started with \\"Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire\\"..."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"When you foretell the decline of a galactic empire, you don't make many friends. But Seldon manages to keep what he finds low key and sets into motion a series of events that will lessen, not stop, the ravages that are to come.A great sci-fi classic. One of the best from an all time master of the genre. When I was younger I tried to track down every book he ever wrote. Think I got all the Tales from the Black Widows, but am not sure.Any lover of Sci-fi will find this not only exciting, but intelectually stimimulating."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"I totally liked the pattern that Isaac Asimov established in \\"Foundation,\\" the first volume in what we know refer to as the original Foundation trilogy. Hari Seldon created the revolutionary science of psychohistory and mapped out a future for humanity that would allow thirty thousand years of barbarism between the existing galactic empire and the future one to be reduced to only one thousand years. Through the effort of the psychohistorians the Foundation was established with its encyclopedists. Then we saw the rise of the Mayors, the Traders, and the Merchant Princes, each representing a step on the path laid out with mathematical precision by Hari Seldon over the first two centuries of the millennium he plotted out.I was looking forward to a continuing series of Seldon Crises as the Foundation played out the rise of human civilization, thinking that what we had hear with what Arnold Toynbee had done with his study of ancient civilizations extended into a future that covered an entire galaxy. But Asimov was setting us up for something unexpected in \\"Foundation and Empire\\"; the idea was that at this stage the Foundation would be threatened by the final power play of the dying Empire. But the universe is apparently tired of Hari Seldon playing with his mathematically loaded dice and has thrown the entire plan into doubt by creating a mutant, nicknamed \\"The Mule.\\" Now the Foundation, the Seldon Plan and the entire galaxy is facing a new and powerful threat.When I first read \\"Foundation and Empire\\" I was rather dismayed at the big change in direction. But, of course, Asimov knew what he was doing. He had already proven the validity of psychohistory, at least within the context of his futuristic novel, and there really is no reason to put out another four books (at two hundred years apiece) to complete the plan. Historians might find this interesting, but Science Fiction fans were going to want more than that from Asimov. Indeed, the Mule proves to be, both in terms of the story and the trilogy, the link between the Foundation and the Second Foundation. The Foundation trilogy is classic science fiction from the genre's self-proclaimed Golden Age, and even if the writing style seems dated or quaint, it remains a seminal series."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"But, then, how could it not be when its author was the incomparable Isaac Asimov? There are, of course, plenty of other noteworthy works by all manner of Old Masters as well as newer authors that, in my opinion, at least belong next to the &quot;Foundation&quot; series simply because they, too, are great sci-fi adventures and space opera: &quot;Stranger in a Strange Land&quot;, &quot;Puppet Masters&quot;, &quot;2001&quot;, &quot;2010&quot;, &quot;Rendezvous with Rama&quot;, &quot;Ringworld&quot;, all the &quot;Star Trek&quot; and &quot;Star Wars&quot; books, as well as books as new to the genre as &quot;Advent of the Corps&quot; and others. I mention them only to show that what great sci-fi authors like Isaac Asimov started decades ago still lives and breeds more and more fantastic works!"},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"This is the first book I read by the author Asimov. I know there are many more famous books from him like the Robots collections and Foundation. I picked this one for the first book simply because this is the first entry to the Foundation series, on a chronological sense. I must say surprisingly, this is a very easy-to-read (compare to Dune, Lord of the Ring, etc), but exciting, and full-of-surprises book. At times, it also gives us thoughful issues (e.g. can we 'predict' the future?), which is what we are anticipating from a sci-fi. I know from many many readers that Foundation is the best among all the volumes, but I can imagine that this is already an enjoyable read, I cannot imagine how exciting the Foundation book will be. It also thrills me to read all other series (Robot, Empire, etc) so as to get a full understanding of the history under Asimov's reign. I recommend this one to everyone who has never touch Asimov's work before."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"As well as a trilogy that is as far-reaching as it is set in a far-distant time with characters and galactic backdrop unrivaled by any other book. Definitely one of the great science-fiction classics just like \\"Stranger in a Strange Land\\", \\"Childhood's End\\", along with modern-day cyberpunk like \\"Neuromancer\\", \\"Count Zero\\", \\"Prey\\", \\"Cryptonomicon\\", \\"Snow Crash\\", \\"Darkeye: Cyber-Hunter\\", etc."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"It was a very interesting concept, a bit heavy on a scientific version of \\"fate\\". This series of books uses the concept of random motion as a prediction for the future was quite a brilliant idea. The story deals with a genius who predicts behavior for millenia into the future and actually has recorded holograms for future people that deal with his predictions. Where I had trouble was the reliance on robots in the later books. I personally prefer the human side of things. It was an interesting read and well worth it."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"Foundation is not easy to read since most of it is politics in the Foundation Universe. It follows the plot very closely but still keeps the scifi element with things like space travel and intergalactic empires.When I read it I found the religious aspect interesting. The main characters were either scholars, politicians, or interstellar traders, and there were a lot of cloak & dagger type situations. Something I found interesting was that women didn't really play any roles until the last part of the book. It's kinda funny to see this Emerald City (Terminus) in the middle of these warring kingdoms who think they have the upper hand. The use of nuclear power as the ultimate source of energy is a important aspect in the book. If you like lots lots of action, then this book isn't for you."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"Asimov is my favorite sci-fi writer and this book is great. Do realize that this is the first book of the Foundation trilogy and that Amazon sells all three books in a single hardcover which makes the most sense costwise. So buy the trilogy in a single volume rather than buying this first story separately."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"but just barely!Foundation (Foundation Novels)by Asimov; a classic, a reread (its been at least 35 years however), and a very quick read. Sadly, Foundation doesn't hold up well at all. It's hard to understand how such an accomplished mathematician and scientist like Asimov was so completely unaware of the coming ideas of chaos theory and how it would make his theory of 'psychohistory' so completely improbable and even faintly ridiculous. Secondly, it's 12,000 years into the future... and Asimov can't imagine beyond the common use of tobacco products, blasters, and nuclear power??All that said (and I know it's been said in many reviews in far less kind terms than I have)... it's still a fun story, and one can see the roots and budding ideas of lots and lots of later authors. One can only wonder what science fiction will look like 70 years from now!"},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"I recently re-read this classic work of science fiction, and was pleasantly surprised to find it's still relevant today. The characters and language are a bit creaky, but the social issues Asimov raises are sound. Under what conditions is it ethical for a self-appointed academic elite to hoodwink and trick the general population for their own good? Phrased that way, the answer seems obvious -- under no conditions at all? -- but what if it really IS for their own good, and if disaster is the alternative?We don't have any better answers to those questions today than we did 70 years ago, when Asimov was writing."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"Absolutely wonderful book. Real science fiction is not about blasters and spaceships, it is about people who've been put in extraordinary situation and how they react to it.I would recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"One more trip outside my usual reading waters. Science fiction. Foundation makes me remember why I loved science fiction when I was in my late teens and early twenties. The whole world is tilted and new ways of thinking and doing things become possible. All our world leaders need to read science fiction, with its ominous ventures into possible futures. Foundation is the story of a world set up solely as place to compile an enormous encyclopedia, an effort for the ages. But as the story moves forward rapidly in time, we readers come to see that the world has been set up for many other, secret purposes, purposes designed to save the thinking peoples from an eternity in a dark age."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"Asmiov is not at all a great writer. He does not develops the characters, who are often just tools to set the story going. Classic readers may find his style too crude, too objective. In this series, a character you find important for the story in one chapter may never appear in the rest of the saga.But Asimov is a master storyteller. His imagination has delivered us a lot of great sci-fi stories, and the Foundation series is among the best.In the far future, experts in the study of the behavior of great populations determine that the galactic empire is going to disappear, and then they conceive a plan to preserve human civilization, and reduce a many thousand years of \\"dark age\\" to just one thousand years. They predict what is going to happen decades and centuries in the future, and take precautions so that humanity will be able to avoid each crisis, according to the strongest factor at each time. It seems complex, but it's not. As long as you reach chapter three, you're ok. I can't tell anymore without spoiling it, but despite its lack of literary quality, it's a story you must read if you like science fiction.I liked this book most for the outstanding way the plan comes together in each crisis, revealing Asimov's amazing creative mind.I you think sci-fi silly, or if you value literary virtue a great deal, this is not your book. But if a great story is enough to entertain you, you won't be able to put this book down."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"I read these books in elementary school , I got hooked on Sci Fi. Wasn't popular at the time but my brother's books were available to read.Story still rates up there with the best books of Sci Fi of all time. I am constantly amazed by the visuals of Star Wars and other such movies but the ideas come from HG Wells, Edgar Rice Burroughs, Heinlien, Clarke, Fredrick Pohl. and I Azimov. (also a few others)Azimov is in my mind the best though not recognized for his Sci Fi (not as prolific in this gendre) and so he gets little credit.I do plan on reading thse books again."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"I'd been hearing about Asimov's work for a while now, and being a sci-fi/fnatasy fan, I figured I should check it out. For me, it's a matter of seeing where the genre has come from and where it's going. \\"Foundation\\" was a quick, worthwhile read which, much like Tolkein, helped define a genre. After reading, I see why Asimov is still relevant today. His stories don't age because the lessons can still be applied to modern empires and the struggles they face.**Spoiler Alert** Do not read below here if you don't want details of the story.\\"Foundation\\" certainly didn't disappoint. At first, I thought it was a little odd that the sections of the book were so far apart in time, but as I kept reading, it began to make sense. Asimov wasn't trying to tell a story about specific characters as we're used to thinking of them (i.e., individual people), rather, he was aiming to tell the story of a civilization. As I read, it began to make perfect sense. His premise is that the actions of humans as a race can be predicted on a large scale. In order to get that across, the story had to be told using large scale and long time periods. Whether Asmiov was thinking of this or not, I can't say. But it works."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"The book covers several generations, so with each generation you have to re-learn all the characters. It is difficult to keep track of who's who when every time you get to know the cast, 200 years suddenly pass and we're in the middle of a new crisis. I didn't read the whole series because of this -- it was obnoxious."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"When a book is slated as one of the greatest Sci-Fi novels of our time, it should be extremely hard to criticize. Unfortunately I found The Foundation to have more than a few flaws which actually made it a chore to read. Considering that it beat out \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" for the Hugo Award in 1965 for best All-Time Series, which is why I decided read it, makes it even more insufferable in my opinion. Simply look at how momentous LOTR's has become over The Foundation in our culture and you can begin to see how it is obviously lacking something. So why does it fall short ? Well, the primary reason is the story line jumps vast amounts of time chapter to chapter, which even though I found refreshing, it gives the reader a completely new set of characters in different settings which receive little to no development. So ultimately the visual depth, as well as character depth, which I find so alluring about Sci-Fi, is ultimately lacking leaving little for the imagination to grasp on to. What this does do though is leave room for what I believe Asimov wanted the reader to really experience, which is the psychohistorical themes built upon long term economic strategy, which was wonderfully orchestrated and second to none. The thing that gets me, is considering that is the focus of the story, it could have just as easily taken place in the 1800's and 1900's and be based on oil or guns instead of nuclear power. Don't get me wrong, the story is intriguing but if you are looking for a visually stimulating Sci-Fi book, I would look elsewhere...or you can just wait for the feature film in 2013."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"I got pretty bogged down with the multiple characters and places and time periods. Not a good book to pick up occasionally, takes a focussed reading. And that's just one of the series!"},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"Inscribed along the bottom of my well-worn copy of Foundation is the following accolade: \\"Awarded the Hugo as Best Series Ever!\\" In response all I can say is, \\"don't hold your breath.\\"Sure, I give the book three stars for its creativity and imaginative appeal. But, as a stand alone work, it doesn't measure up to other estimable sci-fi classics, most notably Robert Heinlein's thoroughly engrossingStarship Troopers. As the first work in a series, Orson Scott Card'sEnder's Game (Ender, Book 1)and Frank Herbert'sDune, 40th Anniversary Edition (Dune Chronicles, Book 1)far surpass it on similar terms.I lost interest in the remainder of the Ender and Dune series, which is unlikely to happen with the Foundation lot from what I know of the rest. It is in the remainder of the series where Asimov supposedly hits his stride. I don't doubt it, but his first book, much likeI, Robot, lacks an overarching narrative that one would expect in a Hugo series. Replacing the narrative is an overarching theme. But the theme's unabashed anti-religious and humanistic elements are somewhat off-putting.Most readers will likely look past this, but it diminishes the book's appeal in my mind. It also dampens my enthusiasm for diving into the remaining books. In the end, the Foundation series may have received the Hugo, but the first book leaves it with much ground to make up when compared to its two most notable Hugo runners-up, J.R.R. Tolkien'sThe Lord of the Ringsand Edgar Rice Burroughs'The John Carter of Mars Series."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"No judgement againt asimov as a sci fi innovator, but i did not find the story telling to be very enthralling and felt almost no emotional connection to the series of characters introduced over large jumps in time.The method for introducing new twists or skipping decades by introducing fake abreviated &#34;encyclopedia galactica&#34; entries was awkward and rough."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"As the beginning to his Foundation series, which will eventually incorpate his entire Asimovian universe, this collection of intertwined short-stories is a must read for Asimov fans. But it is not close to his greatest works - he's only getting started here, but if you take the time to read his other stories and novels, you will appreciate these beginnings."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"Isaac Asimov considered his work that eventually became the Foundation and Empire book of The Foundation Trilogy to be his best, due to his introduction of the misunderstood, mutant conqueror: \\"The Mule.\\" Given Asimov's personal stamp of approval, for that reason alone, this book is well worth devouring. Published originally in the 1940s by the magazine \\"Astounding,\\" this trilogy eventually won the Hugo Award for Best All-time Series ever. It even beat out Lord of the Rings, although I think evaluating two such different series in dissimilar genres is like comparing apples to oranges.Asimov's imagining of a future, immense and extremely technologically advanced galactic empire (based on the Roman empire) that is on the verge of falling back into barbarism is indeed astounding. Among other fantastic characters in this series is Hari Seldon, the Empire's greatest intellectual, who sets about to reduce the period of barbarism from 10,000 years to 1,000. But unfortunately, Seldon's mathematics-based science called \\"psychohistory,\\" whereby he can predict group human actions in the future, was unable to account for a mutant with vast mind control powers; the previously mentioned character who mysteriously calls himself The Mule.Foundation and Empire tracks The Mule as he conquers planet after planet and the efforts to stop him and make sure that Hari Seldon's Plan for the future is maintained. One aspect that sets this book apart from a lot of science fiction is a strong and compelling female character, Bayta, who plays a critical role in combating The Mule. This is especially surprising considering that this work was written in the 1940s. I will leave it at that so as not to reveal not one, but two fantastic plot twists at the end of the book. Foundation and Empire is perhaps the best of a truly classic sci-fi trilogy."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"Once again, Asimov serves up a thrilling read for the sci-fi fan. The two story-lines followed in the text pertain particularly to the question of if/how spectacular individuals can alter the Plan of Hari Seldon. The first pertains to a final thrust of the Empire while the second pertains to the question of an anomalous power known as the Mule.The final expeditions of the Empire attempt to take over the foundation by means of the talented general Bel Riose. Bel Riose launches a campaign against the Foundation and pushes toward victory with nearly unprecedented ease, backed by the Imperium. This first half of the book considers the power of the individual and the mass with respect to the great movements within the Foundation according to the Plan. Although I will not reveal much more than this, I will at least say that the outcome of part one is intriguing in comparison to part two, dealing with the Mule.The second half of the story deals with the relationship of Seldon's plan to the possibility of a mutation which begets a figure who is an extremely powerful galactic conqueror, destroying the overall political milieu foresaw by Seldon. To speak much more of this would spoil the read for you. However, I must say that it is a thrilling text which kept me on the edge of my seat all the way through the end. The ending itself was such a surprise that it indeed reminded me that I was reading Asimov, for it is just the type of intellectual curve-ball that he would throw just as the novel ends.Once again, we have a stupendous text on our hands in these two. It raises major questions about the plausibility of psycho-history, some of which are raised again in the third text in the series. I suggest this text most thoroughly to all sci-fi fans. I only suggest that you at least read Foundation before reading this book."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"But Asimov is one of the greatest science-fiction authors to have every lived. His massive work adding itself to works by other such sci-fi masters: &quot;Childhood's End&quot;, &quot;Rendezvous with Rama&quot;, &quot;Stranger in a Strange Land&quot; as well as the more modern cyberpunk works like &quot;Neuromancer&quot;, &quot;Mona Lisa Overdrive&quot;, &quot;Snow Crash&quot;, &quot;Prey&quot;, and &quot;Cyber Hunter&quot;. All are must-reads for any hardcore science-fiction and cyberpunk collector."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"This book is amazing science fiction novel. Asimov's straightforward and simple way of writing presents the reader with a concise and well formed novel. The plot is amazing with its many twists and turns, although the character development isn't very strong. However, the lack in character development comes from Asimov's style of writing in which he presents the reader with several major characters. The entire book revolves around foreshadowing of a point in history where knowledge will be lost and barbarians will rule over an ingorant civilization. In order to shroten the period of ignorance and barbarianism, Hari Seldon forms the Foundation, a group of scholars on a planet at the edge of the galaxy. Asimov uses foreshadwing to great effect throughout the entire novel to form the plot. Another device well used by asimov is symbolism. One example is the Foundation, which is used as a symbol for hope for the future. The symbols placed throughout the novel bring about a sense of profound revelation to the reader. Irony is also used very effectively in one instance. When the encyclopedists realize that all their work was all in vain, Asimov reveals the fragility of the human intellect. He explains how the composition of human knowledge is not in one single person, but is spread out throughout all of humanity, and cannot be contained within one book or one set of books."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"I read this* because it presents a galaxy without aliens, colonized by people. It was soft SF in so many ways (incl. FTL, antigravity, flying cars, walnut-sized nuclear reactors, laser pistols, personal and city force shields, egregious use of energy in the form of anti-gravity elevators) and the psychohistorian-predicts-future-events-to-the-day plot was dumb--not to mention the idea of civilizations with FTL ships incapable of harnessing nuclear power. With repeated suspensions of disbelief, it was pleasant enough. The characters were not such nitwits as those of \\"Prelude to Fdn.\\" No need to read his other books.* after reading If the Universe is Teeming with Aliens...Where is Everybody?: Fifty Solutions to the Fermi Paradox and the Problem of Extraterrestrial Life (2002) by Stephen Webb"},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"I realize I'm in the minority compared to the other reviews but I don't feel this book is even close to being half as good as the first foundation book.

Also I guessed the big twist in the second story by the third page."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"This is a great read. A lot of great characters, and interesting events take place. This book definitely advances the whole \\"Foundation\\" idea, but it does stand on its own."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"My sister likes to randomly give me things, based on conversations we had weeks prior that I barely remember. I must've been talking up Asimov (the man published enough articles/books for 10 lifetimes) because one day she gave me Foundation and asked me to read it. Not having read it herself, she said the only thing she knew about it is that it's the book that established him. In reality, the books, initially a chapter-by-chapter series in a two-bit magazine, never made him that much money until much later in his life. So it goes.You should, therefore, pick up this book knowing only that one piece of information; this book was his \\"big break.\\" It starts engagingly enough: One arithmetician, Hari Seldon, has found a way to predict the fall of civilization, and develops a plan to stem the suffering of mankind. Very little of the story is actually about the man himself. By nature of the predicting-science, the science of history, the narrative spans a multitude of exotic settings, and even more lifetimes.An interesting thing happened to me as I was reading the book, however, despite having been warned by Asimov himself in the foreword. I realized that nothing happens in this book. That is to say, no actual action takes place. The entire book is dialogue driven.Unfortunately things sometimes take a hit or I have to stop pretending for a second, because during some of the dialogue exchanges people say or do things outside the boundaries of their character(lines like \\"and I'm glad you refuse to countenance it.\\" from a Han Solo-style trader? Just say 'face it' instead!) It's clear that at the age Asimov was when he wrote it at least, that he had a Davincian understanding of women at best. Characters throughout sometimes act in grandiose, dramatic ways that defy common sense or motive. It's like watching a good play with bad acting, and as well, you can practically FEEL the curtain coming down in between chapters since so much of this book happens \\"behind the scenes.\\" Speaking of scenes, they get somewhat sparse of props. Asimov will rarely, if ever, describe inanimate objects. Unless they do something science-fictiony (lets just say he GROSSLY over-estimated nuclear physics and under-estimated electronics.)Anydangway, there's also a problem of overconfident protagonists. At first you're not used to it, so the feeling of imminent peril is genuine, but after reading one cocky protagonist after another, you begin to stop worrying about them because they always come out on top in a vaguely predictable fashion. I suppose part of that is in the design of the book's thesis, but it would be nice to show some more range in his characters.I'm already almost finished with the second one. So far, this first one was better. I know after reading this review it sounds like I was hard on the guy, but really it's not bad. I'm only a little surprised a movie hasn't been optioned, because it kindof feels like Dune.

His later work is definitely better. &quot;Foundation and Empire&quot; is like its predecessor (&quot;Foundation&quot;) in that you get several stories told in different periods throughout Foundation history. Everything Asimov has come up with in these books is fundamentally good sci-fi story stuff, but the lack of character development makes you think while you're reading, &quot;Why am I reading this?&quot; I'll read the last in the trilogy (&quot;Second Foundation&quot;), but that's as far as I'm going to go with these.For great sci-fi, read &quot;Hyperion,&quot; &quot;Fall of Hyperion,&quot; &quot;Ender's Game,&quot; &quot;Childhood's End&quot;, &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey,&quot; &quot;Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep.&quot;For good sci-fi, read &quot;More Than Human,&quot; &quot;The Gods Themselves,&quot; &quot;Slan,&quot; &quot;The Demolished Man,&quot; &quot;The Stars My Destination.&quot;TOO MUCH TO LIST, MY FRIENDS!!!Good luck and good reading."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"In a twisted (mis)reading of the Foundation series, the Japanese terrorist cult Aum Shinrikyo used Asimov's epic as a prophecy of upcoming apocalypse and converted dimsighted guru-dictator Shoko Ashara into an incarnation of Hari Seldon. Worthwhile to sharpen your wits as you read the story to see how the zealots got it wrong -- but also how they could easily pervert Asimov's points.

I thought the story was thin. Surprisingly, the best of the Foundation novels is not the first but the fourth - Foundation's Edge.

The invincible foundation is overrun, the land of your beloved characters is defeated!&lt;pr&gt;And THAT'S just the start of the fun! This book is so well written and Asimov's universe is so well developed, you fell as if your there when the troops of &quot;The Mule&quot; land.

It's my opinion. And Asimov is never more ridiculous than when he writes about feelings, especially about love (scenes seem to be described by a child or a thinking machine). But this writer is still gifted at setting clever plots every reader will enjoy, for instance in his robots tales (of course do not expect more than a quality entertainment, as often with sci-fi). However, Fondation is not really a clever book ; it is not boring, but it has poor content. You will finish it but probably won't read it again. First problem, it is impossible to believe in psychohistory, which smells like positivist propaganda from the 19th century. And because he has nothing more than an adventure story to tell, Asimov uses all kinds of tricks to grip the reader, including lots of surprises justified by unlikely and twisted arguments, some of which you may find hard to swallow. To conclude, Fondation is a kind of cartoon : a succession of sketches, rather funny but unlikely. If you still absolutely want to read the book, don't read Dune before.

As some of the other reviewers have pointed out, the writing style is of a very poor quality indeed. It is not only very dull and dry, but it is also totally lacking in any kind of style or art. The dialogue is simply dreadful, the character development is nonexistent, and the story is pointless and not at all well structured. The fact that this alleged \\"novel\\" is really a collection of short stories is readily apparent, as there is no cohesion and very poor correlation between sections. This is not memorable writing in any way and it has no redeeming qualities as a work of literature.

After having noticed all the editorials, reviews, and awards attributed to the Foundation series, I didn't hesitate to order all the books in the series. What a mistake! I'm not sure what people are seeing in these novels, but in no way do they even come close to approaching some of the other hallmarks of sci-fi, like Dune, Ender's Game, you name it. This book has a semi-interesting setup about trying to preserve civilization during a coming galactic dark age, but beyond that the book devolves into stupid scenario after scenario about how the Foundation is threatened but through the citizens' skill (i.e. sheer stupidity and dumb luck) they manage to somehow make it through the crisis only to face another yawner a few pages later. In between each crisis numerous years elapse, so by the time Asimov sets up the next unrelated crises, the entire cast of characters changes -- you barely have time to figure out their names much less get to know any person in significant detail.This series of books did nothing but put me to sleep on multiple occassions when normally if a book is good I'll stay up all night to finish it. My advice is to steer well clear from this series and try one of the other highly rated sci-fi books out there -- there are so many others that would be far preferable."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"I can understand why this book is considered one of the best science fiction books ever written, especially considering the time period it was written in. It has a very interesting concept of destination and cause and effect (although it is weak in execution and very weak in explanation). For these reasons and other I should only give this book a one star, but instead I gave it two and I will explain why later.There is almost zero character development in this book. The extremely short chapters jump thirty years to eighty years and more between chapters. Almost every &quot;book&quot; within this book has a new set of characters with only a few references of the &quot;heroes&quot; from the previous &quot;books.&quot; At times, this makes for very confusing reading because I had no idea who the new people were in the successive chapters.As mentioned in the title, this book suffers greatly from the Superman sydrome. By this I mean that you know the outcome before the events have unfolded. Superman can't be beat (except for by Doomsday in the comics but he comes back anyway) and therefor when watching the movies you know he wins. So there just has to be more elaborate plans and more complex ways of defeating him but he still will win. The same is true with the foundation. Harry Seldon, the prophet who esentially created the foundation, knew what was going to happen because he could see the future. Every &quot;book&quot; in &quot;Foundation&quot; will ultimately see the Foundation as the victor, so there just must be more complex problems arising, but of course the Foundation will ultimately prevail. And in this book, the problems are not really that complex, just different social economies arising to counter the previously established social economy that prevailed in the previous &quot;book.&quot; I can only imagine that in the later books the problems will get ridiculously complex - maybe even too complex for enjoyment.Because this book has almost zero characterization and is very predictable I would give this book one star, but instead I gave it two. The reason for this is because I have read the backs of the other books in the Foundation series and other reviews of them and I am interested in the storyline. I want to read about the Mule in Foundation and Empire, and I want to read about Earth in Foundations Edge. If not for that this book would recieve a one star rating from me and I would also never recommend this book or ever pick it up again.It may be a classic, but it's not that great. It's not great at all."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"I only recently read this so called masterpiece. I even went do far as to order the special complete edition from the Science Fiction Book Club. Even though I got through it I cannot believe all of the outstanding reviews and awards this series has received. No characters, no science, no mystery (who couln't figure out the identitiy of the Mule?). In addition the story is basically one of the collapse of the Roman Empire. It probably could have been rewritten replacing historical language instead of spacefare and it would not have mattered in the slightest. The only science fictional element was Psychohistory which is not developed at all due to the nature of the plot. If this is a classic, I shall stick to more obscure and worthwhile reads. Blech."},{"Title":"The Martian Way","review":"I just finished reading Foundation and was extremely disappointed. Maybe I was expecting too much, something grander along the line of the Dune series. But the book in of itself is an extreme disappointment. I realize Asimov was young (21) when he wrote this, but his style leaves a lot to be desired. I'll take an early Arthur C. Clarke book over Asimov anyday. This is the first book by Asimov I've read and I'm not sure I want to read another. His style is very dialoge driven with very few, if any, detail given to what the characters think. Everyone is very two-dimensional. And he never describes any of the scenes were all of this dialog takes place. Part of the interest in science-fiction is exploring new places, seeing different things. This entire story could have taken place on an empty stage. In fact, it seems like it's written more for a play than a novel. As for the story, it starts out interestingly enough. The Empire is going to crumble and to avoid thousands of years of dark-ages, a Foundation is set up to preserve the past learnings of the Empire. Well, that's what the original thought was at least. Soon we discover there's an alternate motive to this. Once we learn of this motive, the story goes straight downhill. Asimov skips decades from one page to another. Characters are introduced that we know pratically nothing about, and he never tells us anything about them. I've read history books that had more character development than he gives the people in this book. By the time I got to the end I found myself saying &quot;So what&quot;? Am I supposed to continue on reading this series because it's been called a &quot;classic&quot;. I've seen the word &quot;classic&quot; thrown around a little too much sometimes. This is defintely one of those times."},{"Title":"Solitary Witch: The Ultimate Book of Shadows for the New Generation","review":"If you are on a budget, or simply don't want to purchase dozens of books on the Craft, this is the book for you! A modern Solitary Witch can practice for a lifetime with only this book for guidance. While I believe that one should read everything one can get on any subject of interest, this book will be my primary source from here on.Let me first say that I have long been a fan of this authors practical, down to earth and open sharing of her practice and experience. I find those who refer to her books in a negative way are usually those who resent her success and her openess in sharing what some would like to use to boost thier own ego by wanting others to think that the practice of the craft is some deep dark secret know only to them and their trad or group.As for me, I will be selling many of the books I have accumulated over many years of practice as a Solitary Witch, as I will be using the spells and rituals in this book instead of digging through a dozen books to find just what I'm looking for.For the record, I am a dedicated servant of the Freya, and I find no conflict with this Wiccan based book and my practice of the Northern Tradition. While I personally could do without reference to Angels and Christian Witchcraft, (I believe Christians can indeed practice a powerful form of magick in the ceremonial tradition, but one cannot be Wiccan AND Christian.), it should be no problem for the readers of this book. Just use what you like, and skip what you don't want. There's such an abundance of information here, that you can easily skip a little and still have more than enough.There is a chapter devoted to the young witch or wizard. If you are a Crone, like myself, don't skip this chapter. Who but us will bring along the next generation? We need to know what is important and practical for the Teen Witch so that we can be better and wiser teachers.Well done, Silver Raven Wolf"},{"Title":"Solitary Witch: The Ultimate Book of Shadows for the New Generation","review":"I am a bit disheartened by the last few reviews of Ravenwolf's newest book. Constructive criticism is one thing but to write an entire section blaming the author is another. I am a avid Pagan reader and I find her work to be informative and yet at the same time very helpful in remebering the basics(which is the foundation of others magicks. sSe speaks to a younger audience which is apparent in her titles...Teen Witch, New Generation, terms like this are in reference to a younger generation of Witches. She wants a no fuss, no muss approach by laying it all out and encouraging and even at times enticing us to know more. Ravenwolf's work may at time seem to be repetitve with the pages on circle casting, grounding and centering etc but the book is geared towards the basics.(The important things we should not forget to do when we get caught up with all the directions and guidleines to rituals)This book was a great read. Her humour and style comes across marvelously through the pages of her work(she even had me laughing to myself a few times!)Although I understand that there are many levels to being a Witch and many levels for magickal practice, we should never be without humour and the ability to make it fun and inviting for others. I think part of the reason why so many people are afraid of Witchcraft is that they hear about complicated rituals with strict rules and guidelines. That could easily scare them off, or even hinder new practicioners. Ravenwolf encourages readers to make the craft their own and explore it further.(she does list other books to read for further information doesn't she?) I think this is probably one of her best books and I am going to recommend it to mid-learners and adults alike. You can never have too much Silver in your life!"},{"Title":"Solitary Witch: The Ultimate Book of Shadows for the New Generation","review":"I'm not RavenWolf's biggest fan, but this book is pretty good. I agree with the reviewer below who says this shouldn't be your first book. It would indeed be confusing if you had no background in the Craft, since it's not written in a narrative, read-from-beginning-to-end style. It's more like an encyclopedia or cookbook, and jumps from topic to topic with little fanfare or segue. This works pretty well, since if you're a beginner you can find fairly basic stuff easily, and if you've been around a while you can skip ahead to the new stuff.This book contains such things as extensive correspondence tables, spells and chants (well-written, poetry-wise), and advice on various sorts of situations. I was personally pleased to see a section on the Moon Mansions, since they're a particular fascination of mine, and there's not much information about them readily available. I think that's what most people will get from this book--a few treasures that happen to be what they were looking for. Like I mentioned in the title of my review, there's something for everyone.I will concur with other reviewers--this book is mostly written for the teen witch. You don't have to be a teen to read it, but RavenWolf touches on a lot of subjects that are of concern to teens, and helps them find a sense of personal empowerment. She's been criticized for talking down to teens, but I didn't really sense that in this particular book. She's also been criticized for encouraging teens to question authority, but as she says, there are adults out there who don't have teens' best interests at heart! Abusive parents and teachers, sad to say, are out there, and to exhort teens to blindly accept whatever they say is more condescending than RavenWolf's books. And even a teen whose parents and teachers are caring is going through a time when it's natural to question authority. It's part of the process of growing up and forming one's own opinions. Yes, adults can legally control teens' actions, but I don't believe that a teen has to eradicate even rebellious *thoughts* from her/his mind. (This is in response to criticism of RavenWolf's earlier books--she was blasted for saying a teen could be Pagan even if his or her parents disapproved.)I do have two gripes:(1) She criticizes the village &quot;cunning folk&quot; of the past for using the practices of witchcraft without the religion, and even implies that they brought on the witch persecutions. This is not true. These &quot;cunning folk&quot; lived in a time when there was little surviving pagan lore or belief, and of course they would have used only fragments of the old religion, if they used any pagan lore at all. And the witch persecutions were not about paganism, they were about politics and money. The people who were killed were not killed for being pagan, they were killed for being unpopular.(2) A less serious issue, but still irked me--Acne is *not* caused by being dirty! RavenWolf implies that teens who have acne probably have it because they are too lazy to wash their faces. In fact, acne is usually caused by hormonal imbalances, especially an excess of testosterone. Who do you think steroid users break out? And why do girls break out during PMS? Testosterone levels are out of whack. If a teenager who washes her face twice a day but still has zits reads _Solitary Witch_, she may come to believe she's not clean enough--and over-washing the face can actually irritate it and lead to more blemishes."},{"Title":"Solitary Witch: The Ultimate Book of Shadows for the New Generation","review":"Those of us in the pagan/wiccan community rarely take Silver RavenWolf's writings as serious in nature, as her writings are filled with condescending tone, advice to lie for teens, and an obvious gimmick to make money without any regard for gaining credibility for the pagan community. If you are looking for credible resources, look to Scott Cunningham, Raymond Buckland, Christopher Penczak, Ellen Dugan, but if you see Silver RavenWolf RUN the other way."},{"Title":"Solitary Witch: The Ultimate Book of Shadows for the New Generation","review":"Silver has kept targeting the young audience since her first books. However that does not mean the information is childish or in any way bad. In fact in this huge book which becomes biggeer with her smaller print she has packed in TONS of information. If you can look past the silly teen anecdotes and mama silver type stuff you'll find a book filled with valuble info. I own this book and while I wouldn't say it's a must have, it's definitely taught me a lot that's missing from other 101 books"},{"Title":"Solitary Witch: The Ultimate Book of Shadows for the New Generation","review":"First, what she presents here is \\"outer court material\\" (and I'm being charitable). \\"Outer court material\\" is simply information not bound by secrecy oaths. An analogy -- there is a difference between the owner's manual you get when you open the box containing your new microwave and the technical specifications and drawings which detail the inner workings of said microwave. This book is like the owner's manual. Here the analogy breaks down because all the average person needs to operate a microwave is the instruction booklet but Wicca/Witchcraft/Magick requires the technical specifications which you are unlikely to ever find in a commercially available book -- aka \\"inner court material.\\" Without this, you are just going through the motions.Second, understand that the danger presented by Silver Ravenwolf and similar authors is that they do not make this distinction -- and they KNOW there is one -- choosing instead to present this \\"outer court material\\" as the whole ball of wax. Want to know why your spells don't work and you feel like you're in the middle of a fairly boring role-playing game when you follow rituals you find in these books? It's because you are lacking crucial information regarding what these spells and rituals actually represent, the so-called \\"mystery teachings.\\" Much of this is oath-bound and you are unlikely to find it in a book. Find a teacher, and if there are none where you are, sit under a full moon and ask the deity to reveal these mysteries to you. If your intention is true, and you are ready, they will teach and give you more than you will ever get out of any book.Third, this book is a.) poorly written b.) shows a terrible grasp of history and historical context c.) is incredibly condescending and d.) annoyingly folksy.Finally, think on Silver Ravenwolf's lineage. It implies a Gardnerian connection impossible by Gardnerian standards as men are initiated/elevated by women and vice versa. A true lineage will reflect this. Gerald Gardner could not initiate/elevate Buckland *according to Gardnerian practice.* In fact, Buckland was initiated by Lady Olwen. It is at best disingenous to include Gerald Gardner as part of her lineage because Gardner has nothing to do with it other than initiating the woman who later initiated Buckland in one of the Traditions Buckland followed. Buckland later developed Seax-Wicca, in which he trained/initiated Michael Ragan, who immediately went and formed his OWN tradition and so on down the line. Another analogy -- you're related to your mother's sister's husband by law, but you are not related to him by blood. Buckland would be Ravenwolf's mother's father, Gardner would be her mother's father's sister's husband.I would be surprised if Silver Ravenwolf wasn't aware of this, and one wonders why someone so in tune with \\"Spirit\\" would continue to advertise a lineage which has been questioned by many -- or at the very least, explain why she believes it to be valid. I've seen some nonsense by a separate group consisting of people elevated by Silver Ravenwolf, claiming the same lineage and saying the connection is through the \\"honor of eldering\\" rather than initiation or elevation. To which I reply -- nonsense. Even if you were to consider \\"eldering\\" separate from degree elevation it still doesn't address the fact that Buckland was in no way \\"eldered\\" by Gardner and Ragan was in no way \\"eldered\\" by Buckland.The moral of the story folks, is no one's perfect and always consider your source. Deity never minds healthy skepticism.(BTW, MoonChyld DewDrop is meant to be sarcastic, and I make no claims to a lineage from anyone at all)"},{"Title":"Solitary Witch: The Ultimate Book of Shadows for the New Generation","review":"Only this go around it's all on one book!I've had my issues with Silver RavenWolf in the past. One of my biggest complaints was her &quot;Mama Silver&quot; approach. That may be fine for the teenage witch market, but those of us who have been on the path for serveral years find it a bit annoying.In this particular volume, Silver manages to recap everything that she's written in the past few years (errors included) in a type of encyclopedia form.While some of the information is very detailed and well researched, other areas lack such attention. You can see here, yet again, Silver's marketing towards the teen witches in Spells she has included. I would also like to note that several of her spells are not Wiccan in format, they are more based on the Pow-Wow teachings.Personally I am a bit torn on this book. I have definately found useful information in an easy to find format, but I feel this isn't a starter book. If you're a more experienced witch wanting something easy to grab off the shelf when you can't recall exactly what kinds of spells to do during Jupiter's retrograde, this is the book for you. However, if you're just looking to get started this book might not be what you're needing just yet.RavenWolf said it herself in the book's introduction: &quot;How you use this book is entirely up to you. Feel free to skip over the parts that you already know, or read each section in alphabetical order - doesn't matter.&quot; ... &quot;On the other hand, if you feel the information is too basic, I beg your indulgence - it isn't my desire to insult your intelligence, I'm simply trying to find a happy medium.&quot;I think overall she's done it."},{"Title":"Solitary Witch: The Ultimate Book of Shadows for the New Generation","review":"Solitary Witch is a collection of information, some good, some bad, spliced together with Silver Ravenwolf's quick-fix low theology Wicca lite.I gave it two stars, instead of one, because it shows that perhaps Ravenwolf has been listening to her community. She still gets many things wrong-NOT ALL WITCHES ARE WICCAN, for example, but she seems to be trying.I would recommend anything by Cunningham, Buckland or Dunwich above this book, but if you are a teen who, for whatever reason, feels you need a dumbed down teen book, this is heads and tails over &quot;Teen Witch&quot; for quality.That being said, I feel the target age for this book is about 11-12, and I'm not sure it's appropriate for that age. As a mother of teens, if I gave it to my girls, they'd be offended.That, with all the other problems with Ravenwolf makes this a good book to pass over.Kids don't need Wicca dumbed down or misrepresented, they are just as capable of reading Cunningham as any of us old farts."},{"Title":"Solitary Witch: The Ultimate Book of Shadows for the New Generation","review":"The last segment in this book (part 5) appears geared to teens, though the information can be adapted to be useful for someone of any age. I wonder why Silver didn't take these 100-odd pages, add a bit more information, and make a sequel to TEEN WITCH as opposed to placing them at the end of this Book of Shadows. The Book of Shadows is plenty large as it is. However, being as I'd have bought either I suppose I can consider them a bonus here; I just hope other readers aren't put off by the inclusion of this information and think this is another book geared for kids.The rest of the book, however, is really an any-age collection for the Solitary Wiccan. Silver tackles questions like: the difficulty/challenges with calling oneself a Christian Witch, to use or not use blades in ritual, and other issues that aren't discussed in the typical Wicca 101 books. Plus, lots of great spells and ideas. With its sheer size, this book is real value for the money. While the encyclopedia-type format with its alphabetical order listings isn't as outright readable as her prior New Generation Witchcraft titles, this is the kind of book you can leave open on your coffee table and read a few headings at a time.If anything, this reminds me of a much more readable, accessible and friendly version of Raymond Buckland's Complete Book of Witchcraft."},{"Title":"Solitary Witch: The Ultimate Book of Shadows for the New Generation","review":"Silver RavenWolf seems to be either loved or reviled. I think perhaps the reviling is based on jealousy. Silver has produced many books that have helped others get a toehold in Witchcraft with books that are easy to read and practical. Solitary Witch is a huge undertaking. Silver explains difficult concepts, addresses the needs of the Solitaire, and provides detailed rituals and explanations that should be useful to anyone who has an interest in Witchcraft but either has to work alone or prefers to. Get over the fact that Silver has been a successful writer about the religion she loves. That's not a crime, you know. Cover up her name if you must and open your mind long enough to take an objective look at what a wonderful resource she has created. I believe this book will still be being used when all of us are dead and gone. &quot;Hi Ho, Silver!!!&quot;"},{"Title":"Solitary Witch: The Ultimate Book of Shadows for the New Generation","review":"While this book does have good basic information for beginners, I would only reccomend it to people who have already read books by Cunningham, Buckland, or other authors; this book tends to gloss over what Wicca should really be about, and instead focuses on the fancy shiny tools and fun easy spells. She talks in the book about the power of visualization, meditation, and focus, but her spells generally seem to omit it. Some of the spells or incantations could be built on by more experienced Wiccans, and there are occasional gems of information in the book, but overall, it isn't worth it. Read other books about Wicca first, and if you absolutely must come back to this one, don't bother to buy it. Borrow it from the library or from a friend.If you really want to read a book by Silver Ravenwolf, I suggest her book on American Folk Magic instead.

I know that some poeple are saying that she's so commercial and Llewellyn is a joke of a publishing company that simply reprints the same watered-down drivel with different covers and author names, which I can agree with MOST OF THE TIME. Not this time. Great job Silver! Blessed be!"},{"Title":"Solitary Witch: The Ultimate Book of Shadows for the New Generation","review":"While this book does contain a lot of information, it's mostly fluff. Also, if you do your research, a lot of it is way off. This book was written for the fluffy bunnies, not for the serious practitioner."},{"Title":"Solitary Witch: The Ultimate Book of Shadows for the New Generation","review":"This book is a good place for more itermediate students of the craft. Some people complain about miss Ravenwolf's style. Since she aims her work at trying to simplify the Craft for the teenage neophyte,her books have been perhaps rightfully accused of being \\"fluffy\\". This book is certainly no different. The style is simplified. Easy to follow. But this isn't a book for the random neophyte. This book is more of a complete Book of Shadows,loaded with Silver's private spells,personal insights,and things beginners simply won't know. It's clear she expects the student who picks the up to already be familiar with the basic concepts of spellcraft,meditation,and magickal ethics. In fact if I remember correctly she even states something to that effect in the introduction,followed by a list of suggested reading materials to familirize oneself with the basics. That explains the certain lack of essential materials another reviewer pointed out earlier.The other thing that screams this isn't for the average neophyte is the sheer size of this thing! At 558 pages without the appendicies,this is the most completely book for the Solitary i think I've ever seen! But at that size it's a straight up intimidating book! It's massive! Before you even think about getting it,you have to decide if you have the time to set aside and seriously look at it,or even the storage space to do so. I know that's a turn-off to some people.And then,as that one other reviewer pointed out,there's the allusions to Christianity that pop up throughout. Personally I have no love lost for Christianity. The behavior of certain Christians and they way they twisted Christ's truly positive words to their bitter,prejudicial,discriminatory,biggotist,and downright hateful worldview pushed me far away from that path. But I don't see the problem here. As I have pointed out,Silver addresses her work towards a more mainstream audience,and isn't out to threaten them or denounce them,but rather lure them in to teach them some truths about this Path. And besides,one the things that attracted me to this way of life was it's non-prejudism and it's acceptance of the validity of other forms of spirituality. But apparently these allusions are a problem to some people. And so for them,this would not be the right book.So on final analysis,this is a good book if you can stand the fact that it's for somewhate more advanced students,is written in a rather mainstream than scholarly manner,is incredibly large,has a lot of Silver's own private spells over instructiosn on how to write your own,and has certain allusions you might not like. Otherwise,it's probably best to avoid it."},{"Title":"Solitary Witch: The Ultimate Book of Shadows for the New Generation","review":"I love the book.Some people said that is complicate.

Silver gives the readers a wide variety of great information. She includes many new spell ideas and spells, invocations (which are great), self initiation ritual ideas, Esbat and Sabbat ritual outlines with &quot;magickal ideas&quot; for each. The section on astrology is absolutely incredible. Silver writes about aspects, transits, etc. This is a great book. It is geared a little more towards a younger audience at times but as an adult reader, I still would recommend this book to any practicing witch, wiccan or pagan whatever their age! :)"},{"Title":"Solitary Witch: The Ultimate Book of Shadows for the New Generation","review":"Wonderful book.

It is definetly worth a read."},{"Title":"Solitary Witch: The Ultimate Book of Shadows for the New Generation","review":"For the new or practicing Witch, this book is filled with ideas and extremely useful information. It also gives reference to other books if you are seeking more detailed information as everything in the world cannot be packed into one (although it IS large!) book.I believe Silver RavenWolf to be a woman ahead of the times. She is practical, down-to-earth, and is responsible for much of the Wiccan movement of today. She is no fluff bunny, and the book is not meant just for teenagers. If you are a true seeker, you will use this book and her recommendations of other books.Do yourself a favor and buy this book immediately! I have learned more in the past few weeks than I have from many of the more well-known books that have been around for years.Silver is a delight, and I have all of her books. However, I find the Solitary Witch to be her finest work yet. I highly recommend it for all!Blessed Be!"},{"Title":"Solitary Witch: The Ultimate Book of Shadows for the New Generation","review":"Silver Ravenwolf is one of my favorite authors and teachers of Witchcraft!

This woman speaks of Christianity more than any other book I've seen. I've actually met one of her friends who say she gets a lot of grief for this. It's for a reason!!! I was told this was for Tolerance amongst religions...to I dunno say cover all her basis. Tolerance is great...I have many Christian friends...but when it comes down to it there is no point in trying to blend it with an already complicated religion. I myself am not Wiccan....I am Celtic Pagan...but have study both paths for 11 years. I've said my piece the choice is yours."},{"Title":"Solitary Witch: The Ultimate Book of Shadows for the New Generation","review":"I honestly believe that paganism, religion whatever you want to call it is about bettering yourself. Not begging to diety to give you everything you want. Silver claims to belive the same thing but then provides spells for love and money. How many books does she need to publish on the same information. It seems to me that she is just trying to get her 15 minutes of fame, and make a bunch of money. There is nothing new in this book that makes it a 'must read'. If you want an introduction Paganism: An Introduction to Earth-Centered Religions by Joyce and River Higginbotham is much better."},{"Title":"Solitary Witch: The Ultimate Book of Shadows for the New Generation","review":"This was the first time doing business with this company.

In short, I'm sorry to say it was a bit of a letdown. EXCEPT man that cover is wild! Might I make the suggestion that better packaging would help a future edition? By that I mean dress up the interior with art and design that matches the grand cover. That would really spark this tome up."},{"Title":"Solitary Witch: The Ultimate Book of Shadows for the New Generation","review":"This is a great, maybe invaluable book to have, but please buy more to get a different perspective. I do not want people to think that this is the only book you will need, it is not."},{"Title":"Solitary Witch: The Ultimate Book of Shadows for the New Generation","review":"Please, everyone thinking of buying this book stop beforehand and do a little research on Silver Ravenwolf. Go to any search engine and type in her name. The many misrepresentations in her books as well as the inconsistancies and flat out lies should be taken into account before you decide if you want to purchase any of her books or not.I say again:Do yourself a favor and look up this author before making any purchases."},{"Title":"Solitary Witch: The Ultimate Book of Shadows for the New Generation","review":"I never really liked Ravenwolf's work.It teaches to the pagan community how \\"cool\\" it is to be wiccan.With this book it wasn't like she was typing to a 5 year old which was better but, it still holds all the superficial glamour teachings and spells which I think is ignorant.All of these kids/teenagers are being lead on that magick and being a witch is a end to all your social problems.Well let me warn you, it's not.But I personally believe if you're going to study paganism or wicca read everything you can and take from it what you feel is true."},{"Title":"Solitary Witch: The Ultimate Book of Shadows for the New Generation","review":"I want to like Silver. I really do. I want to give every Pagan writer the benefit of the doubt, and believe that even if they are saying things that make me want to rip my hair out, they have the best interests of the community (as they understand that to mean) at heart.I just wish she'd *write* better.For someone who claims to have started out as an editor, she writes with a cloying tone, often fails to explain her terms or to present information in a logical order (here she doesn't even try), and leaves in all sorts of mistakes, both of information and of clear writing.So why three stars? Because for once, this one occasionally spits up some information that I haven't already seen everywhere else. In amongst the Christian bashing and the winking and the poems so bad I have to scream (an affliction that is hardly unique to Silver, I'm afraid) there are actually some &quot;articles&quot; that contain information. Particularly, there's a lot of astrological lore that is less common in other books. Unfortunately I can't take her at her word about any of it, because I've seen her make so many mistakes on things that I know more about - but at least it's a starting place. It's far from the worst thing she's written."},{"Title":"Solitary Witch: The Ultimate Book of Shadows for the New Generation","review":"How many times can the same thing be said in a different way? Well, apparently at least one more time. I have to admit that this book is not as nice as author's usual work. And although Silver's writings appear to still be targeting the Teen Market.i have nothing wrong with this but one thing and reason i gave it a 3 is the fact true folks, magickal timing is very important in rites. i think for some people who are new to craft they might go &quot;huh&quot; in that chapter i thought for some newbies may get lost and the book does give ref's in back but expect to spend more to understand i think that moon phases are important but when she talks about planets on day of week and month may confuse some reading who bought this book as their first bookStill, I think some of the topics covered in this book like spells for acne, which would have been great for her teen witch book. But i do like her open mindedness on her writing but some of things in her book maybe be alittle to advanced for a person new to craft. Still overall not bad a book was fun to read but i bought this book to see her style of writing and view on craft not bad but not a end all on the craft but as for acne spell issue if it work great for you just view all book as a author opinion. Her eclectic style was nice to see.Not best beginner guide but not the worst and some nice imfo overall.Blessed Be:"},{"Title":"Solitary Witch: The Ultimate Book of Shadows for the New Generation","review":"I bought this because it seemed to cover a lot of territory. In the end, that's its biggest fault--kind of a lick and a promise approach. Even worse is that this author seems to devote much of her efforts to feeding the usual teenaged angst, and giving youngsters the idea SHE is the only one who understands them. . . very dangerous territory, IMO. One thing to offer generic advice, and another to try to generate a cult following. Some useful stuff within, but even more to have to sift through with a grain of salt. If you're new to this topic, don't make the mistake of ending your search here."},{"Title":"Solitary Witch: The Ultimate Book of Shadows for the New Generation","review":"If you're looking for a re-hashed conglomerate of all the books on the craft out there, then go ahead and buy this book. Here, Silver has successfully minced up her old works, thrown in some bogus information to taste, and hit the puree button on the proverbial blender.Personally, I wouldn't bother with the investment. I borrowed the book from a friend, and returned it disgusted, not wanting to buy it for myself. In this book, there are places where Silver begins to Christanize some of the Pagan ideas... in my opinion, she's just selling out her craft.If you're looking to get started in the craft, I would absoluely recommend some of her earlier books, like &quot;To Ride a Silver Broomstick&quot; and &quot;To Stir a Magick Cauldron.&quot; These books are excellent, and essential additions to the library of any serious Witch. This new book, however, is defiently one that my bookshelf will be happier without!"},{"Title":"Solitary Witch: The Ultimate Book of Shadows for the New Generation","review":"I have had SRW's \\"Solitary Witch: The Ultimate Book of Shadows for the New Generation\\" since 2005, and it is a reference I have gone back to many times. SRW has packed an incredible amount of information into this Book of Shadows. It truly is a good overview for the new learner and the experienced Witch, the Solitary Practitioner and the Covener.This book has been criticized by some for not going into enough detail in some areas, such as detailed information on writing and performing the reader's own rituals. On page 23, there is a basic outline for an Esbat Ritual, and explanation is given of Sabbat Rituals and examples of both are given. The reader is encouraged to change the words to suit their liking. She also encourages the reader to read other books by herself and others for further explanation.The book is quite extensive in its scope. There are examples of Rites of Passage Rituals from before birth to Passing Over; ideas for Esbat Rituals; the Eight Sabbats; how to make Holy Water; how to make Sacred Space/Sacred Circle; create the Cone of Power; commune with the Divine; call the Watchtowers/Spirits of the Elements; learn the Wiccan Rede/Witches' Creed; The Wheel of the Year; Magickal Tools; Cleansing, Consecrating, and Empowering Items; information on Spirit Guides, Astrology, Auras, Divination, and much more.There is also an excellent Bibliography, with books from the best authors in the business. An excellent jumping board to fill your personal library."},{"Title":"Solitary Witch: The Ultimate Book of Shadows for the New Generation","review":"I remember starting with Silver's books back in 2001. It is now 2011, and I have sold ALL but one of the books I owned by Silver. That one is the \\"Solitary Witch: Book of Shadows for a New Generation.\\"Indeed, this book has served its purpose many times over, full of bookmarks and highlighted passages, especially concerning astrology and moon phase correspondences.The first three books, \\"To Ride,\\" \\"To Stir,\\" and \\"To Light\\" hold out for the newbie a progression of study already written out and prescribed by Silver's tradition. That's fine if you're fresh out of mainstream religion and still need someone to hold your hand, mystically speaking--especially if you're from a part of Christianity that does not much hold with anything mystical and they leave the \\"Divinum Mysterium\\" to those of a more Catholic or Episcopalian persuasion.Being someone who grew up as something of a mystical person in her own right, I felt that the first three books Silver wrote were very interesting--especially her stories about her family...but try as I might to follow Silver's pre-written exercises, I felt no real connection. This was HER path. Not mine. She gave me the tips and the tools, and I just took the proverbial ball and ran with it.So now she comes up with this ultimate book of shadows thing and I think, \\"Now THAT is something I can read over and over for reference and really build my own practice out of it.\\" So I buy it. Disappointed? Not in the least. It gives me the \\"bits n bobs\\" without the pre-ordained ceremonial hoopla. After all, I'm a solitary, and it is very likely I will stay that way. As a solitary, I am free to commune with the Divine Source however I wish. To make my own magickal recipes, as it were. Silver's ultimate book of shadows allows me to do precisely this--as well as refresh my memory on some things.This book is permanently on my shelf next to Scott Cunningham's completely indispensable encyclopedia books of herbs and stones.My overall recommendation?Buy the book if you're a \\"self-starter,\\" have no interest in following someone else's tradition because you've already forged a deep connection with the Source on your own in your own way, yet want to find ways to build your magickal muscles on your own.Buy this book if you want a side reference to her first three books, if you're a newbie.Don't buy this book if you believe in leaving books in pristine condition, because this book BEGS to be used like a college text! In fact, that's the best way to use it, really. By using it this way, I have learned far more than if I had left the book spotless. But then that's my desire for higher learning (without the big college bills) coming through. ;-)"},{"Title":"Solitary Witch: The Ultimate Book of Shadows for the New Generation","review":"I purchased this book because my neighbor said it was great and her mom had it. After reading the book I found that it is indeed a great book. However it is more focused toward the Teen witch. Most of the writing is telling the reader to ask their parent or talks about how the readers parents feel. Although a lot of the book focuses on this I found that I do like some of the material and found some to be helpful. It's a good book it should just be less focused on the teen and more on all solitary witches."},{"Title":"Solitary Witch: The Ultimate Book of Shadows for the New Generation","review":"This book is the ultimate book of shadows .A very well written and easy to read book.A great book for the new witch.I have learned a lot from this book"},{"Title":"Solitary Witch: The Ultimate Book of Shadows for the New Generation","review":"This book is one of the best around for info on learn skills to be a pagan or wiccan or just how to live with nature!, Love Silver Ravenwolf's books, hope to get more soon!"},{"Title":"Solitary Witch: The Ultimate Book of Shadows for the New Generation","review":"I Purchased this for a very close friend.

I have quite of few books in my courses but this book is cute and can help teens but not everone is a teen either if she wanted acne spell then she needed to put teen witch book.I do agree with her on some points using creativity in rites is a great idea but some of stuff seems to complex for some (hint) Some of most powerful,effective rites come from within. like all books they are opinions take them at face value and use what works for you.Blessed Be;"},{"Title":"Solitary Witch: The Ultimate Book of Shadows for the New Generation","review":"About a year ago I wrote to Silver and asked if she was going to be writing anything to pertain to people who lived in apartments and dorms, where freedom of the outdoors was not always possible.

It should be part of every witch's reading .

She encourages you to look at other sources for in-depth information, but gives a solid background in many areas of Wicca. Some areas I found helpful include the sections on astrology, animal totems (very brief - but includes a variety of real and fantasy animals), scrying, dowsing, grounding and centering, and general divination tips.On the negative side, some parts, particulary the last chapter, seem too teen-oriented and full of mass-markety sort of spells.

My only problems with it is, that it's called Solitary Witch, but many of the recipes are obviously ment for large groups of people. But that's easily overlookable."},{"Title":"Solitary Witch: The Ultimate Book of Shadows for the New Generation","review":"When I first began down the path of Wicca, it was recommended to me that I purchase Silver Ravenwolf's books. So I went out and purchased all of them at one time. What a waste of money!These books read like a first grader's primer. They are quite elementary in nature. They don't really teach you how to do anything on your own. You basically learn Silver's way of doing it and that's that. She contradicts herself right and left and is very condescending at times. She also bashes Christians and people of religions other than Wicca.The way that the material is presented by Silver is as if she is the only person who is right when it comes to how to practice Wicca. Unfortunately, there are some that have bought into Silver's teachings. I once joined a coven before learning that the Priestess was a fan of Silver Ravenwolf's and that the coven members hung on every word that she wrote or spoke. I lasted about four months before I realized that I wasn't learning anything more than what Silver taught them in her books. This was because Silver teaches her way of doing things, not how to do things. Penczak is a much better teacher than Silver. I recommend all his books to newbies.I guess that my biggest gripe is the fact that Silver really does think that she knows it all. Since my grandmother was a witch (not Wiccan), I learned a lot from her. She would take me out to the woods and teach me about herbs and the animals. She taught me how to decant and store herbs, make potions, lotions, poultices, medications, etc. She taught me about the energies and how to manipulate them. What I learned from Grandma, I was able to take and make my own with changes and such. That is the way a person should teach another. But that is not what Silver does. She teaches her way and her way only.Why did I want to explore Wicca? Because I wanted to see if there was anything that I missed out on. Believe me, what Silver teaches isn't anything compared to what my grandmother taught me. The only good thing to come from Silver's books is that I am working on a book about what my grandmother taught me. At least Silver's books weren't a total waste."},{"Title":"Solitary Witch: The Ultimate Book of Shadows for the New Generation","review":"I have tried to read the \\"whole\\" of the book, but find that the book has too many \\"holes\\".For those who are interested in the Wiccan path, read Scott Cunningham as a start as he, and there are others, who explain and teach with great wisdom.I am sorry I am not s fan of hers, but I find her books more for teenagers and certainly they should not be reading Silverwolf without having read a proper authority on Wicca.

It would've been nice if I had someone at the time to advice me against spending that $20...I am against any religious bashing, which Ravenwolf does a couple of times towards Christianity. Bashing is a pretty strong word, but still -- what right do any of us have to call another religion's believes \\"superstitions\\"?I wish so badly that this book, when it came to the spells and rituals, would be more of a guide instead of a step by step instruction manual.I also wish that there was SOMETHING about the Rede in there, something more about meditation, and karma...To make a long story short:I recycled it.And that says a lot.Find another book -- please."},{"Title":"Solitary Witch: The Ultimate Book of Shadows for the New Generation","review":"Despite my opinion of some of Silver Ravenwolf's book, and the many negative reviews of this book, I highly recommend Solitary Witch.

If you don't like that, then don't read it. I am currently showing my younger sibling the different religous ways, and silver ravenwolf was one of the things I showed them.

I have a few problems with the book listed below.The book offered a lot of information, but it was unevenly distributed. In other words: some topics (for example, Astrological section)was very informative, and others (for example, The Astral sections) were very vague barely scraping the subject. I felt this section was put in for the sake of putting it in. The book, in my opinion, would have been better served without it. It left me feeling lacking in knowledge: especially compared with the very informative astrological section.In the future, if this book is revised I hope the author considers either expanding on the subjects that are barely grazed or leaving it out of the book. Remember, you can't miss what you didn't have!Overall I rate it a solid 4 for the reasons above."},{"Title":"Solitary Witch: The Ultimate Book of Shadows for the New Generation","review":"i loved this book it was one of the first books i read on the subject and believe it to be a good book for anyone to read weather they be a beginner or a long time practioner"},{"Title":"Solitary Witch: The Ultimate Book of Shadows for the New Generation","review":"I find this book one of the best(if not the best)in infomation in wiccary, its a great read.Great for begginers. :)"},{"Title":"Solitary Witch: The Ultimate Book of Shadows for the New Generation","review":"Well, I have to confess....

You can realize that it's coming from a skeptic of Ravenwolf!! Lots of pages in this book - 590pages!!

It has loads of information and a lot of research useful to anyone. However, this book recieved only 4 stars from me because this book seems geared towards teens again(spells for lockers,teachers,acne,crushes)and nothing in its desciption or preface elludes to that. Not that there is anything wrong with that, and she does have plenty of info for adults, but I was expecting an adult title and it seems like she is talking straight to young adults. But it is a great addition to any collection, and I do recommend it if you like Silver's other titles."},{"Title":"Solitary Witch: The Ultimate Book of Shadows for the New Generation","review":"Has she stopped researching for these books? I have never returned a book in my life but this one went back to the store. Being Asatru I immediately opened up to the section on runes. That was a joke, they were completely messed up. She changed the names, swapped meanings for the runes, and even included the blank one. Runes are not something that one can debate on, they are what they are. The section of teenie bopper spells was memorable. Of course that kind of throws the three fold rule out the window. Or drives the witch performing them into a pickle, I would not want that backlash. This book was a waste of perfectly good paper."},{"Title":"Solitary Witch: The Ultimate Book of Shadows for the New Generation","review":"I have read some of the reviews here both good and bad. I think that what is being lost here is that Silver is trying to reach many people and help them have an understanding of the Craft. I have read many books on the Craft in my search to gain knowledge and understand who I am as a witch. Every book I have read I have been able to learn something from. To those that put Silver down, is it not hard enough to be a witch in times were others don't understand? Some of the comments on her book sounded personal and it was just suppose to be a book review. For myself Only: I use this book for reference when I am working on a paper but I also use other books to. I am not a Wiccan and follow Gerald Gardeners teachings, I am a Witch and follow the Craft. In the Craft, which is older than Gardener\\"s teachings which his is a mix of three things not just witchcraft, we believe that the woman is in charge not a man. A man can work beside us but not be in charge whereas with Gardener he wanted to be in charge and created his own religion. I am not saying he was wrong just did things differently. Buckland was one of his students and there are many Wiccan writers who followed his path but it was not the only path. Silver teaches in a more soft way and she tries to let you know a bit about everything. As a witch we are not bound to one way of thinking so adding in Reiki is not against the rules as one person commented. Our religion does not say we can't do anything except harm another or ourselves. So many doors are open and I believe that Silver what trying to expose us all to other thoughts on things, to expand our knowledge and that is always a good thing. As witches we have enough anger thrown at us so perhaps we should remember that and look at something with an open mind and allow others to find their own path. If that path is liking Silver's books then so be it. I myself like her books and have used some of her things in my practice of the Craft. There are other authors like Ellen Dugan and Deborah Blake and Scott Cunningham and so on that you can study as well but Silver has a place in this list of good witch authors. This book is a good book and has many things to teach."},{"Title":"Solitary Witch: The Ultimate Book of Shadows for the New Generation","review":"This book is a decent encyclopedia. Meaning you go do your own thing, then, reference this book, then go back to your own thing. Ravenwolf is very motherly, to the point of being smothering. If you're really into being spoonfed, and long winded, winding incantations, speeches to the Gods, the same point being beaten into you, then this book is for you. Like you'll probably give it 5 stars. And there's nothing wrong with that.But, for me, it's a bit much. Too much drama. I'd rather not have a 2 page lecture on why you should not steal a cupcake and how this related to karma and peer pressure, (pg 532). Save it for the kiddie books. I prefer Scott Cunningham's writing style, and relaxed take. (He actually writes like I'm an adult not a complete idiot?)However, I have used this book quite a bit as a reference tool. Old spells and chants, runes, divination. Yay.Skip the mommy witch crap, get the information, get out."},{"Title":"Solitary Witch: The Ultimate Book of Shadows for the New Generation","review":"Silver RavenWolf is a very popular member of the Wiccan world. She has written several books on the subject as well, including To Ride A Silver Broomstick, Teen Witch, Halloween, Silver's Spells for Love, and more. She approches her topic with a light hearted sense of humor and nearly a lifetime's worth of knowlegde.Solitary Witch is for anyone knew to the Craft, or anyone who would like to learn more, as well as secondary level craft users. It's divided into five parts to help break down all the information. At times, it can be overwhelming just how much there is to know, but Silver explains it in a way that makes it more simple and friendly to all readers.This book is recommended for slightly older readers, simply because of the amount of information within."},{"Title":"Solitary Witch: The Ultimate Book of Shadows for the New Generation","review":"For what the book offers it is well organized and useful in format. Unfortunately the material itself is the standard watered-down and distorted Craft content designed for teens that we've seen time and time again. There is however something curious that arises in this book.Here Ravenwolf presents the Charge of the Goddess, and remarks that this version appeared in The Grimoire of Lady Sheba (published in 1972). However, she alters the original text without indicating this was done. This is not only extremely improper protocol for an author when quoting another, but also raises the question of professional ethics. The omitted passage originally read &quot;...and as a sign that ye be really free, ye shall be naked in your rites and ye shall sing...&quot; Ravenwolf alters the text to read &quot;...and as a sign that ye be really free, ye shall sing...&quot;While the author is certainly entitled to her own inhibitions, this does not extend to altering the meaning of another author's work. On page 71 Ravenwolf writes about ritual nudity (skyclad) saying: &quot;...skyclad has fallen out of favor in most Wiccan groups.&quot; which is apparently wishful thinking on the part of this author.All in all the book is essentially a compilation of the author's earlier works, promoting &quot;Next Generation Witchcraft&quot; which is the author's own invention and is tailored to attract the teen market whose disposable income is a target for many."},{"Title":"Solitary Witch: The Ultimate Book of Shadows for the New Generation","review":"If you have already learned the basics of wicca, this is the next book to get. This book offers information of everything from circle casting, calling the quarters, and cleansing an area to palmistry, tarot layouts, faeries, tons of rituals and spells, and so much more. Not only does Silver explain what each subject is, but she offers plenty of information on the subject and gives ways to practice the subject practically. It is a huge book anyway, and is loaded with information. If you have read a begginer's book, like Scott Cunningham's or some of Silver's other begginers books, and have been practicing the energy excercises and been truly practicing wicca, then this book is for you. I recomend this book to anyone that is a step above the begginers level. Thank you Silver for yet another great book!"},{"Title":"Solitary Witch: The Ultimate Book of Shadows for the New Generation","review":"Like several other reviewers here, I thought \\"wow, this is a BIG book so it must contain lots of stuff!\\" Well, yes and no. It IS big and it DOES contain lots of stuff but not necessarily lots of USEFUL stuff.I have read several other of Silver's books and must say that she is not my favorite pagan author. She can be confusing and is obviously out to look \\"cool\\" and make a buck but she is amusing and sometimes informative. This time, however, it looks like she bit off a bit more than she could chew.My first complaint is the format; it is very confusing and skips around far too much. I agree with others that this should not be your 1st book on Wicca. She writes as though she were reviewing techniques and concepts that she has already explained -- apparently elsewhere. Even the basics like casting a circle aren't very well explained. And while you're reading along, suddenly you stumble over a bit that someone else has written concerning \\"other\\" types of magick (such as hoo-doo) that really don't add to the part you were reading and, in fact, are often inaccurate.My other complaint is that this book is obviously written for the teenager. I am not a teenager. I therefore did not buy (or read) her books on teenage witches. I resent having purchased a book under what I consider false pretenses -- i.e. that this book was for an adult, solitary witch. I do not need help with my homework, with acne or with peer pressure. Most of the spells she gives are geared for these kinds of things and that irritated me a lot. I would've thought she more than covered these things in her other teenage-geared books but apparently she feels these things are also of concern for the adult witch. Sorry, Silver, they aren't. Granted, teenagers are more easily manipulated to a particular viewpoint than adults (most adults anyway) so I would predict that those books sell better. But why insult the adults with a supposed \\"ultimate book of shadows\\" that is really geared to kids?On the plus side, she is an amusing author -- even if she doesn't have the grounding in quantum mechanics that she'd like us to believe. There is some helpful information in this book, but you'll have to dig for it. I'd recommend Scott Cunningham's books instead if you are serious about the Craft."},{"Title":"Solitary Witch: The Ultimate Book of Shadows for the New Generation","review":"There are plenty of books that cover specific aspects of Wicca more thoroughly, but this is a good encyclopedic look at anything and everything that could cross your mind in the course of Wiccan life. It may not be the coziest thing to curl up with in your favorite chair, but it's a great tool. I think this is a must for the mid-level practitioner. Many solitaries read a couple of basic books, decide the faith is for them, but are unsure of the next step. This covers things one may not have previously read about (at 590 pages it's much longer than many Wiccan books) and opens up new possibilites for the mid-level Witch. It retains its use as a reference as one continues on ones' spiritual path. A word of caution, though, it is intended for young people. There are spells for dealing with tough teachers, etc., that may be useless to someone who has left that phase in her life. For a teen/twenty-something, however, it's a lifesaver. If I had the money and wasn't afraid of being tarred and feathered I would buy a copy of this and donate it to the local high schools to help all of the kids going though the same thing I experienced."},{"Title":"Solitary Witch: The Ultimate Book of Shadows for the New Generation","review":"I really liked this book. It has really helped me in my journey towards wicca. Although I have put it up, I definitely recommend this to anyone just starting out. It has many different chapters on all kinds of subjects, from dedication ceremonies to protection spells. If you're looking for something to give you guidence, this is definitely the book!"},{"Title":"Solitary Witch: The Ultimate Book of Shadows for the New Generation","review":"Bottom line: some people might find it helpful. There are good resources here and solid information on lunar cycles, history, etc. But some parts of the book are flat-out wrong. She claims that the Hand of Glory wasn't &quot;an actual hand&quot;! Sorry, $ilver, but blood of bat and tongue of dog weren't just &quot;herbal codes&quot;, they were quite real.The book is geared to teenagers, and while it isn't too condescending, a lot of people are going to find it unbelievably silly. If you can stand her horribly annoying diction and you're well-versed enough to know what is and isn't fact, buy it. Otherwise, see if you can scalp it to a neighborhood teenybopper."},{"Title":"Solitary Witch: The Ultimate Book of Shadows for the New Generation","review":"what wrong with you people if you read her other books it says New Generation Witches and then say Witches of the ninties and in the descrition of the book in the back of others it says big book for pagan teens"},{"Title":"Solitary Witch: The Ultimate Book of Shadows for the New Generation","review":"Why is she still able to sell this crap!"},{"Title":"Solitary Witch: The Ultimate Book of Shadows for the New Generation","review":"In the world of witchcraft today, it can easily be observed by the casual onlooker that such books as this are responsible for the numerous people becoming interested in pagan spirituality. Books like this present information pretaining to the topic in an easy-to-follow and easy-to-understand format. Yet, this book and other books by this author are responsible for the wide circulation of plastic, childish, horribly misleading and inaccurate teachings of a religion today called \\"Wicca\\". To you folk who have \\"come to the Goddess\\", or \\"became a witch\\", by reading this book and others like it, I must say to you that are fools. Look at the situation people: here is a system of \\"magick\\" grounded in a \\"religion\\", that is nothing more than a loose compilation of eastern and western mysticism, personal anecdotes, unfounded claims, bogus teachings, childish magicks, and other such things that are all open to the public. People, I am sorry to say, you are not witches, nor are you adherents to a faith that has been \\"passed down by word of mouth for centuries\\" with beliefs in \\"karmic retribution\\", \\"Wiccan redes\\", and a mishmashed pantheon of deities from practically every culture. You are merely victims to a kind of industry falsely based upon feminism, magick, and harmony with nature. Wicca is nonsense, having no firm roots, no organization, and where nothing is sacred. Do you think that witches of the past who were illiterate and living in isolated communities knew anything of hermeticism, or eastern philosophy, and yoga and other such things? No! And do you think that your religion is what you think it is when everything is based upon the things stated above? Wicca is a plastic fabrication, bastardized by hundreds of authors like this one over half of a century. Authors like Silver Ravenwolf have hidden people under a mantle of lies and has made more abominations to the Craft than any author of her time! The Craft is real, as much as some might not like to think, and there are those who still know the true magicks and possess the true knowledge and can still call upon the Old Ones, and they are not sharing knowledge anytime soon. Of course, except for those who have become open to the technologies of the modern era. And even with them, authenticity must still be looked for and examined closely. True witches believe that only a witch can make a witch, and that the passing on of power is much like the passing on of a title...basically, you can't do it to yourself. But this book is not true witchcraft, and any who read it and claim power and knowledge from its teachings, really has nothing. THIS BOOK IS LIES! It is not even \\"Wicca\\" as was began decades ago by Gerald Gardner, which is entirely respectable in its own right. And I don't care if \\"Mama Silver\\" is a \\"lineaged witch\\"(a title which also was fabricated, and the title 'Witch' she has no right to claim). Nothing is held sacred by these hypocrites, as they, again, bastardize the teachings of those who taught them and interbreed them with others until the have a satisfactory body of 'lore'. Simply observe every overpriced book like this pertaining to Wicca on the market, and you will see what I mean. Soon, if you deny what I say now, you'll believe it in the future when your curiosity prompts research into Wicca's authenticity. The true Craft does exist in many forms,(this means that different forms are practiced by different people, but the different forms are always kept the same by those who practice them, as tradition always is) as still practiced by few people who hold it sacred and secret, and it is completely different from the Wicca presented in this book. The true seekers will find it, and will perhaps not like what they see as some may be hopelessly dependent on the \\"nice\\" \\"white\\" cushion of Wicca. But as was said, it is there, and it is not this. This book, if it deserves a name and title, I brand an abomination. Which in truth (and you all know this, Wiccans and Witches and Seekers alike), it is."},{"Title":"Solitary Witch: The Ultimate Book of Shadows for the New Generation","review":"I don't understand why Silver RavenWolf is so popular.

STOP WRITING SILVER!!"},{"Title":"Solitary Witch: The Ultimate Book of Shadows for the New Generation","review":"I'm a beginner, and although some people have mentioned that this is a better reference book than a beginner's book, I found it a nice blend of both. The index has every topic I could think of. The best part is that this book incorporates different spiritual ideas besides just Wicca, such as Reiki, which I found very helpful. A lot of the information is pretty basic, but she makes it easy to understand, and encourages readers to read more about the areas that we're interested in. It's not a structured book, which is a nice change and allows the reader to explore on his/her own.

Fine, but Silver Ravenwolf covers an awful lot of ground and I think, not deep enough into any one thing. She spends an inordinate amount of time on astrology, though, going into quite a bit of detail; but I didn't feel she gave enough detail in her explanations of why a certain mindset or ritual for example, is done the way it's done. A lot of it is her own interpretation of ritual or whatever. That said, if you are a teen and don't want to be talked down to, it's OK. But keep in mind you may want to go beyond what is presented here."},{"Title":"Solitary Witch: The Ultimate Book of Shadows for the New Generation","review":"While this book does contain some useful information, it can be misleading in some ways.

She was the 1st author I read (to ride a Silver broomstick) but I grew up pagan I was like 10.I definitely recommend Buckland or Cunningham to start for real meaty information.

I don't take everything somebody writes as the gospel and from some of the reviews I've read, there are various mistakes in this book; however this book has helped me tremendously and only given me the information to also seek other resources while I'm reading this book. Furthermore, Silver RavenWolf has been practicing the Craft way longer than I have and regardless to all the negative things I've read about her; she's helped me out a lot on my journey.

While it does cover a lot of topics, most are glazed over. She also spends pages and pages writing about things unrelated to the subject. It seemed like every sentence had extra words added to it to take up more space. There several instances where for four pages + (this book is pretty large) she typed and typed but managed to say nothing useful at all.I may be fairly new to this but I'm pretty sure glitter has no place in magick. The book does not talk about the gods and goddess save to provide a rather lame list of deities associated with each pantheon. Over and over again hiding your magickal activities is stressed. While the more important aspects, like being in touch with nature get misplaced behind Acne Removal spells.This book is definitely meant for teens.Her use of long repetitive phrases really bothers me because it seems like half the book is just filler. Not to mention the history being off and the almost total omission of deity.Don't buy this book."},{"Title":"Solitary Witch: The Ultimate Book of Shadows for the New Generation","review":"This is definitely a nice comprehensive book for any pagan book collection.

I am 16. I have read/owned her books since I was 11. When my (christian) aunt came into my room about one week ago when I was playing with my cousins, my immediate reaction was \\"Oh no, she's going to think I'm corrupting her children with what she thinks is a 'Satanic, evil' religion.\\" When I reflected upon my reaction, I realized I was judging my aunt, and Christianity, and that I, I was the one who was being judgmental and persecuting her. Silver Ravenwolf's books do slam Christians. I totally bought into her slander. Who doesn't want to feel better than one third of the world, more enlightened than one third of the world? Everyone wants to feel like they know secrets that other people do not. Everyone wants to be \\"right.\\" I was/am no exception. If you want tolerance, it is not in these books, although they preach tolerance.I have also come away with a paranoid attitude toward Wicca/Witchcraft. I feel like it is forbidden, hated by society. Silver Ravenwolf encourages teens to hide their practice from people for fear of persecution. Maybe she is right, but I feel scared to even TALK about it. That is not an attitude that anyone should have about divinity or their chosen religion.Also, if you asked me to define \\"Wicca\\" or \\"Witchcraft\\" I would give you a very vague answer. I do not know the difference - what have I been practicing?! I could tell you some stuff about paganism, but not Wicca.Well, I have begun studying ceremonial magic out of \\"Modern Magic\\" by Donald Michael Kraig. I have not read any reviews of the book, but I feel like I finally have an idea what I am supposed to be feeling in the rituals I perform. Kraig is very clear about what is factual history and what is mythical \\"history.\\" With Ravenwolf, spellcasting techniques were so vague that I felt I had no solid base to work from.The only way to practice a religion is the way it is meant to be practiced, not any way you feel like it. Even Wicca, a new religion, does have core beliefs that need to be adhered to. You can't just study the occult in general and consider yourself Wiccan or a Witch.DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK ESPECIALLY IF YOU ARE A BEGINNER. YOU WILL ONLY GET WRONG AND VAGUE INFORMATION.

And ALL times (this is an absolute must) keep a look out for things that don't sound right, or just in general set off your BS-dar.

So don't get stuck memorizing everything in her book you can, check facts with a variety of sources.

By such authors as Laurie Cabot, Janet & Stewart Farrar, and Doreen Valiente, etc. (All of whos work I emphatically recommend!) Now, I will admit that, although it truly isn't saying a whole lot, it is better than her previous books. Because, we should truly expect much better from authors amid the Pagan community! And, it is in this vein with which I write this review.Frankly, as a Witch, I cannot imagine that she would have called this book any \\"Ultimate Book of Shadows\\", because it certainly is no (truth be known) workable Book Of Shadows, becauyse of what simply is not within it's pages! If you look at any of the Outer Court Material (pre-Initiate training & published Books of Shadows) or the material from various Books of SHadows (such as Gardners or the Farrars' books) you'll see exactly what I'm referring to. This alleged \\"Ultimate Book of Shadows\\" bears no resemblance to treating Wtchcraft as a religion, and is sadly a disservice. Also, in that vein, there were several inaccuracies, which I would like to take the time to correct:* The majority of it can be found in her previous books, about 80-90%, in fact!* She makes several errors, such as stating that \\"Rede\\" is old english in origin. When, in fact, it is Saxon in origin and means \\"counsil\\" or \\"advice\\".* And, another error is that she claims \\"Theoretically, black is not a colour- it's the absense of light.\\" Not so- according to physics. As it was told to me by a Physics tutorial, the reason we percieve an asphalt road as black (their example) is because it's sub-atomic structure is pulling in and absorbing every frequency and colour in the spectrum! So, yes, black is a colour- it's the combonation of all colours! Or, put another way, black is the result of total light wave absorption!* She also makes a mockery of The Science Trad. of Witchcraft which I follow! And, her so-much as claiming to have studied physics is odd when one see's that she referrs to the reader over & over as an \\"observer\\". When according to physicists we are a \\"participator\\". And, the very word \\"observer\\" MUST be written off the books! This is one of the first things I learned in studying Science and Physics, (I have also read the works of a variety of very well respected physicists and the latest theories thereof). Not to mention the fact that she severly downplays physics, entirely, stating that it's just simple processes, rather than using it to explain a Universe which makes sense to the Witch, which it can (and has) done!* Her history wasn't very good. After all, why read a paraphased version of history, by mere quotes from Hutton's work, rather than reading the whole book? You'd be better for it. He's a ttrue scholar, albeit biased (he once mistranslated Cerridwen's name to mean \\"Crooked Woman\\"). Although, that doesn't mean there is no value to his books- quite the opposite! \\"The Stations Of the Sun\\" and \\"The Triumph of the Moon\\" ought to be on every dedicated Witch's library!* Her alleged \\"spells\\" are off kilter, often, as well. Many of them are not, in actuality, \\"Wiccan\\" (which is what they are labled as). The majprity of them are, in fact, Pow-Wow Folk Magic (note how I've spelled \\"magick\\"). And, another thing, which would make some very Traditional Witches gasp in horror (if I may be perfectly blunt) is that many of them call, for a red plastic dinner plate, and other el-cheap-o, unnatural, and non-religious items. Becauise, quite bluntly, non-natural items cannot hold a psychic charge for any real length of time. And, this is a religion, remember. We don't use plastic dixy cups to pour out our libation to The Gods, after all!"},{"Title":"Solitary Witch: The Ultimate Book of Shadows for the New Generation","review":"This book does nothing but the same thing most all her other \\"works\\" have done: It panders to the underdeveloped mind of the teenager while preying upon their fears and insecurities. What little of it which is not just the simple and prolific regurgitation of a million other \\"solitary\\" books have done, is frightening. Simply put, there is little to no mention of the morals and ethics of Practice, and sad few inspirations or \\"pearls\\" to be gleaned from this mess.If your path is Wicca, I highly recommend [as a springboard only] Wicca: A Guide for the Solitary Practitioner by Scott Cunningham, and his further work entitled, \\"Living Wicca.\\"Now, I'm not saying that just because it's Llewellyn's that a tree hasn't died in vain [just look at SRW's many, many sales pitches geared at America's youth]. But what I'm saying is that Cunningham was not in it for the money. He taught the reality of Magick and its principles, rather than RavenWolf's magick without principles.The choice is yours, but this book offers nothing that isn't in every other beginner's BoS out there."},{"Title":"Solitary Witch: The Ultimate Book of Shadows for the New Generation","review":"When I first started to read my copy of the book, I must admit I got a little bored :( I found it a little tedious the first 50 or so pages, but after that initial akwardness, it was everything I had expected and more! If you want to be a part of the Pagan community, this book is very helpful. Silver discusses some of the social issues involved with being Wiccan/Pagan, which is very important to know. But more than that this book has accurate well rounded information and the wonderful annectodes we have all love. The book also teaches moral responsibility to readers, which is nice to see someone take on. Great read, stick with it!"},{"Title":"Solitary Witch: The Ultimate Book of Shadows for the New Generation","review":"They aren't kidding; it really is the ultimate book of shadows. It covers just about ever topic in magic/Wicca imaginable. It's rather hefty, and it takes a while to read if you read it cover to cover. But, it's well worth it. I refer back to this book all the time. It was one of the best buys on the topic I've ever made. I highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"Solitary Witch: The Ultimate Book of Shadows for the New Generation","review":"Used as a basic Encyclopedia of information on Wicca, I'd give Solitary Witch 5 stars.As a guide to Wicca / WitchCraft or the Ultimate Book of Shadows, I give it 3. I'm picking the happy medium here by giving it 4.The book provides a lot of information in an encyclopedia style format. You glance around and find the basic information about everything.Is everyone going to agree with the information presented? Not a chance in hell. There are way too many paths of Wicca, and there are too many people who in general, hate Silver RavenWolf and if they could, would burn her at the stake. (And I'm not just talking about non-Pagans here! There are many in the community who think we'd be better off without her >.&lt;)I personally think she's a decent author, and while this book didn't give me what I wanted entirely, it was worth the investment.I would have liked more Spirituality & \\"religion\\" in the book, and while Silver it seems *wants* to throw this into the mix, she's afraid to add too much for fear of coming off as boring to the little Teen Witch's who want nothing but spells. Why? Because they tend to be her primary audience.Anyways, I *do* reccomend Solitary Witch ---- if you want a huge plathora of information in an encyclopedia style. It gave me a lot of basics to go on to further my own research, and I think that is just what an encyclopedia should be. I just wish the title were different to explain better what the book truly is."},{"Title":"Solitary Witch: The Ultimate Book of Shadows for the New Generation","review":"While some of the author's words are focused on the teen (as that is who is doing a great deal of searching in regard to religion); it brought back a great number of reminders that I had forgotten in my 20 years of being a practicing witch...and the number 1 thing is that we never stop learning.This book utilizes the authors humor, down to earth phrasing and desire to teach to do just that. While some of it may be more difficult (i.e. the phases of the moon, days of the week/month in which to practice magick and achieve the desired action) she does warn you that this may be true in the Foreward of the book and acknowledges the need and/or necessity to continue our learning through the references that she has provided.I love it and utilize it on a day to day basis, as well as my own Grimoire and that of others. After all, on this path that we've chosen in honoring the earth and creator, we never stop learning...Blessed be,"},{"Title":"Solitary Witch: The Ultimate Book of Shadows for the New Generation","review":"If I hadn't read the back of this book I wouldn't have ever guessed, based on it's content alone, that it was intended for teenagers. It's well put together, with concise information in a format that welcomes the reader to browse freely to any topic of interest. I agree there have been many \\"beginners\\" books written over time, but each author brings with them their own ideas and perspectives associated with the Craft. Silver is no different and I find her perspective valuable to the adept as well as the novice. I count this book as an excellent reference manual."},{"Title":"Solitary Witch: The Ultimate Book of Shadows for the New Generation","review":"There had been no new books by Silver for so long that I began to wonder what she was up to. Now I know. This book must have been a huge undertaking that consumed huge chunks of time and energy. It's not not just a complete BoS for solitaires but an excellent teaching tool beginners. Silver explains every ritual and concept in detail and leaves no questions dangling about basic eclectic Wiccan practice. She delves into more esoteric and intermediate areas. Fat book. Well worth taking the time to read."},{"Title":"Solitary Witch: The Ultimate Book of Shadows for the New Generation","review":"this is an excellent book & I really can't believe the bad reviews. a few years ago there were very few authors on this subject, maybe one shelf in a book store. Silver Ravenwolf has been writing a long time. Long before most of the other authors have jumped on this wiccan ...spiritual bandwagon, & this book covers a lot of what the other authors have not even attempted to cover. She has experience & it shows. It's soup to nuts on what to do. And not do. it explains things clearly. As a parent I understand her references to the 'teenage witch ' because I know there are alot of kids out there experimenting with the craft. And adults too. But I wouldn't let those bad reviews stop me from buying it. I paid $20 bucks last Sunday in Borders & to me it was a real bargain. It's about 10 books previously purchased in one."},{"Title":"Solitary Witch: The Ultimate Book of Shadows for the New Generation","review":"I had read some titles by Silver RavenWolf, and purchased this one.I can NOT recommend this book to anyone is good conscience, and I have so many problems with this book; I hardly know where to begin.Ms. RavenWolf is into getting you to practise her spells instead of giving you the knowledgs and tools to write your own.Simply reading the words without your intent and energy behind them; you might as well say Hocus pocus!, Shazam!, Abracadabra!, etc.I am very disturbed by the fact that the author did not even devote one sentence to discussion of the Rede, and teaching the newbies the &quot;ethics&quot; of magic. All magic has a boomerang effect. What you send out is visited on you.I need to speak to a few matters in the book.Page 20: &quot;She is the Maiden, Mother and Crone, Shr is the sacred trinity of all religions, Indeed, She is the Holy Ghost&quot;I am a devout Pagan, and have no love lost for the religion calling itself &quot;christianity&quot; today. However; this sounds as if the author is trying to confuse young people that Wicca is compatible with &quot;christianity&quot;.Before a person has reached adulthood; Neither I nor anyone else have the right to interfere with the spiritual guidance of your parents or guardians.Page 122: altar layout illustrationThe altar layout is entirely too complex. Many people do not have all of the tools or feel the need for some of them. Do not become concerned that you can't do magick because you do not have hundreds of $ to spend on tools.Start where you are. Cut a limb from a tree and use it as a wand, use tealight or votive candles, use a kitchen knife for an athame, pick up two rocks to represent the God and Goddess, you might visit yard sales, and pick up ceramic figurines of birds, etc.Page 173: &quot;Most magical people begin working with totem animals by choosing their favorite creature.&quot;I thought this was to be a book about Wicca instead of a book on Shamanism. Furthermore; the totem animal chould choose to work with you; not the other way around.Page 320: &quot;Reiki is s channeled form of energy healing that originated in Japan&quot;I am a Master/Teacher or higher in five different forms of Reiki, and can state categoricaly that Reiki is not part of the Wicca system or vice versa.Page 372: &quot;To understand where the concept of demons comes from, we have to look deep into history and the split between the Pagan belief system and Christian superstition used as a vehicle to control the people.&quot;I have no use for &quot;christianity&quot;, but I am deeply offended that the author gives her belief credence; but relegate &quot;christianity&quot; to superstition.Page 435: &quot;Citrine Purpose: Anti-nightmare, protection, psychism&quot;.The Author has Citrine and Amethyst confused here. Citrine is healing, and works withthe 2nd and third chakras. Citrine is one of four stones that do not need to be cleansed of negativity. The other three stones are Kyanite, Obsidian, and SeleniteI sincerely recommend that you leave this book on the book shelf.If you are insterested in Wicca; see my Wicca listmania list, or investigate the writings of Scott Cunningham, Amber K, Marian Green, Paul Tuitean and Estelle Daniels, and Dorothy morrison."},{"Title":"Solitary Witch: The Ultimate Book of Shadows for the New Generation","review":"INDEED! This is the ULTIMATE book of shadows! It is comprehensive, in depth and gives one profound insight into The Craft. Silver writes with her usual humor, sincerity and groundedness. As a purveyor of many different &quot;Books of Shadows&quot;, and other Pagan and Wiccan authors, I give this one a A++. She goes into depth on many, mnay subjects related to the Craft. It is deep, yet understandable and not at all &quot;wu-wu.&quot; The only thing I can't understand is why people think it's mainly for the younger generation. I'm 51 and very well read and I found this masterpiece truly enlightening!Many thanks, kudos and blessings to Silver for helping us all on our individual and sometimes lonely paths!Sincerely,Moonrose (Kathleen Wilson)"},{"Title":"Solitary Witch: The Ultimate Book of Shadows for the New Generation","review":"You either like Silver or you don't. This is the fourth book by her that I have purchased and I am not disappointed. There are too many books on Wicca out there that are a bunch of fluff. Silver may have a distinct personality and views on things-but she is not perfect people. You may not like some of her views but give me a break! We all have our own opinions. My advice is to glean what you will from any book and discard what you don't feel is pertinent to your practice. Stop being so critical!She does her best to be educational and informative, but also provides the reader with options to spellcasting and finding your path in your own time. I challange the Silver critics out there to write something better if you think you can. Otherwise do us all a favor and zip it. Use your energy for something more useful."},{"Title":"Solitary Witch: The Ultimate Book of Shadows for the New Generation","review":"I'm a praticing teenage Witch and Wiccan, and I have to say that this book is pretty informative, though not the best place for spells and such. Yes, Ravenwolf does &quot;dumb&quot; things down, but for super beginners and young teens, I think that it's appropriate to do so as to not confuse them.This book contains *a lot* of information that you cannot find in most other beginning/teen Wiccan books. It contains info on auras, charkas, runes, explanation of the major and minor tarot, and much more.Yes, this is *not* the place to go to for spells because there really aren't any, and they take about 10 minutes to complete, with circle casting and all.If your looking for information on Wicca than I suggest that you either buy this or Scott Cunnigham's &quot;Wicca - A Guide for the Solitary Practioner.&quot; Both are pretty good though I would go for &quot;Wicca&quot; before you buy this. Both are good, but, &quot;Solitary Witch&quot; does contain more information, while &quot;Wicca&quot; contains better [and more] spells and chants.Overall, is it woth your money? I would say yes, if your a beginner and/or a teenager. It contains a lot of information that you cannot find in other beginning or teenage books."},{"Title":"Solitary Witch: The Ultimate Book of Shadows for the New Generation","review":"I Am very disappointed with this book. I own and highly recommend \\"To Ride A Silver Broomstick\\" to anyone who is fairly new and interested in The Craft. I also own \\"To Stir A Magic Cauldron\\" which in it's own right is pretty decent. So when I saw a book that is being advertised as a \\"Book Of Shadows\\" For a solitary Witch, By Silver Ravenwolf, I was very excited and purchased it.That was a mistake. I am a fairly adept Wiccan, however I am always reading and learning, and suggesting to people just beginning, or even just interested in learning new things, like myself. You can never learn or read enough. Wicca should be a constantly flowing religion.This book is not helpful, I have NO problem with folk Magick, or \\"kitchen Witchery\\" I actually have a great respect for it, so that is not at all what I am complaining about.The biggest fault of this book is, it is not advertised as a book for young adults or teens, and it is! It has a condescending writing style that I am not too sure even if i was 15 years younger I would appreciate. Some \\"Spells\\" in the book can be used to fit some small needs, maybe. It just has terrible references to teachers, fellow students, Proms. Gee, This is a little silly for anyone who is not a young EARLY teen, sort of interested in dabbling in Magick, Which could actually be dangerous if not done properly. Anyone in that realm (new to Wicca) should pick up a Cunningham book, and anyone who has had more than a few months, maybe weeks reading about Wicca should seriously invest in a Christopher Penczak book, they are intelligent and informative.Again I am very disappointed with Silver Ravenwolf, She WAS one of my favorite Wiccan Authors. I wish she would refocus her attention to the adult Pagans, and if she does write a book directed towards teens or preteens, advertise the book that way!If you are a solitary Witch and want a book to further your education on the craft, do not bother to pollute your mind with this drivel. Believe me it actually pains me to say that about a Ravenwolf book."},{"Title":"Solitary Witch: The Ultimate Book of Shadows for the New Generation","review":"Let me start this off by tearing into it, that way we can end positively =)This was the first book I bought starting off in my Wiccan studies. I opened the page to circle casting and was dumbfounded that a topic so seemingly complex could be summed up in - what? - 3 pages?! I knew nothing about Wicca, but I went along with it anyway... since I agreed with the philosophies and needed to start somewhere, anyway. Now that I have read numerous others, I can say that this book was a complete disgrace. All right. So Ravenwolf is the most publically-established Witch around, so of course it's going to be advanced. And it's a great referrence book... But unlike other books, this one did not OFFER tips to Spellcraft. She just typed up her own personal BOS. You can NOT simply put your own spells in there! The acoutrements and the motions mean absolutely nothing when you have no idea why you're doing what you're doing or what the words you're saying mean... I feel that this book encourages the production of the &quot;fashionable Witch&quot; - IE: Go through the motions, get to be part of a cool subcultural &quot;cult&quot;.Not that her intentions were poor, I'm sure. Simply put, it is unwise to print your own Book of Shadows verbatim, as many will take every word as holy writ... However, this book has been exceedingly useful to me at a later time, now that I can look back when I need a memory jog for say, the terminology for counterclockwise movement of a casted circle, runic symbols, etc... There's darned good stuff in here. I simply don't recommend it for beginners, nor the naiive (when it comes to following every word.)WICCA IS A PERSONAL RELIGION; THERE ARE NO BIBLES AND TO FOLLOW SOME ONE ELSES' RENDITION OF SPIRITUALITY WITHOUT QUESTIONING IS TO FOLLOW BLINDLY! Always remain true to your own heart. Wicca lies within yourself, not the pages of any book nomatter how well-written."},{"Title":"Solitary Witch: The Ultimate Book of Shadows for the New Generation","review":"I loved the book. Not because I agreed with everything. Not because she wrote everything the way I would have written it. Not because I found every single page useful and relevant. Because I didn't. It is a HUGe book that covers alot of interesting topics.I am really surprised how many bad reviews and angry reviewers there are. Jeez folks lets use our energy to do something positive. Do you really believe Silver is doing more harm than good for young pagans?Things I didn't like were hetero god/goddess focus that almost every neo-pagan book seems to have.Directions for spellwork instead of formulas (although honestly she put in enough information about moon cylces/corresponding days colors ect that people could do this themselves.And lastly the christian references at times turned me off. BUT overall I loved the book she writes things in a clear easy to read/understand manner. I think if you can afford only one book right now to expand your collection this should be it."},{"Title":"Solitary Witch: The Ultimate Book of Shadows for the New Generation","review":"I'm a big fan of Silver RavenWolf, even though many people really like to trash her style. So her historical information may not be completely, perfectly accurate, or she may not write what everyone wants or expects her to write. I can guarantee that no one's book on The Craft is perfect, and Ms Ravenwolf is no exception. But what she never fails to do is to encourage her reader to follow their heart. Although the information in _Solitary Witch_ is mainly aimed at the college-aged group (those who grew up with _Teen Witch_ and now are adults), the information and rituals in this tome are beneficial to practicioners of all ages. I highly enjoy this book, although I believe that it could have been organized a bit better. Overall, it is a perfect book for those who have progressed past _Teen Witch_ and are hungry for the next step up."},{"Title":"Solitary Witch: The Ultimate Book of Shadows for the New Generation","review":"I hesitated to even write a review for this one, but decided that I could simply sum it up. Pay attention to the other reviews to make up your mind, if this book is for you. Silver RavenWolf is considered by some to be a \\"fluffy bunny witch\\", but ultimately, it is up to you what you make of it.I look upon this book as a very comprehensive encyclopedia that covers a lot of subjects (in more or less detail), more than any other book I have seen. From this point, you may want to investigate areas of your interest through other books, authors, web sources, etc, but I find it to be a great starting point and a good book to buy, when you are new to wicca, witchcraft, magic.I am not a teenager and it should also not deter you from considering this book. Yes, some areas are written for teenagers, but I simply choose to move on and adjust the text, as it would apply to me, but most of this book applies to any age. When I first picked up this book and flipped through it, I was not aware that it was written for the teen point of view. I have not regretted purchasing this book and I have quite a lot of books on this subject."},{"Title":"Solitary Witch: The Ultimate Book of Shadows for the New Generation","review":"Very controversial book that has caused a deep schism within the wiccan/witchcraft/pagan religions and communities. I purchased this book just after it rolled off the press and hit the bookshelves in the stores. \\"Solitary\\" was the book to have back nine years ago, a very hot selling book that generated many a tongue to wag and witch to curse over it's contents. Love her or hate her, Silver had the guts and courage to pick up the pen and write her books, especially this book!In reading some of the many reviews on this book I noted one thread that seems very obvious to those that were quick to tap on the keyboard.......the astute discriminating reader will note as I, that the statements made criticizing Silver were born out of the naysayer's lack of comprehension. Or, perhaps, their vehement dislike of Silver, or jealousy, and on and on....irregardless, the fact remains in their exuberance to get their \\"Solitary Opinion\\" out on, \\"Solitary Witch\\" they neglected to take the time to read and missed by a long shot. It seems \\"Solitary\\" is being judged by more than it's cover as is the author.I'm not posting this to review the reviewers so onward in my Solitary effort to write my review of \\"Solitary Witch.\\" Silver wrote the book of all books with this one. It's complete and I believe if one were to search thoroughly a kitchen sink might just be in the midst! It's a comprehensive book that chronicles the history and then explains in depth information regarding witchcraft. It could have used a better index as it's difficult to look up information and that can be frustrating. All in all the content speaks for itself and Silver does an eloquent job in writing, including her context. Her downfall is she writes to a teenage audience which I found to be a bit insulting to the intelligence of her adult readers. At times in her discussions she seemed to downplay our intelligence and in that regard she could have been served by a better editor at Llewellyn!I find this book to be useful and it has earned a place in not only the history of witchcraft but on the shelf next to the cauldron. After ten years it's still my, \\"Go To\\" book!"},{"Title":"Solitary Witch: The Ultimate Book of Shadows for the New Generation","review":"This is the only book I own by Silver RavenWolf so I'm not that familiar with her work nor can I comment on her history of credibility. But I can say that while I did appreciate a lot of the information provided in this book, there were just as many areas where I felt she should have done more fact-checking. One in particular was the piece on Hoodoo she included from Ray Malbrough. I found it to be a very half-a**ed attempt at illustrating the differences between Hoodoo (strictly an African-American folk magic SYSTEM) and Voodoo (a RELIGION). Its misleading and I could certainly see how someone who didn't have any background knowledge of either of those two systems could mistake it for something quite different from what it actually is based on reading this.I also think her apparent disdain for Christianity gets in the way of presenting actual FACTS and not opinions about it. I'm not Christian either but the truth is the truth and whatever personal feelings she had should have been laid aside for the sake of it. Its her responsibility as a writer.Other than that, I have no sincere problems with this book. However, I would definitely suggest buying it cheaper/used."},{"Title":"Solitary Witch: The Ultimate Book of Shadows for the New Generation","review":"I would not use this book or any by this author. She has a Dogmatic approach which lends itself to be a one way view.It has some valid material but for someone who is serious about Witchcraft don't bother unless you like to be subject to her moral dogmatic beat down. Start with Scott Cunningham and avoid her material."},{"Title":"Solitary Witch: The Ultimate Book of Shadows for the New Generation","review":"This book is slightly misleading in some areas. It seems to target young people, much like most of her books do. However, an impressionable young person can get easily confused by some of the conflicting messages in this book. I do not recommend this book by itself as the only source of information a young adult needs to learn this path.That being said, it's a decently Encyclopedia for anyone who has a decent understanding of the Wiccan path. I use it as a reference tool, which is, I think, the ultimate intent of Ms Ravenwolf when she wrote it. I do not use any of the spells in her book, at least not verbatim. I prefer to write my own, or, in the spur of the moment, addlib and write it down later."},{"Title":"Solitary Witch: The Ultimate Book of Shadows for the New Generation","review":"I was expecting much more after reading the hard copy of the same titles book lent to me by a friend. This book, however, isn't half as informative. It has a chapter about sex. Nothing magickal about it. Really informative about herbs and basic spells, but I wouldn't recommend this book to serious practicers."},{"Title":"Solitary Witch: The Ultimate Book of Shadows for the New Generation","review":"This book has its detractors, mostly for containing Silver Ravenwolf's own spells instead of encouraging the reader to formulate their own, but I use it as an encyclopedia of correspondences and basic information. It's detailed enough to be my go-to source reference, but not so detailed that it becomes bogged down. Everything is arranged nicely inside, and the writing is easy to follow.I recommend it for anyone that would like a nice, comprehensive 'all in one' book for their Craft."},{"Title":"Solitary Witch: The Ultimate Book of Shadows for the New Generation","review":"This book has a LOT of great information on a wide variety of topics. It gives a good introduction and info on each subject, so this book is good for the experienced practitioner and beginner. \\"Solitary Witch\\" offers some really great exercises, rituals, spells, and meditations.The only thing I don't like is it's set up. The info is scattered all around the book, which can be very confusing at times.All in all, this book is worth the money!"},{"Title":"Solitary Witch: The Ultimate Book of Shadows for the New Generation","review":"This book is useful to me now that I can fully sift through all the garbage written in this. Like all her books there is no real explanation as to why we do certain things, for what purposes, only to cast a spell to get what you want.NOW! The information on the rituals and correspondences of colours is greatly useful to me now, but alot of the history is bunk and I avoid it. I also avoid all the spells in the book.My best advice is that this is only good if you have some knowledge in Wicca and paganism before hand, so that you can find the real useful information in this. The index is key!"},{"Title":"Solitary Witch: The Ultimate Book of Shadows for the New Generation","review":"I found this book to be a very informative and comprehensive collection of both new practices and historical reference. It is written in language that is easy to understand and the explanation of practices includes solid rationale. Anyone who is interested in researching Witchcraft or Wicca should find this very helpful."},{"Title":"Solitary Witch: The Ultimate Book of Shadows for the New Generation","review":"I have read a few reviews on here by people I feel did not actually purchase this book and were pre-judging it based on part of the pagan communities views towards SRW. I will agree that many of her books seem to be on the \\"fluffy\\" side, especially anything with \\"Teen\\" in the title. Here first series of books were very useful to those just starting out in Wicca or Witchcraft. She then submitted some books on the market, which I would not offer up to someone starting in the Craft.However, this book I believe brought her redemption. If you are not willing to do some studying then this book is not for you. (That is why I feel she got some bad reviews on it.) She covers many aspects of Wicca, Witchcraft, Spirituality, and Magic(k). If you read the book from start to finish then I think you will have a good base to begin your practices and seek out new information. When you read it, it does seem directed towards teens yet she throws some adult things in as well. In the back there are spells she offers up for suggestions, however throughout the entire book she insists spells written you write for yourself are more effective. She also gives the complete guidelines for spells, ritual, and the purposes behind each part, such as why and how to cast a circle, call the quarters, recite the Charge of the Goddess.There are two things in the book I do not enjoy. The first is that everything is from a very feminine point of view. I am not saying it is Dianic but she briefly mentions the God. The second, is that she is clearly influenced by Dutch Folk Magic(k) and I am more interested in other things. For both of these things I could go buy separate books.I think this book is a great starting place for someone interested in Wicca, as long as you pay head and know that her advice does not mean it is Wiccan Law."},{"Title":"Solitary Witch: The Ultimate Book of Shadows for the New Generation","review":"I found this book helpful in starting out. It is a little condescending, but then again, it is written for teens. If you skip past the spells part, it's pretty good, information wise. The spells are idiotic, I'll admit that, but i found the rest of it prety informative and helpful starting out in my wiccan studies.i would recommend it to someone starting out, but read books by other authors too! Don't get all of your information from one book and think you're done. You're only just beginning."},{"Title":"Solitary Witch: The Ultimate Book of Shadows for the New Generation","review":"There are SOOOO many GREAT books about wicca and witchcraft out there I certainly wouldn't waste my money again on this book, and I suggest others don't either. When I picked up this book I thought it was very cheesy. It is a lot of pop ideas wich are beyond illogical just to make wicca look like something out of the movies.This book reads like it walked right out the tv show charmed. It is full of false information made just to look cute so it will sell. This book is not for anyone who is seriously interested in learning to be a solitary witch and teaches many pagan ideas without many WIccan teachings (an YES they are 2 totally different things even though you wouldn't know that by reading her book.)I am not in a coven and I am very happy being a solitary practioner but I understand wicca is a religious choice and like any religion there are beliefs and redes which are followed. It is not 'do whatever you want to do and call yourself wiccan'. Yes some things in religion are personal choices (like choosing to be a vegetarian for example) but the building blocks of the religion are totally lost in this book.Freedom of choice in religion is wonderful and its everyones right but if your choice is to make up your own religion you should not go around saying your wiccan when you do not follow the wiccan ways, Unfortunatly that is EXACTLY what ravenwolf does.This supposedly \\"advanced\\" book doesnt go into details on the history of wicca (and when it does often much of the information is not historically factual) and doesn't give clear definitions of wicca, paganism, or witchcraft. This book may seem simple to understand however it will only confuse readers who study deeper as they will end up having to unlearn almost all of it as they become serious.This book just doesnt encourage deep thinking or lots of factual information, It DOES however make the reader feel like they can just read a spell out loud from the book and it will all work in a puff of blue smoke.This book seems a nice commercial, and cutesy to make everything pretty and oh so shiny. This book is teaching hype not truths. If you truly want to learn about wicca as a solitarty practioner and don't have many resources then skip this book and spend your money on a different book, and read one of the many other wonderful solitary practioner books out there."},{"Title":"Solitary Witch: The Ultimate Book of Shadows for the New Generation","review":"And that says it all. Would NOT recommend to those who walk traditional or hereditary paths unless you're looking for some background work on learning to cast a circle."},{"Title":"Solitary Witch: The Ultimate Book of Shadows for the New Generation","review":"I like silver, being new to the craft her books have helped me out. But like some others i do agree it is a little repetative, but there is more new stuff than old stuff. I like it all being in one big book, no need to shuffle dozens around to look for something. It is geared towards teens and &quot;newbies&quot; but thats ok because its easy to understand. It also, while giving me the info i was looking for, opened my eyes to things i never would have discovered an interest in."},{"Title":"Solitary Witch: The Ultimate Book of Shadows for the New Generation","review":"The first thing I think everyone will notice is that the book is well organized into sections. The front of the book starts with basics that might be very repetative to most of us, but will be a good place for those who are just learning about earth-baised religions and have gotten past the \\"look I'm a witch!\\" stage.The back sections of the book contains some astrological moon phase info for spell work, spells and hex magick. (Note: Hex magick does not pertain to Curses, this is where we could probably use a better definition to correct missunderstandings on the meaning) This does seem to run more along the lines of powwow magick maybe a little scandinavian in symbolism, at least that is my impression of it. Not really my cup of tea but everyone has diffrent tastes.The information that was in the middle seemed to intrest me more than the front of the book or the back. the information on the Wedjat eye was very intersting and even after cross referanceing seemed to stand up to be more accurate than not. The majority of the book is intended as referance and clearly not suggested as the only source for you to gain information.There are some areas that I find the wording used to explain some things to be a little unclear, but not intentionally so. It is not always easy to express beliefs and concepts that are clearly not well understood by mainstream society. However, a more wordy description may or may not have help in explaining things better but most readers would find it too wordy and find fault in that approach.I didn't find any conflict with the love spell as it was not directed at causing anyone in particular to love you... it was just to draw love that had potential to be lasting... couple it with more astrological information than you would find here it could be likely to have a positive results.I think that releasing love of the \\"it's over spell\\" to be suggestive that you had control over love and I think that this could be handled better. However, off hand this is the only one that I can really say I had a real problem with.Over all, I feel that this is a good referance book, not as bad as some would have you believe, Not the corner market either, just another alternative. Some new stuff not seen in other books and a collection of some basic stuff that may have required several books to get all of what is inside of this one. It can also help give you a start on ideas of other topics you would like to look deeper into. Contains more than Scott Cunnigham's \\"Living Wicca\\" and \\"Wicca\\" does and yet covers all the same ground and then some."},{"Title":"Solitary Witch: The Ultimate Book of Shadows for the New Generation","review":"I am a long-time reader of various Witchcraft books. I have read RavenWolf's previous books and enjoyed them though a lot of people refer to her a &quot;fluffy.&quot; Her new book &quot;Solitary Witch&quot; is an unbelieveable resource! It is one of the most impressive, researched books I have seen in a long time! HIGHLY reccomended!"},{"Title":"Solitary Witch: The Ultimate Book of Shadows for the New Generation","review":"How many times can the same thing be said in a different way? Well, apparently at least one more time. I have to admit that this book is not as sappy as the author's usual work. And although Silver's writings appear to still be targeting the Teen Market, this book is not as &quot;dumbed down&quot; as we've seen from her in the past. Still, I have to cringe at some of the topics covered in this book (like spells for acne).All that aside, this book seems better thought out than Silver's past books. And there is a small trace of an attempt to bring balance to this work regarding historical perspectives. For a teen's book, this one is not as bad as others we've seen. But, &quot;not so bad&quot; isn't really what we should accept or encourage from writers in our community. But that's just my opinon, I could be wrong."},{"Title":"Solitary Witch: The Ultimate Book of Shadows for the New Generation","review":"I just had to write a review after seeing all the bad reviews. I really enjoy this book. IT IS A GREAT REFERENCE BOOK with simple and complete sections. It has it all. I can usually find anything I need in it and not have to pull out a lot of books. I have read hundreds of books on wicca and it is the one I use the most. I also recommend ellen dugan and her series on green witchcraft. Silver should be praised for her book it is a work of art."},{"Title":"Solitary Witch: The Ultimate Book of Shadows for the New Generation","review":"I have very mixed feelings about this book. On one hand, its got a TON of information and is a wonderful reference book. However, its written specifically for teenagers. If it wasn't aimed towards teens, it would be THE BEST book on the market and the CLOSEST THING TO AN ALL-IN-ONE WICCA BOOK that exists.Personally, the kiddy theme is too distracting for me to use regularly (but its still a great reference book). If you are considering buying this, look through it at a bookstore to see if its right for you. Barnes n Noble carries it, and they will order it if they are out of stock and you ask."},{"Title":"Solitary Witch: The Ultimate Book of Shadows for the New Generation","review":"I was going to buy this book long, long ago but fell victim to the opinions of others before finally deciding to give it a go myself. Silver Ravenwolf's 'Solitary Witch: The Ultimate Book of Shadows For The New Generation' is everything a Witchcraft 101 book should be; an absolute must have for the aspiring Witch. Ravenwolf writes with the perfect combination of joy, humor, wisdom and fact, and this book is no exception. I thoroughly enjoyed every aspect of this book and already refer to it on a daily basis. Don't be put off by negative reviews. Silver's books are FUN (I can't stand a typically boring book) and hugely resourceful!"},{"Title":"Solitary Witch: The Ultimate Book of Shadows for the New Generation","review":"I DO NOT recommend this book. Much of the book is a mixture of different paths and traditions that are used out of context and become very confusing in the format in which it is written. It has everything from shamanism and hermetic tradition to voodon and hoodoo, not mention it's all mushed in to the framwork of wicca. This irrated me throughout the book because you can not gain an understanding of a path or parts of a path while divorcing it from its original cultural context.The rest of the book is made up of lists of correspondances, the author's personal stories, spells and rituals, and psychiatric advice for teenagers. I absolutely do not like how the book is targeted for teenagers with things like \\"locker spells\\" and spell to \\"relieve the pressure of an unfair professor\\" and I was one who bought it as a teenager. Back then, it even seemed very fake and cheesy for something that is supposed to be a great encylopedia of witchcraft. On the other hand, as a reference for a more advanced witch, it has some value. A brief mention of something has the potential to spur more vigious research into the original myths and lore."},{"Title":"Solitary Witch: The Ultimate Book of Shadows for the New Generation","review":"Oh! My! God/dess! I'm a 15-year-old wiccan student, and I found this book at a Borders store two days ago. Since then, I've been reading it voraciously, stopping occasionally for things like eating and sleeping. There are some excellent blessings, prayers, and meditations, as well as creative ideas for the sabbats - even techniques for astral travel. As the title 'Solitary Witch' might suggest, the information in the book is of greatest use to individual pagans, instead of covens. I reccomend this book to anyone studying or practicing Wicca - it's really an excellent reference for anyone in the Goddess crowd."},{"Title":"Solitary Witch: The Ultimate Book of Shadows for the New Generation","review":"So I bought this book because I love Silver's other books. Wow! It is huge and full of information. In fact, it's one of those only book on wicca that you need. I agree that it is geared toward the already practicing wiccan but there is so much info that it is accessible to anyone who practices. Love it."},{"Title":"Solitary Witch: The Ultimate Book of Shadows for the New Generation","review":"I just bought this book on Saturday (2/22/03) and I have not yet started reading it. I have to say though that it is packed full of information. From Initiation ceremonies,to blessings and prayers, to Wiccan ethics, and spells, and almost anything that you can think of. The cover of the book seems a little grim but the inside definately makes up for that. I think that on the contents of this book alone anyone interersted int he craft new or old should buy this book. But I have not read it yet, and don't plan on finishing it anytime soon, as it is 0ver 600 pages long. If anyone reads this review and has read the book, Please write a review to tell me how it is. Since i have only read the contents so far, but it seems great."},{"Title":"Solitary Witch: The Ultimate Book of Shadows for the New Generation","review":"I would recommend this book to every one. From beginners to advanced, everyone should have this book because it is a wonderful reference book. This will probably be the most used book in my house. It has everything from spells, tarot cards, runes, holiday information, and just about every single thing that a wiccan needs to know. This book is well worth the price. I recommend that you buy it. Just look how many pages it has! This book is worth the price you will pay for it."},{"Title":"Solitary Witch: The Ultimate Book of Shadows for the New Generation","review":"When I saw this book, I said \\"Hey, that's a big book.\\" That's the main reason it was worth the $... It was a bit better than most of her books. She still seems to be talking to teens, despite her saying it was for both beginners and the experienced. She also continues to make the same mistake of using the words witch and Wiccan interchangably. Still, she did her research on this one, so it isn't too bad."},{"Title":"Solitary Witch: The Ultimate Book of Shadows for the New Generation","review":"Silver Ravenwolf was the author who introduced me to Wicca. (along with Scott Cunningham of course)She has a light, witty writting style that lures the reader in and makes you feel as if you and she are sitting across from one another in a student/mentor session. I like this book! Its great for what it is, a Reference work for teens and companion to the 3 part series starting with to ride a silver broomstick.I'm taking the time to write this due to those who wrote in to bash Silver, saying she failed to state the fact that this work is geared toward teens etc. Well people what do you think \\"NEW GENERATION\\" means??? The target audience is clear in the title.There were many reviews that were biased; People expressing their OPINION of how Wicca SHOULD be practiced and stating Silver is wrong in her views. Well, isn't Wicca a religion that allows one to form ones own views in respect to spirituality? These folks are too fond of Dogma!! Perhapse they should concider going back to the Christian church.:P~~~ hahaha Take heart folks, this book comes highly recommended. :))"},{"Title":"Solitary Witch: The Ultimate Book of Shadows for the New Generation","review":"I am always amazed with Silver's work, but this book absolutely blew me away. Silver has a rare talent of taking some extremely tough subjects and putting them in a way that anyone can understand. Although this particular book has a leaning toward teaching the teen witch, it is also an indepth study for us crones :-) After all of her books over the past 12 years or so, I can't imagine what she could possibly write next - but believe me, I'll be first in line for her next book!"},{"Title":"Solitary Witch: The Ultimate Book of Shadows for the New Generation","review":"I'm a teen witch and I love ravenwolf fartingtail because she understands EXACTLY how i feel? In fact her wonderful book has this spell that lets me send elves to protect my locker.

Yes and i got all that information from that book. I'm so glad i found this &quot;turn myself into a wiccan book&quot; because now. One time I didn't have a friends phone number, so I did the 'call me' spell and then 2 months later she really DID call me? I must be the most wonderful powerful witch in the universe. And you know what happened today? I told the teacher that no, the periodic table is wrong and that there is are 5 elements, yup thats RIGHT! Don't forget about spirit! My classmate called me a warlock but she was so dumb because .. there are no such things as warlocks nor devils! I have to go soon now because my coven wants to do a spell I found in this book to help us get 100 on our exams!

I love this book. For all those out there thinking that this is just a manual ur wrong. This book was made for Starters. *the beginners and up* The only reason why those who marked it a 1 star is because u dont understand it. It's quite simple to understand and practice. It doesnt say this is what you have to go by, it doesnt say this is great to solve ur problems for everything. It doesnt tell you that you have to read it at all even if you dont want to. Age 13-16 shouldnt be doing this kind of stuff. Your a young teen, you dont need to practice this. In fact you shouldnt until you know when, where and how to use it. As for the parents interupting during your practicing. Ya it can mess up what you are doing, just like a tv or music can end up distracting you. And yes you do have to be undistracted for those things to work... dahh. It is a good read as long as you know what your doing, and make sure it's for a good reason. 3fold effect can be a bite in the bum. This is for the new generation, why? it's easier to understand. You can udder the words... in the old days the words would be in a different tounge. This isnt \\"charmed\\" nor Buffy the vamp. slayer here.

At the time it was great. She appealed to the younger generation giving her books a hipper younger feel. She protrays the craft as fun and easily attainable.This book reads like an encyclopedia. It is divided into sections and themes in alphabetical order. It is a good reference guide. It is written with the intention of \\"wetting\\" your intellectual appetite. After every section you are given recommended reading. If you are like me it reinforces me to go to the extra readings and look further.Mainly, it is geared towards the younger generation exploring themes like bullies, suicide, etc. If you are an older wiccan this book is good for quick definitions and examples. This book is not for the absolute reader looking for \\"sacred text\\".The craft is a lifelong commitment fulfilled by hard work and a lot of research... this book is a good first step."},{"Title":"Solitary Witch: The Ultimate Book of Shadows for the New Generation","review":"It was one of my first resources purchased. If you intend to use it as the sole resource than you're as obtuse as anyone who only sees one spiritual view and practice.

I would have returned the book if I could have. Although it is focused toward the wandering teen, it's ideas are too scarce. The ideas within are not necessarily focused to any one religion, but a mix of all the different aspects that the author has put together as wicca. This is a choice that is made by the practicioner, and nowhere in this book does it stress this opinion.For those who would like some fun reading about what fantasy religion could be, this would be the book for you. For those who really need some insight into pagan or wiccan religion/spirituality should look elsewhere."},{"Title":"Solitary Witch: The Ultimate Book of Shadows for the New Generation","review":"If you have a question about Wicca, this book has the answer. It is a big fat textbook sized book. There is a Table of Contents at the front and an index in the back. Everything is sorted through by topic.

However, it confused me a great deal. On the back cover it warns that the book is serious magick, so if you are looking for curses and the likes then put it down.

The other guests were a Catholic couple whom I will call George and Emily. George had lost his teaching position at a local Catholic college because of his liberal theology. Emily, a student health nurse, had been dismissed for giving information about contraception to students. I told these two that my wife and I shared their religious heritage but were now Unitarian Universalists. Emily compressed her lips, looked down, and said, &quot;We decided to stay and fight.&quot; They are indeed scrappy people. Recently George accepted a teaching position at a Catholic high school. He did not modify his progressive opinions, the bishop learned of these, and he was fired. I suspect these two are closer to me theologically than they are to the Pope, and I wonder why they remain Catholics. But I respect that decision &quot;to stay and fight.&quot;Michael Morwood also stays and fights, and he is a nimble strategist. When in 1998 his book 'Tomorrow's Catholic' received unfavorable attention from the Archbishop of Melbourne, Australia, he resigned from the priesthood. He continues to find groups of Catholics and others who engage him as a teacher and lecturer.His main concern in this book is that official doctrine and the way it is taught are driving people away from the Catholic Church. Current teaching, Morwood says, depends too much on an outmoded cosmology, on the assumption that heaven is in the sky somewhere and that the universe is a lot younger and smaller than we now know it to be. This style of teaching, and its emphasis on unquestioning faith rather than on free intellectual engagement with tradition, hinder what he calls &quot;adult faith development.&quot; Morwood spent 29 years as a priest, many of them teaching, and in that time he noticed much &quot;arrested faith development&quot; in Catholic adults. Symptoms of this condition include literalism regarding Scripture and certain doctrines; uncritical loyalty to &quot;external authority&quot;; &quot;unquestioning acceptance of dogma and doctrine&quot;; adherence to childish notions of heaven, hell, and judgment; ignorance of how the Christian faith developed over the centuries and of how the Gospels were written; hostility to more sophisticated views of Christian doctrine.A notable item in this syllabus of errors is &quot;Claims of exclusivity: we are the only true religion.&quot; This belief, he says, reflects an inability to appreciate that &quot;all of humankind shares the one Transcendent Spirit,&quot; a sharing that is implied by &quot;the universality of God's presence.&quot; The claim of exclusivity certainly was Catholic doctrine as I remember it from my years in a Catholic university in the 1960s, and it is reasserted in the recent 'Dominus Iesus' declaration from the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith. Morwood would remind me, though, that the church is not just the &quot;teaching authority,&quot; but the entire body of believers.And Catholics do at times pull their leaders in a different direction. An example is the reputedly weakening resistance to ordination of women. Morwood knows that some rank and file Catholics are receptive to his ideas, and he probably hopes that these will become widespread among the laity and percolate into the hierarchy.If his hopes are realized, it will not be because they are modest. For instance, besides challenging Catholic claims of primacy among Christian churches, Morwood would also recognize prophets from nonchristian traditions. Yes, Jesus was &quot;raised by God,&quot; but so also were Isaiah, Buddha, Zoroaster, and Confucius.As for the redemptive sacrifice of the cross, it was never necessary: The Spirit of God, &quot;at work in all places at all times, offered to people in all places at all times the possibility of eternal life with God. Jesus did not regain it, for it was never lost.&quot; Jesus came not to heal a rift between God and humanity, but to teach us that God has never been estranged from us; that by loving each other we do God's will; and that this is more important than professing the correct creed. The early followers of Jesus &quot;came to understand that this man's life was like a mirror to them, revealing the ultimate purpose in life: living in love is intrinsically connected with being raised in death into eternal life with God.&quot;In the past I've wondered if Morwood has used the notion of worldviews as a ploy to avoid charges of heresy. While he was still a priest, a bishop asked him if he believed that &quot;Jesus was God in a way that we are not,&quot; and Morwood replied that he had &quot;difficulty with a worldview that necessitated this belief.&quot; In this book, he answers such questions more assertively: &quot;the onus is on those who insist on the truth of a doctrinal proposition to show, in a contemporary worldview...why Christians should keep on believing this as an article of faith.&quot; Rather than say, &quot;I don't believe this,&quot; he says, &quot;To keep our faith vital, you need to show me why I should believe this.&quot;This is not a strategic evasion but the best answer. He does not see the current dogmatic and exclusivist stance of Catholicism as suitable for dialogue with other religious traditions. He has seen many adult Catholics leave their faith because of hidebound traditionalism. As an educator, he seeks not to put the stamp of his own mind on his students but rather to spur them decide for themselves what makes sense to them intellectually and what speaks to them spiritually. His subtitle, Finding Our Faith, suggests that he sees faith more as a process than as a destination, and is more interested in the process than in the statements of belief that might result from this engagement.This book will appeal to the many who have long been growing restless over ancient teachings which have dwindling relevance and credibility. If this book, an eloquent and inspiring statement from a committed Christian, and others like it, stimulate and embolden enough of today's Catholics, their church might begin to treat people like George and Emily more justly, not to mention make better use of them."},{"Title":"Is Jesus God?: Finding Our Faith","review":"Both this book and Morwood's previous work,Tomorrow's Catholic are authentic, succinct, simple insights into the potential for Christianity, and Roman Catholicism in particular, in the modern world. Together they answer questions of inquiring Catholics and other persons of good will. The books are in- tended for those in particular who have moved or are moving beyond conventional stages of adult faith development. They know that their religious tradition/spirituality is a truth and not the truth. It is for those who need and want cosmic generating principles for their lives. Morwood give them that. The book will initially be upsetting for those who think of Jesus only in the sense of having provided a bloody sacrifice to redeem humankind from a &quot;fall&quot;. But the invitation to live in one's own time and place with the Spirit of God even as Jesus did in is is irresistible for those who heads to learn, hands to work, and hearts to love. Morwood has done a great service for all who do not want to leave their brains at the doors of their churches, or their mosques or synagogues for that matter. He has paid and will likely continue to pay a high price for speaking the truth in love but one can only admire him for having done so and hope he will continue to do so."},{"Title":"Is Jesus God?: Finding Our Faith","review":"Michael Morwood spent 29 years of his life as a Roman Catholic priest in Australia. When he wrote &quot;Tomorrow's Church,&quot; he got the attention of the Vatican. Eventually he chose to leave the priesthood. The present book responds to the questions that arose from the former. What Morwood believes is that religion comes from a worldview that is based on the realities one perceives. When humans learn more about those realities, they find their religion unable to explain the divine story. Morwood suggests that Christian religions, notably Roman Catholic, are based on philosophical and linguistic perceptions that no longer are relevant. For instance, he rejects the notion of Original Sin. He writes that the Adam and Eve story has been shown to be a myth borrowed from other cultures. Our scientific studies have shown that life evolved. Original Sin theory is a way of explaing evil in the world. But it poses some serious problems as the kind of God who could punish all people is not the same God of later philosophers and theolgians, indeed the God the Church proclaims.Morwood refers to a New Story, meaning the way humans see the world today. Anthropology, arhceology, psychology and other sciences have revealed knowledge long accepted. Yet the language of religion has not adapted, causing many to perceive that Christianity is irrelevant. Morwood believes that religious leaders need to explore language and rituals that speak of this New Story by reconciling the Old with it.An example of this is to try to explore how Jesus is God. He refers to the Trinity teaching as being irrelevant today. Yet many people, evne though they do not subscribe to this teaching, believe that Jesus was something special and was God in a way we are not. The divinity of Christ needs further exploration. This means looking at things like resurrection and what it means. Does Jesus go somewhere else? If God is everywhere, how do we consider a heaven where God lives?These and other questions Morwood explores with the hope that others will also try to explore through prayer, reading and dialogue.This reviewer did not agree with the idea of a &quot;New Story.&quot; There are realities known today not known hundreds of years ago. This revieweer believes the challenge is to relive the old story in this current reality. Christians shoudl explore language and rituals that reflect current realities, but integrate them into the old story. This is nothing new really. In Roman Catholicism to some extant new realities have always been added, even though the old story remained."},{"Title":"Is Jesus God?: Finding Our Faith","review":"I had resigned myself to being forever frustrated with the teaching &amp; preaching in my Catholic church. I wanted more 'meat' that I could take as a challenge to my prayer life and social justice mission. Michael has given me challenge, rooted in today's cosmology and scripture. I am grateful!"},{"Title":"Is Jesus God?: Finding Our Faith","review":"This was kind of a disappointing read. I suppose it might serve as a useful introduction for those thinking of stepping out of the darkness of conventional Christianity, but for those who have done so already, it doesn't really have anything new to offer.I think Morwood should have developed his arguments a little more. This is not a thick book (141 pages), and it suffers somewhat by suggesting radical departures from traditional Catholicism without backing them up with well-reasoned, detailed arguments. I don't know how persuasive they will be to anyone who is not already leaning in that direction -- although I suppose if they weren't already leaning in that direction, they probably wouldn't consider reading a book called &quot;Is Jesus God?&quot;While his writing style is less confrontational than Jack Spong's (which is a good thing), his work is much like Spong's in that it fails to provide a very appealing alternative vision. For this reason I can give it only a marginal recommendation."},{"Title":"Is Jesus God?: Finding Our Faith","review":"We do need more people to challenge outdated religious concepts, but Michael's arguments of &quot;updating&quot; God to match our present cosmology simply won't work.Our present scientific cosmology, whatever its limitations, was not developed with God in mind. All ideas came from observation, speculation, theory, and testing of physical results. In none of that can we find evidence of God's hand directing it.If we superimpose &quot;God&quot; on our present paradigm, what kind of God would He/She/It be? Michael proposes awe and wonder at the mystery surrounding us. We don't need God to feel that. Michael states that &quot;God remains utterly transcendent and utterly immanent&quot;.Perhaps, if we could prove the existence of a God. Michael further states &quot;God remains, even more so, the greatest mystery of all, beyond our concepts and beyond our mistaken efforts to shape God into our notion of 'person' and beyond the popular image of a male deity&quot;.In other words, when we choose &quot;God&quot;, we are choosing merely our own thoughts and ideas as to what God is.Michael writes that the apostle Paul has an outdated cosmology, and we need to reject Paul. Yet looking at the same observable facts, Paul rightly concluded in Rom 9:16 that &quot;...it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that sheweth mercy.&quot;Paul's conclusion was based on obvious physical evidence plus the fact that we cannot choose a God who is not dependent on our own beliefs and and opinions shaped by culture, genetics, and psychological dependency.Granted, the old cultural ideas of God are outdated, but simply superimposing &quot;God&quot; over a new cosmology that doesn't need him is much like corporate welfare or political porkbarrels. If there is a God, then he/she/it is not dependent on our concepts. If we place God within this new cosmology, we merely make God the result of our measurements.This is exactly what Paul, Jesus, and the disciples taught against. If man is a creation of God, then man must accept freedom for his own decisions apart from culture or ideological needs. Knowing this to be fully impossible, Jesus stands as an offering of grace for those who seek truth beyond that of men.By seeking to remove the sacrifice of Christ, Michael makes us sacrificial objects to the ideas of humans and majority rule."},{"Title":"American English Compendium","review":"The third and newly revised edition of American English Compendium: A Portable Guide To The Idiosyncrasies, Subtleties, Technical Lingo, And Conventional Wisdom Of American English by Marv Rubinstein is a \\"student friendly\\" collection of the many intricacies of the English language and the variable differences of American English from its British counterpart.

But does everyone know how to capture a Martian's attention--or his heart?Jodi Baker and six Venusian co-workers toil at Hollidays International Travel Online US (HIT-ON-US) for low pay and little appreciation. Then, excitement strikes. There's a new employee. A Martian employee, Brent Davison.The women are all over themselves trying to capture poor Brent's attention. One bakes muffins, one invites him to play basketball, one flirts outrageously-they all have their ploys. All except Jodi. She's loved and lost before and has no interest in subjecting herself to another man's possible perfidy. None of the women know that all of their efforts are for naught. Brent likes the only woman who has basically left him alone: Jodi.During a regular girls' evening out someone suggests a contest to see who can get Brent to ask for a date. Jodi opts out. When Brent does ask one of his coworkers on an innocent date, the girls concoct a new contest. It's to see who can seduce a Martian of her choice into a relationship.Jodi and Brent, while keeping their relationship secret, are already on the fast-track. Just as Jodi suffered heartache in the past-she was left at the altar-so has Brent. Years before, his fianc? snuck behind his back and flew to the west coast for a job interview, then died in a plane crash. Despite his hold on the past, Brent is drawn to Jodi, and in time comes to view his fianc?'s actions through a more realistic lens.The joy in this book is in watching the women interact. By the end, they all find their places, although not all seductions end as we might expect. Cynthianna masterfully handles eight main characters, keeping them separate and unique entities so the reader has the chance to feel comfortable with them all. Another thing I really enjoyed are the emails from Jodi to her best friend and Brent to one of his frat brothers, a great vehicle to fill in events she didn't want to show us in real time and for back story.I would definitely recommend this book, and in fact, already have!"},{"Title":"Seven Ways to Seduce a Martian","review":"Title: Seven Ways To Seduce A MartianAuthor: Cynthianna AppelPublisher: Triskelion PublishingISBN: 1-933471-88-3Written by Cynthianna Appel --author of \\"Scrambled Eggs\\" and \\"Beautiful Dreamer\\", \\"Seven Ways To Seduce A Martian\\" is a delightful, humorous and steamy read...definitely for adults only.After being dumped at the altar, Jodi Baker takes a time out to lick her wounds, and heal her broken heart. She puts her dreams of a higher education on hold, and takes a dead end office job.The all female staff is titillated by the new blood in the office, the quiet, but handsome, Mr. Brent Davison. When a girls night out results in a serious wager, (Who will bed the new guy first?) Jodi wants nothing of it, but still has to stand by and watch her friends make fools of themselves.

I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Seven Ways to Seduce a Martian","review":"As the token male in an all women office, Brent Davison is positive there's no way these women can be sane. As far as he's concerned, they're all crazy, with the lone exception of his cube mate, Jodi, who seems to be the only one who isn't trying to seduce him in one way or another. Brent had his experience with love once and isn't about to subject himself to that heartache again anytime soon.Jodi Baker may be the only woman in the office not trying to seduce Brent but that doesn't mean she isn't interested in him. After being left at the altar, Jodi has no intention of getting involved with any man and definitely isn't about to get involved in the office \\"seduce the Martian\\" game. Oddly enough, Jodi's \\"normalcy\\" is the main thing that calls Brent's attention to her.Having a man in the office is obviously a huge deal for the women of Holidays International Travel Online Us - otherwise known as HIT ON US. They descended on him with their various offerings and invitations until Brent becomes fully aware that these are desperate women and has to email his brother to request reinforcement. Of course, that's before the women get together at the Zodiac Caf&eacute; where each one bets that she can get the resident Martian to go out on a date with her. The only woman who doesn't get in on the bet is Jodi. Instead, she sits back and watches the other six women strut their stuff in hopes of snagging Brent's interest. Once Mel manages to get him to escort her to her cousin's wedding, which should have been the end of the craziness, but some women just can't handle not winning a bet so Gabriela bets that she can get Brent into her bed before he could remember any of their last names. This bet, Jodi does get in on, but her counter bet is that she can get Brent to know every one of the women's last names by the end of the week - with the exception of Gabriela's. So far she's been successful at hiding her attraction for Brent from most of their co-workers but what will happen when the boss, Mr. Johansson, puts them on a new project together? They'll get to share an office and spend lots of time up close and personal. Will either of them be able to resist temptation?SEVEN WAYS TO SEDUCE A MARTIAN is an incredibly charming and funny story. You can just picture this poor man being bombarded with tons of unwanted female attention. I got the biggest kick out of his emails to his brother, as well as Jodi's emails to her girlfriend. They were so animated, and it was great fun to read what they'd say through email. While the main storyline is Jodi and Brent's romance, I loved that Cynthianna Appel didn't leave out details about the other coworkers' various relationships as they developed. Each of these women is so different that it's hard to imagine them as friends but they balance each other out beautifully. If you're looking for a very funny story with heart, SEVEN WAYS TO SEDUCE A MARTIAN is the ideal book for you.Chrissy Dionne (courtesy of Romance Junkies)"},{"Title":"Seven Ways to Seduce a Martian","review":"Jodi Baker is working for a company in what she believes is a dead end job, until she can get over a nasty break up and afford to get back into school. All of her co-workers are young single women like herself with the exception of the newest employee - Brent Davison. His entry into the female office causes quite a sensation among the ladies and begins the start of various bets and contests. As the token male of the office, Brent is aware that his co-employees are finding any and every excuse to be in his office with the exception of one - Jodi. Brent is also recovering from a broken heart, although from a totally different type of event and using this job to help put his life back into some type of order.Jodi and Brent are put together by their boss in a very small office so that they can do a project. Close quarters seem to be all that it takes to get their sparks turned into a fire. Each of them has a best friend from college that is their sounding board and as the relationship goes on they are emailing those friends often for advice, support and venting. As the project goes forward, so does their relationship; the co-workers continue the betting and contests within the office, which affects all of them in various ways.Ms. Appel's story Seven Ways to Seduce a Martian shows how life can be both fun and heartbreaking to younger singles, even how personal and working relationships can form your life and even change what you thought your life goals were. While I do believe that this story will appeal to a certain section of women, I found that it just could not keep my attention or interest.JoReviewed for Joyfully Reviewed"},{"Title":"Tofu Quick & Easy","review":"Tofu - Quick and Easy is a small cookbook packed with a bounty of wonderful recipes.

It is also a good book for the vegetarian cook who is trying to convince a non-veg friend, or someone who does not like or isn't sure about tofu, that tofu can taste good.A few specifics:Just after my aunt (a meat-eater) had gastric bypass surgery, she had trouble keeping down several types of meats, and in order to get protein as her doctor ordered, she started incorporating tofu into her diet here & there. Her favorites were the lasagna recipes. She said if you didn't know it was tofu, you'd have a hard time actually telling it apart from real ricotta-cheese lasagnas. Even my uncle, whose pickier than my aunt, and hates tofu to boot, liked the lasagna recipe.As for me, I am in love with the macaroni & tofu with dairy free cheese. This is the closest I've come for a vegan version of macaroni & cheese, the way I grew up with it (as a dairy/meat-loving person). One recommendation: use the \\"follow your heart\\" brand vegan cheese (unless you make your own). That brand I've discovered, tends to melt the best of all the store-bought vegan cheeses I've tried.Other favorite recipes of mine, the garbanzo bean salad, the scrambled tofu rancheros (or other scrambled tofu recipes), the cucumber-avocado soup, any of the cheesecake recipes, & deviled tofu.So, in a nutshell, you can't go wrong with most of the recipes in this book.

Whether this book delivers will remain to be seen...."},{"Title":"Resurrection (The Penguin classics)","review":"This has been on my shelf for a number of years and only recently have I gotten around to reading it. I've read all of Tolstoy with the exception ofChildhood, Boyhood, and Youthand a few selections fromTolstoy: Tales of Courage and Conflict; so I know his style as well as anyone can hope who doesn't read or speak the Russian language or have a Ph.D. in Russian Literature. I think--before I get farther--I would recommend the Rosemary Edmonds translation. It is very similar to Maude's, but flows much better. After I finished reading this book, I read a very effusive praising of the opening paragraph from someone fluent in both English and Russian. I hadn't given much thought to the opening and even found it a bit bungled, but this made me compare the translation I had read with a few others, and that was a good thing. In Maude's translation it is broken in such a stilted manner that it loses coherence by a too faithful, slightly word-for-word translation that seems constantly underfoot (I really dislike the trend of Peaverizing currently sweeping the literary world by storm, the most ridiculous example being the Proust Peaverizing by Penguin). I know Tolstoy uses different techniques and his writing and one of those was to mimic poor or sloppy writing, but the chance of ever rendering into English things that have no syntactic equivalent is simply a stubborn indulgence on the translator's part. But the first paragraph is remarkable because it's essentially a distillation of the novel, and humanity itself if you take the novel's message to heart. Now if you look at the Edmonds' translation of the first paragraph you get a specific idea (in a sweeping establishing shot a la Dickens, a personal favorite of Tolstoy's by the way) of the scene as a unified whole with those pieces of late-life Tolstoy cynicism common to his later work smeared into the edges. Perhaps the staccato is missing but the entire thrust is more clearly understood. Again (to labor the point) look at the last scene between Nekhlyudov and Maslova. It's brutally concise, and considering the novel consistently centers around Nekhlydov's relationship to her, it should be emotionally resonant even in its brevity. Tolstoy never shied away from rendering his character's inner thoughts or feelings, he is perhaps the strongest novelist in this aspect, so the scene though brief and filled with ineffable thoughts from both characters is very important to the novel and what follows. This scene (and the one preceding it involving the General's daughter) read much better in the Edmonds translation.The structure of the book is much like Gogol'sDead Soulswith Nekhlydov as a Chichikovian wanderer through the different strata of Russian society. He might have more of a connection to these scenes than the much slighter and unctious Chichokov, who sometimes seems an inert fixture before all the provincial pageantry Gogol conjures up. Funny enough, the initial scenes of Nekhlyudov's dealings within the aristocratic society are clipped and vaguely trenchant. Remarkable for the fact that Tolstoy rarely approached these scenes and others with such a heavy hand, so it's a little forced and unnatural, a quality not usually found in any of Tolstoy's work. Perhaps it was his intention to assist the reader in making the transition that Nekhlydov is making as he becomes more alienated and disgusted by that high society. This aspect is probably what has given the novel it's poor reputation among Tolstoy admirers.There are parts of this novel that you see very distinctly the two conflicting aspects of Tolstoy's personality, encapsulated before in the contrasting duality that is Anna and Levin in Anna Karenina. Probably less effective here in this novel than ever before as full reign is given to the sententious idealist, the Levin if you will. Though if you've read stories from the Tales of Courage you may be accustomed to the christian pedagogy overtook his work as he approached death.Fortunately there are enough scenes and descriptions by the Master for a pleasing read, so I don't think this book is entirely devoid of merit; and as a book that is the last substantial contribution of one of the great 19th century authors it should be considered essential reading (Hadji Muradis actually his last work, fittingly, it's more novella than novel, a swan song to the artistic, aesthetic side that was all but squeezed out of this novel by excessive moralizing). I believe the resentments readers have is that they are denied entrance into those splendid drawing rooms of the rich, always a supreme treat of Tolstoy's then and today. But if you like Zola-type earthiness some of the prison scenes, particularly the early scene in the women's prison and the later ones that center around a group of political prisoners, are to me more affirmation of his writing prowess. Actually, I think he's doing Zola one better than Zola.Fundamentally, this is an existential book about the human condition. You feel and sometimes identify with Nekhlyudov (I would think anyone who reads this is a thoughtful, moral person like Nekhlyudov) and Tolstoy shows that it's easier said than done, trying to make this world a better place, somehow beyond our power. But he has chosen to illustrate that question in this novel, quite well I think, and it's one we will eternally ask ourselves. The \\"why\\" of life.So if you want a novel with a sociological power-train, try it out. The fact it's Tolstoy is a blessing. You won't particularly like Nekhlyudov, but you pity him and sympathize with struggle. Overall, the realm of Dostoevsky (ideas, philosophies, cruxes as novels) as tried on by Tolstoy. Interesting and compelling nonetheless."},{"Title":"Resurrection (The Penguin classics)","review":"Tolstoy's third and last novel is about resurrection from moral and spiritual death to an entirely different and improved new life. In its closing pages, Dmitri Nekhlyudov arrives at an understanding of what he sees as the correct - indeed, the only acceptable - approach to life. Referring to St Matthew's Gospel, the Sermon on the Mount in particular, he formulates five rules for living in peace and harmony with God, his fellow beings, other creatures, the earth, and himself.Nekhlyudov's position is mirrored by that of Katerina Maslova, though the commencement of her new life does not follow a religious awakening. For both Nekhlyudov and Katerina, the new beginning is the culmination of a long and hard journey. Katerina is of peasant stock; hence her ability, in Tolstoy's view, to work out her own, albeit imperfect, salvation. Being of aristocratic birth and family, Nekhlyudov could never do that, despite sincere efforts to disperse his inheritance, relate to the common people at a level with which they feel comfortable, and his outrage at the ways in which organized society exploits and ultimately destroys them.Tolstoy completed Resurrection in a hurry to raise money to help a group of religious dissenters migrate to Canada. The hurry may explain why the scale of the book is not closer to that of Anna Karenina, with more fully worked-out personal relationships and the transmission of ideas through dialogue rather than narrative. Failure on the latter is noticeable many times; such as when we are told Nekhlyudov's thoughts on a matter under discussion at a high society dinner, and then simply, \\"Nekhlyudov said what he had been thinking\\". A great disappointment given that verbal debate is such a strong feature of Tolstoy's earlier novels.But there are many touching vignettes, such as that of the peasant, Taras Birukov. Immediately following her arranged marriage, his young wife was so unhappy she attempted to poison him and his parents. She has now grown to love him, and he remains at her side as she is transported to Siberia.The book relates a great many injustices done to both criminal and political prisoners, to the lower classes in general, and to women. It's a document of its time, yet for as long as exploitation and injustice abound, it will remain of contemporary relevance. Resurrection is in any case a must for those who have already read and loved Tolstoy's earlier works.Louise Maude's translation was first published in 1916, but it has been updated and is adequate. The introduction by Richard Gustafson is helpful, as are his notes and list of characters. Tony Briggs' introduction to the 2009 Penguin edition is also worth reading. The two introductions and that of Rosemary Edmonds to the 2004 Penguin edition can be compared using Amazon's Look Inside feature, but all are best read after the novel, not before."},{"Title":"Resurrection (The Penguin classics)","review":"I kept waiting for Tolstoy to get off the soapbox, but it never happened. The writing is classic, and the characterization very easy to follow. But the payoff was lacking -- it seemed to me that the book was more interested in making a point (which I think was Tolstoy's object anyway) than actually having a book that provides a true novel experience.

After reading only a few pages, I found myself forgetting that this was a fictional character. I became emotionally caught up in the ebb and flow of her life in the Appalachian mountains of Virginia, beginning at the turn of the century. Lee Smith, by writing the story of an &quot;everyday woman&quot;, has proven the point that every living person has a story, no matter what their circumastances, if only there was someone to bring it to light. Ivy is a rich and vital character, a true survivor, who lives fully, loves deeply, works hard, and values all that is good in life and people. Ivy isn't perfect. She's flawed, like all the rest of us. The real beauty of this book is that Lee Smith has seen fit to shine a light on a character who is poor but proud, uneducated but intelligent, unsophisticated but filled with quiet dignity, and manages to get through the tough times with a delightful sense of humor and emotional clarity.

Soon, you will be so involved with the story that you will fail to see that the writer has changed, grown into an educatedand brilliant woman, yet one still filled with the love and excitement of her youth. You will remember her always, and be glad."},{"Title":"Fair and Tender Ladies.","review":"Lee Smith takes us on a historical fictional tour of rural south in the late 19th to mid 20th century through the life if Ivy Rowe.

Ivy's complex nature and curiosity drives her to experience life on the edge, no matter the consequences.Lee Smith beautifully chronicles the life of a Steel Magnolia through Ivy Rowe and we are the better for it."},{"Title":"Fair and Tender Ladies.","review":"This was one of the best books I have read lately. It is good to see authors writing stories that depict the importance of families and an understanding of our past."},{"Title":"Fair and Tender Ladies.","review":"I Had to read this for a college class. I procrastinated then fiinally picked it up...from the moment I did..I didnt want to put it down. Ive Rowe would have been my best friend had she been real and had I lived during those years. Traveling With Ive throughout her life was a pleasure. You never knew what she would do or say next. She was a spitfire who never forgot her roots. A must read for anyone looking for a wonderful book!!"},{"Title":"Fair and Tender Ladies.","review":"Lee Smith's novel evokes the heart of Appalachians they do not reveal to outsiders or, sometimes, themselves. Set in a bygone time, the world Lee Smith creates is populated by timeless characters."},{"Title":"Fair and Tender Ladies.","review":"This is a life story of a girl/lady that grew up in a very rural setting and her encounters with life, including her dreams for herself and her family. I liked the way the main character used letters to others to tell the story of her life. Her story showed me the ebb and flow of life."},{"Title":"Fair and Tender Ladies.","review":"Like The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society, this book is constructed entirely of letters. However, in this case all the letters are written by the same person--Ivy Rowe. Many of the letters are addressed to Ivy's sister Silvaney and never mailed, and these are the most reflective and informative. I almost stopped reading after the first 10 pages, in which Ivy is an uneducated teenager in the early 1900s, and her spelling is atrocious. However, her grammar and spelling do improve as the book progresses. The title implies to me that the women in the novel are pampered and vacuous, but that is certainly not the case. Ivy is spunky and passionate, and eventually \\"ruint.\\" She finally settles down with a good man after almost losing him in a mining accident but then strays during a midlife crisis that has tragic consequences. The book spans Ivy's entire life, and there are so many characters that I occasionally got mixed up. Some of them disappear for a while and then crop up again. No one is forgotten, so that closure is complete on all fronts. The characters also raise one another's children, as circumstances require, and I wondered if that was a common practice during the time period."},{"Title":"Fair and Tender Ladies.","review":"When I ordered this book, I did so because I like the author. Only after I started reading it did I realize it was reprinted and that I had read it years before. I enjoyed it again!!A good book from a great author."},{"Title":"Fair and Tender Ladies.","review":"I'm so thrilled to have a signed First Edition (in Like New condition!) copy of what In think is Lee Smith's MASTERPIECE. I love all of her writing, but this correspondence from heroine Ivy Rowe to her sister Sylvie paints a picture of Ivy's life, her spirit, her soul, her surroundings, and the other very real characters who inhabit Ivy's time here on earth. I did not want the book to end."},{"Title":"Fair and Tender Ladies.","review":"I love all of Ms. Smith's books, but this one is my all time very favorite. Ivy's thoughts and feelings throughout her lifetime are captured in her letters. From her childhood through her marriage, nothing is left out. If you have never read Ms. Smith's stories, this is the one to start with. You will not be able to put it down."},{"Title":"Fair and Tender Ladies.","review":"It was a little hard to get into the story, but I soon was caught up into the life of Ivy, who was so appreciative of the little joys of life, which in the end turn out to be the real joys of life. I am talking about the beauty of nature and the ties of family, and friendship. I found the book to be realistic with the ebb and flow of real life. Thanks to Lee Smith!"},{"Title":"Fair and Tender Ladies.","review":"Makes me wish I'd listened to my grandparents tell stories in front of a fire as I was going to bed. Can't put it down. Reccommended especially for women I think."},{"Title":"Fair and Tender Ladies.","review":"I read Fair and Tender Ladies twice within a few months of each other. I can't even begin to accurately describe the subtle power of Lee Smith's writings. She pulls the reader into the text so gently that the realization of textual involvement comes only at the end when it is painful to turn to the last page, painful to end this magical journey. Lee Smith's writing is so real that you not only want to be a part of the novel, you *must* be a part of it. She has quickly become one of my favorite authors and I only hope interest in her and public exposure to her novels will grow."},{"Title":"Fair and Tender Ladies.","review":"To read the plot summary off the cover, you would have thought that this was a lovely poignant classic, along the lines of \\"Little House\\" or something. Just sounded so sweet. It wasn't. I got tired of the over the top, bizarre sexual scenarios, they were perverted and so unnecessary to the otherwise compelling story. It seemed so forced as if the author thought it vital to the selling of the book to throw in various gratuitous sex scenes. Nothing like the style of story you would think you were getting from the paragraph descriptions above on this book. I got half way through the book and gave up....wasted time. Very disappointed."},{"Title":"Fair and Tender Ladies.","review":"_Fair and Tender Ladies_ tells the secrets of the soul of Appalachia. Tracing the life of Ivy Rowe from youth to old age through her letters, the book is an Appalachian masterpiece. Ms. Smith was supposedly inspired to write this book after coming across a bundle of letters at a yard sale. She claims not to have read the letters (after all, they were private!), but she felt a story like this should be told.Here, Lee Smith tells the story of Ivy Rowe, rural Appalachia, the impact big business coal mining, love, hope, and life. If you know nothing of Appalachia, let this be your introduction. If you live there, let it be your celebration. If you are alive, let this story draw you along, softly whispering the story of your own humanity to you--one letter at a time."},{"Title":"Fair and Tender Ladies.","review":"This is one of the few books that I have read more than once. Lee Smith is a master of the southern genre, with characters who are completely emersed in the South, and this is her best to date. The letters in this books keep it moving and keeps the reader engrossed. It is sad, hopeful, and very full of life. Read it if you need a treat."},{"Title":"Fair and Tender Ladies.","review":"This is a book I absolutely love, and one that I intend to keep in my personal library. To me, it is about choices- choices that Ivy Rowe and every woman/person makes in their day to day lives. Ivy had the choice to stay on the mountain, or go to stay with her friends in town. Throughout her life, she had many choices to make- go to a nice school or not, where to live, whom to marry. But throughout it all, I respected Ivy's CHOICES. Sometimes,maybe, she made the wrong choices, but she always bounced back. She did what was right for her, without pretense, without apology, without regret."},{"Title":"Fair and Tender Ladies.","review":"This is one of the best books that I have ever read. Lee Smith brings these characters alive in a way that few authors are able to do. When you begin the book, you enter Ivy's life, and when the book ends, you feel as if you have lost a best friend. An unforgettable experience."},{"Title":"Fair and Tender Ladies.","review":"I love Ivy Rowe; especially the child Ivy whose words and observations make me smile and sometimes laugh out loud.While I know some readers find adjusting to the letter-style of this book a little difficult, I found it a compelling read from the first page. I wrote lots of letters as a child, so perhaps that is why this style seems so natural to me.I was most impressed with Ivy's words and style of speaking - this is exactly what Ivy does; she speaks through her letters because they are written exactly the way an Ivy Rowe would speak. It was very interesting to see how there are subtle changes in Ivy's words, phrases and spelings as she gets older and reads more.I cried when Ivy hears the bell for the last time: I rarely cry when reading and I read a lot."},{"Title":"Fair and Tender Ladies.","review":"This book gives an amazing view into the heart and mind of a girl, Ivy, born in the Appalachians of southern Virginia. You see the world through letters she writes during her entire life. The \\"misspellings\\" and local dialect contribute much to the tale. You are gradually taken into her world. It is a masterful piece of writing that draws you inevitably to the conclusion. A wonderful, sensitive book!"},{"Title":"Fair and Tender Ladies.","review":"I can't imagine reading a more interesting book. I am not an avid reader, but since I started on Lee's books, I never watch television at night- I read. What a unique idea to tell Ivy's story through her letters."},{"Title":"Fair and Tender Ladies.","review":"\\"Fair and Tender Ladies\\" is a story set in the hollows of Appalachian Virginia, and is told through letters written by the protagonist and narrator, Ivy Rowe. Her letters begin when she's a young girl and end at the end of her life, and she unfolds her own story by writing to her relatives and friends. Her life is filled with incredible poverty, struggles, opportunities, unusual characters, serendipity, and blessings galore. Lee Smith is a very fine writer, and the development of this novel through an epistolary structure is unique, difficult to pull off, but this particular effort is as good a novel as I've read in a very long time. I fell in love with Ivy, and I found myself in her life and struggles. I finished the novel a few days ago, but I'm still moved by the beauty that Ivy exposes in a life of simplicity, connection with nature and dedication to family. Anyone who loves the beauty of Appalachia and the stories abounding in the human condition will love this absolutely lyrical novel."},{"Title":"Fair and Tender Ladies.","review":"This author is one of my favorites and here has produced another masterpiece. It's hard to imagine that Ivy won't stay in the mind of the reader for a long, long time. She steps off the pages of the book as a very real and fully-formed person who has wonderful perception, insight and depth to her character. She never leaves home but lives more fully than many a globe trotter because she LIVES every day. In that way she fulfills the enormous potential she had as a child even without adding conventional achievements to a resume. I absolutely loved this book and Ivy!"},{"Title":"Fair and Tender Ladies.","review":"This is a great novel by one of America's most talented living Southern writers. Written in epistles, this novel is poignant and memorable. Fair and Tender Ladies is the only book that has made me cry in recent years--a must read."},{"Title":"Fair and Tender Ladies.","review":"What can I say but this is in the top 3 of my all time favorite reads. Leave youself some time at the end for a good cry. Fantastic."},{"Title":"Fair and Tender Ladies.","review":"A good read for a day at thebeach. Not too much in this story that needs deep thinking, sort of popcorn for the brain."},{"Title":"Fair and Tender Ladies.","review":"The writing style of this book is very different but I think it made it easier to understand. The &quot;letters&quot; are wrote in everyday &quot;Dixie&quot; language. I loved this book. It was fun and it was touching. The story of interaction between family women---and sometimes here in the south, that can be a love/hate relationship. Wonderful book. Ivy loved her family and the memories."},{"Title":"Fair and Tender Ladies.","review":"This is just an excellent novel by a fine writer. In all honesty I'm sort of at a loss here so I'll just say that you should read this book. You'll thank all of us who have recommended it to you.Oh, I heard Lee Smith interviewed and she's really worth hearing. She's funny, self-effacing and smart."},{"Title":"Fair and Tender Ladies.","review":"I'll admit that I haven't finished reading this novel yet, and I'm going to try to grit my teeth and get through it. However, I'm finding that Ivy is getting on my nerves, and I'm at about the middle of the book. At first, her childlike observations were appropriate because she was . . . well, a child. However, this gets to be ridiculous as she grows older. I mean, she's starting to seem like a simpleton. I know she doesn't have much education, but even with that in mind, she wouldn't be so child-like. Ater having gotten pregnant once out of wedlock, she starts an affair with another man. Where was her concern about getting pregnant again??? Also, what's starting to annoy me is that she keeps referring to herself as \\"ruined,\\" but there is barely any outside societal manifestation of this. She is not shunned by anyone, and the man that she grew up with and eventually marries doesn't seem to think anything of marrying a woman who had a child out of wedlock and openly carried on an affair with some hot shot in town. I do not think it would be acceptable during that time for a young woman to openly carry on a sexual relationships like Ivy did. I'm not saying that women didn't have pre-marital sex, but I'm saying that it wasn't done so openly. I hate when authors put contemporary mindsets on people in historical novels.Overall, this book is engaging at times, but I've started to dislike the protagonist more and more as I continue reading.Update 6/28/08 - I finished reading this, and overall, I do think that its a worthwhile read. Also, I think the author is talented. I must say, though, that the novel was depressing. It is definitely one that will make you cry at the end, not because of any specific tragedy. It's sad because it so clearly shows us how swiftly life passes. This book is good, but in a way, I wish I hadn't read it because it is not uplifting (I guess you just have to be in the mood for this kind of novel)."},{"Title":"Fair and Tender Ladies.","review":"I picked up this title while reading another review on the book &quot;Gap Creek&quot; By Robert Morgan. Which I also enjoyed. Once I read the reviews on this book I couldn't wait to read it. When I began reading Ivy Rowe's letters I could not stop and when I did stop I was still thinking of the things she had written all through the day. I grew so close to her. I laughed and I cried. Her voice &amp; hands will wrap around your heart and stay with you long after you read the last page. This is truly my best read of the year 2000. I borrowed this particular book to read but I plan to buy a personal copy for many more years of pleasure. Thank you Lee Smith for enlightening my life through Ivy Rowe."},{"Title":"Fair and Tender Ladies.","review":"I'll read anything by Lee Smith, but this is her best. It's a saga, the chronicaling of a child's (as she grows to old age and death) Appalachian life in a cabin 'up a holler.'Rich with loving detail, philosophy, and the indications of the passing of time not only for the protagonist but also for her community and the country itself, it'll make you laugh and cry and sigh.Read it, if you haven't already!"},{"Title":"Fair and Tender Ladies.","review":"This book was a dream to read. The main character, Ivy Rowe, seems just like an old Auntie or neighbor or someone everyone who grew up Southern would have known. She is a cut up. Her life was not an easy one, but she remained fairly optimistic throughout. It was a sweet and very touching book and it was extremely well written. The way Ms. Smith wrote the dialect was impecable. It was as if someone were telling you a story in your ear rather than reading pages in a book. I was truly transported to all the mountains and towns she writes about in this book. Now I cannot wait to sink my teeth into some of her other works."},{"Title":"Fair and Tender Ladies.","review":"I felt sad when I had finished this book, for there is much wisdom in it. I resisted it for a long while, finding flaws everywhere, but finally had to succomb. The story is told through the letters of one woman from Appalachia, Ivy Rose. She is perhaps wiser and more in tune with the 90s than a woman born in 1900 in the hills should be, but it is a glowing book, alive with the beauty of the Cumberland mountains in western Virginia. It was never the events she describes in her letters that were important - it was the writing of them. The author may be using this as a metaphor for our lives. It is never what happens that is important, but merely the living of it. For so much repeats itself through the generations. It is a wise, wise, book, engrossing and entertaining. Alive to the last page."},{"Title":"Fair and Tender Ladies.","review":"Fair and Tender Ladies tells the lifelong story of Ivy Rowe, a woman growing up and growing old in Appalachian Virginia. The story is told totally through a long series of letters she writs to family, friends, lovers and acquaintances.Ivy's life is one of abject poverty and hardship. Most of her siblings dies young. Her father is disabled through the majority of the book, Her mother is a tormented and exploited soul. Ivy has several chances to escape all this but the pull of place and family keeps her firmly entrenched where she is.This out to be a thoroughly depressing book--instead it is a truly inspiring book. For, though objectively a person with virtually nothing, Ivy sees herself as uniquely blessed. The life force that carries her into old age is one that sees the glass perpetually as half full--her hardships are, to her eyes, less threatening and frightening than those she sees around her. She is essentially saved several times by people she dos not know or whom she has previously rejected. Though she is often exploited she does not allow those experiences to harden her heart.This is not to say Ivy is soft or naive. She merely sees hard times as the burden of life and chooses to write her letters to make sense of it all where she can and merely record it if she can't.I would have thought the letter format would wear after a while. It did not. It in fact created a sense of intimacy that enhanced the reading experience.All in all, this is one of the best books I read in years. I was thoroughly enchanted throughout. I can only rejoice in the large body of work that lee Smith has for me to work through. If her other efforts are even a fraction as good as this book, I have a lot of great reading ahead of me."},{"Title":"Fair and Tender Ladies.","review":"Deft storytelling, timeless truths about women's lives, and an authentic voice that I can vouch for, having spent time with family in that part of the world. Ivy's story helps me to finally understand a lot about my own late mother, who grew up there and would have been only a few years younger than her. Like Smith, when I went to college and read Faulkner, I wondered what South he was talking about, since what I knew was Appalachian Virginia. Finally, this wonderful writer has captured the essence of that other, fascinating &quot;secret&quot; South, which has little to do with the Civil War and is more than just Hatfields and McCoys. I cannot heap enough praise on this book."},{"Title":"Fair and Tender Ladies.","review":"I read this book for my book club and was not overly excited. I would probably never have chosen it on my own, but willing to try it for my group. The more I read the more I slowed down and savored each page and the more I began dreading the last page. It is an amazing book and I will read it again someday. Do not miss this - this is why we read books!"},{"Title":"Fair and Tender Ladies.","review":"This book did everything a good read should do. It made me laugh, made me cry, made me feel all the emotions and struggles of a young girl growing and facing life with its joys and disappointments. I loved her down-home common sense and yet her faith in others. I have read my copy three times, and I never have re-read books before. BUY IT. You wont be sorry."},{"Title":"Fair and Tender Ladies.","review":"Since every review I've read of this book says that women should definitely read it, I have to add that men will enjoy it, too. Being raised in Appalachia, it gave me a better understanding of my own mother, aunts, and grandmother. This is one of the best and most underrated books of the century. When you start it, you'll wonder what you've gotten yourself into. Before you know it, you won't be able to put it down. Please don't pass this wonderful novel up, one of my favorites of all time. Lee Smith is the best Southern writer there is, period."},{"Title":"Fair and Tender Ladies.","review":"This book is lovingly crafted by Lee Smith. Taking place in the mostly uninhabited mountains in turn of the century Virginia, the letter-writer, Ivy provides her readers with an eagle's eye view of her life. The letters span from her childhood through her last hours, and never have I read a book that so quickly and compellingly pulled me into it's core and kept me there. Very few readers will close this book with a dry eye, and for months after finishing it, will find themselves floating back to Ivy and the characters and times surrounding her. I would give this a big 10"},{"Title":"Fair and Tender Ladies.","review":"Rose is one of the most beautiful characters in American fiction, and Ms.Smith delves into every nuance of her heart and soul in a monograph style that shows us every phase of her development and shares all her secrets. The Appalachian setting and Ms. Lee's scholarly research only enhance this joyful celebration of life."},{"Title":"Fair and Tender Ladies.","review":"All of Lee Smith's books are good, but two of them are classics: Oral History and Fair and Tender Ladies. Fair & Tender Ladies is the skillfully woven story of an Appalachian girl and her family from her youth through old age. She is one of the most captivating heroines of my reading experience. If you like good writing, read Fair & Tender Ladies!"},{"Title":"Fair and Tender Ladies.","review":"This novel left me wanting to go sit and visit with Ivy Rowe - I know her that well after reading her letters.

Ivy is a delight. Her story is revealed through letters from when she is a young girl to when she is an older woman. We formed a bookclub in 1998 and picked this book as our first book. We so loved the book that we choose the name of our group as the Fair and Tender Ladies Bookclub (otherwise known as FTL). We just reread the book this past month and loved it as much as we did many years ago.

I have truely enjoyed this book and I am looking forward to reading several more of her books in the future."},{"Title":"Fair and Tender Ladies.","review":"A delightfully unique format for a novel. It is filled with history of the region and the characters come to life in a way that is real and I learned to care about them. It was a good read."},{"Title":"Fair and Tender Ladies.","review":"How I hated for this book to end! I LOVE Lee Smith's writings. She is truly one of THE BEST authors of our time. If you have not read her, PLEASE DO. She NEVER EVER disappoints.This wondeful book is written in the form of letters by one Miss Ivy Rowe. The letters span the lifetime of Ivy. She LOVES to write letters and writes to friends, family, acquaintances. Ivy chronicles her entire life from a young teenager to her death (SOB!! -- yes, SOB!!) in these letters.Ivy lives and dies in the Appalachian Mountain area. She lives through World Wars, ups and downs, feast and famine, good times, bad times, pain, sorrow, joy, happiness. Her letters tell all and tell all very, very well. You meet her family and friends all through her letters to various people. She is outspoken, kind, tough, sweet, loving, caring. Ivy's life was never easy, yet she handles every hurdle with common sense and humor.At first it was a little slow going reading this book as her letters are written in true form of someone who lived in the early 1900's with very, very little education. However, Ivy is one of the lucky people who can read and write and loves to do both.Her spunk, wit, and just IVY will make this one of your favorite books of all time. I loved the format of the book, it is different than any other book I have ever read. I know this is one book that I will not soon forget. Ms. Lee Smith has the outstanding talent of making her characters so life-like and totally people you believe in. How sad I was when this wonderful tale ended. This book also contained much history of our country and I believe I learned a great deal -- in a fun and interesting way -- about our country's colorful history.Do yourself a favor and read this book and then read all of the other treasures that Ms. Smith has waiting for you. You will not be sorry.Thanks!Pam"},{"Title":"Fair and Tender Ladies.","review":"I am rarely so moved by a book that I cry at the end, but that was the case with this book. I found it entertaining, touching, and very moving. The character of Ivy, and the others, are all very real and likeable. I would definately recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"Fair and Tender Ladies.","review":"Don't let its form scare you, though it is a novel composed entirely of letters that Ivy writes (you don't get to read any responses), by the end of the book you'll wonder how any one could even think of writing a novel another way.

I've read it three times and I still can't get enough of it."},{"Title":"Fair and Tender Ladies.","review":"Lee Smith captures the essence of what it is to be a woman.

She has enriched me."},{"Title":"Fair and Tender Ladies.","review":"The characters in Lee Smith's novel are beautifully developed to break the readers' hearts with their naive honesty and devotion to human goodness.

It was like consuming a very wonderful, rich dessert - too bad it has to come to an end but you feel well-sated."},{"Title":"Fair and Tender Ladies.","review":"Loved the way this was written through the letters of this woman. Ms. Smith was so descriptive about her characters. This would make a great movie! You could feel this woman's emotions throughout the book; especially her joys and pains."},{"Title":"Fair and Tender Ladies.","review":"I am disappointed with this novel. I've lived in the mountains portrayed in this novel all my life and really tried to like this story but I just can't. It was very interesting in the beginning. Ivy's take on the world as a child is humorous and witty but sadly these attributes seem to vanish as she gets older. The older she gets the more simple-minded she seems. She is more of a spectator of life as an adult, just relaying events in her letters without the witty observations she provided as a child. Some of the situations are just absurd also. A grown woman running off with a man she has met twice, leaving her husband and children, and living in a cave together in the mountain above her home just to have an adulterous relationship? It's ridiculous."},{"Title":"Fair and Tender Ladies.","review":"Our book club read this book and everyone loved it. We discussed it for 2 hours. I would highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Fair and Tender Ladies.","review":"This book consumed all my time until I finished, then I hated that I didn't take longer to read it, just to make it last. It is so so good. I felt like these were my own people. I've heard little bits and sayings, even the strange older names like the ones in this book all of my life and now I know where it all came from. I want to now get more in touch with some of my own family history that came from the hills just like these. The writing and dialect may be harder for someone not raised in the south or appalachia, but you will get it, and be careful you may find yourself talking just a little like these people, the story gets into you."},{"Title":"Fair and Tender Ladies.","review":"Members of our Book Club were mixed over the review of this book (and we are all women). The format of the book was difficult for some - this includes the language as well as the letter format. It was annoying at times that Ivy's letters were not answered...some were never mailed, thus the book was a bit more like reading someone's diary. Some in our group related well to Ivy's life...mostly the loneliness she felt and a craving for something more. It reminds you of how things were when your grandmothers/great grandmothers were growing up."},{"Title":"Fair and Tender Ladies.","review":"The book did take a few weeks to get here, but it was in great condition. I didn't have any problems."},{"Title":"Fair and Tender Ladies.","review":"This one was painful to read. All of the dialogue is underlined (yes, I know it's supposed to be hundreds of fictional letters, but unfortunately, like real letters, the content tends to drift), and I found that distracting.

His dispassionate exposure of the premeditated and unimaginably sinister methods used by Communists to steal and retain power is a service to the free world...especially given that so many modern, radical organizations (particularly those on the left) utilize the very same tactics to cynically manipulate opinion and exert influence.

It is about a young girl and her friends who journey off to boarding school. The exciting part happens when one of the girls (Lloyd or the Little Colonel) falls dangeressly ill. After traveling back home for a well needed vacation the Little Colonel learns that she is on the verge of a mental breakdown and that she is mentally unstable to return to school. She feels discouraged until she remembers a story from school that helped her pull herself together and concentrate on other people's lives instead of just her own. If you are ages 9-12 and like a relaxing and enjoyable story I would recommend &quot;The Little Colonel's Christmas Vacation.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Little Colonel's Christmas Vacation","review":"A cheery story of a group of girls in a morally uplifting boarding school.

It's odd that such an old romance (my research indicates this book was first published in 1983 under the name of Patricia Maxwell) should catch my interest so intensely. But some of Jennifer Blake's older romances are excellent - better than I see her publish today.Prince Rolfe of Ruthenia (he has too many names to list) is one determined prince. He is in the States searching for his dead brother's latest mistress. Rolfe believes she knows who murdered his brother since she was present at the time of the former prince's assassination. Rolfe brings with him five of his Royal Guard and their presence is most commanding. Rolfe, himself, is hailed as the Golden Wolf; partly due to the royal insignia he wears bearing a wolf and his golden hair. Rolfe is certainly a prince from fairy tales. He is handsome, extremely self confident, very intelligent, amazingly physically fit and he carries his royalty graciously without thought. He is also highly aggressive, resolute, and is tremendously domineering. He will get that which he seeks and can be ruthless in the process.Angeline Fortin lives with her aunt and cousin near New Orleans and does not relish high society. Angeline is a beautiful, loyal, smart, sensible and assertive young woman. She must rely on her aunt's charity for a place to live. She bears a striking resemblance to her cousin Claire. Claire is the missing mistress of the former Prince of RutheniaThis book captures you immediately. By page five you are hooked into the storyline and by page nine sparks between Rolfe and Angeline are flying off the pages as they first meet at a soiree one evening. He has immediately, upon arriving, seen Angeline and believes her to be Claire. When Angeline insists she is not, Rolfe assumes she is lying. Later that evening, Rolfe and his guards locate and capture Angeline. She is taken to the prince's temporary quarters, a lodge in the country. Rolfe sequesters her in his bedroom and begins to interrogate her. He refuses to believe that Angeline is not Claire. Claire's reputation implies that she would be a willing bed partner. Assuming that Angeline is Claire, Rolfe ruthlessly seduces her and discovers he has, in fact, made a great error. Angeline is a virgin. Some readers may take this seduction as rape. I did. But don't let that affect your opinion of this book prematurely. This aggressive nature, seen within the first 60 pages, is not the tone of the entire book. Rolfe definitely regrets what he has done to Angeline but that doesn't mean he becomes less forceful. He is sure she knows her cousin's hiding place. He continues to hold her captive.Although this book begins in an aggressive mode, the story that follows is very involved and so heart rending that you soon forget the beginning pages as anything other than powerful and somewhat savory. Rolfe is uncompromising, type A to the extreme, and is unforgettable in soul and body. Angeline is delightful although a little dense. She is not mean or spiteful and yet she stands up to Rolfe and is assertive in many ways. She never expects that she will ever be more than Rolfe's mistress. She interprets his words or actions towards her as \\"for the moment\\" and doesn't expect a future with him.Royal Seduction is written entirely from the heroine's point of view. Although we never know the hero's thoughts, he spoke his mind so clearly that you had little doubt what he thought or felt. I am certain that Rolfe felt a lot more for Angeline than she allowed herself to believe. We clearly see Rolfe's inner turmoil although we do not have the privilege of reading his thoughts. This is a very sensual book. The actual sensual scenes could be rated no higher than a 3.5 out of 5.0 (see More About Me for rating guidelines). These scenes are not written as explicitly as in many books today but they are still very sexy. It is a true testament that very sensual scenes and high sexual tension can be written without vulgarity or physical details.Rolfe and Angeline spend a lot of time together during the first half of the book. Then the action takes over. Usually I resent time taken away from the leads for the sake of an alternate storyline. But the subplot is so deep and awesome that it cannot be ignored. The romance is so deeply entwined with the action that one is not complete without the other. Although the last half of the book often finds the leads apart or only in the company of others, the sexual tension between them remains high. We see their relationship mature.Overall, I highly recommend Royal Seduction as a delightful read. There are none of the old trappings of silly misunderstandings or false hate that seemed to be so prominent during the early eighties when this book was written. This book is available in eBook format. Once I read it in that format, I decided I wanted a hard copy for my keeper shelf and was able to obtain an old paperback copy online for a reasonable price. I am now slowly making my way through Blake's backlist and occasionally find another jewel but none have caught my fancy as much as Royal Seduction."},{"Title":"Royal Seduction","review":"Over the summer I worked for a publishing company that specialized in romance novels, forcing me to read them in order to write jacket copies and the like. Well, most of them seemed boring and following a certain formula and so I made up my mind that they weren't very good novels at all; but after reading this book I changed my mind. It has actual suspense and a good storyline. The story is romantic and actually interesting. I couldn't put it down! I definitely recommend it to anyone who enjoys books, not just the romance novel enthusiast, because it's the book that made me change my negative opinion of romances."},{"Title":"Royal Seduction","review":"No matter if the \\"hero\\" was nice and appologetic or not after the first rape, which he was not he was a JERK the whole time it seemed, our heroine was still raped. Don't they have syndromes for victims who fall in love with their captors? Well, I liken this story to that. I like Jennifer Blake but she seems to like rape scenes for some reason. Not very romantic material."},{"Title":"Royal Seduction","review":"Angeline had always been a mirror image of Claire. Her hair was slightly darker, her eyes greener, her face kinder. She had never had cause to regret their similar appearances until the ruthless Prince Rolfe mistook her for Claire. Angeline refused to believe Rolfe's wicked accusations against her cousin. While Claire's head may have been turned enough by Rolfe's elder brother to become his mistress, there is no way that Claire would have helped murder him! Rolfe refuses to believe that Angeline is not really Claire and kidnaps her to get the information he needs to find his brother's murderer. There is nothing Angeline can do to persuade him that she is not Claire - until Rolfe seduces her and finds her to be a virgin. Still, even though Rolfe has not found the woman he sought, he knows that Angeline helped hide her cousin and vows to use whatever means he must to pry the information from her. Angeline refuses to give in to his demands and unsuccessfully tries to remain immune to his charms. She has her chance to escape when someone tries to kill the Prince, but she finds herself saving his life and tenderly caring for his wounds. It seems that one of Prince Rolfe's own bodyguards is trying to kill him. But who? And why should Angeline care...?I enjoyed this book quite a bit. I thought that Angeline was a great heroine who displayed a lot of common sense and plain guts in standing up to the men around her and trying to do what was right. All of the characters, even the secondary characters, were well fleshed out and had distinct personalities. Jennifer Blake has a nice, smooth writing style with wonderful descriptions that really made the steamy Southern setting come to life. The plot was also a bit different from most romances and the reader was kept guessing as to who the real villain of the piece was. I think that the price is a little steep, however, and would look for a cheaper used copy of the book."},{"Title":"Royal Seduction","review":"The so-called \\"hero\\" of this book is nothing more than a rapist. For goodness sake, the first time they get together, he throws her down, holds her down and rapes her, and yet this is somehow supposed to be seen as romantic.This book is sickening. It does not deserve to be called a romance novel."},{"Title":"Royal Seduction","review":"In 1984, I lost my husband of 10 years. Left with 3 kids to raise and a life to re-plan, I was vulnerable. A year later I spotted this book at the checkout lane at the grocery store. It was there every week for 5 weeks. I had no interest in romance novels but something about this one intriqued me. So the fifth time I saw it I bought it and read it cover to cover overnight. I have read it several times in the intervening years and still enjoy it.This book was my first romance novel but not my last. Jennifer's other books in the late 80's are also favorites of mine. With romance novels you suspend the rules and delve into fantasy and the story. We don't live in a perfect world and the characters in the books don't either. It is the way they deal with their world that make the story. Angeline is a strong character that deals with life's problems head on and wins.This book is a good read and an enjoyable story. I had never heard of a 'dogtrot'. Jennifer's books bring to life a world I have not known and never will know."},{"Title":"Royal Seduction","review":"I usually don't like heroes to be princes and royalties from some unknown kingdoms but Rolfe was a great one. I liked his story and his behaviour (or at least I could understand why he behaved the way he did). The same goes for Angeline - she was a strong woman who was able to stand for herself and still stay gentle and caring. The story was full of action and though Jennifer Blake used quite flowery language, I really enjoyed reading it. Very well-written and believable with a lot of interesting side characters (the royal guard). I definitely recommend this book, and also Surrender in Moonlight from Jennifer Blake.

Written in 1988, Torme's life story describes his early years as a child prodigy--singing professionally from the age of three, acting in radio at age ten, writing songs professionally at age thirteen--and shows how he developed his career, became a movie star, was music director for Judy Garland's 1963 TV show, and worked with virtually every \\"name\\" in jazz, as a singer/songwriter, drummer, and concert artist.Throughout the autobiography, Torme keeps his perspective, taking the blame for many of his failures, and telling it \\"like it is\\" when, in his opinion, the fault belongs elsewhere. He is particularly harsh in his opinion of the recording industry: \\"Some of the vilest people I have ever met are those who run and control the record industry,\\" he says. His analyses of his marital failures, aggravated by the problems of being on the road, show the difficulties of leading a full life while always looking for the next big chance, professionally, and his sadness at his alienation from some of his children is palpable.For those who love jazz and the entertainment business, the book is fascinating, giving insights into Harry James, Buddy Rich, Chico Marx, Frank Sinatra, Johnny Mercer, Mickey Rooney, Judy Garland, Duke Ellington, Sammy Davis, Jr., and Dick Martin (of Rowan and Martin's Laugh-In). Torme's analyses of his professional failures (such as his disaster at the Copacabana) and of his betrayals by some of his \\"friends\\" show how closely some entertainers identify with their career decisions and how agonizing the ups and downs of professional life can be.Some of the book can be considered self-congratulatory, and other parts reflect Torme's desire to set the record straight (and give some payback for past wrongs), but the book gives an articulate and thoughtful presentation of the life of someone who has been considered the greatest male jazz singer of the twentieth century. A fascinating and insightful look at show business, with all its warts. n Mary Whipple"},{"Title":"It Wasn't All Velvet: An Autobiography","review":"Mel Torme was an incredible man and talent.

If you dig Tony Bennett or idolize Sinatra, read about a guy who puts them both to shame (almost none can-except Mel!)He is a legend and although he passed away June 1999 his star still glitters. The only problem with this book is that he wrote it too soon, there is more to tell 1988-1999 that happened after its printing. Mel sang and worked brilliantly until the end....no decline for him.

In that capacity the book didn't disappoint; Mr. Torme has a great way with words and much insight to convey. In reading his book I discovered that he is quite materialistic and shallow -- something I hadn't really suspected. He quotes his friends and associates verbatim, including a significant helping of colorful language. In fact, I finally had to give up on the book halfway through because I just couldn't stomach the sheer volume of profanity. I did laugh out loud (something I rarely do) when I found the one word Mel saw fit to censor. It's a four-letter word beginning with \\"f,\\" but it's not the one you think. After page upon page of language straight from the gutter, he substituted \\"f***\\" for \\"fart.\\" Go figure."},{"Title":"It Wasn't All Velvet: An Autobiography","review":"Mel Torme wrote a very vicious and innaccurate book about Judy Garland on the set of the tv series.

The title led me to believe that this book would address my questions.However, the book is actually a Biblical and historical refutation of pacifism. It accomplishes that goal well enough, so if that is what you are looking for, this book is adequate. It addresses the data from the Old and New Testaments, atristics and later theologians, and summarizes with a Q&amp;A format. I'd suggest that a more appropriate title for this book would be, &quot;Is it ever right to fight?&quot;If, on the other hand, you are looking for a discussion of the just war, i.e. WHEN and HOW it is right to fight, look elsewhere."},{"Title":"When Is It Right to Fight?","review":"This book deals in stereotypes and caricatures. It ignores the example of Jesus Christ, and denies the exile status of God's predestined elect people. It begs the question continually by assuming that the \\"responsible\\" thing to do is to kill the bad guys. As in his book on hell and the immortality of the soul, there is no evidence of Morey carefully reading the literature of those he attacks.For a page by page refutation of this book, I recommend Richard Barber's \\"Whenis it right to Fight?

Barber is a sovereign grace pacifist, like me."},{"Title":"When Is It Right to Fight?","review":"Bob Morey's book, &quot;When is it Right to Fight,&quot; gives the greatest defense of the Just War Theory ever given. Also, it refutes pacifism and non-resistance and shows their unreasonableness. The book uses the Scripture to justify war in necessary circumstances."},{"Title":"When Is It Right to Fight?","review":"The best thing about Morey's book is the Recommended Reading list at the end. Too bad he didn't study some of the books he listed. John Howard Yoder could have helped him tremendously. For the most part he omitted the most significant pacifists of the twentieth century. Yet he claims to offer a rebuttal to a position he doesn't remotely understand.This ill considered little book is filled with poorly examined assumptions. If you are looking for a thoughtful and biblically insightful defense of war , this is not it. But if you want a shallow piece of work that may reinforce your prejudice, When Is It Right To Fight? may be exactly what you have in mind."},{"Title":"When Is It Right to Fight?","review":"The Bible teaches the rights of resistance. The Bible teaches self-defense. The Bible teaches that there are distinctions of governments. Self, family, church and state government. All of these governments are under God. God is the source of all authority and law. If anyone of these governments go outside of their jurisdiction as laid out in the Bible by God, then at that point, it can and should be resisted. Morey explains this in detail very well.I would recommend this book to the United States of America.

This is one of them.MacIver has still not, to my knowledge, been equaled. Here is my summary of his book written in 1975, and still valid.A pleasure to read, MacIver is the most useful focal point for the study of the modern state. An introduction defines the state as an association characterized by a limiting concept of sovereignty and the rule of law.The first of four books deals with the emergence of the state; its origins, early empire, the emergence of citizenship (including the impact of the cities on associations and on the stratification and organization of society), a nd the formation of the country-state through feudalism and nationality.Book two discusses the powers and functions of the state; the limits of political control, the residence of authority, might and sovereignty, law and order, and the relations betwseen political government and economic order. An excellent descriptive chart is offered that divides the functions of the state in its internal aspect into order, protection, and conservation & development. Within each category, the role of the state vis-a-vis the physical habits and social structure of the society from which it stems is seen to imply related and elaborative activities.Book three explores the forms and institutions of the state, the articulation of governmental powers, and the party system.The fourth and final book, dealing with theories and interpretations of the state, outlines very quickly the evolution of these theories, moving on to focus on two major issues in political thought: the issue of individualism and collectivism, and the attack on sovereignty.In concluding, MacIver offers a very acceptable and timely reinterpretation of the state as an association among other associations--as an organ of the community and thus an organ whose power must be limited in relation to its functions, which in turn must be constrained by the state's inherent impulse, despite its dependency on its public, to encompass and dominate all that falls within its assigned territory.MacIver remains utterly brilliant and so very relevant to our condition.See also:1776What Kind of Nation: Thomas Jefferson, John Marshall, and the Epic Struggle to Create a United StatesThe Thirteen American Arguments: Enduring Debates That Define and Inspire Our CountryThe Revolution: A ManifestoCrashing the Party: Taking on the Corporate Government in an Age of SurrenderRunning on Empty: How the Democratic and Republican Parties Are Bankrupting Our Future and What Americans Can Do About ItThe Paradox of American Democracy: Elites, Special Interests, and the Betrayal of the Public TrustThe Broken Branch: How Congress Is Failing America and How to Get It Back on Track (Institutions of American Democracy)Breach of Trust: How Washington Turns Outsiders Into InsidersWar is a Racket: The Antiwar Classic by America's Most Decorated Soldier"},{"Title":"Special Occasions","review":"The gorgeous photos make you want to read this book cover to cover.

I am writing a historical novel set during these times, and such personalized, intimate and first hand translated source material is critical to the accuracy of my novel.Ozment's book gives us a look at how people really lived, what they said, what they thought, and what they wore, and therefore for this reason the book is indeed historically significant. You can interprete data and statistical patterns up the yahoo, but when you want to find out what people really did in a certain time, read their letters. This book is a &quot;slice of life,&quot; not intended to represent the interests, trends or political ideals of the larger generation to which it belongs, but to focus on a particular 16th century couple at a particular time in life.Just as any painter knows, you must limit your subject in a &quot;portrait&quot; to the most important person or persons you are trying to represent, and capture their true nature by selecting those details to focus on that are most representative of the subject. I believe that Dr. Ozment has done a fine job of doing just that. I will agree with Mellon that I would have liked to have seen more actual excerpts of the letters, only because I found them fascinating.As an aside, I don't believe that the couple portrayed here are any less ordinary to their times than the middle-class of today is to theirs, as Mellon claims in his review. This couple is middle-class, politically connected, and want for little, so that means they are not ordinary? To whom? They also lost their only child, fought with their relatives, hated their jobs, worried about money, and got sick on a regular basis while trying to sift quack cures from the real thing. Sounds pretty ordinary to me. They were members of a growing merchant class at this time, and they lived how they lived. Trying to make them stand for something other than what they are, as Mellon seems to want Ozment to do, would be an exercise in futility.That Dr. Ozment chose this particular couple to write a book about seems less to do with their &quot;conformity to modern white middle class notions of what the marriage relationship should be&quot; than to the fact that they wrote letters to one another that survived intact into the 20th century, which could therefore be translated and commented upon. And I enjoyed the material, though I am neither white, nor experimenting with marriage (I think after 9 years it ceases to be an experiment), nor childless and in pursuit of the almighty dollar (though Mellon seems to assume these are the only types of people who would buy into Ozment's premise of the role of the family in 16th century Germany).In conclusion, if you want to know how a 16th century merchant couple in Germany lived, this is a good place to start."},{"Title":"Magdalena and Balthasar: An Intimate Portrait of Life in 16th Century Europe Revealed in the Letters of a Nuremberg Husband and Wife","review":"Editor Ozment presents letters between a Nuremberg merchant and his wife. These letters are very interesting in that they tell about everyday life in the 16th century. Professor Ozment's commentary on the letters is helpful; however, the book would have been better served if a greater number of the letters had been included. Although some 87 letters between Magdalena and Balthazar are exant, the editor includes fewer than 20 in their entirety. Also, the entire volume is fewer than 200 pages so the book could have been longer. These minor objections aside, Magdalena and Balthazar is a fascinating read!"},{"Title":"Magdalena and Balthasar: An Intimate Portrait of Life in 16th Century Europe Revealed in the Letters of a Nuremberg Husband and Wife","review":"This is an amazing look into a 16th century marriage.

The letters are wonderful and as a communications tool between separated spouses, they are both positive and chatty.As a general reader, I am ignorant of 90% of the details of a 16th century life and could have used more sociological detail. If you are reading this for a class, your professor surely will enlighten you.Of Balthasar's bathing and \\"taking the waters\\" to heal his arthritis and digestive complaints: I do know that the baths have been used since before the Romans to promote healing and well-being. They continue to be patronized by Germans and non-Germans alike.Additionally, Hildegarde of Bingen, a very popular author of the middle ages, who was considered a scientist of her time, promoted bathing for healing. She wrote a herbal medicine textbook as well as her famous mystical books.I also found it humorous that the editor found Magdalene's request for food treats and fancy textiles in every letter excessive. There were no supermarkets with non-seasonal fruits or treats around in the 16th century.

This class-or more correctly, subclass-which in its heyday became derisively known as young urban professionals or Yuppies, espoused the obviously contradictory goals of making money hand-over-fist while simultaneously attempting to maintain a household and some semblance of a family structure. The contradiction arose from the necessity of having both husband and wife pursue monetarily rewarding careers outside the home. But these childless couples, known also as Dinks (double income, no kids), wanted it all, that is, a mom, a dad, a kid, a dog, a hearth, a home, and copious quantities of cash and goods. Thus a complete rearrangement, or complete confusion, of &quot;traditional&quot; family roles resulted. Ultimately, the formerly fixed roles of husband and wife were transformed into interchangeable, if not superfluous, roles for the sake of material success.Ozment's book is a typical byproduct of the id&eacute;e fixe that dominated the minds of educated white middle class Americans in the closing decades of the last century. While proclaiming itself to be an &quot;intimate portrait of life in the 16th century,&quot; its primary purpose is to justify the American marriage experiment of the late 1980s by appealing to the historical example of Balthasar and Magdalena Paumgartner of Nuremberg. Although Ozment's history may have been important to a specific and somewhat elite audience in the 1980s-an audience that was struggling with the validity of its marriage theories and was desperately seeking any validation of its experiments-his history now smacks of mere opportunism and pandering. Which is only to say that a timely history is not necessarily a timeless history.Moving beyond the social milieu of its author and the socio-political forces that distorted his thinking, how does Balthasar and Magdalena stand up to analysis as history? No matter how detailed or superficial the analysis, the history fails on all counts.At about the one-third point of the book the attentive reader begins to experience a vague sense of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu. One moment the narrative seems to be repeating the material presented in the letters of Magdalena and Balthasar, and the next moment the letters seem to be repeating the material presented in the narrative by Steven Ozment. On closer examination, not only is material being repeated for no apparent reason, but the strong inference arises that the book has been cut to pieces and then haphazardly pasted together again. Indeed, analyzing the narrative portions separately creates the overwhelming impression that the work originally began and ended as a straight narrative history that drew heavily upon quotations from the source letters. The letters between Magdalena and Balthasar, not to mention the scattered artwork, seem to have been added as an afterthought. This interlarding of the narrative with the same epistolary examples cited in the narrative causes a profound and tormenting redundancy to pervade the entire work. The reader grows increasingly disgruntled when he begins to realize that he is reading a 100 page book disguised as a 200 page book.Some mention must be made of Ozment's failure to prove his thesis, which generally holds that marriage and family relations in 16th century Europe were not substantially different from those in late 20th century America, and specifically that Balthasar and Magdalena Paumgartner of Nuremberg were &quot;ordinary&quot; people whose &quot;intimate&quot; letters reveal lessons of historical importance.Concerning the general thesis, it need only be said that Ozment's historical couple has been deliberately selected for their ostensible conformity to modern white middle class notions of what the marriage relationship should be. That is, Balthasar and Magdalena have been dredged up from the sea of time not because their story is of historical importance and therefore worthy of preservation for future generations, but rather because their story seems to validate the theories and experiments of the present generation. Of course Ozment sees his history as flying in the face of contemporary thinking, in that it refutes the idea that there is something novel about the &quot;warm, private, egalitarian modern family.&quot; His position is that the transition from &quot;patriarchy to partnership&quot; began long before the 20th century. Thus, Ozment succeeds in chastising his peers for their &quot;post modern&quot; conceit yet does not deviate from the party line. This unfortunate mismatch of past fact and present faith is the usual result when historians seek to justify the ways of man to history.It is painfully obvious that this husband and wife are far from &quot;ordinary.&quot; Although not members of the nobility, they are nevertheless solid Nuremberg middle class, politically well connected and never wanting for material things. Even within the tightly controlled selection of letters Ozment allows his reader to peruse, it is not hard to see a historical couple trying frantically to amass great wealth, keep a household, raise a child and make the move to a country estate. This husband and wife team, these &quot;partners&quot; in unbridled materialism, plainly want it all. Under any analysis, Balthasar and Magdalena are statistical and historical anomalies and are not at all typical of ordinary 16th century people or marriages. On the other hand, their perpetual boredom, their obsession with food, health cures and bodily functions, their superficial intimacy and perfunctory declarations of religious faith, their complete lack of charity, and above all else their dogged pursuit of money make them the prototype for young urban professionals. Ozment, in his fervent desire to justify the socio-political experiments of his own century by an appeal to historical precedent, has inadvertently turned Balthasar and Magdalena into the Yuppies of Nuremberg."},{"Title":"Complying with the Americans with Disabilities Act in Maine","review":"This book rocks.

The incinerated remnants of Dr. Gregory are found curled in the corner of his laboratory at the Edward Teller Nuclear Research Facility near Oakland, California. since this is a death on Federal property, Mulder and Scully are hastily called in. As FBI agents who specialize in unexplained phenomena, they are the investigators of the X-files, strange and inexplicable cases which are also mysteries that the FBI doesn't want solved. Dr. Gregory's unique death quickly and clearly becomes an X-file. As Mulder and Scully begin their fustrating work, unearthing the top secret project that Dr. Gregory was working on, they confront a tight-lipped Federal bureaucracy whose job it is to stop questions before they are asked. One by one, Mulder and Scully hit dead ends, closed security clearances, and classified documents that no one wants them to see. But that doesn't stop Mulder and Scully from ripping the lid off Dr. Gregory's illegal project --&quot;bright Anvil&quot; --a new type of flash nuclear explosive that has all the destructive power of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki atomic bombs, but with a new design that leaves virtually no radioactive fallout. The implications for the modern world are deadly, and some radical protest groups will stop at nothing to prevent the test from happening. When a second victim completely unrelated to nuclear science or Dr. gregory is obliterated in the New Mexico desert, and then a third dies the same way in Washington, D.C., Mulder and Scully begin to fucus on the frightening dimensions of their task. The bizarre deaths cannot be a coincidence. And as they work to uncover the secret unifying element that unites these deaths, it becomes clear that this twisted puzzle has fatal consequences for the entire world. ***personally, this novel was awesome because of the intricate way Scully and Mulder interact with the characters.

Great literature, etc."},{"Title":"Complying with the Americans with Disabilities Act in Maine","review":"This book is quite possibly the worst book I've ever read. The language is rudimentary at best, with Anderson's repetitious narrative grating on my nerves from the very beginning. He seems quite fond of certain descriptions, and as the subject of these descriptions are presented time and again, he reverts back to his original presentation of them, such as &quot;her long face,&quot; or &quot;sheafs of paper\\"-again and again throughout the book. The tone and framework of the writing is reminiscent of the Weekly Readers I was required to read as a student in the sixth grade. There were different levels and colors assigned to the books according to the student's reading skill, 1 being the beginner level and 4 being the moderately difficult level, using the primary palette as a compliment to this system. I would not be surprised to see this book being issued as a Yellow Stripe Level 2, sitting on the shelves of elementary schools across the country.The storyline is weak and the characterization is completely off target. There are holes in the plot you could drive a Mack truck through. It is rare that I give such a scathing review, but this, I assure you is completely warranted. This book is not only insulting to X-Files fans, but to readers in general. I suppose one cannot expect much from a book that supports no critical acclaim of its own on the back cover, rather, but for the series solely responsible for its marginal success. Did no one have anything positive to say about this travesty? Not even the janitor at the New York Times? Not surprising.From the first line, it was obvious this would be a waste of time and I struggled to even finish it. By page 22 I had already flagged 3 grammatical errors...and by the time I finished the book I had flagged 9 in all, unforgivable in a widely circulated published work. I can only hope the editor was asleep on the job, and not as incompetent as his/her work would suggest. One can only hope the other X-Files serial novels are not as ridiculously juvenile as Ground Zero."},{"Title":"Complying with the Americans with Disabilities Act in Maine","review":"This book is totally impossible, rather than implausible asmost of the X-files are"},{"Title":"Complying with the Americans with Disabilities Act in Maine","review":"Kevin J.

It is bad. It is not well read. It has few of the best qualities of the TV show.Read by Gillian Anderson, the abrdiged audiobook clocks in at about 3 hours and read unenthusiastically by Gillian Anderson. One of the reasons I picked this one up is that I figured she'd read it well. It says it was recorded in Vancouver in 1995 (where the show was filmed) and it sounds like she read it between takes. She sounds tired and completely uninterested in the text.Then again, when you look at what she was reading, I cannot blame her for being uninterested. This book has none of the zip of the show. Mulder's lines are almost non-existant. No smart-aleck lines or observation. No wry sense of humor that makes even the weakest of the TV shows watchable (I love the X-Files but let's face it - every episode is not being shipped to the TV Hall of Fame...). This book is a tired and pale imitation of what the show was. You can see the ending coming and you wish it would just hurry up and get here. Perhaps the abridgement gutted the book but I was glad it was abridged.The science behind this audiobook is laughable. Not the supernatural stuff - that's what the X-Files is all about. I mean the atomic science. Does the author really think that anyone can explode an atomic bomb without radiation detectors picking up on it? Remember Chernobyl? The West knew it had gone wrong long before the Soviets admitted to it because it was detected by Western atomic sensors. Atomic blasts show up on seismographs. That's how we knew India and Pakistan had them.

The audiobook is read by Gillian Anderson , and the abridgement has the focus on Scully's part of the investigation and the unlikely supernatural conclusion that takes the agents to the south pacific and the site of a planned above ground test of a new super weapon.Anderson's reading is great! I got a good chuckle out of her comments about how that Mulder's theories were bound to be way out there and not grounded in science.

I don't know. Anderson assumes familiarity with the basic premise of the X-Files so if you haven't seen the TV show you may not understand much of the dynamic between Mulder and Scully and why they seem to get so little support from the FBI in their investigations. The mystery at hand is one of the more unusual paranormal ideas I've come across, and I just wish Anderson set it up so that someone could enjoy it as a standalone without ever watching the TV show.

Mulder and Scully could have been a bigger part of the story and the author didn't really capture Mulder's personality, but Ground Zero was a very enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Complying with the Americans with Disabilities Act in Maine","review":"Of the three X-Files novelizations by Kevin J. Anderson, I think I like this one best. The plot is fast-paced and the story line is mysterious.It's a shame that there are only a few X-Files novelizations by Anderson and other authors.

I felt lost and confused at the end.I really wish that it had not been drawn out so much. I understand that it was meant to build suspense but I didn't understand anything until the last seventy pages.If you are going to read Kevin J.

Anderson,(3 Star Wars, 3 X-Files and 1 Dune) I can say that the man has good ideas, I just don't think that his writing is all that absorbing. As with his Star Wars books, his X-Files books never quite ring true of the characters. As for the cases, they are pretty good, but it isn't Mulder and Scully who are chasing down the monsters. Of all the new X-Files books, Charles Grant's &quot;Whirlwind&quot; nails the characters of Mulder and Scully, but the case isn't particularly involving."},{"Title":"Complying with the Americans with Disabilities Act in Maine","review":"I have read this book many many times and I still get scared.

The plot was interesting and it would be interesting to see produced. It seemed quite &quot;epic&quot; in it's proportions. However, as fun as the general plot was, for a novel if felt rather Mulder and Scully &quot;lite.&quot; For an X-File book they hardly felt like they were there... or rather they were there but much of their personalities wasn't. The way the characters were shown, they just weren't quite the Mulder and Scully Xphiles know and love. The book is an interesting read but not as satisfying as the X-Files at its best."},{"Title":"Complying with the Americans with Disabilities Act in Maine","review":"We really enjoyed Ground Zero--it had a great story line, but at times, it was hard to follow.

Despite of that, this is a book that creates some great images of Merlin and his coming of age.

The writng seems fresh even though written about 100 years ago or so. Each chapter is fairly short and, while linked to the rest of the book, can be read independently.

Great read to provide overall context, background and insight to other more focused topics."},{"Title":"The quest for holiness: A biblical historical and systematic investigation","review":"Koberle doesn't waste his time or ours trying to entertain us or with meaningless controversies. He engages the relationship of justification and sanctification with rigour, energy and genuine belief in what he was writing. I found his careful analysis respectful of Scripture's board themes (no proof texting), the historical theology of conservative Lutheranism (while not partisan), and, suprisingly, pastoral. It is a very fine read. If you are interested in seeing this subject through the mind of a careful, responsible student of the Christian Scripture, a humble student of those who have come before him, with no fluff or wasted space - this is a good book for you."},{"Title":"The quest for holiness: A biblical historical and systematic investigation","review":"Dealing with the topic of justification/sanctification, Koberle does an excellent job of presenting the truths and dangers within the two polarized camps - first those overemphasizing free grace leading to antinomianism, and second those overemphasizing holiness leading to legalism. He reviews the history of the conflict and gives repeated explanations of how and why the two pillars of truth (free grace & necessary holiness) must be left standing in order to fully reconcile all the statements of Scripture. He also addresses a number of related paradoxes in the Scriptures which need to be kept in balance. He explains the classical Lutheran view which seeks to retain the paradox at the cost of not being accepted fully into either of the two camps. Koberle calls for restraint and understanding in the debate, not for the sake of compromise, but because each side holds an important truth. The book is written at an academic level, so prepare to spend some time absorbing what is said."},{"Title":"Go Man Go","review":"Been 30 some-odd years, but this book inspired me to play basketball when I was in school.

I think that there is some useful information in this book. There are simple phrases that have really changed my outlook on life.Things like &quot;Self Importance&quot; really made me worry less about my problems and enjoy the world instead.Labeling things and categoring things can really take the meaning out of things. For example, Carlos tries to find out about Don Juans ancestry. Don Juan refuses to have his ancestry to tell him how to live or to label him, therefore he doesn't think it's important.I like the part where Carlos was whining about his father not getting up in time to go swimming. He whining went nowhere, Don Juan said that &quot;maybe he had trouble getting up&quot;. &quot;If you were so strong why didn't you go swimming yourself.&quot;I learned that promises you make to other people are equally important no matter how big or little it is."},{"Title":"Journey to Ixtlan: the Lessons of Don Juan","review":"i have just finished reading this book and after i was done i felt like i lost a best friend or something, it is hard to explain but it is like i got to know these two people (carlos and don juan). i have been in karate for over twenty yaers and have study different styles and believes and there is just so many un-answered quetions out there that when i read this book it left me with more. it is like the movie billy jack and his conections to the indian spirits as a kid i watched this movie over and over because he was what i wished i could be. i have been to arizona many times and wish to move to superstious mountain area withing the next couple of years. i have been practicing meditation-yoga and have read several books on the subject and they to point to the teachings and studies being more profound in the desert area of new mexico-arizona. as a catholic raised we are taught not to experiment with other believes but having been with several other indian persons from northern ontario canada, and also talking with native arizonian indians i know htere is more to life then what we are told to believe. i whould only recommend this book to people who have an open mind other wise they may think you are on the verge of total colapse if you were to tell them, &quot;yes i do believe this to be non-fiction&quot;peter dunn dunn@netcore.ca"},{"Title":"Journey to Ixtlan: the Lessons of Don Juan","review":"This is the book to start reading Carlos Castaneda.Recommended to all, who wants to know how and why one should live."},{"Title":"Journey to Ixtlan: the Lessons of Don Juan","review":"Over 35 + years still a good book to read.

Researcher Richard de Mille is probably the most even-handed of the critics and The_Don_Juan_Papers is worth a read, though some of the criticisms are merely carping small-mindedness.Regardless of your attitude toward Castaneda's (or Don Juan's!)literal accuracy the series, of which Journey_to_Ixtlan is the best, presents a coherent and engaging spiritual existentialism. A Must Read!!!"},{"Title":"Journey to Ixtlan: the Lessons of Don Juan","review":"It took a lot for me to get through Castaneda's first book, The Teachings of Don Juan. I was totally unimpressed with it. The whole book was essentially about how a Yaqui Indian &quot;sorcerer&quot; put naive Carlos, then a graduate student in anthropology from UCLA doing research on a hallucinogenic plant, through a bunch of weird drug trips that shook his view of reality. And to me, that doesn't jive at all.But in Journey to Ixtlan, Castaneda goes back and says, &quot;wait, start over, reset. I was wrong about all of that drug stuff, it's really not necessary, don Juan just put me through that because I was too stubborn and 'rational' to see that there may be other views of reality than the ones I subscribe to.&quot; In this book he discovers that he doesn't need drugs to experience other worlds. Rather, there are a series of practices for right living that enable the possibility of perceiving in nonordinary ways.So Journey to Ixtlan is where the real lessons about living life in the warrior's way begin. I recommend this book highly as a starting point for Castaneda's work; forget the first two books."},{"Title":"Journey to Ixtlan: the Lessons of Don Juan","review":"Forget the debate as to whether Castaneda's writings were a hoax or that his books became important reading for the drug culture. Although I suggest you read his first two books before reading this one but if you read only one book by Carlos Castaneda this is the book to read. Be his books accurate reporting by a cultural anthropologist (which is becoming increasingly more and more doubtful), mysticism or hokum, this particular book is quite moving and lyrical. And whether his stories are real or imagined and whether the teaching he transmutes came from Don Juan or from his own mind by his knowledge as a trained anthropologist the underlying mystical principles of these stories cannot be dismissed out of hand.Shaman, poet and perhaps an academic scoundrel it is Castaneda's poetry and story telling that comes shining through in this book.If Castaneda's books were a hoax and were represented as cultural anthropology as a better hook to sell books it is a shame because he did a disservice to science and to his legacy. Still I myself, as a former researcher in Harvard University's anthropology department and a student of human ethology, can forgive this sin on one level and enjoy this book as a powerful work of liturature.For if there has been a wrong that has been committed against anthropology it is one that was done by the way the books were marketed and perhaps by the author's personality itself. The works themselves should not suffer and be shunned for this.His legacy would have been better served if he wrote these same works as a writer of fiction.I believe the author would have been wiser to present his works the way Gurdjieff presented \\"Beelzebub's Tales to his Grandson\\" rather than obstinately insisting there really was such a person as Don Juan (even if in the off chance that his teacher did exist).Despite the controversy his writing stands on its own and Journey to Ixtlan is a powerful, touching, enchanting and beautiful book."},{"Title":"Journey to Ixtlan: the Lessons of Don Juan","review":"I started reading ( &amp; still re-read) Don Juan'sbooks by &quot;Carlitos&quot; long long ago , (mid 70's) &amp;still thank God that somehow I found his books. The most important thing this book taught meis to ACCEPT RESPONSIBILITY FOR MY ACTIONS .I was young &amp; lost &amp; scared &amp; a mess &amp; thatconcept had never crossed my mind. I was us-ed to blaming others &amp; their actions towards meetc....for the outcomes of my life.Well let me tell youuuuuuu something. What anEYE OPENER !!!!! ha ha ha . I also leared notto judge people &amp; still try not to..... I rememberDon Juan used to say something lilke &quot; do notsend your bad thoughts to a person that may havedone something wrong. It doesn't do them any good or yourself.&quot;I adore Don Juan &amp;' Carlitos' as he used to call him. Don Juanhad the BEST sense of humor I've ever seen.Castanedas' book enchanted me, terrified me( to the point that I slept with the lights on a coupleof nights ) enlightened me, inspired me &amp; finallychanged me inside for the better.I got a lot out of this one book so I read the restof them &amp; loved them ALL! , Journey to Ixtlan Ihave read so much it fell apart! but I love it .It is my bible on how to be a decent person."},{"Title":"Journey to Ixtlan: the Lessons of Don Juan","review":"Castaneda did the world a favor when he began chronicling his apprenticeship with Don Juan Matus. Whether or not Don Juan was one or three real people is irrelevant since what Castaneda learns is highly relevant to all of us. Learning to &quot;stalk&quot; the self, learning to achieve equilibrium in a world full of petty tyrants (including the petty tyrant of the &quot;self&quot;) are among the most trenchant lessons Castaneda provides us. This book is the place to start with Castaneda and you'll even find within it Don Juan doing magical passes 25 years before Castaneda finally admitted there were such things. The books by Castaneda are the most important books in my life and I highly recommend them to anyone who's after an alternative way of looking at life and the human condition."},{"Title":"Journey to Ixtlan: the Lessons of Don Juan","review":"If you're interested in Castaneda, this is the book you should read first. It covers the same time period as the previous two, but Carlos is no longer as dense as when he wrote them. This book opens the doors to a whole new way to view the world."},{"Title":"Journey to Ixtlan: the Lessons of Don Juan","review":"In this book, Castaneda tries to instill in the reader the components of personal power. A person of personal power can be summed up as someone who chooses to live as a victor rather than a victim. And to break away from the conditioning and habits of society and the norm.Don Juan tries to impart to Castaneda some empowering mindframes and attitudes, such as by Erasing Personal History, one is able to break away from the excuses most people make in their life, and start to take Responsibility and action to change it, rather than blaming and getting stuck. Also the part about losing one's self-importance is extremely powerful wisdom, as he teaches that self-importance is one's own illusion. Only a person with self-importance easily feels hurt by the remarks of others.It is interesting to note that this one of the Castaneda books that really sticks in people's mind, and has influenced a whole generation of spiritual and motivational thinkers, such as Wayne Dywer, Richard Bandler, Anthony Robbins among others."},{"Title":"Journey to Ixtlan: the Lessons of Don Juan","review":"The question with regard to Carlos Casteneda is this: If we accept the premise that this book is largely fiction, does that in turn trivialize the message he is trying to impart? Just what is his message? If the message is that the world is full of witches, sorcerers, irridescent coyotes, allies, and phantoms, then the answer must be an unqualfied &quot;yes&quot;. These entities are no more real, and have no more importance than angels and miracles, zombies, ghosts, or anything else whose existence cannot be objectively observed. However, despite the cult that has grown up around these writings, I don't think this is what Casteneda had in mind. Don Juan warned against being trapped in the world of sorcery, just as he did against getting trapped in the world of everyday concerns. It was when Carlos, the character, realized that he and the dung beetle were on even terms, even though their sensory worlds were profoundly different, that he was finally able to &quot;stop the world&quot;. The warrior, says don Juan, takes responsibility for his life, and interacts with every event as if it is his last. Moreover, once one makes the transition to the path of knowledge, one can never go back. &quot;Ixtlan&quot; is by definition childhood's home that one can never return to. These are timeless and profound concepts, that transcend the venue of leaping shadows and bridges in the fog.Casteneda is an unusual writer, and his insistence on portraying his character as an annoying whiner gets a little wearing after a while. The two messages I found in this work - that the world is much more than appears, and that it is important not to sleepwalk through our lives - these concepts never wear thin for me. And the observation that our modern man can learn these lessons from a superstitious old Yaqui is endlessly gratifying to me.There are many ways to get to the place that Casteneda is trying to show us, and therefore I can't place this volume in the &quot;must read&quot; category. But the concepts have value, and you won't regret the effort in getting to the last page."},{"Title":"Journey to Ixtlan: the Lessons of Don Juan","review":"All Carlos' books are exceptional. For first time readers, I would read Ixtlan first, than 'Teachings'. Than just read them all. A great guide to understanding whats important in life.

There are crucial lessons here, whether or not you believe the actual experiences that happen. Through his relationship with Don Juan, Carlos Castenada reminds us of how truly mysterious the world is, and how much awe and wonder there is in ourselves, if we are brave enough to be willing to see it.The book really has very little to do with peyote or drug usage persay, it has much more to do with questioning the very foundations on which we base the world to become aware of reality. Not one that has been dumbed down by definition and categorization but experienced as it is. I see a direct link here with &quot;I Am That&quot; (a book of talks/interviews with an Indian Guru), and even The Matrix.But the sense of power in nature and the drawn out detailed depictions in nature are like very few books I've ever read.This is a great book for an English Class, Existential Philosophy, or Cultural Anthropology, and I do not see this is as a work of fiction. At the very least it is an invitation or reminder for us to rediscover the magic in our own lives again.It is a thoroughly enjoyable read - suspend your analytical mind for two hundred sixty pages and enjoy."},{"Title":"Journey to Ixtlan: the Lessons of Don Juan","review":"Personal experience and also that of many friends provides the best overall starting point for delving into Castaneda's Books isthis one, The Journey to Ixtlan."},{"Title":"Journey to Ixtlan: the Lessons of Don Juan","review":"What a wonderful adventure.

This is the first book of Carlos Castaneda that I have read so I do not have any comparisons to make with his previous work. What I will say is that I felt that this was a complete work in it's self and stands alone, I had no need to read any more of his books to find out more detail.

I have had my share of experiences and consider myself a spiritual, if not \\"mystical\\" person. I approached reading this book as something of a zen guide like the books I read in my late teens like Dan Millman's \\"The way of the Peaceful Warrior,\\" among others. I was deeply, deeply disappointed.Where do I start. Well, let me begin by saying that Castaneda cannot write. The literary content of this book deserves one star, and that's only because it is written in [mostly] complete English sentences. Second, it has no sense of narrative. It is neither driven by a plot or by an overarching concept, unless the vague and amorphous \\"search for power\\" amounts to something of a plotline. Third, I was not engaged by Castaneda, and I could care less for his search for power; nor does don Juan provide us with any information regarding the search for power. Merely a series of random and incoherent acts that supposedly help one attune themselves to their inner power. Rather, we're taken along for the ride - poorly - as Castaneda and don Juan take endless hikes in the desert and meander along various hilltops and describe hallucinations of bushes. I'm just not sure what that is supposed to convey to the reader. He doesn't give any tangible or practical advice, and for someone who does not have access to don Juan, the journey seems moot. Don Juan is constantly and annoyingly laughing and \\"cackling\\" away at questions posed to him, and condescendingly dismisses questions. He may be an all powerful warrior, but he seems quite simple to someone that only knows him through Castaneda's portrait. The message, whatever it is, was completely lost on me. I found reading it all the way to the end to be my ultimate sacrifice and eventually, the mission that would bring me power. I told myself that if I could finish it, then I am the ultimate warrior...I tried to take away one positive thing from the book, if only to be able to share it with the family members that recommended it (so I don't completely hurt their feelings). I salvaged this quote: \\"A warrior on the other hand is a hunter. He calculates everything. That's control. But once his calculations are over, he acts. He lets go. That's abandon. A warrior is not a leaf at the mercy of the wind. No one can push him; no one can make him do things against himself or against his better judgment.\\" Wow, that's deep."},{"Title":"Journey to Ixtlan: the Lessons of Don Juan","review":"Given the time period this novel was written, it is still an interesting story.

Never the one to shy away from \\"fate\\" (or whatever you want to call it), especially when it comes to someone physically handing me a book that is considered \\"life-changing,\\" I knew I had to read it and set out to do so the next day. And simply put, I thought it was insightful but I was somewhat disappointed and don't really get all the hype.Perhaps I had extremely high expectations (as one would when the book recommender tells you it was life-changing); perhaps its a generational thing; or perhaps I read too quickly, as I read the book in one day. I am planning on re-reading it again more slowly. I have a feeling I might get more out of it the second or third time around, as other reviewers have suggested. However, it just wasn't as mind-blowing as I thought it would be and can't understand how others loved it so much, as to consider it life-changing?I definitely have my share of underlined passages that I thought were very important and insightful, and will take away with me after reading this book, however I thought it was a little corny at times, for lack of a better word. I hated how don Juan kept testing him and while I understand it was so he could come to his own realizations, it just frustrated me as a reader. I felt there was just too much written about how he wanted answers to all his questions and was disappointed when they weren't forthcoming.In addition, the book presupposes that attaining this type of power, \\"stopping the world,\\" and becoming a sorcerer like don Juan is something one should want to attain, but why is that necessarily so? Without contact with others (except it seems his other sorcerer friend), and without any personal history, which he simply gave up, what exactly are the benefits that don Juan experiences? Why should anyone want to become a sorcerer like him?I am sure those who love this book are going to consider my thoughts naieve and comment that I'm ingnorantly stuck in a world where things are what they seem, but I am truly happy in this world where I have a personal history, connections to others and a clear sense of my life and place in the world. Perhaps having a strong religious identity prevented me from buying into these assumptions as well? Or perhaps having read only one of Carlos Castenedas books, I am missing the complete picture that would make this more interesting or relatable?Despite my somewhat-negative comments, I do recommend this book, as I found it thought-provoking and interesting. It would make an interesting book-club selection, because it provides wonderful fodder for discussions and opinions.

It also brought new ideas of spirituality to my mind. I hope that other people have, and possibly will, read this story and like it just as much as I have."},{"Title":"Journey to Ixtlan: the Lessons of Don Juan","review":"That might not come from reading this book alone, as it is the third most believable of the series. When I was a student, I like many others I know who will confess to having read a Castaneda book or two when pressed, went through a couple of years of Castanedism, reading the 8 classics 2 - 3 times each, and even the later four, quite different books a couple of times. Being someone who likes to give the benefit of the doubt until conclusive evidence proves otherwise, I must admit to only getting suspicious by this, the third book. The second book, A Separate Reality, picks up on the supernormal happenings, but still these are within the realms of possibility, when one considers Spiritualist literature. By Tales of Power, when at the end Carlos throws himself off a cliff and only survives by becoming pure perception, bouncing elastically back and forth 17 times between the two inherent realms of all creation, the tonal and the nagual, the game was up. In Carlos' terms, my assemblage point had just experienced a considerable shift into the realms of disbelief. The cocoon had burst. I read the remaining books still interested, but with the growing realization that I'd been had. Bizarre ideas not found in any other spiritual traditions, such as the necessity for people on the path of knowledge to kill their children to reclaim the power they'd lost to them, plus fill in the holes in their cocoons the children had caused, made me wary. This was surely not a philosophy the whole world should turn to, or else we'd be living in a fearful, lonely world with every man for himself.However, this would be fine if the books weren't made out to be non-fiction. While I have seen these books placed with science fiction books in many libraries, in most European bookshops they're still sold with real, non-fiction 'Mind, Body, Spirit' books. The reason I give this book such a low rating is that an intensive study of his works, the books by his various colleagues, plus Richard De Mille's intelligent criticisms, can only lead to the conclusion that Castaneda, the writer, used Don Juan and Carlos, two fantasy characters, to verbalize his own beliefs, which were culled from his own spiritual and academic experience. That there are not some useful nuggets of wisdom, or advice in these books I do not deny. That is their very attraction, plus the belief that it all really happened, and is a new spiritual revelation. But as these are mixed up with increasingly bizarre assertions and beliefs (by the Art of Dreaming it seems all pretence at non-fiction had been given up), it is doubtful whether a lifetime devoted to these practices (as opposed to say, real shamanic practices) would lead to spiritual improvement. If you must have a Castaneda book in your library, rather get The Wheel of Time, a selection of the spiritual highlights of the first eight books, but consider it rather 'The best of the personal philosophy of Carlos Castaneda' than anything to do with Don Juan or Shamanism. This understanding may not have the romantic mix of wild Mexican deserts, ancient wisdom, wise old men and naive westerners which captures the hearts of so many, but it is a lot closer to the truth.The anonymous ghost-writer at Schuster and Schuster who corrected Peruvian immigrant Castaneda's English for at least all of his earlier works (a sample of his writing from 1969 reveals it was still far from perfect, not like what is in books), giving the books their special character, certainly deserves more credit than he or she gets. But they are not written well enough to succeed as fiction, hence their continued classification as non-fiction, besides the intense academic embarrassment it would cause copyright holders UCLA to have to admit such a dramatic change in classification, from fact to fantasy, after having previously given the author a doctorate for his work! I give this book one star on the basis that any book claiming to represent the truth which is later found to be fraudulent deserves no stars by definition, so I must give the minimum rating allowed. The day this book is reclassified as Fiction, I will up my rating to 3 stars though, as it is a quite entertaining and authentic piece of fiction-posing-as-non-fiction."},{"Title":"Journey to Ixtlan: the Lessons of Don Juan","review":"\\"Journey to Ixtlan\\" is a long and unbalanced (sometimes repetitive) dialogue between Don Juan, the sorcerer, and his apprentice. Unbalanced to the extent that the apprentice is humble, naive, easily taken by Don Juan's views, unable to effectively counter-argue the teachings of the sorcerer. The reader is taken into a long and fantastic journey through the desert, where he is slowly introduced into the teachings of Don Juan. For him, the world of everyday life is not real as we believe it to be. Reality if merely one of various descriptions, therefore we have to learn how to \\"see\\" as opposed to merely \\"looking,\\" and \\"stopping the world\\" is the first step to \\"seeing.\\" Once the apprenticeship is finished we have learned a new description of the world and are able to elicit a new perception, one has gained \\"membership.\\" We must break the dogmatic certainty, which we all share, that the validity of our perceptions is not to be questioned. In the long process we must learn to erase personal history, remodel most of our behavior, self-importance must be dropped, we must take full responsibility for our actions, and accept death as the only wise adviser. You become a hunter once you learn to separate the images and see two of everything, you become accessible to power and learn how to tackle your dreams. You become a man of knowledge because you have unravelled the secrets of personal power. A man is only the sum of his personal power, and that sum determines how he lives and how he dies.Carlos Castaneda, an active member of the New Age Movement, had millions of followers around the world. His writings are supposedly based on personal experience, on his studies on the effects of certain medicinal plants and the teachings of a shaman who used hallucinogens to initiate his students into an occult world. His personal life has remained a mystery, as much as his cult, and his literary success is not actually based on quality but rather on being appealing to human thrist for myth, magic, self-improvement, and the imaginary."},{"Title":"Journey to Ixtlan: the Lessons of Don Juan","review":"I bought and read this paperback book when it was new and popular and when we were going on a camping vacation. It was so much crap that I threw it in the campfire and thereby made the most of it as it was actually good kindling. I would recommend this book to anyone who needs a good campfire starter."},{"Title":"Journey to Ixtlan: the Lessons of Don Juan","review":"Don Juan attempts to teach Carlos Castaneda vague lessons by engaging him in a series of nonsensical activities. Many of the themes are common to other spiritual traditions (e.g. breaking routines, becoming inaccessible, not doing, or stopping the world--in the language of this book) and because of this, the reader may have a clue as to what Don Juan is getting at. However, Don Juan consistently spurns Castaneda when he asks for explanations, insisting on showing him instead. Unfortunately, the demonstrations seem to be pointless and nonsensical. Maybe, that's the point, but it gets tiresome to endure this over and over again throughout the book. I'm a big fan of psychedelic drugs and solipsistic thinking, and I approached this book with a great amount of focus but finished it mostly disappointed."},{"Title":"Journey to Ixtlan: the Lessons of Don Juan","review":"This book should be in the pseudoanthropology section and is a classic of the genre. My title above is a quote from Marcello Truzzi's evaluation. Journey to Ixtlan was the third in the series and formed the basis of a doctoral disertation that incredibly was awarded a degree by UCLA department of anthropology, thereby reclassifying that department as the school of literary fantasy studies. For a full evaluation of Carlos Cesar Arena Castaneda see Martin Gardner's notes of a fringe watcher 'Carlos Castaneda and New Age Anthropology' in Skeptical Enquirer Vol 23, No.5 pp13-15; 1999. Never the less read as fantasy/philosophy the book is good value. the fact that it virtually founded a New Age religion is evidence for Gordon Wasson's theory that drug induced hallucinations produced by what he called entheogens are at the basis of many religions ancient and modern."},{"Title":"Journey to Ixtlan: the Lessons of Don Juan","review":"Castaneda's books are garbage designed to make money from gullible hippies, and there are plenty of them still around.

The third, I must admit was a complete bore and repeat of the first two. Believe Carlos' if you wish, but this kind of material is very easy to materialise, in which I think &quot;over-exaggeration&quot; comes to mind. Perhaps, there are people out there who wish to have been and met such characters, as did Carlos many years ago, which simply means they have very boring lives. This is one book I have read recently which I do not recommend, because it is completely rubbish."},{"Title":"Journey to Ixtlan: the Lessons of Don Juan","review":"I first read the book, while backpacking at the age of sixteen in the Porcupine Mountains in northern Michigan; I found it an appropriate choice in camping literature.Carlos Casteneda writes that he was looking for someone who could teach him about pychotropic plants, and that he meets a man (sorceror) named don Juan, who has experience with psychotropic plants like Jimson Weed, Peyote, and a kind of halluigenic Psilocybe mushroom, and who can do just that. Carlos asks don Juan if he can apprentice him and he eventually complies, and they come to a sort of agreement. The two of them begin taking daily walks through the forest together, and talk about pychotropics, philosophies and other concerns. Don Juan begins training Carlos to become a sort of spiritual \\"warrior\\", and he begins to consume peyote.Don Juan's little dialouges are interesting but extreamly strange. He describes to Carlos that he will become a warrioir by \\"stopping the world\\" and by then \\"looking\\" and \\"seeing\\". The ideas don Juan suggests are difficult to interprit and understand. (I recomend a little bit of psychotropic influence to help the 'ol head to process the wilds concepts, haha!) I always liked what he said about walking through the woods with your arms spread open to touch the vegitation around you, and I find myself doing it when I hike. The book is interesting but it doesn't have a lot of substance. I give it a solid - good, but its a good that I find myself picking up again and again."},{"Title":"Journey to Ixtlan: the Lessons of Don Juan","review":"quick shipping, great product, great price. highly recommended book to read, my favorite of castaneda's series."},{"Title":"Journey to Ixtlan: the Lessons of Don Juan","review":"An old book, still relevant; metaphors applicable to all walks of and stages of life."},{"Title":"Journey to Ixtlan: the Lessons of Don Juan","review":"When I first read this book I was too young to understand the meaning behind what Carlos Castaneda was trying to say and I didn't believe that the teachings of Don Juan were possibly as true as they were powerful. But as I read through it again I realized there was more to the book than just a crazy Indian and his hallucinogenic plants, and it wasn't until I re-read Journey to Ixtlan that I understood what Don Juan was trying to teach Carlos.Journey to Ixtlan by Carlos Castaneda is by far my favorite and inarguably one of the best he's written throughout his travels with Don Juan. When you first start reading Castaneda's books, sorcery is a really questionable matter until you read this one and all of your questions are answered. In this book Don Juan teaches Carlos many things that pertain to both the sorcerer's world as well as the world the reader lives in. Many of these things are part of everyday situations and connects Carlos very well to the reader. Some of the things that Don Juan tries to teach or make Carlos realize are erasing personal history, losing self-importance, and being inaccessible. It is these lessons as well as many others that lead Carlos to the \\"stopping the world\\" and the journey to Ixtlan.I would definitely recommend this book to people who are open-minded and who has a high reading level, but I wouldn't recommend this book to people who aren't already familiar with Carlos Castaneda's other books."},{"Title":"Journey to Ixtlan: the Lessons of Don Juan","review":"This is in response to other reviews claiming Castaneda books are not of anthropology nature.For Years I have heard the Field of Anthropology Scorn Castaneda for Not Providing &quot;Evidence&quot; of his findings, and in response to that what evidence could he provide? A few signed contracts a few pictures of don Juan maybe a film? How easy could it be to go down to Mexico and take any old Indian and Take a photograph of him? Or forge a few contracts and teachings ect...People should just accept it! The tremendous ego of the human Nation want's to hold every ounce of power! That's how we all are brought up, When we are threatened even if we are wrong we must fight back,The Hunters Way is gone, the warriors way has vanished, ever since the conquering of west civilization, If You think about it were all about selfdoubt, pity, hate, love, if you think really hard you'll find out your life isn't all great, while we make excuses &quot;that's life&quot; claiming its not fantasy, well what this book made me realize that may be life but it isn't all that the Real world is,This Book its quite extraordinary,But I suggest reading the first 2 books, they're a little slow not quite as &quot;fun&quot; as this book but its a necessity if you want to comprehend it fully,a lot of mistakes people make with Castaneda books is that they should be read from first book to last, not just picking out any of which seems interesting...If you read the first two i suggest reading this one, out of all of them this one still remains as my favorite"},{"Title":"Journey to Ixtlan: the Lessons of Don Juan","review":"I read and re-read this book many times in my early 20's. I took mushrooms and wandered around the woods of Canada alone. I had magnificent revelations - but my life was a disaster. I followed the instructions and crafted my life around personal responsibility. My life was still a disaster. The quality of the writing here is fantastic. Even though this is likely a philosophical treatise and not a true account, the writing is so compelling that an impressionable young mind (like mine was) is likely to swallow it all hook, line and sinker.

He should be studied as a master of his craft."},{"Title":"Journey to Ixtlan: the Lessons of Don Juan","review":"Castaneda's first three books constitute some of the best fiction of the 20th century. Yes I know, I know, many folks think these books are fact as did I when I first started reading them many years ago. I believe it is a testament to Castaneda's gift as a writer that events that objectively appear impossible nevertheless come across as plausible. To be honest I think it is a greater honor to Castaneda to approach these as fiction because the world he has created is so immersive that it has very few peers in literature: He's like the Tolkien of New Age (you cannot tell me Second Ring of Power is not fiction as he 'literally' abandons the diary format altogether for novel format). That said there are many impactful life lessons to draw from this particular title and it is my favorite of the series."},{"Title":"Journey to Ixtlan: the Lessons of Don Juan","review":"I'm an atheist and a big fan of Buddhism. Since I'm certain (in the negative) about rebirth, karma, and all things supernatural, I've wrestled with how some key Buddhist teachings might apply to my atheist worldview. This book gave me a vivid, irreverent, and inspiring vision that has influenced my thought and practice.No-self, non-ego, non-attachment, dropping the story, awareness, death as an advisor, and living in the present are a few themes that Buddhism shares with Don Juan in Ixtlan. Not that Ixtlan is a Buddhist teaching, or that Buddhism is summed up by Ixtlan, or vice versa - that's absolutely not the case. But thinking about the teachings and character of Don Juan (irreverent, hilarious, appreciative, and incredibly down to earth and real) has made my Buddhist practice more real."},{"Title":"Journey to Ixtlan: the Lessons of Don Juan","review":"Journey to Ixtlan is a spiritual story unlike any I've ever read. Castaneda makes no notion of trying to comfort the reader with what fluffy tales of love and kindness. Aside from all the goodness and love that naturally ensues in one's spiritual quest there is a factor of aloneness and detachment that only a few &quot;warriors&quot; out there are equipped to handle.This is a mind opening book, a candid story of Carlos Castenada, a brave man who found his leader, but not his time."},{"Title":"Journey to Ixtlan: the Lessons of Don Juan","review":"Did you ever try to find your hands in your dreams?

To stop the world is very difficult and responsible task(the most difficult we take on in our life, that is for sure.) And last of all I must state people\`s way of regarding the books of Castaneda as an intriguing works on anthropology and nothing more is terrible.

Back in the 80's after I had served a stint in the US Navy I wanted to go home. I did go home but .. I did not seem to fit in. After a couple of years of giving it a try.. I came across this book. I started to read it. I thought, this guy is nuts.. but interesting. I was able to relate to the story (i had never heard of Carlos before). By the end of the book... I was in tears. The lesson that this book taught me was that you can never go home. The home you are seeking is not a place where your folks live. Its a place in time... you can never go back there again. I cried."},{"Title":"Journey to Ixtlan: the Lessons of Don Juan","review":"These books are great stories. I don't know whether Carlos Castaneda went through any of the experiences he writes about or if he was just a great story teller but they do have a ring of truth to them. I was heavily influenced by these books when I first read them, much, much less so now. Journey to Ixtlan is a metaphor for how your life will look as you abandon your old patterns and take on a new way of living.I also enjoyed Positive Energy by Judith Orloff and Energetic Anatomy by Mark Rich.

They were beautiful, simple people and not widely read.Ixtlan is more a metaphor than a reality I realized.I have read several of the Carlos Castenadas books andthe details of each blur in my mind...but the essence of whatthey taught live with me. Its about being in the flow,about balancing energy, about trusting nature, and so much more!I read them before I knew a whit about metaphysics. Nowthat I am a 25 year veteran and teach this stuff, I realizethat Carlos gave me a wonderful spiritual foundation in thesebooks. One of my favorite lines of his is: \\"Follow the PathWith Heart\\". Just read it, keep your mind open, and be willingto receive change. It will all be positive, I assure you!"},{"Title":"Journey to Ixtlan: the Lessons of Don Juan","review":"Without a doubt this is the best book written by Castaneda. I think you have to read the previous 2 to fully understand this one, but this is the one that pulls it all together for me.As a lifelong hunter this book made me understand hunting from an even deeper perspective. It also introduced the idea to me of hunting yourself. Applying the hunting principles to other life situations besides shooting game.I read this book when I was about 20, and it changed the way I thought about life for the better, and not a day goes by that the tactics suggested in the book don't come into play for me.I think the spiritual principles outlined here are available in other books, but I don't believe the REASON behind doing them has ever been explained as fully anywhere else.CC may be gone, but I am forever grateful for the impact of his philosophy on my practice."},{"Title":"Journey to Ixtlan: the Lessons of Don Juan","review":"Quite simply one of the greatest books of modern spiritual literature.

There is alot of speculation as to which books are indeed fiction and which are based on fact. Perhaps all of them are fables from Castaneda's inventive mind. Still, there is a common belief among his fans that, beginning after this book his works become pure fiction. Regardless of the 'factual' nature of these works, Truth is found within Castaneda's writings - especially in Journey to Ixtlan.This is a highly readable and enjoyable book, and this work is by far the one with the most genius and depth and wisdom. It at once deceptively simple and engaging, yet insightful and illuminating. Journey to Ixtlan is a real pleasure to read as well.

If your leaning is towards sorcery and the revelation of it's secrets, you simply MUST read this.

Put succintly...the real war is won when we cultivate higher levels of awareness."},{"Title":"Journey to Ixtlan: the Lessons of Don Juan","review":"As per my other reviews for the first two of Carlos Castaneda's books \`The teachings of Don Juan' and \`A separate reality' the question as to fiction or \`something else' still stands. This 3rd book however still holds the same magic as the other first two books and I am eager to read the next book \`Tales of Power'.This present book deals with Don Juan teaching Carlos how to become a hunter and a warrior. The philosophy behind this very fascinating and even if the book is fiction; you can certainly learn something here.Dreaming & Astral travel: A very nice practice given on page 112 regarding strengthening one's experience. Don Juan tells Carlos to look at ones hands when he becomes conscious in his Dream. He tells him that he can use other objects (4 at most to start with) to look at, this until he loses focus and then should look at another object. Don Juan also gives another practice regarding astral travelling to imagined places. This is a very similar practice that I've seen from Gnostic practices.I love the teachings of Don Juan regarding Shadows in this book Don Juan tells Carlos to look at the shadows to delve into the spiritual and gain great understanding and insight. Never really looked at this before and am very intrigued as to wether this would really work.Once again we find Carlos having to deal with his \`Worthy adversary' in this book i.e. a witch intent on attacking Carlos. I'm interested to know what happens between these two as I further read Carlos Castaneda's books.Non-doing & stopping the world: Surely there is profoundness to real spiritual practices and teaching here. What a wonderful way at looking at this. We have all been taught 'to do', from the youngest of years. According to Don Juan, this doing holds the very fabric of our reality together. One must go against this and learn the art of Non-doing. The philosophy is not as straight forward as you may think. This philosophy is truly insightful and must be read to truly be understood and appreciated; too much for me to go into with this review. Just on this point, this is another reason why people must re-read Carlos's books i.e. once is not enough to allow this to sink in. All in all a wonderful book to expand ones potential as to the \`non-ordinary reality'."},{"Title":"Journey to Ixtlan: the Lessons of Don Juan","review":"This book was instrumental in changing my view of the world and opening up to all the magic that is here now. A truly timeless book, this is the first Carlos Castaneda book I recommend to everyone. Is Don Juan a real person or just a character in the mind of a brilliant Carlos? Everybody wants to know.. (those that have read a few books) If you do some searches on the internet you may be able to find a Don Juan that goes by a different name... Some say that he is the inspiration for these books. Regardless, this reality is quite magical and I have experienced its truth. Thankyou to the Magic of the Universe!"},{"Title":"Journey to Ixtlan: the Lessons of Don Juan","review":"The concepts in this book are insubstantial and poorly explained because the author himself did not understand them. Sentences like, \\"Doing makes a tree a tree and a rock a rock,\\" are common in explaining pivotal concepts such as \\"doing,\\" but are no more than pseudo-koans. Castaneda asks for further explanation but Don Juan is unable or unwilling to truly explicate these concepts in a comprehensive manner that does them justice. They are hinted at in unsatisfactory and ambiguous terms-- never nailed down because even after all of his apprenticeship, it's obvious Castaneda truly does not understand anything that he was taught and actually gained very little from the teachings. He goes through all the motions and somehow sees what he is supposed to see and somehow even feels what he is supposed to feel, but understands none of it and cannot give it significance or grounding. Castaneda's work has largely been discredited as fraud at this point, and from the writing you can tell that he really only had superficial knowledge of the topics he wrote about because he plagiarized and fabricated most of his work. Books like Autobiography of a Yogi are much much better and more rewarding."},{"Title":"Journey to Ixtlan: the Lessons of Don Juan","review":"The writings of Carlos Castaneda, it is very clear, has impacted opinion worldwide. Who will argue with that assessment? The controversey surrounds the issue of whether his writings reflect a truthful telling of his experiences with his mentor, don Juan Matus, or are just a mismash of creative fictional writing. To those who have already read Castaneda's writings, there is no need to preach to the choir or persuade the naysayers. But to those who have not read these books, I ask you to consider carefully: let's say the books ARE fictional. SO WHAT??? Even if Castenda's works ARE fictional, could they still not help expand one's consciousness? IS THERE SUCH A THING that people avoid fiction because it is completely meaningless and of no value to one's own personal development? Really? If you agree fiction has its role to play, then consider the possibility these works might be factual: how much more rich are they then?

It is the only book I have ever read that stalked and attacked me. I gave a copy to an acquaintance, who had a similar experience. At a certain point in the book it turns on you and \\"cracks your world\\". Don Juan was teaching Carlos, his apprentice, to be a stalker and a hunter. He was also trying to \\"crack\\" Carlos's view of the world as a known and predictable place. So I was surprised when the book actually turned on me tried to crack my world and partially succeeded. It is a terrifying moment. The woman I gave a copy of the book to screamed out her husband's name, \\"Robert!\\" when she came to that place in the book to which I refer. I will get a copy of this book and read it again and, perhaps, come back and revamp this review."},{"Title":"Journey to Ixtlan: the Lessons of Don Juan","review":"I have read all the Castaneda books, and I think this is the best one to start with. In his first one,The Teachings of Don Juan: A Yaqui Way of Knowledge, Carlos is focused on the peyote/mescaline. By his own admission, he didn't really understood the drugs were just a tool - and an unnecessary one for most people - for opening his awareness. In this book, he instead focuses on what Don Juan actually taught him, and presents it in a very structured, accessible fashion. The somewhat rigid presentation of the 'lessons' keeps it from being a favorite of mine - I prefer the 'story' or even parable structure ofTales of Power, andThe Power of Silence: Further Lessons of don Juan, but this is still a great place to start overall.As for the controversies surrounding Castaneda and the existence or not of Don Juan, who cares? These are powerful books, either way. Read them as truth, read them as fiction, it doesn't matter."},{"Title":"Journey to Ixtlan: the Lessons of Don Juan","review":"Read this book and be changed. A friend gave me this book 16 year ago, and I have read it at least once every two years since. It is a magical and philosophical read that will cause you to rexamine your life and renew your sense of self purpose in a way that no other book will. Beyond that, the story is entertaining, engaging and beautifully written. I'm on the site now to send it to a friend who I suspect needs to read it. I can't think of anyone who wouldn't at least be intrigued by the book's premise, if not utterly changed by it."},{"Title":"Journey to Ixtlan: the Lessons of Don Juan","review":"Castenada dazzels the mind with his reiteration of the teachings of don Juan Matus, the master sorcerer. After Reading this and other books in his series I underwent a change in life. One could only hope to attain part of the mastery of don Juans journey into the realm of Power. Casteneda studied for over 10 years, with don Juan to become a man of Power. I highly recomend this book and all other in the series to all those who would like to find the true meaning of the description of the world that they call reality, as well as, those searching for the true meaning of Power"},{"Title":"Journey to Ixtlan: the Lessons of Don Juan","review":"Journey to Ixtlan, almost summarily, contains most of the wisdom and core ideas found throughout the Castaneda books. This book is really the only one you need to read, in the sense that the best of the storytelling and lesson summaries are all here. Regardless of your opinion of Castaneda's personal life, the lucidity of this storytelling stands on its own merits.The journey is an allegory, a metaphorical map for one's own journey through life. Cogent lessons from the first 2 Castaneda books are expanded and reiterated here: Becoming Accessible to Power; Using Death as an Advisor; Losing Self-Importance; Not-Doing (Taoist connection); Assuming Responsibility etc.The fundamental question this book insists on is: How will reading it change you through changing your perceptions of everyday reality? This one bears re-reading several times. Highly recommended.ParataxisExtracts: A Field Guide for IconoclastsThe Cloud Reckoner"},{"Title":"Journey to Ixtlan: the Lessons of Don Juan","review":"I have read all of Castaneda's books since they first were published. To my way of thinking, this is his best. The life lesson in the book is you can't go back in time, because you have changed, the earth has changed and everyone else has changed. So if you meet up with the old people in the old places, it's no longer what it was, you can't go back there. It's a simple lesson but well presented in this book.At one time people believed Castaneda was a bit of a shaman, relating a secret knowledge. But it's really just superb story telling. But he introduces practices and philosophy from many shamanistic traditions that have exsted for thousands of years and still do among shamanistic people like the South American native tribes, aboriginies, and other \\"primitive\\" peoples of the past and present. The ideas of lucid dreaming can work (decades ago I found my hands in my dream and directed myself to specific locations) but it doesn't get you anywhere or teach you anything. It's tinkering with your consciousness, like smoking dope. It's different, but no better than reality.The idea of the tonal versus the nagual to me was just the two different states of consciousness, inward directed thinking (how do I feel, what do I think, speaking to yourself essentially) versus outwardly directed thinking ( doing something that requires your concentration, walking, working, writing a review) that takes you out of your self absorption. The nagual is self conscious, existential, the tonal is action oriented. A secret I discovered is you can be really happy mostly in the tonal, but you can only be self reflective in the nagual.These days I enjoy Jack Daniels and retirement. It's a shame that Carlos got caught up in that cult mentality that destroyed all the cultists before him. He should have known better. He was a hell of a story teller. He summed up a world of philosophy, psychology, and mystic thought, in a very convincing narrative. His great mistake was taking on the persona of his own characters. He forgot it was just a story. A great story, but a figment of his imagination and creativity and research. He should never have tried to turn fantasy into his reality."},{"Title":"Journey to Ixtlan: the Lessons of Don Juan","review":"Masterpiece ! Simply magic!

I read it it in the North African desert. Quite a trip! I thought it was fabulous then and I still do. It's a seminal and important work and I was delighted to see it appear as a digital book so I could download it for my kindle and read it again. Well... it's still a great piece of work and I love it. But I hate the typos! I found two instances of repeated words e.g. and and. How is it possible for a book to be published with no typos in paper during an age where we had none of the spell/grammar checking computer capabilites we have now - only be republished in digital with the help of all these fanstastic technologies PLUS TYPOS. What does this tell you about the way the world is going? Plenty of quantity around. But quality - especially quality work - that's a thing of the past. So 1-star deduction for incompetent publishing.

I'm in my 60s now and decided to re-read one of my all time favorite books. The book arrived in good shape but not with the magical white falcon depicted on the images of the book you see here (by Washinton Square Press) but with an ugly black looking (Walt Disney looking) type of crow or some other scrawny black bird that looks like a cartoon. Somehow it destroys the magic of the book. Whoever they hired to do the cover work never read the book or the important chapter with the spiritual lesson of the White Falcon contained within it's pages. I realize its just a cover but somehow it does not fit the book and detracts from one of the reasons for owning a book like this. Maybe younger readers won't care or understand. But for older readers like myself who remember the excitement that a new Castenada book used to generate - you know what I'm trying to say. Just beware of the balck cartoon crow on the cover of some Washington Square Press books where the magical white falcon should be on copies of \\"Journet to Ixtlan.\\" A \\"warrior\\" will know what I'm trying to say. Otherwise the story is the same and still worth reading.

What made this book so different than any others I can recall is that Mrs. Hardy gets more than a mere mention. She actually works on a case with her men. Joe hardy has the biggest part in the story and it even mentions that he is supposedly physically stronger than Frank. It should be the other way around, since Frank is the older of the two. There's even a tongue-in-cheek joke in the novel when someone tells one of the characters that he could always take up a career ghostwriting children's books. I thought that was a cheap shot and just further evidence that not as much pride is being put into writing these stories as it once was. All in all, though, an exciting story with a lot of action. I'd recommend it."},{"Title":"Daredevils (Hardy Boys (Pb))","review":"\\"Daredevils\\" was awesome, so action packed! All of the stunts were thrilling. It took place in Hollywood.

I got a much greater understanding of the oedipal problem and how important the understanding is to regaining emotional health. It's the tip of the whole rotten enchilada of neurosis! It's like an iceberg! 95 percent of our oedipal issues are submerged in or subconscious, waiting to be resolved. Then a person we want to be intimate with comes along just like the Titanic and slams into the frozen mass below the surface and we realize, hopefully, just how big and solid that iceberg really was. I also really liked the parts about the nature of fate. It seems like a strange subject to be in a psychology book but Dr. Lowen has bravely approached how we end up manifesting our subconscious drives over and over again for better or worse, and how we can use the awareness for better instead of worse. It's that pesky repitition compulsion again!Small case studies are integrated into the book and it progresses on explaing the nature and depth of the oedipal problem. It is never boring and not so technical that it is difficult to read. On the contrary, it is warm and conversational, but fully reveals the gravity and seriousness of resolving these issues so the we may experience love, pleasure and pain with the full response of our bodies and cooperation of the ego. Let's not live in our heads anymore people! Strongly reccomend this book. It is also nicely bound and printed."},{"Title":"Fear of Life","review":"Have you ever met someone who is afraid to be who she or he is?This could be the person who won't open their heart up, reach out and take up a cause.I love to read books like this book, because in reading such a book, one is free to ask questions, and demand the best of the author.Alexander Lowen gives you so much information in this book on the beginnings of frustrations, limitations, rejections and anger, in a way that makes you say, &quot;Yeah! That is how it really is.&quot;This book, like Lowen's other books, are not light reading, but instead insists that you look deeply into your heart and claim your feelings.This book is also not a trendy &quot;self-help&quot; book, but instead a book replete with clinical and real life examples that you will find yourself growing, as you read this book.This is an author who I would love to meet, and just be fully in the moment with, without much dialogue - just to share a thank you for writing information that helps us all to explore the human condition."},{"Title":"Fear of Life","review":"This is a useful text and I would very much like to see it back in print.

But to my knowledge, only Lowen has identified where such a strong fear of death comes from--The Fear of Life!Lowen and Bioenergetics has changed my life. The message is not easy but it is hopeful: change your body and you can change your feelings and your life.The book explores how the need or drive for children to exceed their parents leads to suffering both within families and within our culture. It does indeed strongly endorse and make vivid Freud's idea of the Oedipal Complex, but it is much more than just a reworking of Freud. Lowen brought enormous powers of observation and decades of clinical experience to the task of defining what happens in human development that leads to emotional limitations and suffering.For non-therapists,Joy: The Surrender to the Body and to Life (Compass)might be a better book to start with (fewer psychoanalytic concepts), but this is Lowen's most powerful book."},{"Title":"Fear of Life","review":"I highly recommend this book.

Not long ago, I was privileged to visit them. Couto grew up in both India proper and Goa during Portuguese times: her family played its role in the political and cultural events of their times. As an anthropologist with both long interest and fondness for Goa, I looked forward to reading her book as soon as I heard about its publication, though it was not available in the USA. I am aware that many people in India have criticized GOA: A DAUGHTER'S STORY as reflecting the view of a certain class, a certain caste, and a certain (maybe \`outdated') culture. I think these criticisms are basically cheap shots. Everybody's work, including mine, reflects their personal background. Why should hers be any different ? I liked Couto's book because it emphasized the synthesis of Hindu and Catholic tradition within Goa's culture, a synthesis that is under strong attack by rightwing communalist forces today. Whether or not that tradition will survive remains to be seen. She also worries, rightly, about the effects of mass tourism on the culture and ecology of her beloved Goa. To meet Maria Aurora Couto and to read her book is to be convinced of her passionate love of her tiny corner of the world, tucked away on India's west coast, a couple hundred miles south of Bombay. Her good will is unchallenged.However, I must say that as I read through the 400+ page book, I felt many times that it should have had an unbending editor. The author tends to wander down many interesting byways, lose the thread, pick it up, and lose it again. In short, it seems to me the book could have been cut somewhat, but tightened up a lot. Does good will make a good history ? That depends. Though I looked forward to inside details of Goan family life, of personal details of life at the top in politics or culture over the last 40 years, I did not receive much satisfaction. The author sticks largely to the old script---the history of Goa that has been told by many people before, people who documented their statements, and checked them carefully. There are a number of mistakes that even I, not at all a Goa historian, was startled to meet. For example, on page 197---the explanation of how Daman, a former Portuguese enclave north of Bombay, got its name. (She says from a figure at the Peshwa's court, but the Portuguese had conquered it under that very name in the previous century ! ) Again on page 197-\\"sipais\\" is said to mean \\"spies\\", but it means \\"soldiers\\". Page 201---Sattari is said to mean 70 villages, which is correct, but it's noted as \`sath vad' or 60 villages. On page 315, the Portuguese crown is said to pass to Spain in 1602. It was in 1580. On page 320, some confusion arises with Adil Shah conspiring with one Dom Mateus in 1639. Unless there was another Adil Shah somewhere, this historical character was the same one who opposed Albuquerque back in 1510 ! Rather longlived. Certain information appears several times as if it had not been mentioned before. Very interesting chapters on Goan musical traditions (in which the author's father features) and on little known political events in the 19th century are plagued by meanders into other topics when they could have been brilliant with tighter organization. OK, I only bring these things up to make my point that editing was needed. GOA: A DAUGHTER'S STORY is not meant to be an academic work, but by not including more biographical detail, the author has fallen between two ships. The book is a heartfelt paean of love for Goa, perhaps idealistic, somewhat idealized. For people not familiar with Goa, it may prove confusing and too full of unknown names. It might not provide them with the politically correct views of our times either. For those who know Goa, it could be a welcome addition to their library, a walk down memory lane that itself will be remembered."},{"Title":"Beautiful Junk: Creative Classroom Uses For Recyclable Materials","review":"This book not only outlines many projects which can be used in conjunction with recycling, garbage and environmental units, it also sparks ideas for other projects with its open-ended structuring.

It's relationships, collaboration, and community.&quot;This book is for people who have not thought about what elements must be present in a an e-business model in order to ensure profitability, sustainability, and success. If you company is starting its first e-business initiative, this book could save you some lost time and money.If you have done this thinking, chances are that you will not learn much from this book. I found no concepts that I had not read in at least 5 other books about e-business success. The microeconomic analysis of creating a profitable business over time was also incomplete in that it did not pay enough attention to the role of speeding up progress, reducing start-up losses, and creating permanent advantages. I graded the book down one star for these missing elements.The book focuses on six areas for progress (value drivers, in the parlance of the book), and provides an imperative for each:1. Relationships (cultivate your long-term customer relationships)2. Logistics (perfect your logistics)3. Branding (build a power brand)4. Channels (harmonize your channels on behalf of the customer)5. Intermediaries (become a value-adding intermediary or use one)6. Financial Dynamics (transform your capital and cost situations)Each value driver and imperative is detailed with check lists to consider and useful, contemporary examples that you can check on on the Web for yourself.A weakness of the book is that it pushes a bit too hard on the idea of building relationships as the primary way to create profit. Certainly, relationships will always be important, but I suspect that most successes in the future will be built on superior, trustworthy service rather than on relationships per se. The book is also too quick to abandon being the low-cost provider of superior products and services as a valid, broadly-available business model. With specialization, many will be able to achieve that. Further, the book is not imaginative enough in thinking of new ways to add value to customers that cannot be done except on-line.On the other hand, it is the best book I have read for explaining the importance of having a carefully considered e-business model, and providing a structure for examining the options.In the final chapter, the authors look at new trends in technology (especially wireless applications) that will affect how you help customers.The authors have excellent credentials. Nick Earle is the head of HP's E-Services.Solutions group, and Peter Keen has written widely on business and the Internet. The final chapter also draws on the thinking of Rajiv Gupta, general manager of HP's E-Speech operation. The quality of their backgrounds show in the clear articulation of their points of view and the examples they choose.After you finish this book, ask yourself the question of how you can create advantages for your business that customers feel are very important and can never be overcome by competitors. And don't limit yourself to on-line solutions to get there. When you come up with a solution, you'll be off to a good start in creating a superior business model."},{"Title":"From .Com to .Profit: Inventing Business Models That Deliver Value and Profit","review":"Dot-profit provides a good review of the economics and fundamentals of electronic commmerce. This is particularly needed given the state of the market.

I endured many of the events she speaks so fluently about in this story. Many of the events we shared during the same time, although in different locations. Kathy's book is written in a compelling, honest style. I felt as if I was there with her, sharing her pain while watching her mother's body slowly shutting down.As the author of &quot;Condition of Limbo,&quot; another book about caregiving, I am able to feel the roller coaster ride Kathy could not break away from, because I served as a caregiver, while learning the rules of caregiving. Kathy and I learned how to jump through the hoops of bureaucracy, and how to break the rules. &quot;Your Mother Has Suffered a Stroke,&quot; discusses the heartbreak of caregiving and the agony of watching your parent becoming your child while he or she slowly melts away from life.You will enjoy this book if you are searching for information about caregiving, nursing home issues, medical bureaucracy and coping skills for baby boomers.

Now imagine if you would answering the phone expecting it to be your mother saying she's back home and all is well, but that's not what happened to Kathy's mother.From that moment on Kathy's life would change along with her siblings.

She also stresses the importance of making your personal wishes known to your family before they are thrown into a whirlwind of confusion should you suffer an unexpected medical emergency.Bosworth never succumbs to self-pity, yet she shares her heart and her pain in a way that makes the reader part of the journey.

I would highly recommend this book to anyone who is struggling with any kind of a disease. A stroke can come into any of our lives any minute on any given day. This book is about so much more than strokes."},{"Title":"Your Mother Has Suffered a Slight Stroke","review":"Talented author, Kathy Bosworth, has written a timely and informative book for all who have aging parents or know of other with aging family members or friends.

Your Mother has Suffered a Slight Stroke is a necessary and helpful read for everyone and the reader is sure to relate to Kathy and her family and their touching and poignant, true-life experiences.Evelyn Horan - AuthorJeannie, A Texas Frontier Girl, Books One-Four"},{"Title":"Your Mother Has Suffered a Slight Stroke","review":"A friend of mine insisted I read this book. My family has been dealing with strokes for a long time. Our family has been through so much of what Kathy Bosworth wrote in her book. I couldn't believe when I read that her mother's original diagnosis had been wrong. The very same thing happened to us. We had so much to learn about nursing homes, wills, living wills, doctors, and of course the different types of strokes. Kathy covers all this in her book. This is a book everyone needs to read before it happens in your family. Strokes can happen to anyone at anytime. If you are dealing with any type of serious medical problem I think this book would also be of benefit. Kathy is a gracious writer and I thank you for writing it and I am grateful to my friend for recommending it to me. It really did help me and I will recommend it every chance I get."},{"Title":"Your Mother Has Suffered a Slight Stroke","review":"Kathy Bosworth has written a fluent book that is surely a gift of wisdom for all of us readers. She relays her mother's story commencing with a routine test not requiring a ride to or from the hospital. During the test, her mother has a stroke. The hospital makes a call to the family, which ignites an emotional bungie jumping between confusion and fearful concern. In this incredible book, Kathy brings you full circle starting with the onset of the first stroke to life ending and new life beginning.Kathy describes with courageous honesty the basic and the complex of the \\"unknowns\\" that plague her and her brother. She gracefully paints a portrait of a family holding together, learning together, and confronting life changes together. This book is testament that one moment in time changes our lives forever.One of my especially liked sentences in this book is when Kathy's brother Ed says to her, \\"Kathy, you're not looking for more information on stokes, what you are looking for is someone with a crystal ball that will tell you what is going to happen\\". Kathy can't help but still search for someone - anyone that will tell her the hard sterile truth. Kathy braves observing her sweet mother become a person she didn't know and one who in return didn't know her. Every visit Kathy is not sure what she will see or hear. Will her mother be herself today or will she be a stranger? There are high points and very low points yet Kathy retains her sense of humor, her love, and her hunger for knowledge about this situation alive and kicking at all times. This is why this book is so indispensable. You learn with her and from her. Not only about the different types of strokes but also the following consequences such as physical therapy, no resuscitation bracelets, nursing homes, dealing with assets, the government, and of course all of the physical and mental changes. This information is absolutely a must for every professional dealing with strokes. I certainly hope people will be able to find this book in every library in every city.Kathy approaches her book with courageous honesty. I found \\"Your Mother has Suffered a Slight Stroke\\" a loving jewel of clarity into the living with and caring for a loved one who has had a stroke.Thank you, Kathy, for taking on such a difficult subject with such bravery and candor.Reviewed by Sherry Russell GMSAuthor of \\"Conquering the Mysteries and Lies of Grief"},{"Title":"Your Mother Has Suffered a Slight Stroke","review":"Kathy Bosworth has authored a daughter's love story in her book Your Mother Has Suffered a Slight Stroke.

Many 40 something folks opt not to hang around, but Bosworth saw her mother through the pain and suffering and endured whatever her mother dished out under the effects of her condition.Bosworth tells a tale of how she got through a very difficult period in her life with courage, dignity and love.

I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Your Mother Has Suffered a Slight Stroke","review":"This is a stunning book. It should be required reading for every medical professional. Doctors, nurses, and therapists, should have to read it twice, once in their first year of study and again before they graduate. I'm serious.And that is not to say that only medical professionals will benefit from reading this well-written book. Kathleen Bosworth tells her touching story from the lay person's point of view. From that first heart gripping moment when she gets the bad news about her mother's stroke by phone, to the last page, the author's personality shines through. Her outrage, quiet humor, and sense of decency make this book stand out in ways it never might have if a lesser writer had created it.Ms. Bosworth's mother had a stroke. That much can be gleaned from the title. From there the author takes each reader through a maze of doctors, nurses, and therapists who are less than helpful. Some are downright rude, or maybe ignorant. Her search for answers, and for professionals who have hearts as well as brains is detailed honestly. With the support of a loving, close-knit family, she struggles to find a constructive way of managing her mother's care.Kathleen Bosworth educates herself about treatment plans, possible outcomes, patients rights, living wills, and insurance coverage. With courage and determination, she and her brother fight the system to get their mother the loving care she needs and deserves. I recommend this book to everyone and repeat again: This is a stunning story."},{"Title":"More cruets only","review":"Just what I wanted!

Fast action, tense suspense and some poignant moments define this story and make it an enjoyable, though sometimes slightly far-fetched read. Sometimes the vernacular seems forced (many a gratuitous &quot;like&quot; despite otherwise immaculate syntax in oral speech makes for a clash in style), but other than that, McKenzie does a good job of writing; I was impressed by its page-turner qualities.Warning: Read the first two parts first! Both Rahab Link and Jordan Intercept contain references to the previous book(s) and may give away plot elements thereof.Rahab Link also deserves four stars."},{"Title":"OUR FATHER ABRAHAM","review":"Informative.

This one will stay in my library!"},{"Title":"OUR FATHER ABRAHAM","review":"I read the review of this book by Chris Albert Wells - someone who clearly has no idea what he's talking about. He makes comments about Abraham, Moses, and Aaron \\"clearly not being real people...\\" Really? And he supports this with what evidence? Then he goes on to talk about how the NT was written by a political 'splinter group'... and his evidence for this is where? This guy probably read an article in Reader's Digest and tries to come across as an authority on OT & NT scholarship. The Bible (both OT & NT) have a variety of genres and his comment about the Bible needing to be taken either 'with the enchantment of a child' is typical of individuals influenced by enlightenment philosophy, empiricism, existentialism, and postmodernism... anything that can't be 'proven' via the scientific method must therefore be dismissed. Unfortunately the scientific method has limitations - things that are unique or not observable and therefore non-reproducible or testable (the Trinity, the incarnation, a virgin birth, miracles, etc.) fall outside of their bounds and are subsequently dismissed. Rather than subjecting the universe to our seriously limited rationalism and understanding momentarily consider the possibility of the supernatural and miraculous in humility rather than with a condescending approach that relegates everything to absurd or 'child like' when it doesn't fit in a predetermined system."},{"Title":"OUR FATHER ABRAHAM","review":"Our Father Abraham is a must read for every person who belongs to Christ or claims Christendumb.

They have always been in excellent condition. I have to say that this is the first time, I was not totally satisfied. Although the book was in decent condition, it was not in the condition that I am normally use to with Amazon books. The cover was wrinkled from bending and some of the pages were still turned at the corners and not even fixed before it was shipped. I wish maybe having a picture of the book might be helpful although I realize that this is not practical. All the more the description needs to really apply to the book being purchased.I will give it one more chance before I stop buying used books. Just be leery of used products."},{"Title":"OUR FATHER ABRAHAM","review":"Maybe I went into this book with poor expectations, but I was disappointed on the content and how it was written. It read much more like a PhD thesis than a book. It was also highly one sided in it's opinions of the Church and Jewish people. I am sad to say I walked away with very little useful information."},{"Title":"OUR FATHER ABRAHAM","review":"I found the book to be good until I got the part that mentions that gentiles are NOT obligated to follow the commandments of YHVH. In essence it is saying that He has two standards. Not true. Multiple times in the Torah YHVH mentions that there is one law for the homeborn and the stranger that sojourns with them. He has only one standard for all mankind who choses to follow Him. The \\"noachide laws\\" are a way that man has come up with to try and get around the fact that we are to follow YHVH's commandments. Of course a good study is in order to decide if what I say is true or not. Nazerene Israel is the faith of the apostles throughout the book of Acts. Shouldn't it be ours too?Another false point that I found in this book is that they believe Yahshua died on a Friday instead of Wednesday. This is an interesting study for those who are serious about being seekers of the truth. The only sign Yahshua said He would give was 3 days and 3 nights. A Friday death and Sunday resurrection is 3 days by reckoning but only 2 nights, not 3. In this study you will find that He was killed on a Wednesday and rose right at the end of Sabbath (Saturday), see Mt 28:1, the seventh day not the first as is typically taught.I figure that if this book can't get Yahshua's name, death and resurrection, and the importance of one law and one standard for all correctly then there really is no point in anyone reading this book. It was written and caters to mainstream christianity and its dogma. The truth is out there. Seekers of the truth will find it. Yahshua meant this in Mt 7:14. Few will \\"FIND\\" it.Be blessed seekers."},{"Title":"OUR FATHER ABRAHAM","review":"When people stop by our website and ask us &quot;where do we start?

I've read Telushkin's book at least twice and it has changed my life completely on how I talk, act, and speak to people. After reading Wilson's book, my perspective on why Christians think the way we think (in our present day) and why Jews think the way they think has been changed completely.I want say thank you Marvin Wilson for all your hard work and effort in making a book has helped me and so many others see where we come from and why we think the way we do.

In a post-modern society where Christianity is being labeled a rip-off of Mithraism, Gnosticism, Egyptian paganism, and even Druidism, this book accurately shows how what we now call Christianity was seen as a fulfillment of Judaism. Wilson shows that it is Jewish through and through and that we Christians should be proud of it.I was blessed to have him as a teacher for Modern Jewish Culture at Gordon College; I learned more about Jewish-Christian relations in 4 months than I did in the prior 22 years of my life!"},{"Title":"OUR FATHER ABRAHAM","review":"This impressive work deals with the profound spiritual bond between Jews and Christians. The book is not only a biblical, historical and cultural study, but above all a call for Christians to search out and embrace their Hebrew roots in order to live a more fulfilling and rewarding life in a world that seems to become ever more unhinged on many levels. Terrorism is the greatest physical threat whilst spiritually the West is afflicted withnihilismin the form of moral relativism as well as narcissism and hedonism.Part One examines the Hebrew roots of Christianity, explaining what it means for Gentiles to be spiritual Israelites, grafted into and nourished by the original olive tree which is Israel. This section deals with the meaning of our Hebrewheritageand addresses certain problems like the terms Humanizing, Hellenism, The Law and the teachings of the Apostle Paul. The concept of a new spiritual family is very clearly explained here. This is the family of Abraham, a man known for Gevurah (courage, in rescuing his kinsman Lot and others from the Elamites) and Chesed (mercy, in pleading for the people of Sodom and Gomorrah).Part Two surveys Jewish-Christian relations through the last two millennia. The Jewish origins of the Church and the eventual separation of the two faiths are chronicled here, including how the loss of the Jewish connection led to strange dogmas and antisemitism in the Church and no doubt contributed to the division of Christianity into its bewildering variety of churches. It includes discussions of the first (AD 66 - 73) and second (132 - 135) Jewish revolts against Rome. Very few Christians seem to be aware of this tragic history; I highly recommendChristian Antisemitism: A History of Hateby William Nicholls with its intellectually honest approach.Part Three considers how vital the Old Testament and other early Jewish writings are for understanding the message of the New Testament. The three major areas in which the Church has abandoned its Jewish roots are identified and correctives provided in every case. This part includes fascinating insights into theHebrew language, the power of poetry, block logic and meditation. The extremely significant Part Four deals with the Jewish heritage and the Church under headings like Marriage and the Family, Passover and Last Supper, Study and Learning and Attitudes towards the Land of Israel today; this last subject is superbly examined by Paul Charles Merkley inChristian Attitudes Towards the State of Israel, a most illuminating book.The chapter titled Jews, Christians and the Land is of particular relevance in our time. This balanced approach to the issue includes discussions of biblical history, Zionism plus various Christian approaches to the State of Israel, but not as up-to-date as the aforementioned work by Merkley. The author rejects the idea that the Church has replaced Israel. On this matter, I considerFuture Israel: Why Christian Anti-Judaism Must Be Challengedby Barry Horner as the definitive work, scholarly but accessible for the non-theologian.Wilson is also cautious about a deterministic approach with its over-emphasis on eschatology. In his view, one's understanding of the right of the Jewish people to a secure homeland is based primarily on justice, morality and history. It is incumbent upon Christiansto support Israel, but without imposing their particular religious or political agenda upon Israelis. It is our duty to pray, to encourage and to work for a permanent and lasting peace. God is on the side of justice and mercy for all people.Part Five: Restoring Jewish Roots, suggests a number of ways in which Christians may reconnect to their Jewish heritage. This includes Jewish-Christian dialogue in a spirit of humility, continued study and personal growth, and social action. The author concludes this part by emphasizing that the greatest commandment is Love. Christians can certainly learn much about the Old Testament from Judaism, like the different levels of meaning in the text, the expressive power of the Hebrew language and the wealth of commentary accumulated over centuries.The interested reader might find the following books fascinating and illuminating:The Authentic Gospel of Jesusby Geza Vermes, Understanding the Difficult Words of Jesus by David Bivin, Yeshua: A Guide to the Real Jesus and the Original Church by Ron Moseley, Restoring the Jewishness of the Gospel: A Message for Christians by David Stern,God's Promise and the Future of Israelby Don Finto andWhy Care about Israel?by Sandra Teplinsky. Returning to one's Jewish roots can be spiritually nourishing, mentally healing and emotionally uplifting."},{"Title":"OUR FATHER ABRAHAM","review":"Excellent book - Dr. Wilson is a marvelous author who takes you through the history of the Church thru Hebraic eyes. I have never learned so much from one author. Churches need to get this book in the hands of their pastors who could use it for sermons and/or bible studies.

In his view, one's understanding of the right of the Jewish people to a secure homeland is based primarily on justice, morality and history. It is incumbent upon Christiansto support Israel, but without imposing their particular religious or political agenda upon Israelis. It is our duty to pray, to encourage and to work for a permanent and lasting peace. God is on the side of justice and mercy for all people.Part Five: Restoring Jewish Roots, suggests a number of ways in which Christians may reconnect to their Jewish heritage. This includes Jewish-Christian dialogue in a spirit of humility, continued study and personal growth, and social action. The author concludes this part by emphasizing that the greatest commandment is Love. Christians can certainly learn much about the Old Testament from Judaism, like the different levels of meaning in the text, the expressive power of the Hebrew language and the wealth of commentary accumulated over centuries.The interested reader might find the following books fascinating and illuminating:The Authentic Gospel of Jesusby Geza Vermes, Understanding the Difficult Words of Jesus by David Bivin, Yeshua: A Guide to the Real Jesus and the Original Church by Ron Moseley, Restoring the Jewishness of the Gospel: A Message for Christians by David Stern,God's Promise and the Future of Israelby Don Finto andWhy Care about Israel?by Sandra Teplinsky. Returning to one's Jewish roots can be spiritually nourishing, mentally healing and emotionally uplifting."},{"Title":"OUR FATHER ABRAHAM","review":"This is an excellent book.

We cannot fully understand the teachings of Jesus and our Bible without a through knowledge of Jewish history and culture. We worship a Jewish savior, who worshiped in a synagogue, honored and practiced Jewish rituals. We read from a Jewish book, our Bible written by Jewish men. To fully understand the symbolism in the Bible we must know something about Jewish religeous practices.Christianity is a branch attached to a tree that has its roots in Judaism This book is one of the best available for a deeper understanding of Jewish culture and religeon.

It really gives a great basic understanding of your Jewish Roots and it also makes for a GREAT bible study tool."},{"Title":"OUR FATHER ABRAHAM","review":"\\"Our Father Abraham\\" is an insightful piece of literature ; the topics discussed are thought provoking and truthful. It introduces the Christian world to a new way of perceiving the biblical texts and helps any truth seeker to find the right direction for real practical fulfillment in his or her life.But I have certain comments to make : the book may sound as if a believer in Christ from a Gentile background is indebted to an unbelieving Jew. It may give one the impression that biblical christianity is indebted to Apostate Judaism. It is true that we are to fear God and show our gratitude by preaching the Gospel to them and help Jews be restored back , by the mercy showed to us. But to encourage their lifestyle on the expense of the Gospel is to do them harm.In the book there is almost no difference in meaning made between \\"Jewish thought\\" and \\" Biblical thought\\". The Book also fought the departure of Christianity from its biblical roots , and this is true , but failed to realize that Rabbinic Judaism also departed from the faith of the Father Abraham who rejoiced to see the day of the Lord Jesus. If Christianity failed in Practical life , so did Rabbinic Judaism in essence.I have great respect to the many principles of Rabbinic Judaism drawn from the Blessed Word of God ( Old Testament) but I also believe that true biblical Christianity is able to go the second mile by making these principles come true in one's life; and make the principles enthroned in one's innermost part.If we are to learn anything from God-fearing Torah-loving Jews , we are to learn reverence , oneness in heart and mind and obedience to God ; but the solution to how these biblical principles are to be made real in one's life is only found in the Gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ ; not in endorsing any form of traditional Judaism.Simply saying that Biblical Christianity and Rabbinic Judaism are mere sisters with difference of opinions on CERTAIN issues is NOT accurate at all. The difference is one of essence ; the presence of Christianity in the picture denies Rabbinic Judaism its authority and this is a major differnce. If Christians follow Christ and Rabbinic Judaism denies Him ; I perceive with my humble mind that this is an existential difference.I personally do NOT advocate Replacement theology but I do not idealize and idiolize Judaism as it stood for the last 19 centuries. I understand the Author's sympathy with the many sufferings of the Jewish people , but this does not give us the right to endorse any unbelief on the expense of the fundamental truth of the Gospel which is Jew and Gentile as one in Christ.Any christian persectution to the Jews happened to contradict everything that is true about our faith and must be made up by preaching a purer Gospel free from racism , schism and self-seeking causes ; but again that doesn't make any christian embrace Judaism as a second way to God or another alternative. The corinthians , for example , did not donate earthly goods for the Zealots' cause in 1st century Jewish palestine(Israel) but ONLY to their ROOT the brothers of the churches in Judaea. It would be absurd today if Christians support any political establishment or any unmessianic causes in Israel , except for humanitarian purposes but in this case helping needy unbelieving Israelis is the same as helping needy unbelieving african children.Having a Hebrew biblical mindset is not equivalent to promoting Zionist and Present Jewish causes. Making up for years of misunderstanding of the Hebrew thoughts, motivating Rabbinic Judaism, is never equivalent to indulging in a 180 degrees endorsement of everything that is Jewish. The form of Godliness found in Jewish literatures is awesome but lacks the power of God for Salvation found Only in Christ . While Christianity has this knowledge of God's Power , it failed through dualism and Greek Philosophy to live up to God's expectations. Jewish elaboration on the Word of God has the description of a Godly life but the Church made of both fulfilled Jews and enlightened Gentiles have the methodology.Being ingrafted in the Rich Olive tree of the promises and heritage of the People of God of the Old testament requires much attention from all of us who seek to truly understand the mind of God in redemption , but to miss the point as to look up to what's fallen ( the branches to be grafted back and those that will never be grafted) due to unbelief instead of helping them being restored in the rich root is an insult to the Gospel of God. For this reason , no Christian is under any obligation to an unbelieving Jew EXCEPT love and the Gospel of Peace.We must take our bible seriously and change to be conformed to God's line of thought as revealed in the Bible in order to arrive not to a cultural conformity as much as to arrive to Spiritual maturity in heart and practice , because afterall heart and practice are two faces of the One Coin.The Book is a wonderful addition to your library. I congratulate Dr. Wilson for this wonderful piece. But caution must be taken in identifying the real good intentions of the Author that could be misunderstood. The goal is to have a biblical mindset which happens here to be Hebraic and Semitic , but this is only put to practice through a heart renewed by JESUS the MESSIAH ( Y'Shua Ha Mashiach)."},{"Title":"OUR FATHER ABRAHAM","review":"An incredible book for history buffs.

It covers so many historical events that the church would not dare mention today and helps to understand the absolute tension between Jew and Christians today. It answers foundational questions I had (like why we went from the Sabbath to the Lord's Day) and so many other things you would think every Christian would be taught early and often.At times I wanted to cry over the history and the things uncovered in this book (with plenty of references for further study). If some parts of your church experience made you kind of scratch your head because they were so out of line with the Old and even New Testament - this book is for you.But be cautioned - its not for a new believer. This is definitely a \\"meat\\" and not \\"milk\\" type of book and one must be strong in their faith. Not because it tries to take you away from Christianity (it doesn't at all) or try to bind you with legalism (again, it doesn't at all) its just reading about things like the intentional changing of names (people in the Bible, names of books in the Bible, etc.) that you don't want to start to chew on too early in your walk.A really really good book though, especially if you want a good historical basis for your Christian walk."},{"Title":"OUR FATHER ABRAHAM","review":"Marvin Wilson has truly written a Classic in the field of the Jewish Roots of Christianity.

When the non-believing Jews told Jesus their father was Abraham, he told them they were terribly mistaken. He said, \\"If your father was Abraham you would have recognized me.\\" Instead he told them their real father was the devil. Jesus certainly wasn't being an anti-Semite, he was a Semite, but he was telling them the truth. The notion that we worship the same God as non-Christian Jews is no different than the idea of embracing all religions as equal. Christians need to stop apologizing for Jesus and understand that what divides us is much greater than what unites us, because what divides us is God. Jay Bugg"},{"Title":"OUR FATHER ABRAHAM","review":"Christianity is a messiah-mediated religion that originated from Syria-Palestine. It is therefore normal that Christians be introduced to and show interest in the origins of Church beliefs, starting with the Old Testament. These OT stories can be approached on two levels: with the enchantment of childhood that tattoos young minds or with the later judgment adult maturity should display. The story then becomes a very different one because political parties wrote those religious texts aiming to support their own side of the game. In the background of the OT we find two opposing priesthoods within the same Abraham sensitivity that are competing for power, Jerusalem wanting to expand its influence over Israel. The best approach to an adult reading of the OT is \\"The Bible Unearthed\\" by Finkelstein and Silberman. The main biblical actors, Abraham, Moses and Aaron represented original tendencies and Institutions rather than real historical men.The same restrictions apply to the NT, composed by a Jewish splinter group opposed to certain Temple teachings and competing to administer the eternity creed that was becoming a very promising deal during the first century before and after the CE. The only book that really makes sense out of the NT, showing how the internal conflicts were recorded within messianic communities is still to be published.Greco-Romans were the first to bite on Paul's bait and hauling in the Gospels, progressively developed their own supernatural myths with a divine Christ bringing the beliefs closer to the Hellenistic supernatural. Christianity moved away from the original nest and there is no reason to go back to the early schism where tradition abiding Messianic Jews considered that if the God-fearers want to benefit from eternal life, they should first become Jews. This is the domain where religious propaganda still exercises its political wit, forgetting that initially, the main stream of Judaism was more than highly critical towards the messianic hooligans who rejected the Temple establishment."},{"Title":"OUR FATHER ABRAHAM","review":"Why is your faith dimming?

Neet"},{"Title":"OUR FATHER ABRAHAM","review":"We have over 80 Christian denominations and the division is continuing to grow as each denomination fights over who is right on minor issues which all relate to how they interpret the bible. After centuries and centuries of anti-Semitism and an underlying belief weaving itself into the churches theology that the church has replaced Israel, this I personally find to be a very needed study to begin a new journey to a more authentic faith. The Bible was written \\"for\\" us but not \\"to\\" us so if we want to apply proper hermeneutics to our own study of the Scriptures, it becomes critical to understand each of the letters written from the cultural and contextual worldview of the people they were written to. I can't undersand my family's letters between those in Ireland and the US without help explaining what many of the references are speaking of things both the writer and reader are already familiar with and need no explanation. How much less can I approach an ancient eastern \\"Jewish\\" book written by many authors over a 1600 year period in a modern, western and heavily Greek influenced culture? Even the Book of Revelation when understood in its cultural context of Asia Minor under the rule of Emperor Domitian and his games with a Hebraic lens on, begins to all come full circle. Then if I understand what the colored horses in Revelation meant to the readers familiar with the Domitian games keeping all interpretation in line with the Hebrew scriptures, I can understand the application for their day and far more easily determine the application for my day. However, I can't \\"first\\" understand the application for their day, how can I rightly understand them for my own? In the end, I can honestly even feel the temptation in my own sin and flesh to want to divide over how we approach and studying the scriptures. So for those who don't approve of my approach....well, that is why I need Jesus...this side of Heaven, I just don't know how to love like He loved!

It reveals the identity of the early church, which of course was Jewish. It then tells of how Israel was conquered and the Hebraic church fell apart. Once Christianity was in the hands of western society(i.e. Constantine), it drastically changed. The author shows us the evolution of the church to what we now know as Christianity.

I grew up in church but was never taught the full truth. God bless people like Marvin Wilson, who have compiled very readable, historical, and theologically accurate information. Simply said, if you are a \\"Christian\\" of any denomination and any theological level (Pastors included) but have not discovered the truth about the Hebrew roots of the Christian faith, you cannot worship God in spirit or in truth. This book, among others, is crucial to any valid and deep understanding of the Christian faith and beginnings.Pastors, not only should this book be on your office desk at all times for reference in sermon preparation, you must view and show the accompanying video to this book; \\"Jews and Christians - A Journey of Faith.\\"It is time for the entire Christian culture to repent of the evils committed in the name of God and \\"Replacement Theology\\" (or supercessionism - the Jews lost their covenant and Christianity is the \\"New Israel\\"). After reading Wilson's book your spiritual life will grow in ways you never dreamed. You will begin an inevitable moral conversion that will enable the relationship with God and others that Jesus (and Paul) actually intended.Without reconnecting to \\"the root that supports you,\\" or Israel and the Judaism of Jesus, Christianity is only a \\"cut flower in the garden\\" (Krister Stendahl); no root, no life. Again, Pastors, graduating from Seminary did not complete your education at all. Your spiritual leadership is at best inadequate, if not outright ignorantly destructive, if you do not open yourselves to this essential and hermeneutically sound information. Start your reconnection to the true roots of a valid faith with this book as your moral and theological compass."},{"Title":"OUR FATHER ABRAHAM","review":"This excellent, Scripturally based study is written with compassion and authority and reveals how the roots of Christianity run deep into &quot;Hebrew soil&quot;, showing the Hebrew heritage of the Christian Church to be rich and extensive.The book describes at the outset how this heritage has been largely unexplored/ignored by Christian seminaries, colleges and other educational institutions.Through a Biblical, historical and cultural study, the book examines what our &quot;predecessors&quot; in the Judeo-Christian faith have delivered to the Church of today. The opening chapters of this work provide a historical perspective on the Jewish origin of the Church with the book going to great lengths to emphasise the fundamental truths that &quot;Jesus Christ Himself was a Jew&quot; and that the Bible declares &quot;Salvation is of the Jews&quot; (John 4;24).This work tells us that as far as the Gospel record is concerned, Jesus spoke from &quot;within Judaism&quot; and never abandoned His &quot;ancestral faith&quot;. The book also describes how a prime facet of Old Testament/Jewish thought was the promise and fulfilment of Biblical prophecy in relation to the coming Messiah. Something which the earliest Christians, themselves Jews, found resolved in the person of Jesus Christ. The book educates the reader regarding how this Jewishness affects our understanding of the teachings of Christ.The book also proceeds to study the centuries of &quot;de-Judaization&quot; that followed the early Church, plus a study of the negative consequences resulting from the Church being &quot;severed&quot; from it's Jewish roots. The correct Scriptural interpretation of the Church being &quot;grafted in&quot; to it's Jewish roots is explained in some detail. The doctrine of &quot;Replacement Theology&quot; is also examined, wherein the Church is cited as being the &quot;new Israel&quot; and usurping the Biblical promises pertaining to the Jewish people and nation. A process that is described as developing from what was initially the de-Judaization of the Church into the concept of anti-Semitism itself. All these issues are commendably discussed in the contents of this book in their appropriate context with Scriptural references readily provided.Other sections of this study include a section devoted to understanding &quot;Hebrew thought&quot; plus an analysis of the Church &amp; theological conflict.The book also investigates the Judaeo-Christian heritage to the Holy Land and recognises that Judaism is so embedded in it's relationship to the Land that it is utterly inseparable from it. Jerusalem itself is also examined in a similar context and outlines that Jesus was born into a Jewish family near Jerusalem (Bethlehem, Judea), He later taught there, died there, rose from the dead there, ascended to Heaven from there and said that He would physically return there. (Readers should be aware that whilst the book makes some reference to the present day situation in the Holy Land, it does not delve into the complexities and the political quagmire of the current situation. Indeed, that was never the purpose for this study.)This is an extremely comprehensive, readable and informative study on the Jewish roots of Christianity to which the latter is permanently indebted &amp; a &quot;must read&quot; for anyone wishing to obtain a Hebraic perspective on the New Testament. For those interested in this subject I would also respectfully recommend &quot;Jewish Roots; A Foundation Of Biblical Theology&quot; by Dan Juster. Thank you for your time."},{"Title":"OUR FATHER ABRAHAM","review":"This is a stunning achievement and a life changing book! Wilson calls Christians to examine their Hebrew roots. Once you discover the roots of Christianity run deep into Hebrew soil you will never view the Bible the same way.Abraham is father of us all, as Paul wrote to the Romans (Rom. 4:16). He is father of believing Jews, and he is father of believing Gentiles (Rom. 4:11, 12). So if we belong to Christ, we are Abraham's seed (Gal. 3:29). We have that wonderful Abrahamic connection.To many Christians are surprised Christian's roots are in Judaism. Wilson excellent balanced work gives an information in all areas of Jewish culture and what it means to us today. The book is broken down into five parts. They are:1. A New People: Abraham's Spiritual Children2. The Church and Synagogue in the Light of History3. Understanding Hebrew Thought4. Jewish Heritage and the Church: Selected Studies5. Toward Restoring Jewish RootsEach packed chapter includes sub points that will enhance your study and understanding of the Bible.

Before this class, I had been fascinated with Judaism, but I had never fully comprehended just how important it is for me to be fully aware of my own Jewish roots.Frankly speaking, we Christians DO owe everything to, as one reviewer termed it, the \\"unbelieving\\" or \\"apostate\\" Jew. Those terms are very disturbing to me, since they reflect the very thinking that has allowed the division between Judaism and Christianity to continue for so long. On a more distressing level, they are the very thoughts that kept Christians silent during the horrors of the second World War.When Christians approach Jews -- and vice-versa, when Jews approach Christians -- with an accusatory and negative spirit (\\"you're the ones who DON'T believe in [fill in the blank]\\"), no progress can be made in restoring our relationship. For those of us who consider ourselves Christians, it is only when we respond to each other with genuine care and a complete lack of judgment that any progress can be made. When Christians approach Jews with gratitude -- yes, gratitude -- we can begin to understand each other.If you haven't read this book, you may be wondering why Christians should be so concerned with restoring our relationship with Judaism. For a full answer, you'll have to read Our Father Abraham, but I'll give a few reasons right now.For one, Jesus (Rabbi Yeshua ben Yoseph) was an observant Jew, and although He challenged the Jewish thinkers of His day, He remained a Jew until his death, and will remain so beyond the end of time. The very act of theological argument is itself a very Jewish act; extreme importance is placed on midrash (study) and on remaining aware of the reasons behind every tenet of Jewish theology. Furthermore, while it is true that many Jews have not accepted Jesus' messiahship, that is NOT reason for anyone to believe that they have lost their distinction as a \\"Chosen Race\\" and \\"Holy Priesthood\\". The Lord, quite simply, does not go back on His word. The promises and covenants we read about in the Torah still continue to this very day. And as for the question of Messiah, it is little wonder that Jews have not accepted Jesus' claims as such, given the way His followers have treated them for millennia. In the words of many Jews, if following Jesus can allow for anti-Semitism and intolerance, they want no part of Him. For Christians, it is our task to \\"provoke the Jew to jealousy\\" by bearing witness to the joy of following Rabbi Yeshua, and historically we have done a terrible job of filling that role.It is not Christians' task to convert Jews, since the very definition of conversion requires turning on one religion and way of life in order to fully embrace another. Quite frankly, Judaism and Christianity are not two separate religions, and even the Apostle Paul himself never \\"converted\\". (Be slow to accept any Biblical headings that suggest that he did; bold-faced paragraph headings placed by our friends at Zondervan, remember, are NOT inspired text.) Instead, Paul accepted the \\"fullest flowering\\" of his Judaism, and remained a Jew until the end of his life. In light of this model, it is the task of the Christian to love the Jewish people, and to be grateful to them for the gift of our religion and our Jewish Messiah. It is the task of the Christian to thoughtfully appeal to the intellect of the Jew by offering, without judgment, the secret for our joy. Finally, it is the task of the Christian to examine his own life for the cracks where anti-Semitism can creep in. It is easier than one might think......and it is precisely the reason why you owe it to yourself to read this book. I pray that you have found this review helpful and thought-provoking."},{"Title":"OUR FATHER ABRAHAM","review":"I'm on my fourth copy because I keep giving them away. Wilson writes clear and easy to understand. Packed with information on our Hebrew roots and a must have for every Messianic or Christian believer. I never did read it from cover to cover but I devoured chapters in the order of my interest. I especially enjoyed the education and family culture of the Hebrews.Wilson presents the truth in BALANCE!"},{"Title":"OUR FATHER ABRAHAM","review":"I have purchased 20 of these books and given them to friends. The search for Christians to reach out and understand their Jewish roots is vital for the correction or misapplication of some of our beliefs. This book points toward a more powerful and insightful lifestyle, and brings understanding to a much needed area."},{"Title":"OUR FATHER ABRAHAM","review":"What best review can I give for a book that just changed my whole life? I think the best I can do is to honestly warn other readers about this power: \\"Watch out! This book will change your life!\\" But this will only happen if you read it honestly, with a true desire to acknowledge the title: \\"Our Father Abraham\\". Dr. Marvin Wilson, simply and powerfully, explains what Christians have lost since departing from the Jews. And, of course, what Jews might benefit from the Christian experience. Have you ever watched \\"A Fiddler on The Roof\\"? Well, I hadn't, until I read this book. Now it's one of my favorite movies, because I know what's behind it! In short, if you really want to understand the Hebraic roots of your faith, don't start anywhere else. Buy it right now! And recommend it to as many of your dears as possible. But warn them: \\"Watch out! This book will change your life!\\""},{"Title":"Lythande (Daw science fiction)","review":"This volume contains all the Lythande stories written up to its publication; two more can be found in SPELL SINGERS, an anthology attributed to \\"Alan Bard Newcomer\\", but not here. Lythande also appeared as a supporting character in stories written by other authors in Thieves' World; those collected in this volume feature the Adept as protagonist.Lythande is a mercenary magician; specifically, a Pilgrim Adept of the Order of the Blue Star. The Pilgrim Adepts are sworn to fight in the last battle, on the side of Law against Chaos, at the end of the world. Until that day, they wander, gathering knowledge and power as they will (hence 'Pilgrim' Adepts). The power of a Pilgrim Adept depends on keeping certain vows (e.g. never to eat or drink in front of men), but most of all, upon keeping a secret, specific to each adept. If that secret is ever spoken aloud by any man save the Master of the Star, it (and the magic bound into it) become void, so that the powerless adept becomes worthless to the order - and may be killed by anyone who pleases.Lythande has chosen to uphold Law against Chaos always, but others have chosen to wait until the last day. The Adept was developed for the Thieves' World series, and is a special crony of Myrtis (the madam of the Aphrodisia House in Sanctuary). The vows of an Adept are extremely literal, so that Adepts can have *female* confidantes if they wish - and if they can find women to trust with their lives.Check out the Magic in Ithkar series as well; Lythande has visited the fair occasionally.\\"The Secret of the Blue Star\\" - Lythande comes to the rescue of an amazingly beautiful prostitute being roughed up in the street - only to find that Bercy's tormentor is Rabben the Half-Handed, the Adept's worst enemy in the order. But is the girl really a victim, or a spy set to ferret out the Secret - or both?\\"The Incompetent Magician\\" - First appeared in the _Greyhaven_ anthology. Rastafyre the - ahem - Incomparable has lost his wand, to a master thief and magician he cuckolded. Lythande agrees to retrieve it, in exchange for an enchanted lute - to which is bound the soul of Koira, a woman Lythande once loved.\\"Sea Wrack\\" - The seaside village has to rely on half-grown girls to work the fishing boats, because a mermaid has taken up residence nearby, and lures not only men, but grown women to their deaths (only those too young to have felt the tides of the heart are safe). Lythande, feeling secure in having cast off all such emotions, takes up the village's plea to deal with the mermaid...\\"Somebody Else's Magic\\" - Lythande comes to the aid of a priestess of Larith, set upon by thugs in the street. Dying, the Laritha passes on her sword to Lythande in thanks. Unfortunately, the sword has a mind of its own: to avenge its bearer, then force Lythande to carry it back to the Temple - which only women may seek and return alive.\\"The Wandering Lute\\" - As a younger son, the minstrel had gladly accepted the enchanted lute from his father's magician, with its compulsion to follow a migration as regular as the seasons. Now that his older brother has died, though, he must be free of it and return home. Lythande, who'd like a good lute (and who studied a LOT about unbinding spells after the Larith incident) takes it on, intending to disenchant it along the way. Pride goeth before a fall...\\"Looking for Satan\\" - Satan is actually just the name of a wild youngster, caught in a trap and vanished into the empire of Sanctuary. His friends have come looking for him, and Lythande feels moved to help them. (This story, unlike the others, doesn't follow Lythande's viewpoint, but one of Satan's friends, a woman after Lythande's own heart.)"},{"Title":"Lythande (Daw science fiction)","review":"Lythande is a series of stories written by Bradley both for and under the inspiration of the Thieves World series. The mysterious magician Lythande was created as one of the sorcerers in the original Thieves World cast of characters. She is a mysterious entity, committed to the cause of order and doomed to never reveal her identity as a woman.Essentially, Bradley only contributed to the first volume of Thieves World, but the Lythande character lived on after that introduction. This volume contains not only the story from Volume 1 but also contains stories pubished elsewhere as stand alone fantasy stories. The last short story in the collection, \\"Satan\\", is actually written by Vonda N. Mcintyre for Thieves World and uses the Lythande character.For established MZB fans, the forewords she wrote for each story are almost as good to read as the stories themselves. These are almost little essays that explain the evolution of Lythande and summarize Bradley's thinking on issues as diverse as feminism, mediocrity and humor.If you are a fan of Thieves World, but are not familiar with Bradley, these stories should serve as a good introduction to her work. If you have read neither Thieves World nor any other Bradley, then I would begin elsewhere-- either with Volume 1 or with the Darkover series, respectively. These are enjoyable stories, but they do not really compare to the major body of work associated with either source."},{"Title":"Lythande (Daw science fiction)","review":"i will always cherish this book, which i discovered in canberra. mzbradley had created an unforgettable sorcerer. i wish she could have written more books on the sorcerer's journeys before she passed away. mz's death is a great loss to both the science fiction and fantasy worlds. i strongly recommend this book. read it, feel the magic and remember marion zimmer bradley...forever.."},{"Title":"Lythande (Daw science fiction)","review":"I read this book b/c I had read about the character in a short story.

A description of a child with attachment difficulties \\"rebirthing\\" himself?? The talk about \\"container moms\\" who must take everything- including being urinated upon in order to let a child know that she identifies with a child past and can take it?I am not sure the guidance and examples provided here are healthy for the parent, even if, by some strange miracle, they are healthy for the child.As a foster/adoptive mom of two healthy, fabulous children, I am shocked at the author's view that such parents must go to such lengths to help children and form healthy attachments. It seems irresponsible for the author to suggest that complete humiliation and prostration by a parent would be helpful to children with fragile attachments, when such children need healthy role models."},{"Title":"The Delicate Ape","review":"Written in 1944, this book gives a reader of the 21st century a sense of the post war period while being immerced in a page-turning thriller.

They provide not only definitions and summaries, but analysis as well.I found they did an especially good job of breaking down the first 3 chapters that is so filled with technical language that students often become lost and disinterested in an otherwise wonderful book about the human condition.I have found more and more of my students that use these books perform better on my tests, and have deeper and more meaningful papers than those that don't.

This book is one. I could not force myself to finish this book, no matter how hungry I was for a book. To me the characters are tedious, the plot is bland, and the entire book is predictable. Of course, I had read a book previous to this one that was similar, but with vibrant characters and a great, funny, sweet plotline. If you want this book done right and without divine intervention, read Bet Me by Jennifer Crusie. You won't regret it."},{"Title":"Menaced Assassin","review":"I should state outfront that I am a Joe Gores fan, and that I served as a technical advisor on this book and was given a small, almost unnoticed walk-on. The book takes on two really tough tasks: It is written in two voices, a first for Gores; and it takes on a philosophical theme and tries to interweave it with a mystery story.As much as I like Gores' work, I don't think he quite succeeded, here, although even the partial failure is a very good read, and one does care who-dun-it. He writes good characters and his setting in San Francisco is evocative. Those not familiar with his work might do better to begin with 32 Cadillacs or one of the DKA series, then read Wolf Time before taking on Menaced Assasin."},{"Title":"Menaced Assassin","review":"I chose this author Joe Gores, because his books are interesting and do not have lude remarks or many ugly words."},{"Title":"Menaced Assassin","review":"Menaced Assissin is an interesting book of murder &amp; revenge. However, it is filled with a disertation of evolutionary theories throughout which could have been condensed.

The reading was also stilted and difficult to read at times. However, it was an interesting story with graphic descriptions of the killings, which kept me interested in knowing who the killer was."},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"Seriously, this book is just convoluted and boring.

Thus, it doesn't make any sense to think that a novel like this one is really any better than say, Michael Crichton or Stephen King. Aesthetic standards can't be grounded.Thus, don't listen to anyone who tries to distinguish between &quot;serious&quot; works of literature like this one and allegedly &quot;lesser&quot; novels. The distinction is entirely illusory, because no novels are &quot;better&quot; than any others, and the concept of a &quot;great novel&quot; is an intellectual hoax."},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"There is one principle reason that Emma is remembered. It was written by a woman. If Jane Austen had been a man, her works would be regarded as banal and inconsequential works of little literary merit. The work is impressive considering that Austen came from a culture that repressed women (a characteristic that most female authors share), but beyond that it is a poor work.There is a profusion of works of greater literary merit by women than what Austen offers, Mary Shelly's &quot;Frankenstein&quot;, Kate Chopin's &quot;The Awakening&quot;, Alice Walker's &quot;The Color Purple&quot;, &quot;Nectar in a Seive&quot; by Kamala Markandaya, or a very fine piece &quot;Their Eyes Were Watching God&quot; by Zora Neale Hurston. All of these works have better characteristics than &quot;Emma&quot;, and prove to be superior to all of Austen's writings.Trust me, &quot;Emma&quot; is a waste."},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"Having been forced to read &quot;Emma&quot; for an English Literature course, I feel that I know as much about it as anyone else, if not more so. &quot;Emma&quot; is nothing more than a trashy romance, like the rest of Jane Austen's novels. We all know more or less what is going to happen at the end of the book - of course the hero and heroine are going to fall in love. Austen's use of irony is not exemplary either - is there anyone who didn't realise that Frank Churchill was hiding something, if we weren't sure quite what? Anyone who describes an Austen novel as a &quot;classic&quot;, particualy this one, needs their head examined. She is an olden days Jackie Collins, whose fancy language seems to have deluded some into believing that she is something which she certianly is not."},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"Well, Jane Austen was not a Charles Dickens. This work lacks the superb construction of Charles Dickens' novels. The images are there, but Austen does not put you there the way Dickens can. Also Austen's work does drag at times even though it is only about half the length of Dickens' full length books. But aside from that, it is a pretty good novel. The book is pleasantly funny with some touching moments. Emma herself is well drawn as a young woman who thinks she knows what is best for everyone, and later learns that sometimes it is best to let people make their own decisions. In all honesty, this is not uncommon at all. I find it very interesting that the recent movie &quot;Clueless&quot; was able to portray this story in a modern day setting. (The names were all changed, but anyone who read &quot;Emma&quot; could tell the movie was based on it.) Mr Knightley is memorable as the embodiement of reason. Harriet is fine as the poor girl caught in the middle. If you like this book, I suggest the movie with Kate Beckingsale as Emma."},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"Emma was a very well written book in the Victorian era.

For the price, I was very pleased."},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"It seems as though there is a law that every edition of one of Jane Austen's books must be published with a painting of a formal lady or ladies on the cover. In the case of Emma, such a painting is, perhaps, most appropriate. Emma, unsurprisingly, tells the story of a young woman named Emma. She is, as we are quickly told, spoiled and head-strong. And, as is always the case in Ms. Austen's heroines, young and unmarried.Emma has recently lost her sister/mother-figure to marriage and appears doomed to a lifetime of seclusion with her kindly, but odd and hermited father. To avoid such a result, at least for a time, Emma sets to matchmaking. She finds a neighborhood girl with only limited prospects and attempts to launch her into the stratosphere of an advantageous marriage. Irony abounds.This novel reads much like Jane Austen's other materials. The text is dense, but witty and, at times, quite funny. The action, such as it is, is slow paced and revolves around the joining together of various singles into couples. The themes are, as is often said of Austen, private. The manners, speech and attitudes are largely dated.I do not consider myself a great Jane Austen fan, but there is no doubting her greatness in crafting this novel. The characters are as lifelike as ever an author has produced. The plotting is intricate. Indeed, only a second or third reading reveals the many hints and suggestions laid before the unknowing reader on his first journey through the book. The text absolutely sparkles with wit - there are, in fact, moments where one might laugh out loud. This is without reservation a book that any reader would do well to peruse and study.That said, I find it difficult to overlook the attitudes of an earlier age and that impacts my enjoyment of the book. The casual tyranny of Jane Austen's protagonists is jarring to the modern eye. Indeed, much of Jane Austen's value system is repugnant to me. Of course, one tries to read the book with respect to the time at which it was written. In doing so, one finds a beautifully written book about a delightful set of characters who comedically come together. Ghastly prejudice, however, is very close to the surface, particularly in this book of Austen's."},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"Nothing struck me more about this book than its pre-occupation with class boundaries, dwarfing even its other principal obsession - the question of matrimony.Coming from a society often criticized for its rigid caste hierarchy, I cannot help wondering whether comparisons of social equations in India and England in the 18th century would yield many remarkable differences. Emma's disregard for the &quot;insignificant&quot; classes would do the most caste-conscious Brahmin proud.One of the questions that stems from a first reading is the position of Ms. Austen herself. Emma's character is obviously intended to come across as more than moderately conceited. Is the opinion she, and other characters imbued with the darker shades of gray, hold, of the importance of nobility and high birth, intended to reflect the authoress' own disapproval of the social rigidity of pre-Victorian England...or is it merely the use of an existing social situation as a tool to bring into focus, the underlying moral theme of the ills of conceit and indiscretion?Either way, it is a little disappointing to note the apparent indifference which marks the book's attitude towards the same class distinctions which it so effectively delineates. It would have been considerably more interesting for instance, if Ms. Austen's sparkling prose could have been employed to contrast the characters and social circumstances of Emma and Jane Fairfax, who is superior to the eponymous protagonist in merit but inferior in social standing, instead of restricting her role to a supporting one."},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"I thought Emma was a deligtful book with a great ending i knew it would end that way but it was fun to read and jane austen is now my hero."},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"This was the second of Austen's books I had read, The first being 'Pride and Prejudice'.

Even if you read slowly your time will never regret it!"},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"I would classify this book as my favorite out of all the Jane Austen novels. It makes me cry everytime I finish it, because of The beautiful artwork of Austen's writing. Making all of Emma's mistakes seem so real, and her triphums seems as though they are your's. I see such a realism that only Austen seems to have mastered in her characters. Thought it always finishes with a happy ending, it gives hope that even as clueless (not meant to be a pun) as Emma is and how many stupid mistakes she made her efforts are rewarded with all of her matchmaking adventures coming to an end and everyone who was caught in the confusing love web being freed."},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"Marvelous! Incredible! Amazing! Wonderful! That about sums it up right there. It was a great book. I t kept you in on going suspense on who was going to marry who. It tied up all the ends and it made you want to leap for joy at how happy things turned out. I definitely would give this book to you if you asked me &quot;What is the best book on earth.&quot;"},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"Emma is basically a darling snob. She has a kind, loving heart, and really wants to do good, but makes a tangle of everybody's lives, including her own. I'm sick of flawless, shallow, empty heroines, so Emma's faults and conquering of faults endear her. The unabridged book is slightly complicated (such as old-fashioned language) but if you savor it slowly it is well worth it. The plot is clever, sweet, funny and leaves a satisfied, warm kind of glow in the pit of your stomach. The perfect ending makes you want to cry. Don't spoil THIS novel with any trashy sequels.TRY WATCHING the Gwyneth Paltrow and Jeremy Northam &quot;Emma.&quot;"},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"I have always loved this droll piece of literature! Jane Austen created a charming and hilarious heroine in Emma. The comic timing and great characterization proves that Austen was -- and still is -- the most sought-after and influential author ever! (Just look at the work of Helen Fielding, Marian Keyes and other female authors of this era.)Emma is a force to be reckoned with. She takes it upon herself to play the role of Cupid. She chooses her candidates according to social status, age, charm, etc. The irony, of course, is that Emma doesn't have a lover of her own. What happens when one of her conquests as Cupid goes terribly wrong? And will Emma find her own knight of shining armor? This is one of the funniest situations in the book.If you love Jane Austen, and if you haven't read this novel, please do!"},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"An intellectually stimulating piece of literature, which challenges one's beliefs and enlightens one's mind with inventive theories concerning life-- if this is the type of commentary that peaks your fancy than I would not recommend reading Jane Austen's Emma. Indeed, the book is a coming-of-age story illustrating the comical mishaps of Emma Woodhouse, the novel's heroine, who takes destiny into her own hands. Particularly, she makes it her purpose to find suitable mates for her close acquaintances. As one might imagine, at times this creates a slightly awkward situation for the parties involved. Therefore, readers are introduced to a strong set of supporting characters inhabiting the small commonwealth of Highbury.Undoubtedly there is one amongst the bunch that the reader is able to identify with. For instance, Mr. Woodhouse, the town hypochondriac, who fears any situation which could spark the onset of illness; therefore, he virtually never leaves the comfortable confines of his home. In addition, Miss Bates and Mrs. Elton, the village gossips, who make it their business to learn all the comings and goings of the townsfolk. Besides the previously mentioned characters, there are a host of others who take you into their hearts and homes within the pages of the Jane Austen's novel.In fact her strong characterizations were perhaps the most compelling factors that kept me turning the pages. Indeed, Emma lacks the complex nature of many other novels written today. It is, however, a timeless example of the dynamics of human interaction. Yet the book's strongest claim to attract readers is a carefree amusement ending with a happily ever after."},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"How could Jane Austen have thought that the character of Emma would please no one but the author?I was charmed to enter Emma's world, amused by her wit, stunned by her complacency, sympathetic when she made her mistakes. I finished the book with a real affection for this character, drawn so finely and so lovingly by a truly masterful writer.I had seen the movie version starring Gywneth Paltrow before reading the book. I expected to read the entire book with Paltrow's raspy laugh and swanlike neck in mind. Yet Austen transported me away from my cinematic preconceptions. There is so much more to &quot;Emma&quot; than a movie can capture: the incisive social commentary, the near perfect grasp of human nature, which hasn't changed much since Austen's time, in all its ugliness and sublimity.There has been much discussion over why Austen remains so popular with readers today. After all, her characters are geographically and socially isolated, immensely concerned with money, and (with a few exceptions) have no discernible occupations other than hunting for mates. It is hard to find similarities between these lives and those of modern Americans. What Austen does so well is to depict her particular place and time with astonishing clarity. Through Austen's (and Emma's) eyes, we see the commonalties that exist among all people, no matter the time or place."},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"&quot;Emma&quot; is definitely Jane Austen's best and most humorous book. The quirky characters, comic faux pas, and Emma's adventures in matchmaking keep you very entertained. Although it's funny, the vocabulary can be challenging.

Big mistake. Stevenson's reading is energetic, precise, and diverse. As a very accomplished actress, she skillfully conveys a different and appropriate voice for each of the many characters. She easily glides from the whining Mr. Woodhouse to the pining Harriet Smith; from the jabbering Miss Bates to the judicious Mr. Knightley.I selected this audio volume of Emma because the box clearly states that the reading is _unabridged_. Naxos has published unabridged all six of Jane Austen's novels, and all are read by Juliet Stevenson except Pride and Prejudice, which is read by Emilia Fox, the actress who portrayed Georgiana Darcy in the 1995 BBC adaptation of Pride and Prejudice. We who love reading these treasures by Jane Austen are, therefore, in very good hands when listening to these unabridged audio versions."},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"Yet another charming & beautifully published book.

Book arrived as described (brand new, perfect condition)"},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"I can't remember the last book I disliked as much as I dislike Emma. GoodReads informs me that I have been struggling through this book since the middle of October, but in actuality this book has been haunting me for at least ten years. I bought it sometime before I went to boarding school. Though I remember starting it several times, I never made it past page 30. As I vociferously complained about this book as I was reading it this time, both M and my mother asked me why I was reading it if I disliked it so much. I didn't really have a good answer at the time, but now I know. Leaving this book unread for so long was haunting me. I really don't like leaving things undone, and I wanted to challenge myself as a reader. As an apprentice-writer, you are supposed to read as much as you can. If left solely to my own devices, I would mostly read YA, so Classics and Modern, Adult Lit are good for me.Usually, I like reading about Austen's heroines. I enjoyed Pride and Prejudice. Northanger Abbey was a fun read. But Emma Woodhouse makes me want to hit people. Okay, mostly I just want to hit her. So what were my issues?In Northanger Abbey, the heroine is also fairly naive and kind of creates the problems in her life. But you know what? She feels badly about it! And she learns! Emma's excessively high opinion of herself pissed me off beyond belief, and though she feels bad for a minute or two, in another 30 pages she'll be doing exactly whatever it was that got her into trouble last time. In fact, I don't think she focuses too much on starting the rumor about Jane Fairfax being in love with a married man. If she even thinks about it, it wasn't for very long. In fact, she focuses more on making a catty comment to Jane's aunt (whose ridiculously chatty dialog is *painful* to read), and that's primarily just because Knightly chastises her for it.Which brings me to my other issue: Knightly. Not a super-hot Austen heroine, in my opinion. Call me a crazy modern woman, but patronizing guys just aren't attractive to me. Now, I think he's perfect for Emma, who continues to act exactly like a spoiled child/Mean Girl, but I couldn't get 100% behind a relationship predominately based on him trying to fix her and get her to grow up. Maybe I'm missing something, and I'd love to see your thoughts or defenses of the book in comments. But really I'm just glad I accomplished that. Hopefully my other 10+ year book that is haunting me, The Phantom of the Opera, won't be as painful.Rating: 2 stars-- At least I will never have to start this book again."},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"Jane Austen has a lot of fans. I am one of them. My wife is another. People have been arguing the merits of Austen's novels for quite a number of years now; some people love her work, others do not. This is as it should be. We can take this premise of love/hate Austen a step further though. It has been my experience over the years that there is conflict even among those who love this writer's work and that everyone seems to have their favorite novel. This is also only right.The problem is though that I have found people who read Jane Austen are also a very opinionated lot and quite often harsh words are spoken when discussing the strengths, merits, flaws, dislikes, etc. of Austen's various works. Alas, I have to report to you that this is the case in our household; a normally peaceful place filled with tranquility and marital bliss...about 49 years of it...thank you very much!Yes, we are a family torn asunder. My wife (silly girl) feels that Emma is Austen's best work, while I, who am far more knowledgeable of such matters, prefer her novel, Pride and Prejudice...of which I am sure most of you will agree....me, not her, i.e. my mistaken wife. (Emma, bless her heart, is such an aggravating little twit).Anyway, this is really not a review of Emma, the work (I will admit that it is a very fine read worthy of multiple readings ever few years), but rather that of the actual book edition on sale here. I felt sorry for my wife when I saw her ragged copy stuffed into one of her already overly stuffed bookshelves and felt a new edition was in order. I bought this one for her.For the asking price of this book, including S&H;, I cannot for the life of me figure out why people are disgruntled and unhappy with it. It is very well bound, the font is extremely readable, the quality of paper is quite good, the dust jacket is extremely attractive and all the pages were present. I check the binding very closely when the book arrived, and again, for what I paid for this thing, it was excellent! Trust me...I know about such things. Hey folks, this is not advertized nor is it a leather bound first edition! This is a workable, useful book for everyday use.Now I have both this work and P&P; down loaded to my Kindle. The chances of my wife ever using one of these reading machines are as about as likely as pigs flying next mayday. It ain't going to happen. Therefore, she now has a new hardback book; one that will quite likely outlast both of us; It did not cost me a fortune. She can read her copy; I can read mine and the war between us that has been going on since we were in our early teens can continue.Bottom line...this is a good buy. And I must tell you, my wife was delighted with it.Don BlankenshipThe Ozarks"},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"I must start by admitting I did not get \\"Emma\\" the first time I read it. Or even the second. I did not really begin to properly understand \\"Emma\\" until after reading an essay by the great P.D. James, \\"Emma Considered as a Detective Story,\\" which forms a chapter in herTime to Be in Earnest: A Fragment of Autobiography(a wonderful piece of writing too). And even after that, I have to confess, it took a while. This is a novel that does not give up its secrets easily.Although the outward plot is simple enough (some reviewers have found it tedious, and I did too, initially), the real genius of this book is that all the really exciting and dramatic stuff -- Jane Fairfax's agonized secret engagement, Frank Churchill's game of misdirection -- is happening both offstage, as it were, and under our noses. There is a very exciting, melodramatic romantic story here, but that's not the one Jane Austen tells us. She hides it in plain sight, however.All the clues are there (just as in a detective story) but we don't see them, because we are seeing the world through the eyes of Emma, who is, as the 90s remake wittily reminds us, clueless: self-absorbed, naive, convinced the world revolves around her. But aren't we all?The book itself is a kind of conjuring trick, and once you see that, it is impossible to ever see it again in the same way."},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"These books are wonderful! I love feeling like not only am I reading a delightful classic but I am doing so with a piece of art. They are truly treasures on my bookshelf!"},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"Jane Austen's Emma was published in December 1815, when she was forty years old (just 19 months before she died). It is thus a work of her mature period, and is something of a favorite among her devotees.My admiration of Austen's work is partly for her insight into human nature but also for the sheer beauty of her prose. It has a poetic texture. Her sentences can be long and complex, with some confusion of pronouns, so that they need to be lingered on, their sense teased out of them, until their structure and meaning is revealed, exactly as one would do with poetry. The effect is immensely satisfying.She spends almost no time on descriptions of place, but when she does she shows herself capable of describing a scene succinctly and effectively. Her main focus is on character. She describes her characters and their motivation at length, and reveals them through dialogue. This emphasis on dialogue makes her work eminently suitable for dramatization, so it is no surprise that there have been so many adaptations of her work in cinema and televisionEmma is unique among Austen's novels in that the heroine is a spoilt rich girl, with definite character flaws. The reader is challenged to judge her and to choose to like her or not.One or two of the plot elements are somewhat contrived, but that befits a comedy of errors, which is what this essentially is.I would advise reading as little as possible about the book before reading the book itself, for fear of spoilers. In particular, you should avoid any introduction, because editors of classics very generously provide complete synopses of plots in their introductions, presumably to spare the reader any surprises. Introductions are best read after the story or, in the case of the Barnes & Noble Classics edition, not at all. The introduction by Steven Marcus is verbose, meandering and thoroughly confused. If you want good editorial input, choose another edition.[PeterReeve]"},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"\\"Emma Woodhouse, handsome, clever, and rich, with a comfortable home and happy disposition\\" is a suitable heroine for Jane Austen's lightest, frothiest novel. While \\"Emma\\" is not nearly as dramatic as Austen's other works, it is an enchanting little comedy of manners in which a young woman with the best intentions meddles in others' love lives... with only the faintest idea of how people (including herself) actually feel.After matchmaking her governess Miss Taylor, Emma Woodhouse considers herself a natural at bringing people together. She soon becomes best buddies with Harriet, a sweet (if not very bright) young woman who is the \\"natural daughter of somebody.\\" Emma becomes determined to pair Harriet with someone deserving of her (even derailing a gentleman-farmer's proposal), such as the smarmy, charming Mr. Elton. When Emma's latest attempt falls apart, she finds that getting someone OUT of love is a lot harder than getting them INTO it.At around the same time, two people that Emma has heard about her entire life have arrived -- the charming Frank Churchill, and the reserved, remote Miss Jane Fairfax (along with rumors of a married man's interest in her). Emma begins a flirtatious friendship with Frank, but for some reason is unable to get close to Miss Fairfax. As she navigates the secrets and rumors of other people's romantic lives, she begins to realize who she has been in love with all along.Out of all Jane Austen's books, \\"Emma\\" is the frothiest and lightest -- there aren't any major scandals, lives ruined, reputations destroyed, financial crises or sinister schemes. There's just a little intertwined circle of people living in a country village, and how one young woman tries to rearrange them in the manner that she genuinely thinks is best. Of course, in true comedy style everything goes completely wrong.And despite the formal stuffiness of the time, Austen wrote the book in a languidly sunny style, threading it with a complex web of cleverly orchestrated rumors and romantic tangles. There's some moments of seriousness (such as Emma's rudeness to kind, silly Miss Bates), but it's also laced with some entertaining dialogue (\\"Silly things do cease to be silly if they are done by sensible people in an impudent way\\") and barbed humor (the ridiculous and obnoxious Mrs. Elton).Modern readers tend to be squicked by the idea of Emma falling for a guy who's known her literally all her life, but Austen makes the subtle relationship between Knightley and Emma one of affectionate bickering and beautiful romantic moments (\\"If I loved you less, I might be able to talk about it more. But you know what I am. You hear nothing but truth from me\\").Emma is a character who is likable despite her flaws -- she's young, bright, well-meaning and assured of her own knowledge of the human heart, but also naive and sometimes snobbish. She flits around like a clumsy butterfly, but is endearing even when she screws up. Mr. Knightley is her ideal counterpoint, being enjoyably blunt and sharp-witted at all times. And there's a fairly colorful supporting cast -- Emma's neurotic but sweet dad, her kindly ex-governess, the charming Frank, the fluttery Miss Bates, and even the smarmy Mr. Elton and his bulldozing wife.\\"Emma\\" is the most lightweight and openly comedic of all Jane Austen's novels, with a likable (if clueless) heroine and a multilayered plot full of half-hidden feelings. A lesser delight."},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"Unlike the previous reviewer, I greatly enjoyed this book. It's actually my favorite of Jane Austen's novels. Emma, to be sure, is a little frivolous and silly, but she's meant to be, as the book shows how she goes from hapless matchmaker to happily matched herself. The book is at times laugh-out-loud funny, and gives charming insight into life during that time period. Poor Harriet is a very amusing character, and Emma's father is a hoot. The many misunderstandings and romantic confusions only add to the story. Give Emma a chance...you won't be disappointed!"},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"The title character of \\"Emma\\" is unique among the heroines of Jane Austen's novels. She is \\"handsome, clever, and rich\\" and at twenty-one years of age, inexperienced in life. Further, for most of the novel, Emma is not actively seeking a husband. The grim economic necessity that made finding the right husband so important for Lizzie Bennet and her counterparts in the other novels does not apply. Emma can therefore be allowed to be foolish in her social forays, even to fail, without impairing the audience's ability to enjoy the resulting romantic comedy.Emma lives at the estate of Hartfield with her doting but hypochondriac father. Their social status as the leading family of Highbury is unquestioned. The recent marriage of Emma's governess to a close neighbor prompts Emma to wish to arrange suitable matches for her other friends and neighbors. Her immediate target is Harriet Smith, an amiable young woman of uncertain social status. Against the advice of Emma's brother-in-law and confidant Mr. Knightley, Emma persuades Miss Smith to refuse an offer of marriage from a Mr. Martin, a upright hardworking farmer of no social distinction. Emma then tries to match Harriet up with the ambitious young vicar of Highbury, Mr. Elton. This scheme fails, hilariously, when Mr. Elton proposes instead to a horrified Emma.Mr. Elton soon brings a new Mrs. Elton to the village, a vulgar social upstart who presumes to arrange the social life of Highbury. Among her targets is young Jane Fairfax, once the paid companion of a gentlewoman, now forced to make her own way. The arrival of the charming and handsome Frank Churchill creates additional complications. Emma, after getting over her own initial infatuation, presses a match between Frank and Miss Smith. She is also provoked by Frank into passing rumors about Jane Fairfax and the husband of the woman she formerly accompanied. The climax of the story may be an unfortunate picnic at Box Hill, where everyone seems out of sorts. Emma thoughtlessly insults the silly but harmless Miss Bates, for which she is very properly upbraided by Mr. Knightley. Emma then learns, in rapid succession, that Frank has been engaged to Jane Fairfax all along and that Harriet believes she has gained the affection of Mr. Knightley. Emma is mortified to have misjudged both Frank and Jane, and to have inadvertantly pushed Harriet towards a man she now realizes she loves herself.Emma must take responsibility for her mistakes and make good her relationships with Miss Bates, Jane Fairfax, and Harriet Smith. Her fear of losing Mr. Knightley leads to a fateful conversation with him in the garden of Hartfield, in which Emma's fear of losing his friendship works at cross-purposes with Mr. Knightley's real agenda.Austen's subtle and witty exploration of social relationships in \\"Emma\\" is both humorous and insightful. \\"Emma\\" is the least heroic of Austen's heroines, but her undoubted charm and her very human efforts to mature have endeared her to generations of readers. \\"Emma\\" is very highly recommended to fans of Jane Austen's novels as perhaps her most polished romantic comedy."},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"Emma Woodhouse is an atypical heroine for a Jane Austen novel. Usually, we see disadvantaged girls struggle to find happiness through marriage. In Emma's case, we see a girl who has everything in the world she could want. She is rich, pretty, and happy. She has no desire to be married, as it would interfere with the simple life she enjoys with her father and she knows it would break his heart to be parted from her. The story follows Emma's life beginning at 21 as she tries to help a young girl named Harriet Smith marry above her station. Emma also engages in a flirtation with a young man and generally makes a a mess of things as she tries to manage the affairs of others.I have read that Jane Austen felt that Emma was a character only her creator could like. I would have to disagree with that. Emma is certainly flawed, but her heart is almost always in the right place. Pride has blinded her to her own limitations but she is also one who does not shrink from the responsibility of her mistakes and tries very hard to learn from them. I found this admirable and grew to like her more and more as the book progressed.Aside from Emma, the rest of the cast was also very well written. Her father is a complete hypochondriac and often engages in behavior that would typically be considered highly rude. Yet, he is motivated so completely by a desire to be kind to others that his misguided application of that desire only endears him to the reader. Mr. Knightley, the no-nonsense friend of the family is admittedly not the most complex character in the world, but he is a very good one and his solidity is a great counterbalance to Emma's wishful thinking.In summary, Emma is a nice change of pace from Jane Austen's other novels. It starts off well and grows more engaging as it continues. The characters are interesting and Emma herself grows considerably during the course of the novel."},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"While \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is Austen's masterpiece, Emma deserves distinction as a work of wit and fun. Austen wrote about the misfortunes of a high-minded philanthropist (\\"Emma\\" was perfectly translated into the 90's by the movie \\"Clueless\\"). In \\"Emma\\" Austen poked fun at the way Emma feels almost obligated to help her associates \\"better themselves\\" but did not realize until the end that she needed to work more on herself.I enjoyed reading this book and recommend it. If you are new to Austen then I recommend you start with \\"Pride and Prejudice\\"."},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"Honestly, if I had not read Pride &amp; Prejudice first, I would have thought that I did not like Jane Austen's writing style. Emma is extremely slow to begin with though it picks up about half way through. The story centers on Emma Woodhouse, the unmarried daughter of a man obsessed with ailments to be potentially caught from drafts, rich foods and just about anything that is part of ordinary life. Consequently he does not go out (as a rule) and depends on Emma substantially for companionship and general well being. Despite his eccentricities, he is well loved by the community and is a very genial character. Emma, resolved not to marry, takes up matchmaking after her governess, Miss Taylor, marries friend and neighbor, Mr. Weston and Emma feels that she had contributed to making the happy union come about. Against the advice of family friend and mentor, Mr. Knightly, she \\"takes under her wing\\" a young girl at the local school to groom and bring out into good society in hopes of finding her a husband - specifically Mr. Elton of the vicarage. Despite her unknown parentage and lack of good expectations, Emma convinces the girl, Harriet Smith, to aim high in her expectations of a husband and to reject the advances of those of her natural social set in preference for a gentleman.This goes on for so long that I was convinced that this was going to be the whole of the book. Joyfully, though, the Mr. Elton angle blows up catastrophically and simultaneously several more interesting characters are introduced. The icily reserved Jane Fairfax comes to visit her grandmother and aunt before hiring out as a governess. Though she had been taken in by the Campbells and raised very genteelly along side their own daughter, she has no fortune of her own. The same age as Emma, they are expected to be fast friends but Emma's resentments of Jane's superior abilities and deportment do not bode well for this. Then Mr. Weston's son, Frank Churchill, who was raised by his aunt and uncle after his mother's death, comes to meet his new stepmother and makes a splash in Highbury society. Mrs. Weston has designs for Emma and Frank. Emma meanwhile has designs for Harriet and Frank. No one can figure out Jane's designs though Emma suspects improper attachments between her and her benefactor's daughter's new husband. Mr. Elton then brings in a new wife whose forceful manner and arrogant air threaten to turn everything upside down against Emma when Mrs. Elton tries to force a relationship as Jane's benefactress. Similarities between Emma's presumptions with Harriet and Mrs. Elton's presumptuous behavior with Jane are unavoidable and provide a relatively subtle irony.In this last half as the intrigues play out, the story takes on the flavor of Pride and Prejudice and becomes infinitely more interesting. Though the first part was slow, it did serve to really build the character of Emma and she becomes very real through her actions in the second half. It also serves to humanize Mrs. Elton's character to some extent while softening Emma's.This really is a very, very good book and I would have given it 5 stars except for how slow it was in the first half. A patient reader will enjoy this but readers who don't have patience with character studies or slow bits would do better to read Pride and Prejudice."},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"After reading Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice, then Sense and Sensibility, I could not help but read another one of Austen books. The merits of the book lie mostly in character development. Emma, a girl of 21, is altogether too absorbed in the dangers of matchmaking, which result in several devastating consequences for her friend Harriet and her own continual blindness to the true feelings of the men around her. The reader encounters various characters of interest that form a better &quot;tangle&quot; of plot than Pride &amp; P/Sense &amp; S has to offer. I admit that the first 2/3 of the book left me questioning Jane Austen's work. I could not admire Emma Woodhouse (whom I thought to be at first a silly girl who misinterprets everything) as much as the other &quot;heroines&quot; in Austen's other books, but she proves to be sweet and naive, but clever at the same time, and she always has the best intentions at heart, especially for her loved ones like Mr. Woodhouse. It appears that Jane Austen always saves the best for last--I found the last 1/3 of the book delightful. Throughout the whole book however, Austen's talents and satire shines in various characters, particularly Mrs. Elton, who represents society's perpetual desire to be upper-class. Austen also sheds light on the social stress of class, power, connectinos, etc, without overwhelming the reader.I highly recommend reading this masterpiece."},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"&quot;Fffftt!&quot; Cupid's arrow, once again, pierces the hearts of two unsuspecting people. Causing two people to fall in love, Cupid is known for his matchmaking. Similarly, Cupid is portrayed through Jane Austen's Emma. The protagonist, Emma, tries to find her best friend, Harriet, a husband. Emma is a well thought out, insightful novel. Despite the time gap between the time that Austen composed this novel and present day, the reader can still relate with characters. By developing a setting for Emma, Austen uses a realistic setting. For example, in the village of Highbury, class rank, reputation, and family background are major factors in marriage arrangements, which was a harsh reality during those times. Austen also develops Emma really well through her actions and decisions. Because Emma is a life-like character, she too makes mistakes. In addition, Emma also chooses to make decisions that make readers love and despise her. Creating unique love triangles, they contribute to the interesting and complex plot. For instance, Harriet has affections for Mr. Elton, however Mr. Elton has feelings for Emma, and Emma is trying to set up Harriet and Mr. Elton together. Using symbols, Austen is able to help readers recognize affections between characters. Showing his love for Emma, Mr. Elton keeps Emma's portrait of Harriet and makes a riddle for Emma and Harriet. However, Emma interprets Mr. Elton keeping the portrait and the riddle as his love for Harriet, but in fact symbolizes feelings for Emma. Also, Austen's themes are well carried out in arrogance and self-deception, and marriage. Thinking she's a perfect matchmaker, Emma is constantly proud of herself and her setups. However, she is unable to realize that marriage can't be playing around with. Ultimately, Emma was a very good book because of its great setting, characters, plot, symbols, and themes."},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"Emma is definitely Jane Austen's most captivating heroine. Emma may be flawed, but her character is the most enjoyable. I loved this novel. Throughout the story, Emma overcomes many personal hurdles. A synopsis would ruin the book - this is a must read!"},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"Watching my favourite sitcoms or a worthy comedy on the big screen I may be moved to laugh out loud. Books have a much more arduous task. Very few authors have managed to make me laugh. Roald Dahl has, so has Harper Lee. Now I can add Jane Austen to the list. Emma is more of an entertainment than an art. It is structured very much like a romantic comedy of the 90's. The characters are introduced and beautifully developed while the reader wonders who will end up with whom. It is a tribute to Jane Austen that we care for Emma even though she causes so much trouble. She is unique in that we enjoy her failings as they lead to so many embarassing situations. In fact the Emma at the beginning of the novel is a much more interesting character than the polished Emma at the conclusion. Plot? There is very little. It is characters that Austen succeeds at. We remember Knightley and Emma; Frank Churchill and Mrs Elton; Mr Woodhouse and Harriet Smith. They are all well defined characters and like any good book you miss them when they depart. Oh and the line that forced me to laugh out loud: &quot;Mr Knightley seemed to be trying not to smile; and succeeded without difficulty, upon Mrs Elton's beginning to talk to him&quot;. If you don't get it read the book, I guarantee you will enjoy it."},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"I loved Emma by Jane Austen. I think that the best aspect of Austen's writing is her witty irony that is featured in all of her books. I thought that Emma was a touching and funny story about a young woman whose lot in life is to play the matchmaker. She tries to fix the world to her own liking, but it does not work. Finally, she stops being so critical and realizes what is standing right in front of her. If you enjoy the book (which I think you will), buy or rent the movie starring Gywneth Paltrow. It is just as funny as the book. If that is not your fancied genre, check out Clueless, starring Alicia Silverstone. It is loosely based on the novel and also very funny, with a modern twist."},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"Though Persuasion is my sentimental favorite, I regard Emma as Austen's finest novel overall. She is at the top of her game and everything works: the dialogue, character development and, did I mention, the humor? While teaching Emma in my AP English class this year, I realized that many less talented readers read right over the irony and scathing remarks. Jane Austen is so very funny that she makes better readers out of those who take the time to read her carefully. I have to admit that the movie version of Emma with Emma Thompson is quite good and does the novel some justice. It also helps a first time Austen reader get a flavor for how things looked and sounded in this time period. If you haven't yet started to enjoy Austen, pick up Emma and you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"I've been reading ever since I was younger, and have always enjoyed it.. After reading all of Nicholas Sparks novels, I decided to go in a different direction and read some classics.. I decided upon Jane Austen after reading reviews of her novels.. So I bought Pride and Prejudice, Sense and Sensibility, Persuasion, and Emma.. I choose Emma to read first because I thought it would be less interesting than the others.. How wrong I was! I absolutely loved this book, it's the best novel I have ever read.. Now I fear that the others will not be nearly as good as this one.. I agree with the others that the beginning is rather slow, but it picks up towards the middle so just stick with it! You will not be sorry.. I have no other words to describe this book other than amazing!"},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"Jane Austen's Emma was a wonderful book. I think it gives Pride and Prejudice a run for its money because you get to see Emma grow as a person from being arragont to being kind.Now here is a basic Readers' Digest summary. Emma Woodhouse, a bright and wealthy young woman, and her father lose Emma's governess, Mrs. Weston(\\"poor miss Taylor\\") because she has gotten married. Emma brags to a good family friend,Mr. Knightley, that she predicted the match herself. She then wants to be a matchmaker. However, Mr. Woodhouse decides to disapprove of every marriage.To replace Mrs. Weston, Emma befriends Harriet Smith, a young poor girl wiht no record of her real birth mother. The two become good friends. Emma finds a wealthy man, Mr. Elton, that she thinks would be perfect for Harriet. Harriet grows to love Mr. Elton, but the feeling isn't mutual.A poor old maid, Miss Bates has her niece, Jane Fairfax, visit the town. Emma is envious of Jane because Jane is everything Emma wants to be: respected, elegant, and musical.Frank Churchill, Mrs. Weston's step-son, visits the town. Charming and handsome, he pays much attention to Emma. Many speculate the two as a perfect match. While others approve, Mr. Knightley is determined to think ill of him.Well, I'm sorry, but I hate giving away books, but believe me, this book is worth it. I will warn you that Austen tends to ramble on, but if you hang in there you will love it!"},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"Once you master the difficulty of the language(some in our reading group never did), you can focus on the story and relate to the witty and impudent Emma. In one incident Emma and her best friend and former governess share a non-verbal communication by stepping on the other's foot under the table when something wild is happening! So many of these &quot;modern&quot; exchanges take place, that I was able to drop my misinformed presumptions that the english gentry class of the nineteenth century are so different from me. There are moments of great cruelty (such is the case of class struggle) and there are two hilarious characters; the gossipy neighbor who barely catches her breath, and answers her own questions, and Emma's worrisome and overprotective father. The story seems to be one party after another -- from parlor rooms to ballrooms to picnic luncheons -- you will be amazed at how much time these people have on their hands! Oh, the leisure class. Emma goes through some humbling changes, and there are surprising turns of events. I found myself wishing for Emma's world -- where your neighbors are intimates and you alternately visit and are visited upon, and work isn't in the picture."},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"It's not that I don't like Emma as a character, I do! It's great that she's a bit flawed and gets into messes because of her arrogance, and I even liked the storyline (though to be honest it's probably only because of \\"Clueless\\") to a certain extent - I just felt it was a little dull.Nothing ever really seemed to happen. People just talked. A lot. And I felt that the whole 367 pages (of my copy) could have been cut down to 150 - at least! The one possibly exciting part (Harriet and the gypsies) you didn't see happen, as it was only ever talked about. Like the rest of the book.It's the first Austen I've read and has - I hate to say - slightly put me off trying any of her others, although I probably will in time.If you like charming books of light humour and romance - or just Austen - I'm sure you'll enjoy Emma, but if like me, you are used to a bit more excitement and adventure, you might want to try something else.

The story takes you back to old Enland (I guess 1800s)..the main character Emma, is a smart young woman from a well to do family in England. The story pretty much revolves around our heroine in her attempts at matchmaking, the social norms of England in those times etc. Though it borders on romance, I would say it is more of drama. Of course, Knightley (though old) is an adorable character in the story. Though Emma might seem a little...spoiled to some readers, I would say she is a sensible, likeable heroine.

You can never tire of a truly well written book like her writing of Emma."},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"Emma Woodhouse is priviledged. Very priviledged. She comes from the richest, most important family in her small town. Everyone looks up to her, including her indulgent governess and even more indulgent papa. The theme of her life, from the time she was small, has always been \\"Emma knows best\\". Emma takes this to heart when she takes an interest in young Harriet Smith, the beautiful, empty-headed daughter of, well, someone. The book follows Emma's misadventures as she tries to marry Harriet off to the local parson and meddles in the lives of her friends and neighbors, eventually learning that perhaps she doesn't always know best.This is, I think, one of Jane Austen's less popular works, perhaps because there isn't a great deal of romance in it. It is, as I titled the review, more of a character study, as well as a study of society at that time. On first reading, I didn't care for the book or for Emma's self-centered goodness. After reading it again, I grew to enjoy the book as much if not more than her more popular works, like Pride and Prejudice. The wit is sharp as usual (and maybe slightly more ascerbic), and more thought seems to have been put into the secondary characters. Definitely worth a read."},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"Like all of her novels, Jane Austen's EMMA is essentially a comedy of manners, a work in which the characters move inside a highly restrictive code of conduct and must walk a fine line between the socially acceptable and unacceptable if they are to survive, much less reach their goals. But at the same time the central character, Emma Woodhouse, is a marked departure. Not only is she a young woman of considerable wealth and social standing, she is, as critics are fond of pointing out, &quot;flawed.&quot;The nature of Emma's flaw is essentially Austen's observation of the great failing of the upper-class: an assumption that what they think and do is inevitably correct. And although Emma is quick-witted, generous, and kind, she suffers the effect of this blind arrogance when she comes to believe that she is gifted as a matchmaker and can order the romantic lives of her circle to suit her own liking. The result is a series of seriocomic entanglements and disasters that touches virtually every one with whom Emma comes into contact.The story requires considerable exposition, and consequently the action is slow to gather; add to this the fact that Emma herself is so overbearing and self-assured that you frequently want to give her a slap. The result is a novel that many, including Austen fans, will find an uphill read. Even so, Austen is writing very close to the peak of her powers here, and her amazing talent for observation, subtle irony, and flashing wit endow EMMA with tremendous charm and interest. In many respects a remarkable novel, but one that I recommend more to determined Austen fans than to casual readers.GFT, Amazon Reviewer"},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"I definitely recommend this book to first time Jane Austen readers, and especially to young girls, for it is so cute and so amusing. I wish I were &quot;forced&quot; to read this in High School for I would have surely written good papers on it. I can't see how anyone can dislike this classic. Jane Austen's character &quot;Emma&quot; has her faults of course, be she is a true character that is amusing and utterly charming, unlike those characters in Pride and Prejudice and Sense and Sensibility, which by no doubt are wonderful books, but Emma truly has to be my favorite Austen work. It is predictable, even without having seen the movie that was based on this work (that mind some of you was written over 200 years before Alicia Silverstone existed...gosh!) but the predictability of it made it all the more enjoyable, like a sort of mystery in romance. I definitely recommend this book to anyone over the age of 11 or 12. I know I'll make my kids read it some day. It is superb!"},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"If I could do it over again, I would read Jane Austen's Emma before I read her Pride and Prejudice. Unfortuanately that was not the case. I loved it nonetheless. Emma combines witty humor and a fun cast of characters that makes for very enjoyable reading. It does not read as quickly or as easily as Pride and Prejudice, but it is still great fun!If you have seen the movie Clueless starring Alicia Silverstone, then you know the basic plot. The 1995 movie was adapted from Jane Austen's novel, which was published in the 1800s. The Miramax version of Emma is done very well and should be viewed after reading the novel, not before. It would make the reading even slower.Emma Woodhouse is a young woman who is the socialite of her small English town of Highbury. She is beautiful and wealthy and popular; everything that girls nowadays want to be or imagine themselves to be, so she is not terribly hard to relate to. She is not terribly smart but humorously clever and witty.This novel displays this young woman's journey to self-discovery and love; along the way she humorously meddles in everyone's lives. Her romantic blunders are extremely fun to read about. I recommend this novel to any avid reader, but I should caution you against reading Pride and Prejudice beforehand, but if it is too late, do not hesitate to read it. And even though it may drag a bit, bear with it; the ending is reward itself!Needless to say Emma will always have a place in my heart and on my bookshelf."},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"Of all of the books by Jane Austen this was my least favorite. The central character is not likeable and you can't sympathasize with her. It is a long and tedious book and it was constantly set aside to read something else when a new book arrived. If you are truly a fan of the 18th century period writings yes go ahead and read it but Pride and Prejudice, Sense & Sensibility and Northlanger Abbey are far better reading."},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"I'm reading Emma again for the third time. It happened like this: I thought I'd try an audio book on CD for the first time, something to listen to in the car besides music. Scanning the shelves at the local bookstore, I saw loads of contemporary best sellers, self and financial help, new age and evangelical Christian spirituality, and Jane Austen's Emma in MP3 format, all on one disc. Austen! Water in the desert! I scooped her up.For the last week I've been listening to her in my car. At the beginning it was without much concentration. Over the next few days my attention gradually increased. Now I'm hooked. Down the throat. Through the gut. Again. It happens to me every time I return to Jane. I just can't get enough. The last two nights I've gone to bed reading ahead of where I've listened. Even though the story is coming back to me, I'm still taken by it, hook line & sinker. Jane's reeling me in, and the line is utterly slack.Now, I am a guy. I break out in hives if I happen to accidentally brush a romance novel. As far as I am concerned, bodice rippers where the tall olive skinned duke inevitably has his forceful yet gentle way with the heroine are good only as ammunition with which to tease the women in my life who enjoy such tripe. Having said this, I realize a lot of people also refer to Jane Austen as \\"Chick Lit,\\" equating her with the likes of Nicolas Sparks. For the record, those people are on crack.Austen is much more a comedic writer than a writer of what we call romances. She is simply a hoot. Subtle disjunctures and ironies build to exquisite crescendos. She has me laughing every other page. Her characters, even her unpleasant and ridiculous ones, tend to breed sympathy. Like most of my favorite books, she creates worlds, or a world, really (all of her books are set in the same historic and geographic milieu,) which comforts and gladdens. The feeling I get from her is much like the feeling I get when I read Tolkien describe the Shire or Last Homely House, or something like the children's book Frog & Toad to my niece.It's an eating poached egg on toast snuggled up inside under a quilt on the couch with a cup of tea on a rainy day kind of feeling. (Don't you just love English prepositions and phrasal verbs? Try doing that in French! Austen and phrasal verbs: two of the many reasons English speakers ought to rejoice in their language, I say!)Anyway, during all of her stories, including Emma, Europe was being blown apart by the Napoleonic Wars, and the only oblique references in any of her stories to that maelstrom is that Great Britain has a mobilized Army (Pride & Prejudice) and an active Navy (Persuasion.) The reason the military is important has nothing to do with Austerlitz, Waterloo, Trafalgar or any of that nonsense. Rather, it is that both services have officers which make very suitable suitors for women of her heroines' social positions (Lt. Wickham & Capt. Wentworth, for example.)Some brand this awful: elitist, sexist, parochial. I, for one, find it beautiful. Small, intimate, ordered, secure, anchored. Very human and sane, that is.What matters most is not what some silly diminutive one armed Corsican with maniacal delusions of world conquest is doing; no. What really matters is whether and how Mr. Woodhouse takes his gruel, or if Mr. Elton will propose to Harriet. Or if Mr. Knightly and Mrs. Weston have come to visit yet, today. Will Mr. Frank Churchill come, and what is he like? Has Emma truly foiled Mr. Martin's advances on her friend, he being an entirely unsuitable yeoman farmer? Harriet must marry a gentleman, you see.Just so. Indeed, these are truly the things that mattered- and still matter- most. Don't let the history books and the reverse snobbery of some critics fool you.Instead go read this book, and every other that Jane wrote, and prepare to be enchanted."},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"Emma is Jane Austen at her best, the work of a writer in her prime. While earlier novels such as Northanger Abbey and Pride and Prejudice are extremely witty and well-plotted, none are as clever, interesting or satisfying as Emma, in its depiction of the frivolous preoccupations of the landed gentry in eighteenth century England.The plot centres around Emma Woodhouse, the young, beautiful and clever daughter of a hypochondriac father, who amuses herself by attempting to play cupid to her friends and neighbours - with predictably painful results. Austen's characterisation is delightful: characters such as Mr Woodhouse and Miss Bates are brilliant comic creations but are never in danger of becoming caricatures, like Dickens' characters sometimes do. Meanwhile Emma herself is a complex mixture of intelligence and thoughtlessness, kind-heartedness and self-satisfaction, and is superbly realised. Austen's dialogue is as delicious, and frequently hilarious, as ever - she reveals the finer nuances of her characters through the things they say, intentionally or otherwise - and shows how intuitively insightful and compassionate she was.As in most Jane Austen novels, all situations resolve themselves into a happy ending, though whether this tendency was prompted by a genuine positivity and warmth of feeling or a playful sense of irony, nobody is sure. Regardless, Emma is a tremendously satisfying read."},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"Jane Austen wrote some of the most remarkable romantic novels in English, and Emma is said to be written at the height of her powers. Like all her novels (Pride and Prejudice and Sense and Sensibility), the narrative is simple, straightforward and the story develops through seemingly commonplace conversations and events. Emma is twenty one year old daughter to rich Mr Woodhouse, \\"full of trivial communications and harmless gossip.\\" The story captures how Emma comes to terms with her own errors of judgement, and how she discovers her liking and love for one of the chief characters of the novel. (Perhaps giving his name away here would be sacrilage on my part!!). The cast, the locations, the conversations are set in distinct Austen style, rooted in rural English counties. The romances are Victorian, and progress through delicate, slow developments that a through, diehard romantic is bound to like. Emma's actions are governed by her own romantic fantasies, where she tries to bring people together playing a matchmaker, and her failures as well as successes make this novel an interesting read. A treat for Austen fans!"},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"Buyers be advised that, though this page as of 08/30/2005 does not specify, this is ABRIDGED.

Emma is a very imperfect heroine, but Jane Austen was wrong in supposing that no one but herself would like her. I find Emma to be refreshing as a heroine, and she stands is stark contrast to Fanny Price in Mansfield Park (my least favorite Austen heroine). There is none of Fanny's timidness or inability to stand up for herself. Emma is independent and strong, and much more modern than other female characters in classic literature. Her mistakes in pride and arrogance are such as we all make on a daily basis. She presumes to understand people's emotions and thoughts and thinks she has a right to order things as she would have them be...very type \\"A\\", in my opinion. But, as her intentions in every case are good, as she only wants those she loves to be happy and prosperous, one cannot really blame her.The other characters in this book are also very satisfying, particularly Jane Fairfax and Mr. Knightley. Jane is the poor orphan on whom everyone in Highbury, the village in which Emma lives, dotes upon. Emma, of course, can't stand her at first, but only because of the knowledge that Jane is superior to her in many ways. How many of us have declared that we don't like someone simply because they're better at something than we are? Mr. Knightley, Emma's neighbor and long-time family friend, is her conscience, calling attention to those errors in judgment that Emma constantly seems to make. He often lectures her, but only in an attempt to set her on a better course. When faced with the prospect of losing him, Emma must confront her own feelings and question her own situation in life.It's altogether an enjoyable read, with plenty of twists and blunders, and should appeal to any fan of Jane Austen...or just anyone who wants to read the real version of the movie \\"Clueless\\"."},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"Emma Woodhouse, \\"handsome, clever, and rich,\\" is the 21-year-old daughter of the elderly owner of Hartfield, the largest estate in Highbury. Though only a couple of hours away from London by carriage, Highbury regards itself as an isolated and virtually self-contained community, with the Woodhouse family the center of social life and at the top of its social ladder. Emma, doting on her hypochondriac father, whom she represents to the outside world, has grown up without a mother's softening influence, and at twenty-one, she is bright, willful, and not a little spoiled.Having too little to do to keep out of trouble, Emma's hobby is matchmaking, \\"the greatest amusement in the world.\\" Unfortunately, her sophistication in the social graces does not extend to much insight into human beings. Taking Harriet Smith, a young woman of \\"questionable birth\\" under her wing, Emma makes Harriet her \\"project,\\" educating her in the social graces, convincing Harriet not to marry farmer Robert Martin, who has courted her, and ultimately persuading Harriet that the vicar, Mr. Elton, is falling in love with her.Bored and without a large circle of \\"suitable\\" friends, Emma is an incorrigible meddler, playing with the lives of those around her, snubbing those she considers inferior, gossiping about others in an attempt to divert attention to herself, and misreading intentions. Only Mr. Knightly, sixteen years older than Emma and a friend of her father, stands up to Emma and tells her what he thinks of her behavior, and it is through him that she eventually begins to grow.Love and the formal protocol of marriage are a major focus here, with marriage more often a merger of \\"appropriate\\" families than the result of romance or passion. Class distinctions, acknowledged by all levels of society, limit both personal friendships and romantic possibilities, and as Emma's matchmaking fails again and again, causing grief to many of her victims, Emma begins to recognize that her pride, willfulness, and love of power over others have made her oblivious to her own faults. Austen shines in her depiction of Emma and her upperclass friends, gently satirizing their weaknesses but leaving room for them to learn from their mistakes-if only they can learn to recognize the ironies in their lives. Though Emma may be, in some ways, Austen's least charming heroine, she is certainly vibrant and, with her annoying faults, a most realistic one.

I highly recommend this one!"},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"A smug but goodhearted society girl learns her judgment isn't as incisive as she thinks it is. \\"Emma\\" is a fun, lighthearted version of Jane Austen, with enough misunderstandings and crossed signals to form the basis of a modern sitcom. For all its pleasant enjoyability, however, the novel is also a fascinating character study of one woman being elevated to a nobler level by being taken down several notches.In this respect, \\"Emma\\" is a prime example of the fact that although many see Jane Austen as something of a proto-feminist, she often gave her male characters the most admirable constitutions of her entire cast. Although the female Emma may be the heroine we hope will triumph, the male Mr. Knightley (like Colonel Brandon of \\"Sense and Sensibility\\") is the unimpeachably noble person, and the one who helps Emma ascend to a higher plane of virtue when she might otherwise have been left in despair at her failures. In the end, Austen's fourth novel (and the last published during her lifetime) is not a feminist manifesto. Rather, it transcends the gender wars and remains a touching comedy of errors with a profoundly subtle commentary on human pride and folly."},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"In a letter to a relative Austen once wrote \\"3 or 4 families in a country village is the very thing to work on \\"She knew this world intimately and well and it was the subject of her best novels of which Emma most assuredly is one .Emma Woodhouse is young,lively and thoroughly spolied .She is complacently sure she knows what is best for all her friends and acquaintances ,especially in matters of the heart .She is a self-appoinited matchmaker to all her friends and she particularly interests herself in the affairs of the young and naive Harriet Smith,an unassertive and timid young woman .Emma is convinced Harriet would be ideally matched with the local minister Mr Elton not knowing that he despises Harriet for her lack of social graces and standing and that he is set on wooing and winning Emma herself .Emma is idly contemplating a dalliance with a newcomer to the village ,Frank Churchill ,but her real feelings are for the local squire George Knightley .Knightley is an amused and exasperated spectator to the meddling which is second nature to Emma.The novel deals with the way Emma's plans for others collapse and she as a consequence comes to a new and painful degree of self-awareness.She knows less about herself and others than she fondly imagines .The book is a very tough-minded piece of work and has universal themes to do with human motivations and self-deception.It shows the manipulations and strategems of the marriage market as supremely important in society .Emma is essentially about growing into self awareness rather than a romantic comedy as so many other Austen novels are .It is why it still retains its impact so many years after its original publication .The support cast is well drawn -Elton,in particular being a great sketch of an odious snake who has somehow been born as human being .Any society in which people meddle in each others affairs is one in which Emma is still a valid book"},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"A classic gem done full justice by the superb reading of Prunella Scales. A great listening experience was marred, however, by a surprising and disappointing flaw in disc 8 which rendered the final track unintelligible.It would be much appreciated if you could replace this faulty disc, as such a literary masterpiece deserves to be presented and preserved in mint condition.The damaged disc apart, Jane Austen would surely applaud this excellent rendition of her beloved Emma."},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"Emma Woodhouse is an atypical heroine for a Jane Austen novel. Usually, we see disadvantaged girls struggle to find happiness through marriage. In Emma's case, we see a girl who has everything in the world she could want. She is rich, pretty, and happy. She has no desire to be married, as it would interfere with the simple life she enjoys with her father and she knows it would break his heart to be parted from her. The story follows Emma's life beginning at 21 as she tries to help a young girl named Harriet Smith marry above her station. Emma also engages in a flirtation with a young man and generally makes a bit of a mess of things whenever she gets involved.I have read that Jane Austen felt that Emma was a character only her creator could like. I would have to disagree with that. Emma is certainly flawed, but her heart is almost always in the right place. Pride has blinded her to her own limitations but she is also one who does not shrink from the responsibility of her mistakes and tries very hard to learn from them. I found this admirable and grew to like her more and more as the book progressed.Aside from Emma, the rest of the cast was also very well written. Her father is a complete hypochondriac and often engages in behavior that would typically be considered highly rude. Yet, he is motivated so completely by a desire to be kind to others that his misguided application of that desire only endears him to the reader. Mr. Knightley, the no-nonsense friend of the family is admittedly not the most complex character in the world, but he is a very good one and his solidity is a great counterbalance to Emma's wishful thinking.In summary, Emma is a nice change of pace from Jane Austen's other novels. It starts off well and grows more engaging as it continues. The characters are interesting and Emma herself grows considerably during the course of the novel."},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"*Warning: there are some plot spoilers in this review!*Jane Austen has a reputation as a witty, humorous writer with a keen eye for human folly and failings, and with this novel she certainly lives up to her reputation. While Emma isn't as popular as my personal favorite Pride and Prejudice, I believe that Emma is so popular, and can be considered \\"literature\\" (that is, a piece of art) because the story really has a universal quality to it. The fact that we can relate to the situations and characters in Emma some 300 years later is what makes it seem so timeless, and why the Emma movie with a \\"modern twist\\", Clueless, was so wildly successful. When you compare both Emma and Clueless they show how little has changed and that privileged teenagers (and young adults) will find themselves in the same situations and social patterns, whether they are in 19th century England or 21st century America.Of course, while the wealthy and bored teenagers in Clueless might try to set up their friends on dates, the stakes were a bit higher in Emma. Emma (the heroine) attempts to match her new friend Harriet Smith with the new minister Mr. Elton not just for dating, but for marriage as long as they both shall live (remember, divorce was rare, if not nonexistent in early 19th century Britain.) Unfortunately, this plan backfires when Mr. Elton becomes interested in Emma, not Harriet. The problem was that Emma (already conceited because she successfully \\"guessed well\\" when she matched her tutor Ms. Taylor with a local widower Mr. Weston) failed to get to know Harriet and Mr. Elton well enough to figure out if they were, in fact, right for each other. Emma shows her class-snobbery when she (through some very adolescent mind games) convinces Harriet to reject the proposal that she receives from a local farmer (Mr. Martin, the man Harriet likes and eventually falls in love with), in the hopes that Mr. Elton will propose. Emma was too self-centered and (to steal the phrase from Amy Heckerling) clueless to notice that Mr. Elton was not, in fact, interested in Harriet, but in herself--a fact that leads to Harriet's heartbreak. Of course, this is only one part of the multi-faceted story that Jane Austen created about the life of a \\"handsome, clever and rich\\" woman living in Highbury, England, but it gives you a sense of the life and times of Ms. Emma Woodhouse (as we see them in the book)Fortunately, all is well in the end when Emma learns her lesson about matchmaking and toying with emotions and discovers that she loves her brother-in-law and well loved family friend Mr. Knightly. This is a classic \\"happy ending by way of falling in love with the best friend that you had all along,\\" but with a slightly dated feel. First, he is sixteen years older than her and he, in a way, helped to raise her (at least, in principles). The fact that he admits openly to having been \\"in love with (her) ever since (she) was thirteen at least,\\" slightly bothered me. Who, in the 21st century, would admit to having a crush on their 13 year old sister-in-law? In the context and time of the novel it's romantic. Now Mr. Knightly might be described as a pedophile. However, the dated dialogue (like the above) is the only qualm I had about the book, and I hope that it doesn't discourage anyone from reading Emma. Overall, I would recommend this book to any Clueless fan, romantic-comedy fan, or anyone who wants to read the wonderfully universal writing of Jane Austen."},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"Very much like Shakespeare's Twelfth Night, Emma, a novel by Jane Austen, is a tale of confusion and intrigue over the universal topic of love. The reader's feelings of befuddlement and captivation, while nonexistent at the beginning of the novel, will grow exponentially until the climax. At the end of the novel, everything finally makes sense and the characters live on happily ever after. This is a very satisfying ending, clearing up all earlier confusion, although it leaves little room for wonder and thought after the reader has finished the book. Though I found this novel very confusing, and therefore unenjoyable at times, the intrigue and vivid setting and characterization overpowered my initial dislike. I would recommend Emma, to seventh through ninth grade students who are capable of deciphering meaning from complicated words and are able to pick out the essential subject matter of passages that do not state the meaning strait out. Readers will enjoy the frenzied, almost comical, characters in all their confusion over who loves whom, as well as all the wonderful descriptions, and the satisfying ending."},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"Emma is another one of Jane Austen's novels. It's a good book, however I don't believe it's as good as Pride and Prejudice. The protagonist, Emma, is a very bright and handsome young lady. It seems that the protagonists of Jane Austen are always female, intelligent, and pretty. The characters in this book are complex. For example, an elderly well-known bachelor suddenly falls in love and took a wife of about the same age as he. His reason for marrying is also strange, because he simply wanted to have a wife. And Emma was the person who started and encouraged their relationship. The plot was interesting too, a few surprises here and there.My problem with Emma is that it wasn't as engrossing a story as Pride and Prejudice. But this is a different style of book, so it's really unfair for me to say that Emma is not as good as Pride and Prejudice. Other than that, it's a wonderful book.I recommend it to readers who want dialogue-based novels."},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"I just recieved my copy of this wonderful work by Jane Austin and, even though I have hardly had time to crack open the beautiful cover, I must say the edging on the pages is exactly as they say: It is uneven and roughly cut. Just as you would have seen in Jane Austin's time. If any of you have grandparents and have stumbled upon their editions, their's probably looked the same. I don't think this is due to the fact that B&N; doesn't care how their books look, but because they wanted to keep that feel that you were reading an older book, from a different time. After all, they didn't have computers and things to measure the print paper perfectly back then.I can't wait to dig into the witty, wonderful world of Jane Austin. It's always a treat!"},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"Although Austen's longest novel, Emma is a lot of fun to read. It was areal challenge to make us truly care about this spoiledand meddlesome character. I guess it because it is Emma's depth of feelingand her reactions to all the chaos she creates throughout the book that reallyendear her. That and the fact that in the end everything works out as itshould (no major spoiler that), and all her messes are resolved happily orcomically.I can see why many consider this to be Austen's best work: it has many of thebest qualities of the other work, but it also builds into a mysterywith a surprising resolution, and many characters turn out to be quitedifferent from what we initially suspect."},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"I love historical novels and Jane Austen holds a special place in my heart. Even so, I have issues with Emma. I adore much of the writing style, but the plot and characters irk me.Let me start by saying that Jane gets kudos for trying to do something different here. In other stories she had not-well-off young women who were desperately trying to get by in life, to thrive in the world they had been born into. Emma is Jane's efforts to focus on a new kind of heroine. Rather than being poor and worried about her future, Emma is quite secure. She is wealthy. She has a father who dotes on her, a house she loves, and she is perfectly content to live like this forever. She has no need of a husband or really of a partner at all. This is an interesting diversion from other stories.Emma, aged 21, grew up without a mother and with a loose-handed governess. So she is spoiled and very aware of her class and status. It might be hard especially for American readers to relate to just how stratified English culture was at the time. Some situations - like how Emma treats farmers - might be seen as cruel. It's important to put this into context. This was \\"normal\\" at the time. Heck, for a few societies on the earth this is \\"normal\\" even in modern times. You can't really judge it as right or wrong.Mr. Knightley, aged 38, has been pretty much an uncle to Emma her entire life. He was a teen when she was born and was always there to watch over her and correct her. He tries to guide Emma as she plays romantic match-making games with the people around her, but Emma thinks she knows what is best. She manages to bungle a variety of relationships. To her credit, she does feel badly right away, but then she plows ahead with a new scheme.SPOILER WARNINGOne of the key issues I have with this book is the VERY creepy idea that Mr. Knightley has been lusting after Emma since she turned 13. If I had a young daughter and a male family friend in his late 20s started following her around as soon as she hit puberty, I would be quite irate with him. Again, I realize gigantic age gaps in this time period were normal. As they say in the story, men weren't expected to take on a family until they hit age 30 and had the financial strength to support a family. Women were supposed to marry in their late teens / early 20s so they could kick out as many kids as possible. Even so, though, to have a person that was almost an uncle to Emma stalking her as soon as she started showing a womanly body really bothers me a lot.Also, I realize Emma is written to have her be spoiled. Jane Austen tries to give her some humanity by making her dote on her father and feel remorse each time she does something wrong. However, to me it just doesn't get past the way-too-spoiled aspect of her personality. Interestingly, I enjoy some of the movie versions FAR more than I enjoy the book because in the movie they alter the storyline just enough to make it much more palatable. They smooth out some of Emma's annoying traits and make the Emma-Knightly pairing a bit less creepy.Still, if you're looking to start reading the Jane Austen series of books, I wouldn't start here. I'd start either with Pride & Prejudice or with Sense & Sensibility."},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"Frankly I am puzzled by the criticisms leveled at this edition. There is another edition [also by Barnes and Noble] and it is cheaper, though the quality is very flimsy and I wonder if the other reviewers were confused with that edition?This edition of Emma is beautifully bound, with a cloth spine, and has a lovely portrait on the cover. The text is not too small unlike some other editions, it makes for comfortable reading. The book itself is sturdy, as it is in hardback, but not unwieldy - it fits nicely into my hands. Besides the main text of Austen's novel itself, it has added features - a brief chronology of the world of Jane Austen & Emma, an introduction, the main text, as well as useful endnotes, a list of adaptations of the novel [in both film and book format],comments, as well as a list of resources for further reading [biographies and letters of Austen] and criticisms. In all, a value buy."},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"Emma (Barnes & Noble Classics)Great Book if you like the classics as I do. Quality of the pages is very good (acid free should you wish to keep it and, smooth texture)."},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"It is difficult to imagine how a book written in 1816 can still be relevant and emotionally viable, after so much change in literature. And while female gender roles have evolved and broadened (causing certain things to become irrelevant- like the drastic choice between marriage or condemnation), Emma remains one of the most complex and ambivalent characters in literature. Perhaps because Austen's major theme- pride- is a rather timeless attribute in humans.Austen was quoted as wanting to create a character \\"no one but [her]self will much like,\\" and Emma certainly answers that promise. Emma is a talented, highly intelligent woman who carries so much pride, that she deems every man an ill-suitor for her, while an under-adjusted adolescent side of her secretly resents such men for being turned off by her harsh arrogance, smugness, and severity. She acts as a match-maker for her less fortunate common friends, bringing them together with men whom she despises; thus ridding herself of her own ingrown desires while condescendingly \`helping' her girl-friends meet men who share their mediocrity. As difficult as it is to like Emma, readers will find her mysteriously compelling, perhaps because there are moments of confused kindness, where our heroine is able to transcend her vanity and truly feel happy for the couples she brings together.Enter Mr. Knightley, who after a tiresome handful of preceding men, is able to gain Emma's respect and affection simply by not buying into her mind games and calling her on her actions. Austen's genius is most manifest in her witty dialog, and the dynamic between Emma and Mr. Knightley- in their bantering flirtations veiled under intellectual stimulation- are testament to that.This novel is about self-image, and for a woman in 19th century patriarchal society that is all she has. Emma owns her self-importance until the men notice, until it becomes real (and despite early feminist tendencies, this only re-confirms female's subordination to men in that social context). Regardless of how readers feel about Emma, the novel is superbly written with wit, irony, and an almost ruthless emotional verity. If an author's goal is to gain her reader's empathy, Austen set out for herself a highly ambitious goal, one that was improbably executed with grace."},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"Maybe it was the way Jane Austen drew the reader into the story, or possibly the twists and turns of the plot, but whatever it was to add the extra flavor it worked.

It has a way of making it an impossible task to put it down. This story stands the tests of time and will surely work it's way into the hearts of millions more.

While \\"Emma\\" is not nearly as dramatic as Austen's other works, it is an enchanting little comedy of manners in which a young woman with the best intentions meddles in others' love lives... with only the faintest idea of how people (including herself) actually feel.After matchmaking her governess Miss Taylor, Emma Woodhouse considers herself a natural at bringing people together. She soon becomes best buddies with Harriet, a sweet (if not very bright) young woman who is the \\"natural daughter of somebody.\\" Emma becomes determined to pair Harriet with someone deserving of her (even derailing a gentleman-farmer's proposal), such as the smarmy, charming Mr. Elton. When Emma's latest attempt falls apart, she finds that getting someone OUT of love is a lot harder than getting them INTO it.At around the same time, two people that Emma has heard about her entire life have arrived -- the charming Frank Churchill, and the reserved, remote Miss Jane Fairfax (along with rumors of a married man's interest in her). Emma begins a flirtatious friendship with Frank, but for some reason is unable to get close to Miss Fairfax. As she navigates the secrets and rumors of other people's romantic lives, she begins to realize who she has been in love with all along.Out of all Jane Austen's books, \\"Emma\\" is the frothiest and lightest -- there aren't any major scandals, lives ruined, reputations destroyed, financial crises or sinister schemes. There's just a little intertwined circle of people living in a country village, and how one young woman tries to rearrange them in the manner that she genuinely thinks is best. Of course, in true comedy style everything goes completely wrong.And despite the formal stuffiness of the time, Austen wrote the book in a languidly sunny style, threading it with a complex web of cleverly orchestrated rumors and romantic tangles. There's some moments of seriousness (such as Emma's rudeness to kind, silly Miss Bates), but it's also laced with some entertaining dialogue (\\"Silly things do cease to be silly if they are done by sensible people in an impudent way\\") and barbed humor (the ridiculous and obnoxious Mrs. Elton).Modern readers tend to be unfairly squicked by the idea of Emma falling for a guy who's known her literally all her life, but Austen makes the subtle relationship between Knightley and Emma one of affectionate bickering and beautiful romantic moments (\\"If I loved you less, I might be able to talk about it more. But you know what I am. You hear nothing but truth from me\\").Emma is a character who is likable despite her flaws -- she's young, bright, well-meaning and assured of her own knowledge of the human heart, but also naive and sometimes snobbish. She flits around like a clumsy butterfly, but is endearing even when she screws up. Mr. Knightley is her ideal counterpoint, being enjoyably blunt and sharp-witted at all times. And there's a fairly colorful supporting cast -- Emma's neurotic but sweet dad, her kindly ex-governess, the charming Frank, the fluttery Miss Bates, and even the smarmy Mr. Elton and his bulldozing wife.\\"Emma\\" is the most lightweight and openly comedic of all Jane Austen's novels, with a likable (if clueless) heroine and a multilayered plot full of half-hidden feelings. A lesser delight."},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"I actually saw the film (with Paltrow as Emma) before reading the book and I must say, that I am glad that the movie was very true to the novel because I adore the movie. I was actually surprised that the book was so similar. It features one of my favorite Jane Austen characters, Emma of course. She is a joy to read about. The dialogue was easy to follow and it was a quick but fun read."},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"The fourth, longest and last of Jane Austen's books to appear in print during her lifetime, Emma is considered a classic romantic comedy and was first published in 1816. Written almost 200 year ago, it's inevitable that the dialogue may feel a bit stilted at times. However, this adds dimension and depth to the story that focuses on 19th century social hierarchies and the interaction between various social classes.Miss Emma Woodhouse is a shining example of a 19th century socialite. Beautiful, clever and wealthy, she fancies herself a master matchmaker and sets in motion a laundry list of schemes to pair off the Highbury residents. Convinced a makeover would elevate her new friend Harriet's social standing and thus her marriage potential, Emma, fueled by her feeling of superiority, plotted and planned, all to no avail. Failing to realize the extent of her shortcomings and the consequences of such hurtful behavior, Emma was finally confronted by Mr. Knightley. Afterwards, embarrassed and ashamed, she reevaluated her life and began to make amends, in hopes of becoming a better person.Emma is a beautifully written, classic, laced with wit and sarcasm. Through a vastly differing cast of characters, each delightfully inspiring in his or her own way, Austen vividly captured the heart of a community. Everything is neatly tied up at the conclusion, as things literally come full circle...ending much the way it began.A subtle, yet significant message is hidden just below the surface--the beginning and the ending are just definitive points in the journey, in between is where we write our definition of happiness. There's a depth and sincere honesty written into the very fabric of this story-that must be recognized to fully appreciate the artistic genius of Jane Austen.Like a vintage automobile, Emma is a slow, leisurely read, perfect for a lazy Sunday afternoon.Armchair Interviews says: What more can you ask of a book, even if the story is 200 years old."},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"I really enjoyed this a lot. It's not quite as good as Pride and Prejudice, but it is better than Sense and Sensibility. It still has a lot of things to say that are still very much pertinent to modern times.

Although overlong, it's still a really, really entertaining read."},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"Jane Austen is one of the greatest women writers in history, and Emma ranks among her best.

I decided to give it another try and couldn't believe that I hadn't enjoyed it before. \\"Emma\\" is not a work of deep and intense literature, but Austen deftly explores human motives and emotions. Emma is consumed by the class system and buys into its importance, much like Mr. Darcy in \\"Pride and Prejudice.\\" Emma feels she has the power to change the system, especially where her friend Harriet Smith is concerned. Emma must find out the hard way about class distinctions and friendship.I'm not an avid Austen reader, in fact I'm quite a novice as far as she is concerned.

All of her books are wonderfully warm, but they show a tendency to light irony as well. Ms. Austen describes her world of early nineteenth century England so very well. In this book her heroine is Emma Woodhouse. She is the younger daughter of a wealthy landowner. She has a good heart, but she is spoiled. She also sticks her nose into other people's love affairs with some disastrous results. Miss Austen does a wonderful job describing life in a busy English village. The village in this story is Highbury. The characters in the book are wonderful, but it is the spiritual development of Emma that carries this book. Somehow she manages to grow and learn while staying within the strictures placed on her by her father and by English village life. Your journey reading Jane Austen's work is not complete if you do not read this book."},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"This is a book about Emma, a rich girl's mischievous struggle in her own little fantacy world.

Even in the worst moment when Emma's ill judgement turned into chaotic love triangle, the story went on and worked everyone's fate for the best. Since I don't read much of Jane Austen's works, I guess her style tends to be light and comic. So, if you are looking for a book with lots of heart throbbing drama, this is definitely not the one."},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"When I first tried to read this book (almost ten years ago, when I was around 13), I found it incredibly dull because there is little action. I finally decided to reread Emma and realized that the appeal of this book (in addition to Jane Austen's writing style) is in its characters. Emma's setting is a small town full of an assortment of delightful personalities.At the center of the story is Emma Woodhouse, an intelligent and wealthy young woman, who believes that she knows what is best for everyone around her. Emma takes the orphaned Harriet Smith, a pretty but simple-minded girl, under her wing. The consequences are disatrous for all. I found it pleasant to watch Emma grow throughout the book and learn about the way the world works.The other characters include the loquacious Miss Bates (and her silent, elderly mother), the constantly distraught Mr. Woodhouse, and the handsome and affluent Mr. Knightley. There are also Jane Fairfax (who the movie portrays a little bit more negatively than the book) and Frank Churchill who show up later on in the book to make life a little more interesting.These people and many others add to the richness of Austen's narrative. The best part about them is that all are real people who have both good and bad points, and make mistakes. I found that a lot of them are similar to people that I know today in the 21st century.The second time I read through this book, I found myself aching for more. I felt delighted every time I find one of Jane Austen's little witticisms (and there are a lot!). These little gems are enough to make her my all time favorite author."},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"Emma Woodhouse is easily Jane Austen's most annoying character. She's young, knows absolutely everything about everything, is the judge of everyone's good character and takes those around her for granted, despite frequently praising her friends and relations. She is, for all intents and purposes, the 18th century version of daddy's little rich girl.How can a book about such a person be so captivating? The short answer is simply: because Jane Austen wrote it. The long answer is several hundred printed pages and well worth the read.Much of the story is the typical Jane Austen framework, but the character of Emma is entirely different from many of the other main figures in Austen's works. While her other heroines have plenty of outstanding qualities and several flaws, Emma has plenty of flaws and several outstanding qualities. It's the central, exceptional qualities that make Emma a worthwhile character, but the flaws - and her growing consciousness of them - that make her loveable.Countering Emma is the younger, and more gullible, Harriet Smith. She becomes Emma's project when Emma learns of her situation in life and is determined to improve it by befriending her. Emma's increasing awareness of her own flaws footnote their friendship, as she is forced to admit to being something of a snob, and a meddler.There are all sorts of loud and obnoxious people in \\"Emma\\", and Austen's orchestration of the interaction among them is, as always, brilliant. The character of Mrs. Elton alone is one of my favorite \\"bad examples\\" of all times. This is perhaps the downright funniest of Austen's books, but in ways it is also the happies and the saddest. Miss Woodhouse and Miss Smith are in the throws of adolescence, where everything is either tragic or blissful.I typically say that \\"Pride & Prejudice\\" and \\"Northanger Abbey\\" are my favorite Austen works, but secretly it might be truer to say that \\"Emma\\" is. It's not as clever as \\"Pride\\" or as satirical as \\"Northanger\\", but the way in which Emma is forced to open her eyes to the world - and the way it continues to revolve, and evidently not around herself - is really something most of us can relate to all too well.Incidentally, the movie version of \\"Emma\\", starring Gwyneth Paltrow, isn't bad, but if you haven't seen it yet, please do yourself the favor of reading the book first. As always, there is so much in the pages that is ignored on the screen. Then, when you're done reading, watch \\"Clueless\\" again, which isn't nearly as true an adaptation, but is a funnier movie."},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"I did my best to read this book but I just couldn't get into it.

The characters that she creates come alive on the page and even though nothing terribly exciting happens besides the usual day to day, I find myself drawn into the lives and events anyway.In the introduction to my version of Emma, there is a comment that Emma is basically a book about nothing. While this is true in a way, Emma is about a lot more than nothing and gives the reader a fascinating glimpse into the world of Emma's England. There is also the great intrigue (insert tongue into cheek a bit) of whom will be matched up with whom and when these courtships will commence, etc.Ms. Austen's easy to read style and sense of humor really do make this an enjoyable book to read and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys a lighthearted frolic through classic literature in old England."},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"If you have not read Emma since you were in high school or college, read it again!! A wonderful story which held my attention from beginning to end. I read it on my kindle and could not put it down. The recent movie follows it very faithfully."},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"As a reader who is tired of cliche romances and characters, I really enjoyed Emma for the unstereotypical main character. Emma is neither wonderfully good with dreadful circumstances (like Jane Fairfax, Jane Eyre, etc.), nor rich and intolerable (like Mrs. Elton, Scarlett O'Hara, etc.), rather she is like many of us today, a well-to-do girl who is nice but has faults. I loved how she grew through the story, slowly realizing more and more of her fundamental issues. Mr. Knightly is the perfect gentleman to everyone and a wonderful friend to Emma because he loves her enough to correct her for her faults. Even so, he grows and improves in the book as well. All of the characters have many facets to their personalities and characters and Austen weaves a beautiful web through the story. Emma is a lighthearted, fun read, yet has depth and relevant themes.I recommend reading this book twice so that it can be fully appreciated."},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"Now that I have all my computer business sorted out (and at home sick today) I'm going to try to get moving on my Jane Austen reviews. Emma was the second Jane Austen book I read, and the only one I read for school. I was 15 at the time and actually wasn't all that fond of the book. It was funny, yes, but I found Emma herself absolutely insufferable and the relationship between her and Mr. Knightley kind of squicky (fell in love with her at 13???) but watched the Gwyneth Paltrow movie and liked it. A couple years later, I gave it another try and loved it!It's probably second or third favorite of all Jane Austen's novels. I still find Emma to be very irritating at times but she is a very amusing character to read about. Like Elizabeth Bennet in a way, she is so sure of herself and her impressions of people and turns out to be totally wrong at just about everything. I like how she learns her lesson when some of her matchmaking attempts go awry. And I realized that Mr. Knightley wasn't serious about falling for Emma when she was only 13, thank heavens. I like that Frank Churchill, the \\"bad guy\\" of the book, isn't exactly a villain per se, but still a total cad.Most of all, I like the element of mystery. Who sent Jane Fairfax the piano? What secrets are the characters hiding? It wasn't a crime novel or anything, \\"only\\" a romance, but throughout there was a sense that things weren't what they seemed, which I enjoyed. Of course, now there's no surprise to learn of Jane and Frank's engagement but it's fun to pick out the all the hints or \\"clues\\" that Mr. Knightley picks up on but Emma is totally oblivious to.I like Mr. Knightley as a character, but he's not exactly my type. Emma needs someone to keep her on the right track, but I'd be afraid he'd be nagging me all the time. I guess it's of no importance, since he's a fictional character and all, but it's still fun to think about."},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"Before reading the book Emma by Jane Austen, I made the mistake of watching the 1999 movie version starring Gwyneth Paltrow. For some reason I just did not like this movie and I found that I could not sympathize with our heroine Emma because I just plain did not like her. I found her childish, self-absorbed and meddling. Since watching this movie I have been a bit prejudice with the story and I never really wanted to try my hand at reading the book itself. I have been lately re-reading most of Jane Austen's novels and I realized what a disservice I have been doing myself all of this time by not reading this book. I dug out my copy of Emma and I began to read. The basic plot everyone knows and not a lot happens but I realized that the writing is wonderful and what a truly fantastic heroine Emma is. She is flawed, probably the most flawed of all of Austen's heroines but the best part about Emma's personality is that this makes her more human and more like us. She is able to see when she does wrong and she tries at the end of the book to atone for some of the mistakes she made about people's characters. Of course the novel is filled with Austen's wonderful characterizations of human personalities, and I think that since Emma is one of her later novels she had perfected her art of characterizing people and making them such wonderful individuals to read about whether they are more for comic purposes than to be a main character.This addition also contains some wonderful supplemental background information of Jane Austen as well as some of her letters and also what other writers have thought of her works and of this book in particular. I love reading other's opinions on Jane Austen and what they feel she thought or felt since we can't ask her ourselves so I found the information in this addition excellent."},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"It was hard to like the main character but it is supposed to be.

The binding and printing is really beautiful and they look great on a shelf. Probably ok to read as well."},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"\\"Emma Woodhouse, handsome, clever, and rich, with a comfortable home and happy disposition\\" is a suitable heroine for Jane Austen's lightest, frothiest novel. While \\"Emma\\" is not nearly as dramatic as Austen's other works, it is an enchanting little comedy of manners in which a young woman with the best intentions meddles in others' love lives... with only the faintest idea of how people (including herself) actually feel.After matchmaking her governess Miss Taylor, Emma Woodhouse considers herself a natural at bringing people together. She soon becomes best buddies with Harriet, a sweet (if not very bright) young woman who is the \\"natural daughter of somebody.\\" Emma becomes determined to pair Harriet with someone deserving of her (even derailing a gentleman-farmer's proposal), such as the smarmy, charming Mr. Elton. When Emma's latest attempt falls apart, she finds that getting someone OUT of love is a lot harder than getting them INTO it.At around the same time, two people that Emma has heard about her entire life have arrived -- the charming Frank Churchill, and the reserved, remote Miss Jane Fairfax (along with rumors of a married man's interest in her). Emma begins a flirtatious friendship with Frank, but for some reason is unable to get close to Miss Fairfax. As she navigates the secrets and rumors of other people's romantic lives, she begins to realize who she has been in love with all along.Out of all Jane Austen's books, \\"Emma\\" is the frothiest and lightest -- there aren't any major scandals, lives ruined, reputations destroyed, financial crises or sinister schemes. There's just a little intertwined circle of people living in a country village, and how one young woman tries to rearrange them in the manner that she genuinely thinks is best. Of course, in true comedy style everything goes completely wrong.And despite the formal stuffiness of the time, Austen wrote the book in a languidly sunny style, threading it with a complex web of cleverly orchestrated rumors and romantic tangles. There's some moments of seriousness (such as Emma's rudeness to kind, silly Miss Bates), but it's also laced with some entertaining dialogue (\\"Silly things do cease to be silly if they are done by sensible people in an impudent way\\") and barbed humor (the ridiculous and obnoxious Mrs. Elton).Modern readers tend to be unfairly squicked by the idea of Emma falling for a guy who's known her literally all her life, but Austen makes the subtle relationship between Knightley and Emma one of affectionate bickering and beautiful romantic moments (\\"If I loved you less, I might be able to talk about it more. But you know what I am. You hear nothing but truth from me\\").Emma is a character who is likable despite her flaws -- she's young, bright, well-meaning and assured of her own knowledge of the human heart, but also naive and sometimes snobbish. She flits around like a clumsy butterfly, but is endearing even when she screws up. Mr. Knightley is her ideal counterpoint, being enjoyably blunt and sharp-witted at all times. And there's a fairly colorful supporting cast -- Emma's neurotic but sweet dad, her kindly ex-governess, the charming Frank, the fluttery Miss Bates, and even the smarmy Mr. Elton and his bulldozing wife.\\"Emma\\" is the most lightweight and openly comedic of all Jane Austen's novels, with a likable (if clueless) heroine and a multilayered plot full of half-hidden feelings. A lesser delight."},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"Lively, vivid rendition of my favourite Jane Austen novel. Prunella Scales interprets the characters with great individuality and spirit."},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"EMMA is a joyful read, made even more entertaining through Prunella Scales's vocalization of several characters and through her interpretation of the text. Her complementary pace actually improves the listeners' appreciation of Austen's comedic plot. Austen's novels, a treasure any time, are given a fine aural performance by Ms. Scales."},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"Emma by Jane Austen is truly a very enjoyable novel dealing with the upper-middle class women of the Victorian Era, and it gives us an illuminating insight on the way of life of the people of that time. Emma is a comedy in the sense that the novel ends on a happy note with three marriages and also in the sense that it gives themes such as marriage an exaggerated importance. Also, the novel as a whole in conceived in a spirit of irony - irony in incidents and irony in characterisation. In the novel, Jane Austen depicts her view of people as social animals who live by a social code based on a set of moral values. Thus, in Emma, Jane Austen shows, in a good-natured way, the disastrous consequences caused by human follies and stupidities, leading to the violation of the social code.The very fact that Emma is looking for \`would-be' grooms for girls she takes a fancy to is undoubtedly a trespass of the social norms existing at that time - a clear example of a folly. Emma's other folly may be said to be her excessive pride. Her pride leads her to dominate, and to see the lives of others as extensions of her own ego, and therefore deny the other characters their human autonomy. Ironically, we see that she, who delights in using others, discovers that she, in turn, has been used, or more correctly, duped.Emma also deals with the follies of arrogance and self-deception. While reading the novel, we find Emma adopting what may be called a \`know-all' attitude. She is utterly self-important and presuming. She pays no heed to Mr. Knightley's advice either with regard to Mr. Elton or with regard to Frank Churchill. She thinks that she can successfully handle the affairs of others, and the high regard the Highbury society has for her only makes matters worse. Hence, through the character of Emma, Austen warns against the dangers of influence and interference. Emma, through her actions of meddling in everybody's affairs, finally achieves nothing good, and even causes harm to her own self.Also, Austen gives marriage such an undue importance that the title character, in her pursuit of husbands for others, overlooks social norms existing at that time and gives more value to marriage rather than crucial human relationships. Thus, in a comic way, Austen depicts Emma's greatest fault in breaking social norms and overlooking crucial human considerations in pursuit of petty things such as marriage.Comedy also emanates from the narrator's treatment of Mr. Woodhouse and Miss Bates as \\"comic characters\\". But through these characters, Austen explores another facet of human follies. Through the character of Mr. Woodhouse, we are brought to see the negative aspects of indulgence - indulgence of the same kind that has caused harm to Emma. And the character of Miss Bates, while depicting the pitiable state of unmarried women, acts as a kind of test for Emma's power of responding to \`socially inferior' people. Mrs. Elton is another comic character, amusing us greatly by her airs of self-importance and her social snobbery. She has too high an opinion of her own elegance, accomplishments, and social charm that she thrusts herself upon everybody without inhibition or hesitation. She also breaks the established social rules by calling Mr. Knightley \\"Knightley\\", not giving him his gentleman's worth. In fact, we may say that Mrs. Elton is used to portray the very evils of Emma's character in a somewhat extreme way.Hence, as we have seen, Austen deals in an intellectual way the follies and stupidities of humans. We learn particularly through our understanding of Emma's faults, and by learning above all, how significant and fundamental these values are. For Emma's aloof relation to others, her willingness to treat other characters as toys - these become significant betrayals of human considerations. The social and moral universe of the novel takes a greater significance because it provides a context in which Emma's faults are not minor ones to be treated lightly, but total violations of a whole established system. The agents of retribution in this world are Mr. Knightley and Austen herself as the narrator.Thus, Austen condemns certain human foolishness such as snobbery, excessive pride and a disrespect for established moral and social values. These are the human stupidities which are purged, through Emma's process of self-analysis and redemption. It is only at that time that Austen makes her heroine rise above such human foolishness and stupidities to become a more moral and less petty human being. Hence, it may be said that the novel persuades us, through a very entertaining and comic plot, the importance of self-knowledge, a true regard for self and others, and also to consider every human action as a crucial, committing act of self-definition."},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"Jane Austen said of Emma Woodhouse (in a letter) that she had written a novel with a heroine \\"whom no one would like but myself\\". Indeed the first sentence (another sterling first sentence by Austen. How does she do it?) paints a picture that is easily understood as a spoilt little rich girl:\\"Emma Woodhouse, handsome, clever and rich, with a comfortable house and happy disposition, seemed to unite some of the best blessings of existence; and had lived nearly twenty-one years in the world with very little to distress or vex her.\\"At the same time we have to disagree with Miss Austen. Readers have fallen in love with Emma (both novel and heroine) since the novel was published, and with good reasonRonald Blythe states in his introduction to the 1966 Penguin Classics edition of \\"Emma\\" that it is \\"the climax of Jane Austen's genius and the Parthenon of fiction.\\" I do not dispute it for a second. This novel is my favourite work from my favourite author.The book has a plot so timeless than even translating it to modern day Hollywood and casting Alicia Silverstone in the lead still gets you a hit movie, Clueless. OK, it's obvious from the first chapter who is destined to marry Emma but our dashing hero, Mr Knightley, is still the only person who ever criticises Emma, indeed he spends a large part of his time in the novel telling either Emma or her friends about her flaws.Austen wrote to her niece Anna (writing a novel at the time) that \\"Three or four families in a country village is the very thing to work on\\" and stayed close to this for most of her own works. Yet at the same time, in a letter to her brother Edward (another incipient novelist) she played down her concerns as \\"the little bit (two inches wide) of ivory on which I work with so fine a brush, as to produce little effect, after much labour.\\" 'Emma' is certainly the novel on the smallest piece of ivory with the finest brush, yet it pokes as much fun and wields as savage a knife on the social conventions of Austen's England as any other novelist of the time.Austen was capable of writing novels with genuine popular appeal at the same time as she flouted the conventions of fiction. 'Emma' is a marvellous example, an easily read, enjoyable novel with a heroine who is in charge of her own destiny and who marries for no other reason than she loves a good, strong man.Everyone deserves to read a novel this good. Just because teenage girls will adore this novel and swoon over Mr Knightley doesn't mean the rest of us should be stopped from this marvellous read. I enjoy Austen immensely and this is my favourite. I probably read it once or twice a year.When you come to choosing the edition I once again find myself recommending the Penguin Classics edition for its Introduction. This time it is Fiona Stafford who does such a good job (though I think the '66 edition Introduction by Ronald Blythe was a fraction better.)"},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"The present novel is about the young women, Emma Woodhouse, who lives a pampered life with her father in Sussex. The family is well off financially and one of the wealthiest in Hartfield, part of Highbury. Her mother has passed away and her sister has married and left the home. Emma's governess, who is her best friend as well, has gone leaving Emma alone with her father. The story revolves around Emma's social life in the town and the development of Emma as a person. Beyond knowing those facts, you should not read any more about the plot until you read the novel, or you will risk spoiling the read. I will not give away the plot, but will only describe the writing style and structure.I read Austen's \\"Mansfield Park,\\" then read some analysis by Nabokov from his Cornell \\"Lectures on Literature\\" and the comments of Jane Stabler from the introduction of the Oxford version. After that I got a bit excited and read Austen's early writing \\"Sense and Sensibility,\\" along with the analysis by Margaret Doody in the Oxford version. Yes, I guess I am now an Austen fan, and it is a pity that she did not live longer. \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" was my third Austen novel and so far the most fun to read.Based on the four novels written over two different time periods, it is clear that she developed a certain fixed writing style and a common structure. She uses the early pages to introduce the families, and other characters, and give start the story. She moves characters around from place to place in part for time shifting. She does a wrap up in the last few chapters.Those opening chapters are an obstacle for most readers. She uses her own vocabulary and has an unusual way of structuring her prose. That structure is a trademark of Austen's writing. Also, she manages to work in a lot of drama and social issues with some humour and irony.From what Nabokov and others are saying, she got her inspiration from Sheridan, Richardson, Henry Fielding, Sir Walter Scott, and the poetry of Cowper. She modulates the complexity of the prose to reflect the characters - such as making the sentences of Sir Thomas Bertram in \\"Mansfield Park\\" somewhat elaborate instead of describing how the character is dressed or a similar description to convey qualities and traits, i.e.: she uses the complexity of speech to convey character. Also, she uses lateral shifts and epigrammatic notations and similar literary techniques. These techniques are interesting for some readers but just confusing for others. It is all part of the price of admission to entering the world of Jane Austen, and it is part of the fun in reading her novels.Overall, once you get past reading and digesting 50 pages or so and have absorbed the Jane Austen vocabulary (words such as felicity, remonstrance, countenance, etc.) and understand the structure of her prose, the book becomes a compelling read. The second Austen novel seems much easier than the first.This was written by a mature Jane Austen and by way of comparison, it is an interesting read but less complicated than \\"Mansfield Park.\\" It not as interesting nor as witty as \\"Pride and Prejudice.\\" The read is slow and a bit diffuse since there is no clear set of protagonists other than Emma, her brother-in-law, her reserved father and a few other residents of the town. The novel wanders for 350 pages, then comes together strongly at the end. Overall, it is a delightful and a pleasant read."},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"There is absolutely nothing wrong with this book at all. It is a very good read, in a very standard binding. You get a good introduction to it and some nice notes which are helpful.This is set in contemporary times to Austen, and was the heroine which Austen least liked. Emma Woodhouse is young, rich and single. She lives a life of wealth and privilege in a small village just outside of London. In her world, and in her village she is queen. However there are flaws in her character which will be tested.Austen liked to write about small things, about daily life, and the petty things which people in small communities become obsessed with. And so into Emma's life come the scatter-brained Harriet Smith the daughter of \\"someone\\" who cobbles together what learning she might at a local ladies academy. Emma adopts her and tries to help her make her way in the world by finding her a good match.Emma's fine world is disrupted when first Mr Elton moves to the village, and then marries a rather smart but upstart woman who wishes to manage everyone's life.Austen's skill in reflecting Emma and her machinations for good, against Mrs Elton and her machinations for her own good are gloriously done.Emma is a brilliant novel and its themes are universal and timeless, it is all about the things in life which never change - love, pride, marriage, status and money.Don't watch dreadful movie adaptations of this book (like the one Gwyneth Paltrow did) the book is much sharper, wittier and subtler. It is greatly enjoyable reading. The introduction may (or may not) help you to greater understanding of her ability to write with a light, sharp pen. Hopefully the story will stand out for its brilliance."},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"i had to read this for my english sophmore highschool class and while most of my peers *hated* this book, i found this book very intriguing and esp. realistic to even today in highschool. the subjects of vanity, friendship, honesty, control, reality, self-desire, relationships, status, and maturity is all incorporated in this book and deeply and straight-forwardly depicts the life of any teenager in any century then or now. Emma struggles to understand her intentions and learns what her mistakes were all about and the reader sees her mature through experiences and constantly learning and realizing her mistakes and flaws and misconceptions. though it was a long story and had a lot of old-language narration, i have to say, Emma is part of the epitome of what ever teenager goes through, female and male. while this is mostly a chick book, guys can find themselves related to the situations that Emma deals with with the other men in the book. i highly recommend this book for people who have patience and are open to the ideals of aristocracy back then. it's amusing, witty, and shocking. really great book."},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"I'm in the fellowship of the \\"unashamed.\\" That is, I'm a whole-hearted MALE fan of all things Austen. It all began when I found my daughter's dusty college copy of Emma from our library because I was bored and could not find anything else to read. After struggling through the first 100 pages and trying to make sense of Miss Austen's enormous character list, I was hooked. What hooked me? First and formost was the very intertwined plot, much like a romantic \\"whodunit\\" or \\"who's gonna do it\\" mystery. The plot thickens with subtle clues as to who loves whom and the comedy surrounding the heroine's naive' and fumbling attempts to become a matchmaker to anyone in her circle that is marriage material. Never in my life have I read such succulent and appropriate dialogue. I was so enthralled I literally roared through the book to find out what was going to happen next. A second reading is mandatory for the first-timer because part of Miss Austen's genius is that a more deliberate reading mines the depths for the clues that lie beneath the surface of the story. Like the tip of an iceberg, the reader can storm through the book and enjoy it thoroughly; then do a re-read and luxuriate on how much richness and delicate detail lie below the surface. I was so caught up that I found myself talking to the characters alternately encouraging them and warning them on what they were scheming. The heroine Emma is one of the most charming, yet frustrating heroines in all of English literature. Give it a \\"go\\" as the English would say!"},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"Emma Woodhouse is an atypical heroine for a Jane Austen novel. Usually, we see disadvantaged girls struggle to find happiness through marriage. In Emma's case, we see a girl who has everything in the world she could want. She is rich, pretty, and happy. She has no desire to be married, as it would interfere with the simple life she enjoys with her father and she knows it would break his heart to be parted from her. The story follows Emma's life beginning at 21 as she tries to help a young girl named Harriet Smith marry above her station. Emma also engages in a flirtation with a young man and generally makes a bit of a mess of things whenever she gets involved.I have read that Jane Austen felt that Emma was a character only her creator could like. I would have to disagree with that. Emma is certainly flawed, but her heart is almost always in the right place. Pride has blinded her to her own limitations but she is also one who does not shrink from the responsibility of her mistakes and tries very hard to learn from them. I found this admirable and grew to like her more and more as the book progressed.Aside from Emma, the rest of the cast was also very well written. Her father is a complete hypochondriac and often engages in behavior that would typically be considered highly rude. Yet, he is motivated so completely by a desire to be kind to others that his misguided application of that desire only endears him to the reader. Mr. Knightley, the no-nonsense friend of the family is admittedly not the most complex character in the world, but he is a very good one and his solidity is a great counterbalance to Emma's wishful thinking.In summary, Emma is a nice change of pace from Jane Austen's other novels. It starts off well and grows more engaging as it continues. The characters are interesting and Emma herself grows considerably during the course of the novel."},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"A good read.

Where Emma Woodhouse takes residents with her father. Emma is clever and yes, rich. She enjoys many of the same things young adults do today do including match making and visiting friends in 1800's fashion.Emma is the main character as you probably can tell by the title of Emma. She has a bad habit of match making just ask \\"poor\\" Harriet. Emma attempts to stop threw out the book but always ends up going back. She vowed never to marry early in life. Besides her father Mr. Woodhouse needs her and she enjoys calling on her single friends. If she had a husband to complicate things she could not go see those friends. Unless the man she married enjoyed calling on those same friends.Emma seems like she could walk off the page and appear in the 21-century, even thew she lived in the 1800's. Her habits are the same as many young women today of not marrying and the dreaded habit of match making.Emma is full of personality even thew she can be a little mean to long time friends and not relies it without someone telling her. But Emma appears real and grounded.I would recommend Emma to young women who are fast readers and who know someone or they themselves enjoys match making. Because Emma learns control the desire to mess with people's feelings.Get Emma today even if you don't read it you can tell your friends you own on of the classics by Jane Austen."},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"I first learned of 'Emma' by watching the movie starring Gwyneth Paltrow - I was instantly captivated by the high-class style of that era, Emma's life and her relationship with Mr. Knightly. After watching the movie probably 16 times, I went and read the book and was so glad I did! It's become one of my all-time favorite books simply because I love Emma's character and get lost in her life and world every time, and come back later craving to read it again! The book expands and clarifies so much we don't get to see in the movie and gives you the original view of Emma - apart from the movie. As a woman, I love romance and tales of older times where nobility and class presided yet values were down to earth, respectable and loving. 'Emma' combines both nobility and the 'down to earthness' in Mr. Knightly. If you love romance, strong female characters and getting lost in another world of balls, dances, society - definitely read this and watch the movie with Gwyneth Paltrow! It's gorgeous and guaranteed to uplift you."},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"Though not her favorite novel, Austen's Emma shines as one of her most beloved. The character of Emma is both believable and lovable. This particular edition is a great keepsake, one you can pass down to your own daughter."},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"Because of its popularity, I believe the literary merits of &quot;Emma&quot; are perhaps overlooked. So much more than a mere &quot;romance&quot; novel, it is also one of the most humorous works of fiction ever written, rife with some of literature's most memorable and beloved characters. &quot;Emma&quot; remains my favorite of Austen's books and is a testament to my opinion that she is one of the greatest novelists of all-time, male or female."},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"I really enjoyed this novel, as I do all of Jane Austen's works. The narrator is an interesting character, making comments on the action and people around her. I was surpised at how much the narrator disliked her heroine at the beginning of the story. The growth of Emma throughout the novel gives hope to every spoiled child or even prideful adult. My only regret is that I saw the movie with Gwyneth Paltrow (and even Clueless) before reading this. I think I would have enjoyed it even better not knowing what laid ahead. I highly recommend saving the movies for after the book."},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"Though exhasperating at times, Emma enchants us all. It is through Emma's repeated blunders,imprudence, and vanity that she becomes one of the most charming heroines of all times. Jane Austen has created a hilarious set of characters: the preposterously overprotective father, the poor chatterbox neighbour, the pretty, lighthearted proteg&eacute;, and the man of reason whose love finally dictates against his logic (to name a very few). Although the plot is at times made dreary by Miss Bates' prolongued monologues, the novel is otherwise a light read. One must not expect to turn the last page having learnt some universal truth, but rather having enjoyed a few good laughs, some heart-leaping, and a few sighs. Emma is an outstanding proof of Jane Audten's wit; the candour and modesty in her novel make it a truly refreshing read."},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"Emma is one of the best books I have ever read.

I would recommend it to anyone who likes a good book."},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"I purchased &quot;Emma&quot; about a year ago and finally picked it up about 2 weeks ago. I was engrossed in the story from the beginning. Although it does take patience to get through some of the less exciting parts of the book, it is a very enjoyable book to read. By the end of the book, these characters will feel like your own family. I learned a lot about English culture and about how the upper class families used to live. Jan Austen is a very good author and could be classed with the best of them. Oddly, this book has a strikingly similar plot as the movie &quot;Clueless&quot;. After you read the book you will see a resemblance between Cher and Emma, Dion and Mrs. Weston, Elton and Mr. Elton, and Josh and Mr. Knightley. I HIGHLY recommend this book!"},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"I found this book extremely interesting, and it held a very unique story line, which seems at times hard to come by in many recently published books. I enjoyed the main character, Emma, whose character was so incredibly... fun, (mainly) mature, rommantic, and exciting all in one. Her want to match everyone with a lover reminds me very much of the premise of the novel A Midsummer Nights Dream.

If this book proves its worth I would certainly say that any of the other novels written by Jane Austen are as wonderful as this book was for me."},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"No one reads a book like Fiona Shaw. No matter what she narrates, her voice weaves a golden web, entrapping the listener with great charm and ease.Shaw's narration of Emma is no exception. Jane Austen's ambitious matchmaker and her circle of friends come vibrantly to life as Shaw's beautifully modulated voice gives each character his or her own pitch and tone. You hear Mr. Knightly chide Emma for her recklessness and &quot;poor Miss Taylor&quot; speculate that Miss Fairfax and Mr. Knightly are &quot;a couple.&quot; Their voices come alive entrancingly.Austen's story is wonderful to read, but Fiona Shaw makes it an even greater treat to listen to. I give her narration the highest possible recommendation. Here's to more from Ms. Shaw!"},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"EMMA, Jane Austen's fourth novel was published in 1815 and dedicated to the Prince Regent, later King George IV. Austen privately abhorred the Regent for the treatment of his wife Princess Caroline and his dissipated lifestyle. In 1813 she wrote to her friend Martha Lloyd, \\"I suppose all the World is sitting in Judgement upon the Princess of Wales's Letter. Poor woman, I shall support her as long as I can, because she is a Woman, & because I hate her Husband.\\" She did however recognize the value of his name and agreed to the dedication. Upon publication EMMA also had its own share of critics. What impressed early readers was not that it lacked energy and style, but that its story was dull and uneventful. Even Austen's famous publisher John Murray thought it lacked \\"incident and romance\\" and Maria Edgeworth, a contemporary author so greatly admired by Austen that she sent her one of the twelve presentation copies allotted by her publisher, could not read past the first volume and thought \\"there was no story in it.\\" Ironically, what these two prominent and well read individuals attributed as a weakness is actually EMMA'S greatest strength.If one looks beyond the surface, EMMA is an intricate story focused on the astute characterization and social reproof which Austen is famous for. Emma Woodhouse is a complex character that on first acquaintance is rather a pill. Austen gave herself a great challenge in creating \\"a heroine whom no one but myself will like.\\" In contrast with her other heroines, Miss Woodhouse does not have any social or financial concerns and thus no compelling need to marry. Therein lives the rub. We have no sympathy for her whatsoever. She's rich, she's spoiled and she's stuck up. Who indeed could possibly like such a \\"troublesome creature\\"? During the course of the novel we witness her exerting her superior notions of who is suitable for whom as she match makes for her friends with disastrous results. It is no wonder that Maria Edgeworth gave up reading EMMA after the first volume. At that point we have met most of the characters in Emma's insular world and are coming to fully understand her ignorance and misguided perceptions in relation to them. She is truly exasperating. Austen tests our endurance fully as the novel progresses and her heroine continues to make mistakes. It is a testament to her skill as a writer and deft comedian that she holds our fascination with the \\"busy nothings\\" of every-day country life in Highbury, a small village filled with endearingly flawed characters. The transformation of the heroine from spoiled and insufferable into a contrite, mature and likeable young lady that you want to root for, is nothing less than remarkable. It is truly a shame that Edgeworth could not recognize the genius of Austen's sly sashay of characterization into a world that could be your own neighborhood. We can only account that, \\"One half of the world cannot understand the pleasures of the other.\\"If you liked the new BBC/PBS miniseries Emma (2009), enjoy the original novel with all of Austen's resplendent language in this expertly produced audio recording. Read by acclaimed British actress Juliet Stevenson, viewers of the 1996 movie adaptation of EMMA will remember her superb portrayal of the vulgar a vacuous Mrs. Elton and know you are in for a treat. Adding equal measure of energy and humor to each of the characters, Stevenson's perfect blending of a classic novel and a sensitive interpretation enhanced my enjoyment greatly. Pop this one into your CD player or iPod during your commute to work. I highly recommend it. \\"It is such a happiness when good people get together -- and they always do.\\" Ch 21Laurel Ann, Austenprose"},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"And I mean that in a good way.

No, she isnt perfect, but her flaws are part of what makes her so real. While the Bennett women were certainly by no means perfect either (the crazy mother immediately took away any hopes of that), they always seemed rather flat to me. Emma is witty and charming, but with a degree of authenticity that makes her seem less like a character in a novel, and more like your best friend. highly recommend."},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"Jane Austen's, Emma, is about an upper-class young woman from the 18th century. She is the protagonist and makes a hobby out of match making. By doing so she injures her companion, because she is blind to other peoples' feelings and opinions. Emma is a benevolent character, but she is incredibly misguided. The only person who can criticize her is Mr. George Knightly. They have grown-up together and their relationship develops as the novel progresses.Most of the plot is propelled by Emma's antics and schemes to contro the people around her. Comical witticisms pervade the novel. The more Emma attempts to steer her peers toward certain paths the more she discovers her own lack of direction. The theme of marriage is evidents as it is the central focus for nearly every character. Some renounce it while others advise prudent matches. In the end, Emma must stop wielding others and concentrate on her own ambitions regarding marriage.I thoroughly enjoyed reading Emma. I also read Mansfield Park and Northanger Abbey. Both of these paled in comparison to Emma. I found myself with a perpetual smile on my face as Emma got herself in and out of mischief. She is so likable that I was constantly rooting for her. She was great because of her fallibility. Her mistakes weer always out of good intentions.The novel is romantic, yet not in an effusive way where there is some Adonis spouting sonnets. It is more subtle and underplayed. It is above all a story about society. I learned a lot about the role of women in this time period. Emma is extremely intellectual and her only outlet for her intellect is in trying to play Cupid. Also, a woman's solitary means of advancing her situation is though matrimony. This explained the emphasis on connections.The only character that slightly peeved me was Mr. Knightly. He is the handsome \\"prince charming\\" and mentor to Emma. It is his infallibility that makes him so aggravating. Knightly was always right and Emma was always wrong. I wanted her to be right for once and laugh at him for being precocious. This, of course, never happened. Ultimately, Emma is one of my favorite historical fiction novels."},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"I am a burgeoning literary scholar, so it may be rather unfashionable, as I am told, to say that I am a Janeite - though I have never gone so far as to throw a tea-party in her honour, I will say that I am exceeding fond of her novels, her style, her characters, and her corrective social satire. If she were not dead, lo, these last 185 years, I would positively send her an elegantly written letter declaring my love. At any rate.&quot;Emma&quot; is a fine novel, as though it lacked only my approbation to make it so. In it, Austen explores the vagaries of the marriage plot in the way only Austen can, with all the humour and satiric bite of which she is capable. She imagines a solipsistic community, Highbury, &quot;a crowd in a little room,&quot; if you will, where everyone knows everyone else's business, and Emma Woodhouse, the 21 year old mistress of Hartfield, presides socially over all. Through and around Emma's point of view, Austen examines the various social, class, and economic relationships that hold the community together.&quot;Emma&quot; begins with a very Doodian rhexis - the cut - Emma Woodhouse and her sedentary old father's society is broken up by the marriage of Emma's governess/best friend, Miss Taylor. Creating a sort of void in Emma's life, a newcomer to Hartfield, a 17 year old girl named Harriet Smith, becomes the intimate friend and a reclamation project of sorts for Emma. Emma, convinced the &quot;natural daughter of somebody&quot; must be, like Fielding's Tom Jones, related to someone of wealth and influence, tries tirelessly to play the matchmaker, filling Harriet's head with delusions of grandeur. Throughout the novel, Emma must face the chastisements of her landed neighbour, Mr. Knightley, the quiet support of Mrs. Weston (Taylor), and the temptations of a relationship of her own, while learning the limitations of her own understanding of the world in which she lives.As in most of Austen's novels, &quot;Emma&quot; focuses on the changing nature of the English economy, and how it trickles into even the most secluded of English towns, forcing a reckoning and acknowledgment of the shift in English society from primarily aristocratic hierarchy to the moneyed-middle classes. That Emma is a young woman indicates that the transition must happen immediately, with the present generation, which is difficult, especially from Emma's privileged, though not exactly aristocratic vantage point, to understand and accept. The intrusion on Emma's peace by such characters as the young, ambitious vicar of Highbury, Mr. Elton, the up and coming interests of the merchant Cox family, the industrious farmer, Robert Martin, and the incessant bombast of Miss Augusta Hawkins (and her associations with Bristol, epicenter of the British slave-trade) provide a range of perspectives on the possibilities of the rising and increasingly influential middle classes - and the impact they have, even in so small a village as Highbury. Austen asks us to read the microcosm as in some ways, importantly representative of the macrocosm of England.I think in all of these points of interest, at least to me, I've forgotten completely to say how deftly Austen presents these critical issues with such decided humour, grace of style, and flawless execution of plot and character development, as to make the most glaring philsophical and social issues seamlessly blend into the comic forefront of the novel! One finds it difficult not to laugh straight through the first three or four chapters altogether. Her characters, from the delightfully disturbing hypochondriac Mr. Woodhouse, to the initially unreadable Frank Churchill and Jane Fairfax (who must foreshadow Jane Eyre), and the irrepressibly vociferous Miss Bates - are all well drawn and memorable. This review is getting really long and pretentious now, so I'll stop - go, start reading &quot;Emma&quot; this instant."},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"The problem is that Jane Austen is so popular - her books are the only 200 year old novels to stay in the Amazon top 5000- that people come to her expecting easy reading. This is 200 year-old English and takes persistence and I get upset when readers are disappointed. It's about a young woman in an English village trying to make matches for all her friends and getting into trouble. Deaths and sex take place way off stage. Some critics complain that Jane Austen ignores them but she is sharply aware of them. When Mrs Churchill dies it's a joke (People's opinions of her improve because she proves her ailments were not imaginary) The death of Emma's mother takes half a sentence and she is replaced by &quot;an excellent woman as governess&quot;. Jane Fairfax's father is killed in action (presumably against Napoleon - or maybe the Americans) Harriet Smith is the daughter of a tradesman decent enough to support her but not married to her mother. Women have no careers open to them and totter on the edge of poverty unless they inherit money or marry. An old man with rheumatism has to apply for parish aid."},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"&quot;And you have forgotten one matter of joy to me,&quot; said Emma, &quot;and a very considerable one--that I made the match myself. I made the match, you know, four years ago; and to have it take place, and be proved in the right, when so many people said Mr. Weston would never marry again, may comfort me for any thing.&quot;Mr. Knightley shook his head at her. Her father fondly replied, &quot;Ah! my dear, I wish you would not make matches and foretell things, for whatever you say always comes to pass. Pray do not make any more matches.&quot;&quot;I promise you to make none for myself, papa; but I must, indeed, for other people. It is the greatest amusement in the world!&quot; -Jane Austen, EmmaThe edition of Emma that I just finished has a lovely portrait of a young woman on the cover painted by Josef Stieler. So as a coworker walked by my desk she asked : Are you reading a chick book !?I quickly protested it was not a chick book--one has one's pride after all--but the cover and her question raise the question : why is it not a chick book ? Why are the novels of Jane Austen, dealing as they do with the machinations of English gentry of marriageable age and their convoluted courtships, so popular among all readers ? We well understand why she should have been a favorite of Henry James, but why did Winston Churchill continually reread her also ? These questions are directly related to another which plagues modern arguments over Jane Austen : do her novels have political ramifications ? The answers to all these questions are to be found in Emma, which is my favorite of her novels.At the outset let me admit that this only became clear to me when watching the terrific movie Clueless, which is based on this novel, but I now believe Emma to be one of the greatest political novels ever written. Austen predicted of Emma Woodhouse : &quot;I am going to take a heroine whom no one but myself will much like.&quot; She was quite wrong; Emma is exactly the kind of misguided busybody with a heart of gold for whom, unfortunately, we have trouble nursing much dislike. The plot of the tale is presumably too well known to need much rehashing here : suffice it to say that Emma is a pleasant and well-intentioned young woman who fancies herself a matchmaker, having successfully joined her governess and Mr. Weston, and so proceeds to meddle in the romantic lives of those around her despite eschewing the idea of marriage for herself. In particular, she takes Harriet Smith, a pretty young girl of dubious social station, under her wing and tries finding her a husband. There follow the expected misunderstandings and hurt feelings before true love finally outs and Emma realizes that not only did she not know what was best for others, in fact she did not understand her own heart's desires.Now, at first blush that may not sound all that political, but the fundamental point Ms Austen conveys is actually not dissimilar to the argument of the great political philosopher F. A. Hayek in The Road to Serfdom (read Orrin's review). Hayek's devastating critique of the modern state and centrally controlled economies argued that no government bureaucrat could ever effectively make decisions for other people because it is impossible to process all of the information that goes into other people's decision-making. Only the free market, which allows for the greatest flow of information that humans have thus far devised, can even begin to approach the levels of efficiency that a complex economy requires to function smoothly. Likewise, Jane Austen, over a hundred years earlier, warned us of the unsatisfactory results to expect when one person sought to make decisions for others, even when acting with their best interests at heart. There will always be those among us, like Emma or like Hilary Clinton, who wish to manipulate our lives (always, we are assured, for our benefit rather than for the joy they take in the exercise), but the results are seldom salutary and never what the manipulators intended.The idea of poor Jane Austen having to hide her writing when a family member entered the room and confined to the novel of manners is nearly totemic to feminists. They decry the system of oppression which restrained her talents to insignificant topics and sentenced her to writing about romance. In reality, Austen, at least in Emma, demonstrates that simple human wisdom knows no bounds and is as likely to be found in a comedy of manners as in any scholarly journal. In its own way Emma is as stern a rebuke to centralization and authoritarianism as can be found in the Western Canon. That her books are wonderfully witty and evoke images of an inviting pastoral past is merely icing on the cake.GRADE : A+"},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"While this isn't the only great narration of \\"Emma\\" available, I've enjoyed it for years.

Though I must admit that Pride and Prejudice is my undisputed favorite from among those novels I have read by Ms. Austen, she does have many other great works. Emma is yet another example of her unparalleled skills as a writer. Most people find Austen's themes of romance most interesting but her novels, Emma in particular, are peppered with a great deal of satire. Austen manages to not only create an engaging story but also to criticize the ridged society in which she lived. In all of the Jane Austen novels that I have read she has created a humorous character who seems to talk far too much and make herself ridiculous to everybody; that character in this story is Mrs. Bates. Though Mrs. Bates long speeches did often get annoying they were not without humor and it seems obvious that Austen was poking fun at many of the women in her society. Though it took me a while to get through this book I did thoroughly enjoy it and was further convinced of Jane Austen being one of the greatest writers to ever live. This novel rather contrasted both Pride and Prejudice and Sense and Sensibility in the fact that the heroin was not an underprivileged young woman who was lifted up from inferior circumstance. Instead, Emma was born into a high circle of society and a great deal of money. It was not her who was looked down on but she who looked down on others and while she was generally well meaning she was not without her pride and sense of superiority. I had a bit of a difficult time relating to Emma's character as opposed to those of Elizabeth Bennett or Elinor Dashwood who were both more level headed and loveable. I always enjoy Jane Austen's novels and I am very glad that I read Emma. I would most certainly suggest it!"},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"Received book in excellent condition and fast shipping. I am enjoying this book, what a great read!

While I love this book, it's not my favorite anymore.Emma is such a fun character because she is so sure that what she's doing is right when all the while she's just making a mess of things. The best part about her is that when she sees that she is wrong, she can laugh at herself & learn from her mistakes.Mr. Knightly is one of my favorite Austen characters. His name says it all, \\"knightly.\\" He is the perfect gentlemen...possibly moreso than Mr. Darcy, even.The characters in this book, as in all Jane Austen books, represent both the follies & goodness in human nature, which is what I love about her writing. This is a wonderful book that I highly recommend for anyone new to Jane Austen."},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"Emma Woodhouse is in need of a new particular friend now that her governess has married. As luck would have it, she meets pretty and artless Harriet Smith, a girl of obscure parentage. Emma is convinced that Harriet is a gentleman's daughter (after all, she did attend a good boarding school), and takes it upon herself to teach her the ways of a lady and to introduce her to a good eligible gentleman that would elevate her station in life. Harriet has her eyes set on a simple farmer, but that is not enough for her, at least not according to Emma. She knows what's best for everyone around. Emma fancies herself a matchmaker. In fact, she takes credit for introducing Mr. Weston to her former governess. And, at twenty-one, she has no intention of ever marrying. She has to look after her father and their Hartfield estate. She is an heiress to thirty thousand pounds and is well respected among her peers. What more could she want? But Harriet needs Mr. Elton. A girl like Harriet cannot become an old maid like the tiresome Miss Bates. Emma is determined to make it happen, and she doesn't care what Mr. Knightley, her brother-in-law's brother, has to say on the matter.Jane Austen is known for creating flawed characters, most of which are not central in her stories. The closest Austen came to creating an anti-heroine was Marianne Dashwood in Sense and Sensibility. But the novel is told mostly from Elinor Dashwood's POV, which makes Marianne seem less insufferable. Emma is Austen's official anti-heroine -- a young woman who thinks she knows so much when she actually knows nothing. She is essentially clueless to everything that goes on around her. Mr. Knightley is always there to scold her and set her right, of course. Emma, though not my favorite Austen, is a lovely story. The theme is very popular and it has inspired many authors and Hollywood producers throughout the years. (The 1995 teen flick Clueless is a modern-day adaptation of Emma.) It has also inspired an infinite number of sequels written by new authors. Austen does sort of drag the story a bit toward the end, which is why I take away half a star. That, in a nutshell, is the only drawback in this book. The rest is wonderful. You will get all of the Austenian elements here: a shocking match, irritating snobs, hilarious social commentary, balls and assemblies, silly ladies and suspiciously charming men. Mr. and Mrs. Weston, Miss Bates, Harriet Smith, Frank Churchill and Jane Fairfax are my favorite characters -- after Mr. Knightley, of course. He is my third favorite of the Austen men (after Mr. Darcy and Captain Wentworth). If you're new to Jane Austen, then Emma is a good way to start. You won't be able to resist reading her five other books. I read this several years ago, but the experience was more enjoyable this time around. Jane Austen is as addictive as chocolate and I look forward to reading Mansfield Park soon."},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"I haven't read a Jane Austen novel in years. The last time I read one of her novels I was very young and it was not by choice. If you want to rediscover Jane Austen, start with Emma. This novel is about a very snobby, spoiled, and at times malicious young lady by the name of Emma Woodhouse. Emma lives in the village of Highbury with her hypchondriac father. After Emma's Governess, who throughout the book is known as Mrs Weston marries, Emma is left with a lot of time on her hands. I'm afraid she does not use this time wisely.Emma finds a new friend and protege in Harriet Smith, a young lady with an unknown past who Emma takes under her wing. Emma brings it upon herself to give young Harriet somewhat of a social makeover. She induces her to aspire to greatness and put on airs proper to a lady of Emma's class, although she's not even sure what class Harriet belongs to. When Harriet is offered marriage by a farmer by the name of Mr Martin, Emma is horrified! She convinces Harrriet that such a man is hardly worthy of her and intices her to find romance with the handsome but vain vicor, Mr Elton. Emma's disasterous matchmaking decison is the focus of the book.I found this novel incredibly amusing! Emma's unbashed snobbery, Harriet's ignorance, Mr Woodhouse's constant worry of illness befalling every character in the book. This book is literally laugh out loud funny at times. The novel features many other equally amusing characters. Mr Knightley, Emma's sister's brother-in-law, who is the one person in the novel to always tell Emma how it really is. The chatty and annoying Mrs Bates, the insufferable Augusta Elton who is almost as full of herself as Emma.When Jane Austen wrote this book she claimed no one but herself would like Emma Woodhouse. Emma is conceited and selfish, but the beauty of this book is that Emma is forced to come to terms with what her behavior has caused her and those she loves. The Emma you meet at the beginning of the novel is not the same Emma that you say goodbye to at the end.If you want a simple description of what this novel is about I will tell you that it is about a young lady's road to maturity and growth. Jane Austen isn't for everyone, but if you are curious or want to give her novels another try, start with Emma. It's guaranteed to renew your interest in one of the greatest writers in English literature. Five stars!!"},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"After reading 'PRIDE & PREJUDICE' and loving it I decided to read all of Jane Austen's works. 'EMMA' was second on the list, if I am being honest, because I loved the movie 'CLUELESS' and although I believe 'PRIDE & PREJUDICE' will always be my favorite Jane Austen novel, so far (I am only three novels in) 'EMMA' is a close second.I found 'EMMA' to be extremely witty, intricately woven and definitely kept me on my toes! The way Austen set the stage for the many different interconnecting aspects of this book just proves why so many readers adore her. If you are interested in reading Austen , I am sure many would say that you cannot go wrong with any of her novels, however this reader highly recommends both \`EMMA' and \`PRIDE & PREJUDICE' and hope that you will enjoy them as much as I have."},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"Emma Woodhouse is an atypical heroine for a Jane Austen novel. Usually, we see disadvantaged girls struggle to find happiness through marriage. In Emma's case, we see a girl who has everything in the world she could want. She is rich, pretty, and happy. She has no desire to be married, as it would interfere with the simple life she enjoys with her father and she knows it would break his heart to be parted from her. The story follows Emma's life beginning at 21 as she tries to help a young girl named Harriet Smith marry above her station. Emma also engages in a flirtation with a young man and generally makes a bit of a mess of things whenever she gets involved.I have read that Jane Austen felt that Emma was a character only her creator could like. I would have to disagree with that. Emma is certainly flawed, but her heart is almost always in the right place. Pride has blinded her to her own limitations but she is also one who does not shrink from the responsibility of her mistakes and tries very hard to learn from them. I found this admirable and grew to like her more and more as the book progressed.Aside from Emma, the rest of the cast was also very well written. Her father is a complete hypochondriac and often engages in behavior that would typically be considered highly rude. Yet, he is motivated so completely by a desire to be kind to others that his misguided application of that desire only endears him to the reader. Mr. Knightley, the no-nonsense friend of the family is admittedly not the most complex character in the world, but he is a very good one and his solidity is a great counterbalance to Emma's wishful thinking.In summary, Emma is a nice change of pace from Jane Austen's other novels. It starts off well and grows more engaging as it continues. The characters are interesting and Emma herself grows considerably during the course of the novel."},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"Like most of Jane Austen's novels, the theme is around young women and how to obtain marriages with suitable men and be in love with them at the same time. In Emma, we have a heroine who not just sits around and speculates on who would pair up with who, but actively strives to influence and guide the matchmaking. She takes on a protege, Harriet Smith, a young woman of unknown parentage and sees into every interaction with the various gentlemen, more than is actually there. Unfortunately for poor Harriet, whose emotions get tangled around various men \\"who are all above her socially\\", Emma learns that manipulation and scheming is doing more to hurt her dear friend than to have left things alone.The reason I read this book as a mystery, is that the reader is left to speculate (without peeking) which man would pair up with which lady. There are red herrings, where the characters other than Emma, misspeculate, to lead the reader into examining the clues to see if it were the case. Also, one of the male characters purposely set out to mislead where his affections are placed, and there is also a misunderstanding between Emma and Harriet on which gentleman she admires, with Emma giving encouragement because of mistaken identity.The scheming finally crashes to a sequence of revelations brought about by a sequence of events. One after another, the couples pair off with a sequence of marriages, assuring the reader that the correct matches were made and happiness for the future guaranteed. Even though the middle of the book is very slow, the reader can go back and look at the clues and events after knowing the ending to see where inclinations rested and secrets lay buried."},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"I've read it a million times, it was purchased as a gift for someone; but, since I never received the other two books, I didn't bother giving it."},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"This book arrived new and in good condition. I am going to try to read all of Jane Austen's novels. I have previously read Pride and Prejudice."},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"If you love literature and you love needlework, this one is double the love. The book is timeless and the needlework cover will be as well. Enjoy"},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"When I first opened the novel, I realised that the book was split into three volumes, which comprised of eighteen chapters apiece. I wondered how long it would take me to get through the read. As it worked out, the organisation of the novel, and the clarity of the language makes the novel a very legible read, and can flow through the chapters in each of the volumes with much ease. It could take less than three to four days to complete one volume, in nine by nine chapters, with active concentration.As the volume chapters are split, volume one makes for a very interesting read, as divided in between the chapters, we're almost immediately introduced to Harriet and Emma's relationship, and Emma's designs on how she plans to interfere in Harriet's relationship, and make her wed mr Elton, of Emma's choice, not mr Martin, of Harriet's choice. As she breaks up Harriet's relationship with mr Martin, we find ourselves sympathising with Harriet, but with Emma a lot less, and our opinion of her schemes, makes readers feel critical of her.In volume two, we sympathise with Emma a lot less than we are critical of her. On first read, volume two can get extremely tedious, because the themes run on, and have a lot less in common with volume one. By volume three, we get a better understanding of volume two, and the themes eventually link together, into something more conclusive. On first read, however, volume two can get quite tedious, and more put-downable as readers opinion grows colder towards Emma, because of how unfairly she breaks down Harriet's relationship, and also because of her prejudices towards miss Jane Fairfax, whom we find ourselves liking, and is through the novel a lot nicer, and more consistent than Emma.By volume three, our understanding of Emma grown warmer, as her feelings towards not wanting to ever be married begins to change, as her understanding of mr Frank Chruchill, and mr George Knightley begins to change. She finds herself going to balls, and centred into some flirtation between these two men. By the end of the novel she discovers Frank Churchill has been secretly wed to Jane Fairfax, and we are also surprised to see that Emma's marital status also concludes with a wedding to George Knightley, although Mr Woodhouse, Emma's father was to a certain degree against this union of the two, believing that Emma had vowed never to get married to anyone, so that she can continue looking after Woodhouse, and not leave.If there were any further protests to the conclusion of who got married or not, or if there were ever any intentions for the centreing married couples to divorce, this is not identitifien by the author, because of the cosy-close ending of the novel, centred about the characters getting married, and divorce is never a theme that has ever been explored in Austen's novels, even in less happier, eccentric, or less committed relationship.Overall, with a little patience, the novel is a very good read, especially, if readers can get through the tedious themes of volume two, and into the merits, and warmer themes in volume three."},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"\\"Emma Woodhouse, handsome, clever, and rich, with a comfortable home and happy disposition\\" is a suitable heroine for Jane Austen's lightest, frothiest novel.

Emma begins a flirtatious friendship with Frank, but for some reason is unable to get close to Miss Fairfax. As she navigates the secrets and rumors of other people's romantic lives, she begins to realize who she has been in love with all along.Out of all Jane Austen's books, \\"Emma\\" is the frothiest and lightest -- there aren't any major scandals, lives ruined, reputations destroyed, financial crises or sinister schemes. There's just a little intertwined circle of people living in a country village, and how one young woman tries to rearrange them in the manner that she genuinely thinks is best. Of course, in true comedy style everything goes completely wrong.And despite the formal stuffiness of the time, Austen wrote the book in a languidly sunny style, threading it with a complex web of cleverly orchestrated rumors and romantic tangles.

However, I can recommend this one as it has a great ending."},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"The theme Jane Austen has in Emma aims to explore the psyche of an adolescent teenager who is past the blush of being a child, but could not cope with the traumas brought on by the war. It explores the emptiness of being without a mother, and at the same time the writer must be writing from the perspective of a young person who knew all the right things to say but coming out short. Essentially, Emma wishes to be the person who has given her birth, but is left alone with her \\"peacock-personality type\\" father who was constantly jealous of her mother's friendship while living. Her father could not survive the lost of her mother again, but at the same time, knowing this allows her to marry Emma to marry off Mr. Knightley, an equally jealous \\"peacock\\" man who would again retell the tale of her mother's marriage."},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"I was needing to read the book for a book club within a month.

Emma Woodhouse is the spoiled, rich, younger daughter of the widowed Mr Woodhouse. Her father, Henry, is nave, self-centred, a borderline hypochondriac and the ultimate pessimist. Emma lives at home with him, looks after him and has no plans to ever marry because of this. She is a strong-willed and snobbish 20-year-old with a rather dull life who fancies herself an excellent matchmaker. Most of her friends and acquaintances indulge her. Only George Knightly, the elder brother of her sister Isabella's husband, John, is critical of her behaviour. He takes her to task for meddling in others' lives. As with all novels of this era, compared with today's offerings, the reader has to be patient and allow the story to build. There's also getting one's head around the language used. It took me a few instances of the word \\"nice\\" to realise that what it meant then (foolish, stupid, senseless) was not what it means today. The garrulous Miss Bates is a source of humour and there is plenty of talking at crossed purposes. This novel seems to point to the importance of status and appearance in Miss Austen's world.

I didn't know that Clueless was an adaptation of the classic novel until I read an article, and hey, the writer did a good job of updating Emma. 'Course, both Emma and Clueless are terrific and funny stories about the trials and triabulations of mediocre matchmakers. Additionally, I think Austen does a great job of creating characters that you love and hate with a passion. This is one of the funniest novels that has been written by Jane Austen. I like Emma, and I recommend it to anyone who wants to know the story upon which Clueless was based."},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"This book is one of many by Jane Austen that will put you into a total field of happiness.

The heroine, Emma, was hilarious, especially when her schemes backfired. However, Austen's EMMA resembles modern day soap operas. As an example the heartbreaks of Harriet and the maliciousness of Mrs. Elton can be found on any episode of _The Young and the Restless_(granted, though, without the strong sexual content).

I found myself liking her more towards the end of the book as she saw the error of her ways. I loved Pride and Prejudice...but this book just didn't really click with me."},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"Austen weaves a brilliant tale of Emma Woodhouse, a young socialite, and her community in Victorian England. Emma cannot resist inserting herself into the affairs and pursuits of her neighbors and dear friends and the resulting chaos is delightful. Emma is indeed a flawed character, but so are the others in this tale, which makes it all the more authentic. Emma's belated realizations of the results of her machinations are humorous as well as often disastrous. Feeling she must match her new protogee, Harriet Smith, with a suitable husband, Emma manages to mangle the situation not once but three separate times. Of course in the end it all comes out well but it is a wonderful ride. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"I downloaded Emma for free on my kindle from amazon.

So she vowed never to get marry, but ended getting married to a very unexpected person .This book is a typical romance comedy friction novel. It started of slow and then the pace pick back up again. You will see Emma finding herself and becoming a better person. I think the Emma character means well and wants her friends to be in high society like her, but she comes of snobby and meddlely. while reading the book I keep saying to myself girl just fall back and fix your own self up.

And unlike most of Austen's heroines, she seems to have no redeeming qualities, making it incredibly hard to read about her for hundreds of pages.I guess one could argue that the book is well written by virtue of the fact that I despise Emma so much as a character. But I'm not arguing Austen's merits as a writer. I am simply stating that this book is not worth reading when there are so many other classics out there that you might actually enjoy!"},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"A lot of people have said that Emma is one of their favorite books but I would have to differ. This book put me to sleep every time I picked it up. It was dull and boring, this is only my opinion. I would not let this book effect and make me not want to read Jane Austen again. Since it is only one book out of many of hers. I felt this book was for a different crowd of people. Maybe I should have waited till I was older and grasped the concept more.Miss. Taylor Emma's good friend and governess get's married and move's out. Emma has no clue what to do with herself. Mr. Woodhouse, Emma's father, gets upset and thinks Miss. Taylor now known as Mrs. Weston is making a huge mistake of leaving the family and things will never be the same without her living at the house. Emma then meets a girl named Harriet Smith, who is not as smart as Emma but she likes how she is willing to learn and listen to what she had to say. They went on daily walks around the town. Mr. Martin a very dull farmer that Emma's brother-in-law works proposes to Harriett who has had a crush on him before Emma tried to set her up with Mr. Elton. Emma influences her to refuse the offer of marriage, so she does. This was before n and got to know each other very well.Emma thinks she can match anyone up with love, if they gave her a chance. She herself has vowed to remain single. She tries to set Harriet, up with Mr. Elton, but Mr. Elton likes Emma instead of Harriet and wants to marry her. Emma refuses and Mr. Elton leaves and gets married to some person who nobody thinks is worthy of him. When Emma finds out Mr. Elton got married she doesn't want Harriet to find out since she is still hung up on him they found out Mr. Elton had married. Emma is very controlling when it comes to love, and this is one reason why I didn't like the book she aggravated me.Mrs. Weston's stepson is coming she is nervous he won't like her and confides in Emma. Emma is out for a carriage ride and she gets stuck. Mr. Churchill Mr. Weston's son comes and helps her get out, he doesn't tell her who he is till after and she is amazed by how good looking he is. She is confused with hr feelings for him after that. She thinks she may be in love but she doesn't feel like she is. Mr. Churchill likes a woman named Jane who is staying with Miss. Bates, a dear friend of Emma. Emma doesn't really like Jane since she always has one over her. For example at a party that was thrown they asked Emma if she would like to play the piano, when she is done Jane is asked to play the piano and everyone loved Jane's when people only like Emma's performance.At a picnic with Jane, Mr. Churchill, Miss. Bates, Mr. Elton, his wife, and Mr. Knightly, Emma's very good friend. Emma insults her friend, Miss. Bates. Mr. Knightly tells Emma off. Emma realizes she loves Mr. Knightly but is worried he loves Harriet. They secretly have feelings for each other but neither of them do anything. Finally they do confess there feelings and they get engaged. Harriet ends up with Mr. Martin and Mr. Churchill ends up with Jane.Mrs. Weston becomes pregnant and Emma does not want anyone to know about her and Mr. Knightly's engagement until the baby is born. Jane and Mr. Churchill are also keeping their engagement a secret.I couldn't really relate to this book. I would have done a lot of things different then what she did. For starters I would not have gone and meddled into every ones love life. Its their life and people need to respect that and not mess with it. I understand she thought she was helping everyone but truth be told she wasn't and it just was annoying to see how she kept going off and doing that throughout the book."},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"Contrary to another review, this book is not property formatted for Kindle.

The use of some of Austen's words and phrases from 19th century England (around 200 years ago) may make it somewhat incomprehensible for many readers, though. Since this book is focused more on characters than on the plot, and Jane Austen's own style is very elaborate, it tends to drag on with detailed descriptions of people and events. This can get very tiresome and tedious. So, if you're going to read Emma, you may need to save quite a bit of time because it might be necessary to read some parts a few times to understand them. Because Emma is such an old tale, there has been a movie made of it to make it easier to understand. Of course, it is not as detailed as the book, so the movie can not replace it. The movie Clueless, a modernized version, could also help decode some of the tough parts; just remember, watching it doesn't replace reading it; as characters were added, and names changed. Also, if you are looking for ways to create more effective characters in a story you may be writing, this would be a good story to find examples in. There are many characters who have very distinct and individual personalities in Emma. In this way, it relates to another of Jane Austen's novels, Pride and Prejudice.

It may be the fact that I didn't like the main character as I had in the other books, but this book really went by slowly. It wasn't that bad of a story and really deserves 2 1/2 stars instead of the given 2 stars, but thats not an option. I would still recommend people to read the book for the good plot behind slow movement and seeing this prideful heroine transformed into a more likeable person."},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"Endowed with wealth, brains, and good looks, Emma Woodhouse (twenty-years old) busies herself with other peoples' lives as she --thinking herself worldly and clever-- goes about scheming and conjuring up romantic liaisons.But it will turn out that she's neither worldly nor clever, but nave! And that in the end the only love match that really matters is her own. Dialogue supplies an immediate image of Emma. In reply to Mrs. Weston's question: \\"She is loveliness itself. Mr. Knightley, is not she?\\" Mr. Knightley responds: \\"I have not a fault to find with her person,\\" he replied. \\"I think her all you describe. I love to look at her; and I will add this praise, that I do not think her personally vain. Considering how handsome she is, she appears to be little occupied with it; her vanity lies another way.\\"From the very beginning we can see that neither beauty nor vanity seem to be the theme of the story but--meddling. When Emma's governess-companion marries and leaves the Woodhouse household, Emma finds herself on her own; that is without a female voice of wisdom. Soon, she befriends a 17-years old illegitimate girl named Harriet, taking upon herself the duties of a matchmaker.Though Harriet is a sweet girl, she isn't so well-read or bright. Emma has her own opinion of her: She had always wanted to do everything, and had made more progress, both in drawing and music, than many might have done with so little labour as she would ever submit to. She played and sang -- and drew in almost every style; but steadiness had always been wanting.Next, Emma prevents Harriet from marrying farmer Robert Martin, who though decent, Emma thinks he's \`beneath' her. The novel depicts the British social system of hierarchies and inequalities, where titles of nobility and the landed gentry are the regents of the majority of the population. Intrigues, conspiracies, and much cleverness fill Emma's head as she cooks up schemes upon schemes to guide the docile Harriet.For this Emma proclaims her maxim: \\"I lay it down as a general rule, Harriet, that if a woman doubts as to whether she should accept a man or not, she certainly ought to refuse him. If she can hesitate as to \\"Yes,\\" she ought to say \\"No\\" directly.'\\" Having formed an opinion of Emma, at this point, readers can see how misguided she is. Emma's father is a feeble old man given to whining and wishing everyone to see the world as he himself sees it.Although he's a benign character, he proves incapable of giving sound counseling to his daughter. So father and daughter agree, \\"That is the case with us all, papa. One half of the world cannot understand the pleasures of the other.\\" To all of Emma's interventions, Mr. Knightley --a man of reason, common sense, and much nobility of heart-- disapproves, and once in a while warns Emma of her meddling. When Emma goes beyond her childish trickery and insults the town's spinster, Miss Bates, Mr. Knightley reprimands Emma, causing her to realize that she had turned into a selfish and careless brat. Much self-knowledge will come to Emma from this episode.The mysterious characters Frank Churchill and Jane Fairfax add much thickness to the plot, which in some parts reads like a detective novel. The interaction between Emma and Frank and Jane helps Emma grow up and find a spiritual center.When Harriet tells her that she is in love with a man of a higher social standing and that he is being corresponded, Emma believes that man to be Mr. Knightley! Expecting to be told that Knightley will confirm his love for Harriet, she's awakened fully to the pangs of love when he --instead-- declares his love for her.And all is well that ends well: Harriet marries Mr. Martin and Emma Mr. Knightley.Although I admire Jane Austen's novels, I cannot help but to cringe at the British caste system that she describes. Titles of nobility, hierarchies, landed gentry, inequality, advantages over the common people, and so forth are all in my view detestable.The founding fathers of the United States of America wrote in the Constitution: The constitution of the United States provides that no state shall \\"grant any title of nobility; and no person can become a citizen of the United States until he has renounced all titles of nobility.\\" So, let's keep it that way."},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"Matchmaker, Matchmaker,Make me a match,Find me a find,Catch me a catch,Night after night in the dark I'm aloneSo find me a match,Of my own.- Fiddler on the RoofIn this romance, all the married characters are perfectly matched: Mr. and Mrs. Weston, John and Isabella Knightley, the reverend and his wife, and the list goes on. No wonder there is a friendly cupid in the village: Emma Woodhouse. This story explores the different aspects of love.Harriet Smith is Emma's friend. Miss Smith falls in love with three men in one year; quite a record even for Highbury. Hardly a flirt, Harriet Smith's heart is pure and indestructible. Bad advice makes her ditch Robert Martin, but a chance encounter reveals that her feelings for him are unchanged. \\"Unconditional\\" is the best word for this kind of love.Mr. Knightley's love is unrequited. For years he's been longing for a woman out of reach. And Emma does not even know she is in love. She only finds out when Harriet lays claim to the one man her heart desires.And the case of Mr. Woodhouse reveals a bizarre and unhealthy obsession. He refuses to believe his family and servants can ever find happiness away from Hartfield. But this actually reveals his own dependent form of love. When Emma marries he won't let her leave the house, so unfortunately her husband has to move in till Mr. Woodhouse dies.But it is not a tale of love unless the green-eyed-monster makes an appearance. Emma's jealousy is the most obvious. Jane plays the piano better than she does. Jane does almost everything better than Emma. It is no wonder that Highbury's most eligible bachelor is enraptured by this pale beauty. Needless to say, Jane Fairfax is an infrequent visitor at Hartfield.Miss Fairfax in turn discovers her jealousy of Emma at Box Hill, when Emma flirts loudly with a man who unbeknownst to her, is Jane's secret lover. Jane decides to break all ties with Emma. This might have been the best plan, because until matters turn right, sickness makes Jane paler than ever which may frighten visitors.But perhaps the worst culprit is Mr. Knightley whose disparaging remarks concerning Frank Churchill at first seem to be the wise counsel of a man of the world. Frank found true love as a young man while Mr. Knightley is fast approaching middle age unable or unwilling to find someone to marry. His constant criticism of Frank ends abruptly when he finds a woman willing to marry him.Highbury's cupid is in some ways similar to Jane Austen. They both are strong independent women who believe that marriage with the right person can create happiness. This is a light read. For the most part, Austen avoids physical description in favor of dialogue. It is amazing how depth of character can be portrayed this way. Jane Austen's ability to make fiction appear real is a rare talent."},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"I'm so sorry, but I simply fail to see what's so wonderful about Jane Austen.

Can't wait to finish and start another.It was priced right and a classic."},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"'Emma' is the first Jane Austen novel I've read in 20 years. My earlier experiences (with 'Pride and Prejudice' and 'Sense and Sensibility') were disappointing; they seemed to be overly genteel and without substance. Was 'Emma' any different? Er,.. no.The first thing that grabs you about 'Emma' is that it reads like a play. It is almost all dialogue. No action, no flowing descriptions of the early 1800s England country ... just talk. This makes for a very tiresome read.Worse, the story (about a sweet young thing who busily plays matchmaker without any consideration of her 'victims' or her own love life) is rather [bad]. Any dramatic moments are very tame. Emma's high society world is so devoid of emotion it is any wonder they bother living at all. And in Emma's world there are no bad guys, no poverty, ... and no one seems to work for a living. Think 'Ozzie & Harriet' transported back 150 years and plopped into rural England and you've got the idea.So why bother with 'Emma'? Purely out of respect for the author, and her legacy as one of the founding female writers of modern English literature. She attempts, although not very successfully, in writing on matters other than soap operatic tosh (\\"gothic novels\\") her female peers did during that time. True, other woman writers have since greatly eclipsed anything Jane Austen has done. But she was the pioneer. So please give at least one of her novels a try."},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"Some of my friends like Jane Austen, but I really don't understand why. I know she's an important part of literary history because she was the first writer to use third-person narration instead of writing novels in the form of letters or diary entries, but an innovative form does not make up for bad content. I don't think I dislike it because of the time period - I like Wuthering Heights and Jane Eyre. I don't think I dislike it because of the everyday activities of the characters - I like L. M. Montgomery, James Herriot, and Ray Bradbury's Dandelion Wine. It's just boring. Emma is a whiny rich girl whose problems are on the same level as Miley Cyrus getting the wrong car for her sixteenth birthday.Emma is the only JA book I have made it all the way through. I had to read this book for a high school Lit class, otherwise I wouldn't have finished it. I have seen at least one movie for all of her books, though, so I know none of them are my cup of tea. Pride and Prejudice is the least aggravating. Mr. Collins, Lady Catherine, and Lydia are sort of funny I guess, but not much. The part where Lydia elopes is okay, because it is the only time in her entire career that JA makes her characters show any strong emotion. And Mr. Darcy is kind of hot in the six-hour movie, but so what.Maybe I would have liked Jane Austen if I had been introduced to her when I was thirteen. There's nothing in Emma that pisses off the moral guardians, but at least sex and violence can be entertaining when they aren't too gratuitous, whereas shallowness and materialism ... are ... just ... boring. JA's heroines don't seem to think about anything other than finding rich husbands and wearing fancy dresses to the local ball.In the words of Charlotte Bronte, \\"Anything like warmth or enthusiasm, anything energetic, poignant, heartfelt, is utterly out of place in commending these works: all such demonstrations the authoress would have met with a well-bred sneer ... ruffles her reader by nothing vehement, disturbs him with nothing profound ... Jane Austen was a complete and most sensible lady, but a very incomplete and rather insensible (not senseless woman).\\""},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"...However not nearly as bad as _Sense and Sensibility_. The characters seem a little less sterotypical here, and while _S and S_ was harshly critical of the snobbery of the upper class the main heroine in _Emma_ is herself one of these people, which makes it interesting. She is a busy- body who meddles in the affairs of others and thinks she alone can judge the motives of everyone else with exactness. Although she is very proud, she is not overbearing or mean (except to those she snubs) and we like her.The plot doesn't hold much to it, though. It is filled with what has become typical plot devices of the romance novel-- the comedic misunderstandings between people as they miss each others meanings completely, as well as the \\"knowing/not-knowing\\" and the \\"does she love me/love me not\\" devices which are utterly over-used and stale to most contemporary readers. Perhaps these were fresh in Austen's day. That to one side, even the plot itself was too simplistic and much too easy to see through. These shortcomings combine to leave the reader with a sense of tedium. It does not \\"work\\" today, classic or not."},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"IS THIS BOOK&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;CONSIDERED an......AR rated book.??..."},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"I appreciated the service I received.

Plus how could we possibly like Emma. She is so self centered and ignorant. The only two times in which she can somewhat appeal to us is when she crys and in comparison to Mrs. Elton. This is a mockery of upper class life of the 19th century and Jane Austen, to my knowledge, lived a somewhat isolated life. How could she write a book on a topic which she doesn't know about. This further mocks the upper class leaving the point of this book as being entertainment. Why put us through 500 pages of pain.

The most important thing about love and relationships, however, is that no one can control who a person does and does not love.

You could update the time period and everything is still completely applicable in today's world.Aside from the story, I should also like to note that the formatting of this story is fantastic on the Kindle, unlike some of the other Austen novels I'm reading (Pride & Prejudice's formatting is not as smooth)."},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"\\"Handsome, clever and rich\\" is how Emma is introduced to us, and a happy, carefree existence she leads, with very little to worry her other than idle gossip. The youngest of two sisters, Emma lives alone with her father, doting on him, after her sister Isabella marries. Their mother is long deceased, and Emma has grown up with a kindly governess, Miss Taylor, who bestows strong motherly affection on her.Set in 18th century rural England, the novel affords us a picturesque, detailed view of the daily tenets of English life at the time, complete with carriages, gowns, housekeepers and social traditions. Austen weaves a delicious web of Emma's life and that of her friends in Highbury, where they live. Mr. Woodhouse, Emma's father, is a gentle, kind man with an excessively considerate compassion to others that often borders on paranoia. He is constantly afraid of catching cold, or falling ill, and lectures those around him incessantly on the need for precaution. We learn of Mr. Knightley, a long-time, close neighbor of the family, whose brother is married to Isabella, and of the Westons, Bates, and Perrys, all families of the area, as they intermingle in Emma's world.Harriet, a girl of less social advantage, is taken by Emma under her wing. Emma's favorite hobby is matchmaking, and we watch her make one blunder after the next to poor Harriet. When Robert Martin, a young farmer, proposes to her friend, Emma retaliates very sharply, advising Harriet against marrying him and \\"falling into lower circumstance.\\" Harriet is miserable, but appears to be convinced. Mr. Knightley, ever present in Emma's life and home, scolds her sharply for her interference, but Emma stands her ground defiantly, insisting that she knows what is best for Harriet.When a Mr. Elton appears on the scene, pouring lavish attentions onto them, Emma is convinced of his being far superior to Mr. Martin, and does all in her power to coax Harriet into returning his feelings. All the while, she is smugly telling Mr. Knightley that she predicts a far better outcome for her friend than his preference of Mr. Martin. Harriet becomes attached to Mr. Elton, and all is going to plan, when Emma receives a tumultuous shock: Mr. Elton asks for her own hand in marriage. Emma, horrified, asks him about his feelings for Harriet, but he denies vehemently, saying that all his advances were meant towards Emma! Our heroine then sinks into utter guilt and mortification, watching Harriet's heart break due to her own wheedling and landing her in this mess.Mr. Elton wastes no time; he soon marries another rich woman, obviously keen to secure a fortune. Meanwhile, Emma's attention is caught by Mr. Frank Churchill, a recent arrival to Highbury, but she comfortably assures herself of her immunity to love and marriage. She flirts with him, but does not entertain any serious ideas towards him--only to find herself duped, again, when his secret engagement to her neighbor is revealed.Overwhelmed by all her blunders, Emma is feeling a great deal of confusion and remorse, but there is a final blow that she is unprepared for. Out of the blue, Harriet shares her new feelings for Mr. Knightley with her, and her hope that these feelings may be returned.Emma's world crashes at that moment. She panics and feels extremely agitated, which suddenly leads her to realize her own love for Mr. Knightley, a love unknown and unacknowledged by her. As she stares into herself, she reflects on his constant presence in her life, her attachment to him, her extreme care for his opinion. The thought of losing him is too painful to bear, and Emma, for the first time in the story, is plunged into total misery. But the tables turn yet again. As she awaits his breaking the news to her, of his attachment to Harriet, Mr. Knightley comes forth with a powerful declaration of love for Emma, a love he has had for years. In a very touching scene that causes the reader's heart to soar, Mr. Knightley, normally not a man of many words, pours his feelings to Emma in anguish. He asks her to marry him, with a pained conviction that he will be refused. Emma is overjoyed, assures his troubles away, accepts without a second thought.Amidst her shock, and just as she is dealing with the conflicting emotions of her own extreme happiness, and great mortification for Harriet, Mr. Knightley saves the day by encouraging Mr. Martin to approach Harriet again. The girl's feelings for him, which had never ceased, finally prevail, and the couple are united.Despite her haughty airs and egotism, Emma is \\"faultless despite all her faults\\" in the eyes of Mr. Knightley, and we can't help liking her, too, for she is always trying to do good, and her heart is in the right place. Mr. Knightley himself, kind, generous, sincere and honorable--a close reminder of Mr. Darcy--wins us over, and we breathlessly wait for things to work out between him and Emma. The author, with a remarkable talent for making us hold our breath, turning the tables and providing unexpected turns, concludes the book with happy endings for all, leaving us smiling.Austen's language, two centuries ago, is as delicious as the novel itself, the quaint writing taking us on a foray into older English and its idioms, structures and expressions. One of my favorite novels, Emma is a delight to read, from start to finish, and a story that captivates the imagination right until the last page."},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"Written in a very different dialogue, sometimes hard to understand what she means the way she express's her thoughts and feelings.

I lked this book but I didn't adore it.I think the characters were well done. My favorites were Mr. Woodhouse and his germaphobic ways...as well as his distaste in people getting married and leaving their cozy little lives. I also liked Harriet Smith because she had a simple and almost innocent way about her...the way she blindly followed Emma and molded the desires of her heart according to Emma's approval. I felt a connect to Harriet in that way...especially thinking back to high school...the popular girls trying to get you to think a certain way and telling you would make a good boyfriend.Emma Woodhouse is a likeable character. She is a matchmaker who gives up on the hobby due to her matches never fall for each other and drama is the result. The secound half of the book is about Emma finding out her own heart.The reason I only gave two stars was because to me this was an okay read. I saw some of the new movie and the theme interested me...so because it was free on my Kindle and because I wanted to try a sophisticated and chic lit type read...I read it.If you can keep up with drama and who likes who...and if you enjoy a well written novel with a long letter thrown in for the juicy details you crave...than leave the gossip behind and stick your nose into one of Austen's lesser known novels.

But with the greatest, the classic authors, I use a special yardstick, awarding the ultimate prize only to their absolute must-read works.Indeed I do think EMMA is done with more elegance of finish than PRIDE AND PREJUDICE. But it cannot match that 5-star work for drama and characterization. Looking back on EMMA, is there very much to the story that really stands out? Rather, isn't it the writing that's the star? Doesn't the craftsmanship, and particularly Jane Austen's gift for managing the flow of narrative, stand out even above the narrative itself?! Very odd.The story is essentially that of Emma Woodhouse's miscalculations regarding everybody and everything -- and, I guess, how in the end these do not matter anyway. The one big dramatic turn in the book is where young Mr. [withheld] is revealed to be engaged to Miss [withheld]. It's a testament to Austen's creativity that this revelation has the cataclysmic effect it does on the reader. Thus does she make a great big universe out of her tiny local ecosystem in which people are wholly absorbed in discussing and planning and brooding over other people's relationships -- that little world in which matrimony is the ultimate destiny.Only one character comes back to me as having been memorably etched, and that's Mrs. Bates, mother of Miss Bates. Her train of conversational irrelevancies is comically rendered in some of the longest and best speeches in the book, giving quite a realistic effect that, incidentally, doesn't advance the story in any way I can tell and therefore subtracts just a bit from the marvelous consistency of the whole. Of course Emma too is someone we can look back on and remember after we're finished reading the book, but that's a little different because we're always seeing her from within, hers being the central intelligence of the story.Striking passages abound throughout the novel. One can make a fun exercise out of just savoring the narrative effect of her chapter openings. Here are two of them, picked totally at random. Chapter 33's: \\"Emma was not required, by any subsequent discovery, to retract her ill opinion of Mrs. Elton.\\" Or Chapter 38's: \\"No misfortune occurred, again to prevent the ball.\\"But suddenly now I must take something back. I almost omitted mention of what is actually the biggest dramatic turn in the book, and one which provides its very crux, \\"It darted through her, with the speed of an arrow, that Mr. [withheld] must marry no one but herself!\\" That does indeed come as a shock! So yes, now that I think of it, EMMA contains somewhat more of dramatic highlighting than my above reflections would suggest. And definitely, the more I page through the book at this moment, reviewing my red underlinings in it, the more I get drawn back into Jane Austen's world of exquisite prose."},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"I am a huge Jane Austin fan and was not disappointed with Emma.

Getting through some of the language usage was a bit challenging, but, if you love reading Jane's other novels, this one is just as enjoyable."},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"I love the option of being able to read Emma online and take notes on my Kindle Fire. The story is a classic Comedy of Manners novel about courtship and marriage for the wealthy Victorians.

Emma is proud of her recent match-making success and sets out to do more. After a few awkward setbacks, she learns not to play Cupid, and that love is random and spotaneous, and can't be forced. In some places, the book can be kind of slow, but if you keep going, it gets better.

You must read it."},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"I will admit that when it comes to reading things that are regarding as &quot;classics&quot; I usually want to kill myself. I find the language and story etc. boring. Emma, is actually the exception to that.Emma was written in the late 1800's by Austen who is known for her work Sense and Sensibility and Pride and Prejudice. Emma is a young woman who prides herself on setting up her friend/governess with her new husband. Emma decides to continue her matchmaking skills by taking on a new protege. Her new protege has a crush on Mr. Martin whom Emma deems as not acceptable. Emma tries to persuade Harriet's interest to others and well it is a fisaco. The first man actually likes Emma. The second man Harriet is interested in ends up being the man that Emma herself discovers she likes. Of course all ends well with all the characters getting what they deserve.It is an amusing read. The theme seems to be that although Emma in the beginning seems like a shallow, selfish girl, in the end she realizes that she was snobby and wrong and tries to rectify her mistakes. She doesn't want to hurt her friends and realizes that what she thought was best for them was wrong.If you are looking for some &quot;quality fiction&quot; or if you have a school report to write, this is an excellent book to read. you won't be bored."},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"Having recently read Pride and Prejudice in under a week, I expected Emma to suck me in and spit me out just as easily. It didn't. I had to work to read Emma.For starters, I didn't like Emma, the character, very much in the beginning. She came off as stuck on herself and very know-it-all. But, I was determined to give her a chance b/c a friend of mine named her daughter Emma for this book. So, I trudged on, and did begin to like the girl. I also read the commentary on the book and constantly compared it to scenes from Clueless (since Clueless is a modern-day Emma).The story dragged on a lot longer than I normally would be comfortable with, but once I got into a good pace for reading, that was fine. More than anything, I just wanted to know what was going on with Jane Fairfax. The outcome was very welcome, and I enjoyed Emma's love-life conclusion.It was a very enjoyable book, though I wouldn't call it &quot;the most perfect of Jane Austen's perfect novels,&quot; as was written on the inside flap of the book."},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"In Jane Austen's Emma, there is an abundance of irony that can clearly be seen. This can be seen in several parts of the book, and is at work throughout it. One example is the web woven between Emma Woodhouse, Mr. Elton, and Harriet Smith. Another is Frank Churchill's secret engagement to Jane Fairfax. Yet another is Mr. Knightley and Emma being in love. Austen usesirony expertly to keep us, the readers, guessing.Austen's use of irony between Harriet, Mr. Elton, and Emma is obvious. She uses it when Emma paints a portrait of Harriet for Mr. Elton. Referring to the portrait, Mr. Elton says, \\"\`Letme entreat you, Miss Woodhouse, to exercise so charming a talent in favour of your friend'\\"(38). There is verbal irony and situational irony in this because Mr. Elton was intending to compliment Emma's artistic skills, but both Emma and Harriet took it as a compliment to Harriet's beauty. Mr. Elton also sends a riddle that indicated he wanted to court Harriet when all along he intended to court Emma.There was very apparent irony in a entanglement between Emma, Jane, and Frank. We think that Emma and Frank are meant for eachother and will end up together. There is a considerable amount of flirtation between Emma and Frank, and, at one point, Emma fancies herself in love with him. All along though, Frank is involved in a secret engagement with Jane.Lastly, and probably the most significant, is the irony of Emma and Mr. Knightley being in love with eachother all along. Austen strategically refrains from telling us he is in love with her and Emma never knew she was in love with Mr. Knightley. Their love is portrayed to be of a brother and sister. It is ironic that while Emma is trying to set up all her friends, she is unaware of her own love for Mr. Knightley.The irony in Emma is necessary to create the confusion that makes this book so splendid. With all the irony throughout the book it makes it almost impossible for the reader to realize whatis actually going on. This adds to the surprise ending. How Austen uses irony makes her a great writer and her book worth reading."},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"Emma is not such an easy read. The plot is enough to cure anyone's insomnia.But if you really think about it you can get alot out of it about human character. Funny enough Austen never married as Emma planned to never marry and both for the same reason. They wan't to stay and take care of their fathers.I particulary liked the character Miss Bates. She was a very realistic character. Where ever you go there will always be a Miss Bates and a Miss Fairfax. Well, the book was certainly worth reading."},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"Unlike some of Austen's other famous works, EMMA centers around a beautiful young woman, quick and clever. Though at twenty-one, she is sitting a bit high on the fence as regards marriage, this is of little importance. Emma the character professes not to desire marriage. This is a decision of privilege, and one that is not seen much in many female characters appearing in novels of this time. The reason Emma has the luxury to refuse marriage is not her strong will or great intelligence, it's her great fortune. Emma need not marry because she does not need the money and thus security that a husband would usually bring a woman of lesser fortune and social status. Emma will inherit from her father, and she already enjoys a high position in society. It is therefore not necessary that she marry for any reason beyond love, and when we first meet Emma, we find her skeptical of love and determined to progress slowly into old maidenhood. Long before Maslow developed his Hierarchy of Needs in the field of psychology, Jane Austen understood intuitively that one had to remove physiological need and want before one could get to the greater things of life, like love and self-fulfillment. The beauty of Austen's setting and the social status of her characters, is that since the accumulation of wealth by any one character is virtually a given, and that to speak of money directly is an almost unpardonable social error, these characters are freed to go about their vain, frivolous lives completely unencumbered by thought of where the next meal will come from, or whether or not it is prudent to send one's child to school or to keep him at the farm. Actually working for one's living is definitely unfashionable, and the best position to have is one where you've accumulated so much wealth that you can sit on your estate, live off the interest and not discuss how much money you have or where it came from. True, social status counts for much, and much of social status is determined by the amount of money in one's bank account-but the greater determinant of social rank lies in birth. The daughter of a character with little money but a good name might still be a good catch. The daughter of character who has amassed a great fortune, but done it in some vulgar way or not married well is not such a good catch. In either case, it is not really the amount of money one has, but one's position on the social ladder that Austen wants us to pay attention to.As usual, Austen addresses her characters with great wit. Of her title character in EMMA, Austen wrote \\"I am going to take a heroine whom no one but myself will much like\\" and sets about doing her best to fulfill this prediction. From the first, Austen seems to regard her character with a smirk and a wink. Within the first few paragraphs she is characterized as \\"handsome\\" and \\"clever\\", yes, but Austen also speaks \\"of the real evils of Emma's situation,\\" namely \\"the power of having rather too much her own way, and a disposition to think a little too well of herself.\\" Yet it is clear that by the end of the novel Emma's character will have changed from one of vain frippery to that of a good, noble woman, modest and sure of her true responsibilities. You always know how an Austen novel will end before you even start it; the fun is in GETTING that far. EMMA is no different. An excellent read for a rainy day."},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"Emma is one of the best books I have ever read. The way Jane Austen displays Emma is funny. Emma's faults make her realistic and someone you can relate to. The way she relates to the other characters makes the book very interesting.

It is about a young girl who is close to becoming spoiled and conceited, but through many experiences both good and bad she slowly turns into a caring considerate woman. I have read all of Jane Austen's novels and Emma is definately my favorite. It contains more humor than most of Jane Austen's stories and is fun to read. I would recomend this for a first time Austen reader, because it is such a fun book that is somewhat lighter and easier to read than some of Austen's other novels."},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"This book is well-written for a love story. The outcome fits the story line perfectly. Jane Austen does a good job on having Emma manipulate peoples lives so they fall in love with one another. Then Austen has Emma going hay-wire because of her mixed feelings and she kind of gets a taste of her own medicine. Her love set ups are not going as she had planned. Then everything hits her all at once. I love it! I would recommend this book is great if you like romance and all of the mushy stuff. Jane Austen did it again."},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"I read Emma by Jane Austen. In this case, the title Emma means snobby, rude, and self centered. This meaning portrays itself throughout the book because of the way the main character, Emma, acts. This story takes place in the small town of Highbury, England in the early 1800's. This is significant because the story would have been very different if it took place in Draper, Utah in 2010. Manners and social standing would not have been as important as they were back in the 1800's. The language, dress and customs were so different back then but human nature is still the same. The protagonist of this book is Emma Woodhouse. She is a wealthy, snobby, clever girl who is content with the way her life is. The antagonist is Mr. George Knightley; a trusted friend of the Woodhouse's and is the only person Emma knows who is openly critical to her. Emma lives with her father at their estate called Hartfield. She was not interested in marriage because she feared that if she did marry, her life wouldn't be as wonderful as it was at the present time. Miss Taylor, Emma's governess however, did want to marry. Emma's father, Mr. Woodhouse had a friend named Mr. Weston. Emma encouraged his visits and introduced him to Miss Taylor. After long talks and numerous dinners, Mr. Weston proposed to Miss Taylor. Emma decides she needs another project and puts her sights on her friend Harriet. Emma, over proud of her match making skills, tried to match Harriet with a man named Mr. Elton. He showed signs of really liking Harriet, but in the end he was in love with Emma instead. Emma finally realized she needed to end her career as a matchmaker after hurting many people along the way.The style of Emma is a satire of social class. Jane Austen makes fun of the importance of social propriety with her characters. For example, Emma felt that the Cole family was beneath her and wasn't willing to dine with them until she found out she wasn't invited to a party they were having, and then she wanted to go. Also Mrs. Elton was constantly made fun of because she was too informal. Jane Austen does a really good job of describing the characters and the scenery. I have a very vivid mental image in my mind of what everybody and everything looks like. The theme is \\"Love is complicated and doesn't always go as planned.\\" Emma had to learn this the hard way. I would recommend this book because it is unpredictable and even though it is set in a different time period people are essentially the same regardless of time and place. Human nature is ageless."},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"When I first picked up \\"Emma,\\" I was expecting it to be as charming and alluring as Austen's well-known \\"Pride and Prejudice\\". What I found, however, was it didn't quite measure up to my expectations. Although I had high hopes for this book, and anticipated it's spectacular outcome, I wasn't as thrilled with it as I thought I would be. I found it hard to connect with Emma, the main character. At first, she seemed like a sweet young lady, caring for others and rarely found at fault. But once I learned of her snobby disposition, wealthy pride, and little care for the feelings of others, I wasn't as fond of her. Her character was set up as the stereotypical \\"snobby, rich girl\\" we think of today--one of whom makes sure to always get her way. The idea of the upper-class's success and how they are, evidently, the most intelligent of people, was the way Austen seemed to portray her character. Because of Emma's lifestyle and family setup, she was able to get most of what she wanted, most of the time. Although she wasn't always arrogant and rude, she certainly did have her flaws.Emma delighted in matchmaking, but, while doing so, didn't think of the feelings of others--which would later lead her into trouble. This \\"hobby\\" of hers often caused misunderstanding and, ultimately, ended in heartbreak. When Emma recognizes her \\"gifting\\" in this area, she uses it to her full potential. Even though she would try to turn things in the favor of those she was closest to, she often ended up in control of their lives. She went along assuming the emotions of others, when in reality, their feelings were not at all what they had seemed. Emma's assumptions led her nowhere. But, through all the distress she caused, she discovered a great deal about herself and her unrecognized love.When Emma's only mother figure in her life--Miss Taylor, the family governess--gets married and moves away, Emma becomes distraught. However, this discomfort soon gets pushed aside when Harriet comes into her life. Harriet is an orphan who becomes a friend to Emma. But, this relationship doesn't do good for either of them. Emma takes advantage of Harriet as her \\"pet\\", pulling her around and using flattery to make her do things. She puts things into Harriet's mind that aren't always true, trying to give her a hope of love.Throughout the many complicated relationships of Emma and her friends, there is one particular friend who stood beside her the entire time. He was Mr. Knightley--an old friend who steps in whenever he thinks Emma is taking things a little too far. She rarely listens to him, though, and must suffer the consequences. Even as smart as Emma was, she didn't have the intelligence to understand the feelings of others. She hardly put anyone before herself."},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"\\"Emma Woodhouse, handsome, clever, and rich, with a comfortable home and happy disposition\\" is a suitable heroine for Jane Austen's lightest, frothiest novel. While \\"Emma\\" is not nearly as dramatic as Austen's other works, it is an enchanting little comedy of manners in which a young woman with the best intentions meddles in others' love lives... with only the faintest idea of how people (including herself) actually feel.After matchmaking her governess Miss Taylor, Emma Woodhouse considers herself a natural at bringing people together. She soon becomes best buddies with Harriet, a sweet (if not very bright) young woman who is the \\"natural daughter of somebody.\\" Emma becomes determined to pair Harriet with someone deserving of her (even derailing a gentleman-farmer's proposal), such as the smarmy, charming Mr. Elton. When Emma's latest attempt falls apart, she finds that getting someone OUT of love is a lot harder than getting them INTO it.At around the same time, two people that Emma has heard about her entire life have arrived -- the charming Frank Churchill, and the reserved, remote Miss Jane Fairfax (along with rumors of a married man's interest in her). Emma begins a flirtatious friendship with Frank, but for some reason is unable to get close to Miss Fairfax. As she navigates the secrets and rumors of other people's romantic lives, she begins to realize who she has been in love with all along.Out of all Jane Austen's books, \\"Emma\\" is the frothiest and lightest -- there aren't any major scandals, lives ruined, reputations destroyed, financial crises or sinister schemes. There's just a little intertwined circle of people living in a country village, and how one young woman tries to rearrange them in the manner that she genuinely thinks is best. Of course, in true comedy style everything goes completely wrong.And despite the formal stuffiness of the time, Austen wrote the book in a languidly sunny style, threading it with a complex web of cleverly orchestrated rumors and romantic tangles. There's some moments of seriousness (such as Emma's rudeness to kind, silly Miss Bates), but it's also laced with some entertaining dialogue (\\"Silly things do cease to be silly if they are done by sensible people in an impudent way\\") and barbed humor (the ridiculous and obnoxious Mrs. Elton).Modern readers tend to be unfairly squicked by the idea of Emma falling for a guy who's known her literally all her life, but Austen makes the subtle relationship between Knightley and Emma one of affectionate bickering and beautiful romantic moments (\\"If I loved you less, I might be able to talk about it more. But you know what I am. You hear nothing but truth from me\\").Emma is a character who is likable despite her flaws -- she's young, bright, well-meaning and assured of her own knowledge of the human heart, but also naive and sometimes snobbish. She flits around like a clumsy butterfly, but is endearing even when she screws up. Mr. Knightley is her ideal counterpoint, being enjoyably blunt and sharp-witted at all times. And there's a fairly colorful supporting cast -- Emma's neurotic but sweet dad, her kindly ex-governess, the charming Frank, the fluttery Miss Bates, and even the smarmy Mr. Elton and his bulldozing wife.\\"Emma\\" is the most lightweight and openly comedic of all Jane Austen's novels, with a likable (if clueless) heroine and a multilayered plot full of half-hidden feelings. A lesser delight."},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"Thank you for the quick shipment!

Book was in condition stated, which is great!"},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"One of the better audiobook readings of any Austen novel. Prunella Scales is particularly fine at delineating the voices of the various characters: the forthright and sensible Mr Knightley, the self-satisfaction of Emma, the tremulous old-womanish Mr Woodhouse, and the silliness of Harriet Smith, are all definitely and exactly given utterance. The dialogue has all the crack and vivacity you could ask for.However, Scales is slightly less convincing in the author's own voice. She doesn't always fully characterize the many distinctions the author makes but her reading still remains on the happy side of neutrality because it never intrudes: it understates rather than obscures the point of Austen's writing. Even so, delicate reticence is always more welcome than brazen misreading of which, alas, many examples abound."},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"\\"Emma\\" is a multi-layered tale of self-deception and self-discovery; as claustrophobic and at the same time as sparkling as the interior of a glass Christmas tree ornament. At one level it's a telling of the familiar \\"what you wanted was right there all along\\". But much of what we see is filtered through the thoughts of Emma - and she is such a deliciously unreliable narrator. She's clever, and knows herself to be so, which makes her (often willful) blindness about almost everything all the more delightful.In the hands of a lesser author Emma could be loathsome. Because this is Austen, we can smile at the happy ending that Emma's machinations have kept from her for so long."},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"Though far from my favorite Austen work, Emma is still laugh-out-loud hilarious in its ironic and witty prose and dead-on-accurate portrayal of human behavior, character, psychology, and society. Emma is certainly Jane's most social novel, dealing so greatly with class and courtship, the definitions of proper behavior and manners. It also has her most deeply flawed heroine in Emma Woodhouse, a brilliant, imaginative, yet snobbish, shallow, and socially-retarded (as in, she is oblivious to social cues) young woman who knows next to nothing about the human heart, least of all her own, yet so delights in creative matchmaking. Luckily, Emma is contrasted with Miss Bates, who knows and understands all, and her love-interest, Mr. Knightly, who tries desperately to guide her behavior. Though Emma has been criticized due to its class-consciousness and its seeming sexism (i.e. in Emma's treatment at Mr. Knightly's hands), these are unjust when Emma's character development is traced. Emma also has the distinction of boasting Jane's most charming \\"villain\\" in Frank Churchill, the gentleman who delights a little too much in deceit. Emma is absolute Jane, but certainly not my favorite (Persuasion, Pride and Prejudice, and Sense and Sensibility, and Northanger Abbey come far ahead), but it's Jane. It's charming, it's thought-provoking, it's hilarious, it's introspective, it's filled with all-too familiar characters. So, what more can you ask for?

One of the pleasures of a Jane Austen novel is the author's deceptively quiet tone; its very understatement sharpens her satire and makes her jokes even funnier. Unfortunately, Miss Scales has adopted the opposite approach, using a hopelessly inappropriate shrill, impatient voice. Given that the opening chapters are dominated by two of literature's most tiresome characters, Emma Woodhouse and her feebleminded father, the result is unbearably irritating. I gave up after an hour, and was glad to track down a far more enjoyable reading by Juliet StevensonEmma (Classic Fiction)- by far the best Austen narrator on the market today."},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"In the constricted world of Jane Austen's EMMA, there is a general lack of a sense that anything exists beyond that which Emma can see or Austen can relate. Emma, her family, and friends live either in the small town of Hartfield or its equally miniscule environs. The action of the novel is more or less coterminous with the very real events of the Industrial Revolution, the French Revolution, or even just some whooping and hollering of some village bad boys. This smallness of space is matched by a smallness of psychological depth. Austen tacitly assumes that good is ubiquitous, and where good seems to be lacking, its normal contrary is not evil at all. Those who show a deficiency of good either are merely mischievous or are incapable of doing no more than sputtering about their evil. Further, those who sputter do so in isolation and do not seriously disrupt the social order. They are neither punished nor remorseful. In the interactions among the characters, Austen in EMMA makes a marked change in the basic makeup of her cast. In PRIDE AND PREJUDICE, for example, she shows only the landed gentry. But here, Austen presents a definite variation in character. It is this wider cast of type that allows Austen to play the magician and make the reader think that Austen's world is bigger than it is. And at the center of this static world is Emma herself, who, in the canon of Austen, is the heroine only in the broadest sense of the word.For the first time in any of her novels, Austen gives the reader a heroine who has numerous grievous faults. Emma is a young headstrong woman who comes across as a huge snob. Emma describes Mrs. Elton, who is more purposeful in her mischief, as \\"self-important, presuming, familiar, ignorant, and ill-bred.\\" Emma might as well have been talking about herself. Readers who note Emma's genteel manner allow that surface patina of gentility to suggest that there is a basic difference between her and Mrs. Elton. This difference is more a matter of degree than in kind. In her harsh treatment of Harriet Smith and disparagement of Jane Fairfax, Emma is more than thoughtless; she is downright sadistic. The best that can be said for her is that in the benevolent atmosphere of Jane Austen, nastiness is not permitted to materially affect the outcome. Those who are nasty are rendered impotent in their nastiness, like Mrs. Elton, or are allowed to improve by degrees through a slow process of self-realization, like Emma. And it is this growing understanding of Emma's own faults that is at heart the theme of the book. The plot, which is really an incredibly contorted series of misunderstandings based mostly on Emma's constant misapprehensions of who loves whom, is the hook by which the theme comes into play. Regardless of who tries mightily to set things aright, the only one who can teach Emma to look inwardly for wisdom is Emma herself. The comedy that results from all these miscalculations sets up the satire which arises from the contrast between the way Emma misreads relationships and the way that the readers do not. Despite the fact that some readers complain that the smallness of setting renders the smallness of the morality as insignificant is to misunderstand why each new generation of reader finds Emma to be an uplifting vision of the regeneration of a woman that is probably not unlike many of her readers."},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"Had this story been written in a more contemporary style, my review would have been totally favorable.

I found myself often wishing she would just get to the point.I would have awarded more stars if it wasn't so difficult for me to get through."},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"&quot;Emma&quot; has been called Jane Austen's most flawed heroine, but I'd rather reserve that title for Fanny Price of &quot;Mansfield Park&quot;, whose very &quot;perfection&quot; makes her one of the most obnoxious inventions of British literature. How can one stand a hero or heroine who is never, ever wrong? We'd rather have someone like Emma, who, for all her flaws, or maybe because of them, is a delightful creature. She's a hopeless busybody, meddling and interfering in everyone's lives, too much the lady of the manor for her own good; but she means nothing but everyone else's good. Unlike Austen's other heroines who are barely in the leisure class like Elizabeth Bennet or one step away from poverty like Fanny Price, Emma Woodhouse is comfortably well-off; she doesn't need a husband to support her because she'll inherit a fortune from her widowed father, so she's free to cheerfully attempt to marry everybody else off according to her own inclinations. And her main project is her friend Harriet, the child of an unknown father (an enormous social stigma in early 19th-century England), whom she attempts to pair off with a snooty, social-climbing vicar, unable to see the damage she is doing to both. Fresh from one blunder, Emma races headlong into another, and yet another, until you want to yank her chain and bring her up short. And she almost undoes her own self when the man she realizes she has loved all along, her neighbor Mr. Knightley, begins to see potential in Harriet himself.We know the mess is going to get sorted out sooner or later; Austen has a genius for untangling messes and getting everybody back on the right track, but it's fun to watch Emma racing from one hairbrained scheme to the next and getting caught in the traps of her own devising. And we like her none the less for it. Because Emma, wrongheaded as she often is, doesn't have a mean bone in her body. She genuinely wishes everyone well, even though it's on her terms. It takes an older, wiser and more experienced head like Knightley's to help her see the error of her ways. Knightley is the perfect foil for Emma, with a wit and intelligence as sharp as her own, but providing maturity and stability to balance her free-floating exuberance.&quot;Emma&quot; is not Austen's best work; just as Emma is a somewhat airheaded creature, &quot;Emma&quot; lacks the depth of Austen's later books such as &quot;Mansfield Park&quot; and &quot;Persuasion&quot;. Emma, along with Elinor Dashwood and Elizabeth Bennet, is one of my three favorite Austen heroines, but Emma lacks the insight and maturity of the other two. Too often acts without thinking, but it's just this quality that makes her so endearing at times, even while it makes her so aggravating. Emma is probably Austen's most humanly fallible heroine, and maybe that's why we like her so much. Perfection is for gods and saints; Emma is for real."},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"I must admit, I had really high hopes for this novel. However, after reading the first chapter, I put it down to go onto a different novel. A few months and a few novels passed and I again picked it up to try again. History does, indeed, repeat itself. Another chapter down, I went to another novel.Finally, after owning the book for 8 months, I decided it was time to just do it. So, I refused to allow myself to put it down again for another novel. It took me about twelve chapters to become involved in any character besides Mr. Knightly and to enjoy the story... but it did come.Had I reviewed this book before chapter 12, I would have said, &quot;No way... this book is too slow and long winded!&quot; However, after finishing it, I appreciate the author and the story more than I did before.I will say this much, however: I have discovered that I am a reader of Charlotte Bronte, but a viewer of Jane Austin movies adapted to film."},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"While doing research for a high school paper on Pride and Prejudice, I often came across the statement that Emma was Austen's masterpiece. Having practically memorized P&P; and Persuasion as a child, I found this near impossible to believe, especially as I couldn't get into Emma's dense text. Well, it's been 7 years hence and I'm eating my words. Emma is by far Austen's greatest literary achievement. The style and language and overall concept display her restraint and command as an author. Every word is perfectly chosen and placed - a brilliant feat that doesn't excite, but soothes the soul. The work isn't quite as plot-driven as P&P;, or even S&S;, and everything revolves around the ingenue, Emma Woodhouse. If there was such a thing as an epic about one simple person, Emma would be it.Love her or hate her, Emma is quite a creation. She's somehow both the heroine and anti-heroine, sincerely generous and wildly selfish, preternaturally poised and childishly weak. While Emma is not spared when she is wrong, it's very clear that Austen loves her - the sharpness of her satiric voice is soften by the overall tone of complacency and fondness. Never do you worry that Emma will turn out badly.In addition to the remarkably controlled and polished language and structure, Austen's voice is more in evidence here than in any other novel, much to her credit. The lack of a precise plot, makes the author's tone much more important - you feel with Emma, while also being able to judge her. Austen inhabits Emma's head, giving you her particular slant on things (with remarkable nonchalance and neutrality), but also looks at the world of Highbury at large, giving you the chance to also see things as they actually are (and gently laughing at Emma's egocentricity). Emma isn't the darling Elizabeth Bennet is, but neither is she so nearly one-dimensional. Elizabeth is a latter-day Emma - too right, too cool, too witty. Emma is more graceful, but human, conflicted, young. Sometimes seeing a character's gradual growth is a worth more than watching her get from Point A to Point B.The lesser characters set off Emma as the heroine more than her own actions do. They are seen as the typical flawed humans, who will stay irredeemably mediocre. Emma isn't really as perfect as she thinks she is, but she can and will grow beyond her immaturity. It's abundantly clear that Elton, Mrs. E, and even Harriet will never do so. As for the character who spouts off the mind-numbing chatter in all Austen's works, Miss Bates is the best of the bunch. What is amazing is how logically it all flows together. Genius.Emma is a princess, a do-gooder, a child-woman becoming a woman. While Emma is a bit hard to love, she is Austen's ideal: warm, sincere, graceful, teachable, and thinking. Her counterpart in her metamorphosis is Mr. Knightley. He's the everyman version of Darcy's integrity and presence, but approachable, wise, eloquent, and practical. His semi-role as Emma's teacher bothers some readers, but given their difference in age and experience, it's only natural. After all, he can't still be learning life's lessons at his age, unlike the young group in P&P.; All in all, Emma will be appreciated by readers who care about authorial voice and respect her more mature grasp of language. It's really quite impossible to compare P&P; and Emma - so to avoid disappointment, I don't recommend fixating on a rehash of a boy-meets-girl plot. This story is richly told and is most definitely about the girl."},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"Who can deny the fact that almost every earthling has taken up the fancy of arranging others' lives as roles of puppets? &quot;Life is a stage&quot; so Shakespeare claims, Emma Woodhouse just finds herself enthralled to such dramatic performances, and being so confident of her &quot;directing&quot; skill, scene after scene of Highbury romantic comedies come alive under the hands of Emma before she is even aware of them herself.A charming sample of Austen's lighter works, Emma presents the story of a Victorian era Cher, busy meddling with the love-conquests of her young apprentice Harriet Smith, fumbling into a carelessly-knit net of pretence, then rising to find her Prince Charming in a quiet corner of her throbbing young heart."},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"The divison of opinion on this page is interesting but probably not surprising. Emma is a book for serious readers and if you go in expecting an easy-to-read page turner, then stick to Danielle Steele. (It is beyond depressing that two people who wrote reviews were somehow of the amazingly ignorant opinion that Jane Austen ripped off Alicia Silverstone's Clueless.....Rather difficult seeing as she was alive in the early 1800's .....hmmm.) Emma takes patience but it's a rewarding read, with all the complications, misunderstandings andbanality of your average soap opera yet shining with Austen's trademark subtle wit and mordant intelligence which has made this novel a classic.Books do require a little more time, effort and thinking than sitting mindlessly in front of Alicia Silverstone, but what you take away from the experience is a much wider understanding."},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"As good as this book is, it is slow to start does not really pick up until after the 150 pages or so. But stick with it. However, those looking for an introduction to Jane Austen might be better suited with faster paced Pride &amp; Prejudice and gradually make your way toward this one.Two things that I liked very much about this book. The lead character is a likable but strong willed heroine with fixed ideas and the author is not afraid to use that to a disadvantage. Emma is flawed and it makes her interesting to read. Also, you get a stronger sense of community in a small victorian town and how they relied on one another found here than any of her other works that I have read. It's a very charming enjoyable aspect that works in the books favor. As far as premise goes, this is one of the more cohesive and linear of Austen's works and I can see the reason why this has been this has been adapted to film and stage so many times.What I liked about Bantams edition was there was no droll introduction or afterward by a scholar indicating why the book and author are important and lets the work speak for itself. What they did have was useful footnotes when the characters were referencing now obscure objects, writers and poets making the book more accessible.But as well as the book starting slowly, the other problem I had was that I found myself not emotionally investing in the characters. Emma is likeable, as stated before, but that was about it. Despite her appeal, she has no impact. Same goes with everyone else save for Miss Bates. The town spinster had me in stitches with her rambling monologues and sweet nature. When someone picks on her, it does make an impact.A nice story, just not a great one. Outside of the reservations mentioned, I'm glad I read it and recommend it."},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"Emma by Jane Austen is one of her more unknown works, and yes, it does seem tedious to read. However, those readers out there who say that they are &#34;very disappointed by emma&#34; are not thinking the right way.If everybody in the world were disappointed by books that are &#34;boring&#34; or &#34;tedious&#34; to read, nobody would ever have read Moby Dick or Les Miserables. (Not saying I think those books are boring, but in today's increasingly unappreciative society those books are considered boring to read).The real charm of classic books is digesting it and comprehending it, and in Austen's case, simply enjoying the satrical humor and wit that she subtly managed to sneak into all of her works.I know, as a middle school student, how easy it is to wander while reading or to just skim over the pages. Just keep on trying and one day you won't be disappointed by Emma. Just read slowly and get all those little gems of humor that Austen employed in her books.Also, who ever said you need to like the main character? Of course, everyone loves characters like Elizabeth Bennet. She's personable and likable. However, main characters are &#34;imperfect&#34; for a reason. What is the point of using literary examples in an essay if the literature doesn't depict realistic characters?Yes, Emma can be a snob, ignorant, and a little vain, but appreciate her for the human being she is and enjoy the classic Jane Austen book!"},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"I've been a fan of Austen for 20 years and this is one of my favorites.

Usually, we see disadvantaged girls struggle to find happiness through marriage. In Emma's case, we see a girl who has everything in the world she could want. She is rich, pretty, and happy. She has no desire to be married, as it would interfere with the simple life she enjoys with her father and she knows it would break his heart to be parted from her. The story follows Emma's life beginning at 21 as she tries to help a young girl named Harriet Smith marry above her station. Emma also engages in a flirtation with a young man and generally makes a bit of a mess of things whenever she gets involved.I have read that Jane Austen felt that Emma was a character only her creator could like. I would have to disagree with that. Emma is certainly flawed, but her heart is almost always in the right place. Pride has blinded her to her own limitations but she is also one who does not shrink from the responsibility of her mistakes and tries very hard to learn from them. I found this admirable and grew to like her more and more as the book progressed.Aside from Emma, the rest of the cast was also very well written. Her father is a complete hypochondriac and often engages in behavior that would typically be considered highly rude. Yet, he is motivated so completely by a desire to be kind to others that his misguided application of that desire only endears him to the reader. Mr. Knightley, the no-nonsense friend of the family is admittedly not the most complex character in the world, but he is a very good one and his solidity is a great counterbalance to Emma's wishful thinking.In summary, Emma is a nice change of pace from Jane Austen's other novels. It starts off well and grows more engaging as it continues. The characters are interesting and Emma herself grows considerably during the course of the novel."},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"Be warned: this book is slow. very slow. i loved pride and prejudice, but i would have quit partway through this one if it hadn't been a gift.However, if you have the patience and fortitude to get through it, you will be rewarded. Though i could have done without so much detail about the planning of a party, or full chapters of Emma and Mr. Knightley talking things to death, it was an overall good book. Emma is very fully developed. She starts out, not as a good girl with some faults, but as a vain, selfish, silly young woman, and comes out by the end of the book deeply and believably changed.one thing I particularly enjoyed is that since Emma was always so wrong in her guesses, it was up to the reader to figure out what was really going on, and who was in love with whom. Especially towards the end, I had a lot of fun picking out hints and speculating, and seeing my guesses come out right.The book isn't so amazing that i would urge everyone to struggle through the whole length of it, but it's a worthwhile and enjoyable read. it just could have been much shortened."},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"This was the first time I had \\"read\\" Emma.

Oh wait, perhaps most important is the love story--or love stories--that touch the readers' hearts. Or at least touched mine. All of those elements are there, and so I enjoyed the book. While not my favorite book of Austen's, Emma is far from my least favorite (ahem, Mansfield Park)."},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"I have always loved \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" and wanted to expand into more of Austen's works. This one did not disappoint! It is a fantastic tale with all the usual Austen humor and wittiness that work so well in her stories! In fact, it is now up there with \\"Sense\\" as my favorite Austen work!\\"Emma Woodhouse, handsome, clever, and rich, with a comfortable home and happy disposition, seemed to unite some of the best blessings of existence; and had lived nearly twenty-one years in the world with very little to distress or vex her.\\"The first sentence in the novel really sets the stage for all the mistakes the main character makes throughout! This novel tells the story of Emma Woodhouse, a privileged young lady who, with nothing else to occupy her time, loves matchmaking among her friends. She loves it so much that she doesn't pay any attention to her true love right under her nose! Of course things don't go the way Emma would like and there are the usual misunderstandings but things work out in the end and everyone ends up with who they are destined to be with.This had been called one of Austen's best works and I can agree with that. I really loved this story. This certainly is the \\"lightest\\" of Austen's novels as you will not find any lives ruined or huge scandals that ruin reputations. It is simply (and wonderfully so) the story of a small, English village where the inhabitants really have nothing substantial to occupy their time; none more so than Emma. I think one of the things Austen is so marvelous at is her ability to really focus on her characters and their everyday lives and none of her novels do this as well as Emma. As there is no serious \\"action\\" the story must therefore focus on everyday occurrences. You could call this a comedy of manners as the characters revolve within a very strict code of behavior and etiquette where everything should move along very smoothly but of course, because of meddling (mainly Emma's) things always go completely wrong! The novel is full of the usual, heavy Austen dialogue and description which I'm sure can get tedious for some readers (I did find myself skimming over some of Miss. Bates' extended ramblings) but, as in her other novels, it does not get in the way and can really help the reader come to terms with a time very foreign from our own. Many modern readers find the \\"elitist\\" attitudes in Austen's books a turn off and condemn the novels. However, Austen is not intending to make these attitudes seem wonderful; if some readers would look closer they would realize that she is really satirizing these attitudes and showing them for the silliness they really were. The main character, Emma, can be a bit annoying at times, but she is so open about her own faults and weaknesses that its hard to dislike her. In fact, you do see her acknowledging in several places her mistakes and is able to laugh them off and learn from them. Austen herself said that Emma was a character that nobody would really like but herself; I disagree.Yes, she can come across as snobbish, arrogant, and overly conscious of her place in society but what can you expect from a girl who has been raised by a doting father and governess? Mixed with those slightly irritating qualities, though, is a sweetness and a true desire to be helpful which really makes her endearing. I highly doubt Emma's personality is that much different from other young ladies of the time. I think the true shining star in this novel, though, is Mr. Knightley, Emma's close friend and true English gentleman (supposedly this was Austen's favorite hero as well and created her ideal gentleman in him; his name is no accident). He is kind and thoughtful, witty and intelligent, but blunt and always ready to bring Emma back down to Earth. Their bantering back and forth is really charming. I only wish we knew more about Mr. Knightley's background and that we could see more of him in the novel! The rest of the characters in the novel are all brilliantly drawn and even though they are not the focus of the story, you come to know them as well as the two mains: the eccentric and hypochondriac Mr. Woodhouse, sweet and naive Harriet Smith, the kind Westons, slightly foppish Frank Churchill and the very reserved Jane Fairfax, the kindly Miss. and Mrs. Bates, and the exceedingly arrogant Eltons.This is a wonderful and delightful story and I would highly recommend it to anyone. It is a light and charming story about a slightly flawed but kind young lady (and who among us is not flawed?) who, through a series of blunders, grows and matures. It is also a humorous story poking fun at the strict code of behavior and the social classes of the day."},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"Jane Austen's novel Emma has been well known since it's publishment. In the 90's, a successful chick-flick movie, Clueless was based on this novel. Even though the movie does not in any way depict the intelligence of Jane Austen, it serves the main characters' personalities. The book by far was absolutely and brilliantly written while easy to understand in fairly relatable modern English. This book is a great read for literature analysts because it serves a wide variety of character traits within their society. It can also be used to analyze the socio-economic stereotypes and lifestyles of their time. The plot and storyline were at a consistent pace with a surprising climax and turn towards the end. Because it is a love story, it does follow the usual typical love story scenes. However, love is depicted differently by each couple and character, which sets it apart from other cinderella-like stories, which were popular during that time period. It is a very relaxing book -- not an intense read. It is also a classic even though not as widespread or as known as other Austen's novels such as Pride and Prejudice. It is definitely a recommanded read."},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"Many literary critics have proclaimed Emma to be the most accomplished of Jane Austen's novels. That may well be, but I don't personally number it among my favorites. That said, it easily deserves its five-star rating; I haven't read an Austen novel yet that doesn't.Emma is, of course, the story of beautiful, young, wealthy and accomplished Emma Woodhouse. Of her, too many kindnesses can not be said. At least, that is the attitude displayed by everyone around Emma. She's heard nothing but praise and exaltations her entire life, and has come to quite believe her own billing. And while she generally means well, Emma has grown into an unforgivable busybody and snob.Emma lavishes most of her attentions on her dear friend Harriet Smith. While Harriet is of a lower status and desirability than Emma herself, Emma feels confident she can improve upon Harriet, introduce her to all the right society, in short, make her a most advantageous match. Never mind the perfectly nice farmer who is already in love with her.And so, Emma insinuates herself into the affairs of Harriet and several others around her. She is certainly not the most sympathetic of Austen's heroines and my feelings about her tended to fluctuate from chapter to chapter. Nevertheless, no conflicted feelings got in the way of the joy brought about by a patented Austen ending. Additionally, Austen proves yet again that humor based on an intimate knowledge of human nature is timeless. I defy you not to laugh over the antics of Emma's possessive and gruel-loving father. Austen's social satire is as sharp as it ever was."},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"\\"Emma Woodhouse, handsome, clever, and rich, with a comfortable home and happy disposition\\" is a suitable heroine for Jane Austen's lightest, frothiest novel.

As she navigates the secrets and rumors of other people's romantic lives, she begins to realize who she has been in love with all along.Out of all Jane Austen's books, \\"Emma\\" is the frothiest and lightest -- there aren't any major scandals, lives ruined, reputations destroyed, financial crises or sinister schemes. There's just a little intertwined circle of people living in a country village, and how one young woman tries to rearrange them in the manner that she genuinely thinks is best. Of course, in true comedy style everything goes completely wrong.And despite the formal stuffiness of the time, Austen wrote the book in a languidly sunny style, threading it with a complex web of cleverly orchestrated rumors and romantic tangles.

Emma Woodhouse, our twenty-one year old matchmaker of Highbury, rates the marriage of her governess to a wealthy and respected gentleman, Mr. Weston, as one of her laudable matchmaking successes and decidedly takes on the challenge of finding a suitable wife for the vicar of Highbury, Mr. Elton. Alas, Emma is not the talented matchmaker she thinks she is and makes frequent blunders in judgment and is often blind to the romantic inclinations of the people around her...What then ensues is a spectacular comedy of manners that is heartwarming, satirical, lively, and charming.Mr. George Knightley, brother-in-law to Emma, does not approve of Emma's new matchmaking hobby or her new friendship with Harriet Smith, \\"the natural daughter of nobody knows whom.\\" Harriet Smith, a seventeen year old parlour border at the local school, is inferior to Emma in sophistication and sense. Mr. Knightley would much rather see Emma with a companion that is her equal in intelligence and influence her positively. Mr. Knightley is one of the few people in Emma's life that recognizes her faults; and believing her too often indulged and spoiled he makes no qualms about admonishing her for these faults. Unfortunately, Emma is often willful and ignores Mr. Knightley's wise counsel.Jane Austen is quoted to have said Emma was a \\"heroine whom no one but myself will much like.\\" This is true for some Austen fans who rank Emma Woodhouse as one of their least favorite heroines. However, there many readers that find her likable and claim her to be one of their favorite Austen characters. Emma Woodhouse is unique in that she is wealthy and well provided for, thus giving her little inducement to marry. In addition, even though she enjoys pairing up her friends and neighbors, Emma has little inclination or interest in finding love for herself and declares that she will never marry. (So much for having a romantic heroine!) Nonetheless, I am very fond of Emma, her lack of experience in the world has made her naive and the indulgence of her family has swelled her head, but she is not an unworthy or unlikable heroine. Throughout the course of this novel Jane Austen beautifully depicts the journey of Emma's maturation and displays her blossoming into a self-aware, humble, and sensible woman.My favorite thing about \\"Emma\\" is the charming village of Highbury and all who reside within. There is such a pleasant mix of endearing and exasperating characters: Miss Bates, a poor spinster who dearly loves to share news with her neighbors; Mr. Woodhouse, such a generous and a caring man who suffers from nervous anxieties about the health of his family and friends; Mr. Weston with his jolly and sanguine temperament; and Mrs. Elton, who believes herself to be the first in consequence in the town and is extremely vulgar and conceited. According to Miss Bates \\"there are few places with such society as Highbury.\\" How very true!While \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is the most famous and popular of Jane Austen's six major novels, I believe that \\"Emma\\" is truly an excellent, accomplished novel that is not to be overlooked. I may not recommend it to someone for their first experience with Jane Austen, as it is a bit lengthier than the others, but I highly recommend it to readers who enjoy traveling to the time and world of Jane Austen whether it be in book or on screen!Austenesque Reviews"},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"\\"Emma Woodhouse, handsome, clever, and rich, with a comfortable home and happy disposition\\" is a suitable heroine for Jane Austen's lightest, frothiest novel.

Consequently, she thinks she is the ideal matchmaker, and makes this \\"skill\\" her vocation, which creates all sorts of intrigues, equivocations, and comical situations for all the unfortunate people who surround her, especailly her young and poor protege, Harriet, whom she corners into rejecting a decent fellow in order to get her someone \\"better\\", someone she will be able to receive at her home. So, Emma becomes trouble, and the initial success is hard to repeat. Emma proclaims that she will never marry, as her role in life is only getting other people to marry, besides the fact that she must take care of her old father. Who, by the way, is an unsympathetic, hypocondriac, complaining, and blackmailing man, who has utterly spoiled Emma. Her elder sister, by contrast, is married to a rich banker and lives in London. The rest of the characters is also very well rounded, especially the family friend Mr. Knightley, who is always lecturing Emma about her meddlesome habits; Mrs. and Miss Bates, a couple of neighbors who are poor but close to the family (Miss Bates speaks constantly and erratically, which makes many people avoid her), and the unlikable Elton and Frank Churchill, who Emma believes is in love with her.The book is funny and written with the mastery of Austen, who manages as always to create a closed world, bounded by very strict rules of conduct and prejudice, in an ecnhanting setting. Emma is definitely a spoiled brat, kind but arrogant, and her delusion about matchmaking unbearable, but nevertheless she is an attractive character, and her youth makes the reader forgive her faults."},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"While this novel is certainly a cut above most modern fiction, Emma is not Austen's best work. In contrast with Pride and Prejudice and Northanger Abbey's tight narrative structures, Emma is long and rambling. The narrative presents many insignificant details even as it leaves out more important scenes. For example, we are privy to several examples of Miss Bates' idle chatter, but Harriet's capture by the gypsies and Robert Martin's proposal happen offstage. Although Miss Bates is supposed to be a lovable character, I found myself putting the book down during one of her conversations and not returning to it for several months (which is unusual, as I read Northanger Abbey in a day).Nevertheless, the novel does have its redeeming features. Several people have noted that they disliked Emma's snobbishness, but we're not meant to adore her, and the author gently pokes fun at her elitism. Prior to the book's publication, Austen wrote that she feared no one else would love Emma as much as she did, so the protagonist is not intended to be a likeable character. Her flaws balance out her good traits, such as her wit and liveliness. Her dialogues with Mr. Knightley and even Harriet contain subtle zingers that may not be readily apparent to a 20th century reader the first time around. If you think you didn't like this book, you will appreciate it more on a second reading (and you can always skim the boring parts, like poor Miss Bates!). You will learn a great deal about the classist ideology lurking beneath Regency Britain's prim veneer. And if nothing else, reading with the intent to pick up on the characters' oblique but witty repartee will help you sharpen your own wit and social skills."},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"Emma Woodhouse is an atypical heroine for a Jane Austen novel. Usually, we see disadvantaged girls struggle to find happiness through marriage. In Emma's case, we see a girl who has everything in the world she could want. She is rich, pretty, and happy. She has no desire to be married, as it would interfere with the simple life she enjoys with her father and she knows it would break his heart to be parted from her. The story follows Emma's life beginning at 21 as she tries to help a young girl named Harriet Smith marry above her station. Emma also engages in a flirtation with a young man and generally makes a bit of a mess of things whenever she gets involved.I have read that Jane Austen felt that Emma was a character only her creator could like. I would have to disagree with that. Emma is certainly flawed, but her heart is almost always in the right place. Pride has blinded her to her own limitations but she is also one who does not shrink from the responsibility of her mistakes and tries very hard to learn from them. I found this admirable and grew to like her more and more as the book progressed.Aside from Emma, the rest of the cast was also very well written. Her father is a complete hypochondriac and often engages in behavior that would typically be considered highly rude. Yet, he is motivated so completely by a desire to be kind to others that his misguided application of that desire only endears him to the reader. Mr. Knightley, the no-nonsense friend of the family is admittedly not the most complex character in the world, but he is a very good one and his solidity is a great counterbalance to Emma's wishful thinking.In summary, Emma is a nice change of pace from Jane Austen's other novels. It starts off well and grows more engaging as it continues. The characters are interesting and Emma herself grows considerably during the course of the novel."},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"Emma Woodhouse, \\"handsome, clever, and rich,\\" is the 21-year-old daughter of the elderly owner of Hartfield, the largest estate in Highbury. Though only a couple of hours away from London by carriage, Highbury regards itself as an isolated and virtually self-contained community, with the Woodhouse family the center of social life and at the top of its social ladder. Emma, doting on her hypochondriac father, whom she represents to the outside world, has grown up without a mother's softening influence, and at twenty-one, she is bright, willful, and not a little spoiled. Having too little to do to keep out of trouble, Emma's hobby is matchmaking, \\"the greatest amusement in the world,.\\" Unfortunately, her sophistication in the social graces does not extend to much insight into human beings.Taking Harriet Smith, a young woman of \\"questionable birth\\" under her wing, Emma makes Harriet her \\"project,\\" educating her in the social graces, convincing Harriet not to marry farmer Robert Martin, who has courted her, and ultimately persuading Harriet, wrongly, that the vicar, Mr. Elton, is falling in love with her. Bored and without a large circle of \\"suitable\\" friends, Emma is an incorrigible meddler, playing with the lives of those around her, snubbing those she considers inferior, gossiping about others in an attempt to divert attention to herself, and misreading intentions. Only Mr. Knightly, sixteen years older than Emma and a friend of her father, stands up to Emma and tells her what he thinks of her behavior, and it is through him that she eventually begins to grow.Love and the formal protocol of marriage are a major focus here, with marriage more often a merger of \\"appropriate\\" families than the result of romance or passion. Class distinctions, acknowledged by all levels of society, limit both personal friendships and romantic possibilities, and as Emma's matchmaking fails again and again, causing grief to many of her victims, Emma begins to recognize that her pride, willfulness, and love of power over others have made her oblivious to her own faults. Austen shines in her depiction of Emma and her upperclass friends, gently satirizing their weaknesses but leaving room for them to learn from their mistakes-if only they can learn to recognize the ironies in their lives. Though Emma may be, in some ways, Austen's least charming heroine, she is certainly vibrant and, with her annoying faults, a most realistic one. Mary Whipple"},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"&quot;Emma&quot; was the first Jane Austen book I read, and after reading all of Austen's novels, it is still my favorite. The plot is amusing, and it kept my interest from beginning to end. Indeed, I couldn't put the book down until I finished it. For those who think that it is too difficult a read, try it. I was only 12 the first time I read it, and I enjoyed it immensely. Also, I would like to set the record straight concerning the movie Clueless, which was based on &quot;Emma&quot;. Clueless was made in the 1990's, while Jane Austen was born in the late 1700's and died in her forties. It is rather obvious that &quot;Emma&quot; came first. I know this at the age of 17, and can only wonder where certain reviewers were during English class. Back to the book, though - I loved it and would recommend it to anyone!"},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"Emma is the first Jane Austen novel I ever read, and 13 years later it's still my favorite. It's also the most accessible, easy to read Austen novel. I literally could not put this book down. I thought all the characters, especially Emma, were wonderful. The title character, whie arrogant, was well meaning in her attempts to play matchmaker for the people around her. I could really relate to her, because I recognized that I've met people like her. She was at once funny, well intentioned, spoiled, controlling, and sweet. This book is really funny. The introduction is very useful in helping the reader keep all the events of the story straight. As well, it gives readers insight into the times, and into Austen's views about society. I really appreciated having the cast of characters printed at the beginning of the book, because there are alot (sometimes, it seems, too many) characters inhabiting the book. Because each person in the novel is so distinct and well drawn, the occasional confusion is worth it. I highly reccommend this book to anyone!"},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"Jane Austen's \\"Emma\\" is a good read. I consider Austen a mistress of dialogue and of creating very colourful, vivid and almost touchable characters. These two points make \\"Emma\\" a very enjoyable novel.The only thing I found weak - as it is in other Austen's books - is the sudden turns in the story, events that have an incredibly atrificial (or deus ex machina) taste to them.It almost feels like Austen has tried to twist the entangled situations in such a way as to ensure a undisputable happy ending.Despite of the shaky storyline, the main character - Emma Woodhouse - comes through as credible and realistic. She has her faults, she makes mistakes, and inspite her wit and intelligence, she is young and inexperienced and this makes her very much like any other young woman in the 21st centrury - a young woman who has to go through some blunders in order to learn about life and herself.It is Emma's character that makes the whole book worthy of purchasing and adding to one's library. I would suggest \\"Emma\\" above any other Jane Austen's classics for it is obviously the most mature book of them all."},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"I first read this novel when I was a teenager, and while I liked it because it was Jane Austen, I was so exasperated by Emma herself that I left it alone after that. I have just re-read it, and realized that I just didn't get it first time round. Fun is being poked at Emma the entire time by Austen - Emma's words and thoughts are her own, reported through the ironic medium of Austen's prose. It is Emma who is too snooty to go to the Coles' party, for instance, and Emma who is mocked by Austen both for that and for her fall from that supposed high ground when she sees that she will be bored and alone if she doesn't go. Austen doesn't say it, she merely reports Emma, and we have to work it out. It is all perfectly done; the perfection of it makes me catch my breath. If you didn't like it, try it again."},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"For me, reading Jane Austen's novel EMMA is a delight. However, not all readers have been in agreement with me over the years including Jane Austen herself who warned her family before publication \\"I am going to take a heroine whom no-one but myself will much like.\\" She was of course making fun of herself in her own satirical way; - her critics on the other hand, were quite serious. When the book was published in 1815, Austen sent a copy to her contemporary author Maria Edgeworth who gave up reading the novel after the first volume, passing it on to friend and complaining, \\"There is no story in it.\\" Others had mixed feelings offering both praise and blame for its focus on the ordinary details of a few families in a country village. One important advocate of Emma was Sir Walter Scott, whose essay published in the Quarterly Review of 1815 represents the most important criticism on Austen's writing during her lifetime. Even though the review was published anonymously, she must have been quite giddy when the reviewer heralded her EMMA as a \`new style of novel' designed to \`suit modern times'. Heady stuff to be sure. When it was later learned that Scott had contributed the review, it would placed Jane Austen in a whole other league of writers.EMMA can be enjoyed on different levels, and for pure humour and witty dialogue it may reign as Austen's supreme triumph. Just Google quotes from EMMA and you might agree that it has the best bon mots of any of her novels. Modern critics claim it as her masterpiece, and I do not doubt it. PRIDE AND PREJUDICE may be the most beloved and well know of her works, but Emma represents Austen at the height of her writing skill and power as a story teller. Like some of Austen's contemporaries, the modern reader might find challenges in its minutiae and supposed lack of story. Not to worry. There are many sources available to assist in understanding Jane Austen's subtle and often witty dialogue, her unique characterizations, and help place the novel in historical context.One source to consider is the new 2008 edition of EMMA, by Oxford World's Classics. Recently revised in 2003, this re-issue contains the same supplemental and textual material with a newly designed cover. For a reader seeking a medium level of support to help them along in their understanding you will be happy to find a thoughtful 23 page introduction by associate Professor of English and Women's Studies Adela Pinch of the University of Michigan. The essay contains a brief introduction, and segments on Shopping and Suburbia, Narrative Voices: Gossip and the Individual, The Politics of Knowledge, and Emma: Much Ado About Nothing?. Her emphasis is on understanding Austen's choice of writing about the ordinary and extraordinary aspects of the lives of its heroine Emma Woodhouse and her circle of family and friends in Highbury, a small English village in which she sets about to match make for all of its singletons blundering hilariously along the way. I particularly appreciated Prof. Pinch's positive comments throughout the essay.\\"Austen makes voices stick in the mind through her use of free indirect discourse, which makes character's voice seem indelible, capable of soaking into other beings. But she also uses the same technique for representing thought. Her cultivation of this mode of representing her heroines' minds has made her novels crucial to the history of the English novel, markers of a movement when the novel as a literary genre perfects its inward turn, and begins to claim human psychology as its territory. Above all it creates the feeling of intimacy with her heroines that many readers prize.\\" Page xvii-xviiiIf I may be so bold and interject as the everyman Austen reader for a moment, parts of this essay are scholarly and touch on areas beyond my immediate understanding, especially when she delves into the philosophical and psychological pedantry. For the most part, Prof. Pinch's essay is written in accessible language and is reverent and admiring to the author and the heroine. I found this outlook refreshing since the heroine Emma, and the novel EMMA have received some criticisms for their shortcomings over the centuries. The novel is about so much more than the \\"no story\\" that Maria Edgeworth hastily condemned it to be. I especially adore Emma's little friend Harriet Smith and think her much maligned in the recent movie adaptations, and well - can there ever be enough praise bestowed upon Mrs. Elton? She is comedic genius and worthy of a nomination to the literary comedy hall of fame.Professor Pinch has also supplied the helpful explanatory notes throughout the text which are numbered on the page allowing the reader to refer to the back of the book for explanation. Honestly, I prefer them to be footnoted at the bottom of the page instead of riffling back and forth, but that is a quibble on convenience. The remainder of the supplemental material; Biography of Jane Austen, Note on the Text, Select Bibliography, Chronology of Jane Austen, Appendix A: Rank and Social Status, and Appendix B: Dancing are repeated throughout the other Jane Austen editions in this series.This Oxford edition is a sweet little volume at an incredible price if you are in the market for a middlin amount of supplemental material from reputable sources containing an authorative text edited for the modern reader. If you enjoy matchless wit and irony, unforgettable characters, and a unique story that turns the everyday imaginings of a young Georgian era woman into an extraordinary story filled with a comedy of manners and romance, then take note; - Miss Emma Woodhouse commands you to purchase this book immediately!Laurel Ann, Austenprose"},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"Prunella Scales is wonderfully talented. Good separation of characters. Her rendition of Miss Bates is incredible - leaves one breathless."},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"I've read Sense and Sensability, Pride and Prejudice, Northanger Abbey, and most recently Emma, and while all of them are wonderful, this one was, to me, the most engaging. The characters are all really well developed, especially Emma, who is portrayed as incredibly human. You always like and sympathize with her, but sometimes you want to slap her. The story is, briefly, about Emma, who lives with her father Mr. Woodhouse. She has vowed herself never to marry, but loves to play matchmaker. She has just matched her former governess, &quot;Poor Miss Taylor,&quot; up with Mr. Weston, and is quite proud of her success. Mr. Knightly, a neighbor and the brother of her older sister's (Isabella) husband (Mr. John Knightly), warns her about meddling, but she doesn't take him seriously. Soon Emma befriends a young girl of unknown parentage (she is illegitimate and her father, while providing for her care, remains anonymous) named Harriet. Harriet is in love with a farmer named Robert Martin, but Emma thinks that he is beneath her, so manages to talk her out of accepting his marraige proposal. Instead, thinking that she would be a perfect match for Mr. Elton, another local gentleman, encourages Harriet to set her sights on him. Harriet actually talks herself into being in love with him, until everything is ruined because Mr. Elton turns out to be in love with Emma instead. She turns him down and he leaves town, soon returning with a wife, whom no one likes.Meanwhile, Mr. Weston's son (Mr. Frank Churchill), who was sent to be raised by his aunt when his mother died, comes to visit his father and flirts constantly with Emma, who is flattered and flirts back. She begins to think she might be in love with him, but when he leaves town again to go back to his aunt and uncle, her feelings cool down. Another out of town visitor, Jane Fairfax, who is the niece of the rather irritating Mrs. and Miss Bates, has also come. Jane is destined to become a governess because she does not come from a wealthy family. Emma and Frank had been speculating about her, because Emma thought she was secretly in love with her friend's husband and that was the reason for her coming, and Frank said he agreed. Emma is jealous of Jane anyway because she is more talented and accomplished than Emma, but whenever she says anything against her to Mr. Knightly, he defends her. Mrs. Weston tells Emma that she thinks Mr. Knightly is in love with Jane, which horrifies Emma because if Knightly marries, then her nephew would no longer be the heir of his estate. Meanwhile Frank Churchill returns and Emma thinks that Harriet is now in love with him. Harriet does say that she has feelings for a certain gentleman that they both know, and that she thinks Emma knows the one she means, and asks for advice about whether she has a chance and should persue it. Emma encourages her, and meanwhile realizes that she has feelings for Mr. Knightley. Then another problem arises. I don't want to say too much more because I don't want to spoil the story if you don't know it, but the plot becomes even more complicated before everything is resolved. But it's a great book and if you are only going to read one Jane Austen novel, this is the one to pick."},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"\\"Emma Woodhouse, handsome, clever, and rich, with a comfortable home and happy disposition\\" is a suitable heroine for Jane Austen's lightest, frothiest novel. While \\"Emma\\" is not nearly as dramatic as Austen's other works, it is an enchanting little comedy of manners in which a young woman with the best intentions meddles in others' love lives... with only the faintest idea of how people (including herself) actually feel.After matchmaking her governess Miss Taylor, Emma Woodhouse considers herself a natural at bringing people together. She soon becomes best buddies with Harriet, a sweet (if not very bright) young woman who is the \\"natural daughter of somebody.\\" Emma becomes determined to pair Harriet with someone deserving of her (even derailing a gentleman-farmer's proposal), such as the smarmy, charming Mr. Elton. When Emma's latest attempt falls apart, she finds that getting someone OUT of love is a lot harder than getting them INTO it.At around the same time, two people that Emma has heard about her entire life have arrived -- the charming Frank Churchill, and the reserved, remote Miss Jane Fairfax (along with rumors of a married man's interest in her). Emma begins a flirtatious friendship with Frank, but for some reason is unable to get close to Miss Fairfax. As she navigates the secrets and rumors of other people's romantic lives, she begins to realize who she has been in love with all along.Out of all Jane Austen's books, \\"Emma\\" is the frothiest and lightest -- there aren't any major scandals, lives ruined, reputations destroyed, financial crises or sinister schemes. There's just a little intertwined circle of people living in a country village, and how one young woman tries to rearrange them in the manner that she genuinely thinks is best. Of course, in true comedy style everything goes completely wrong.And despite the formal stuffiness of the time, Austen wrote the book in a languidly sunny style, threading it with a complex web of cleverly orchestrated rumors and romantic tangles. There's some moments of seriousness (such as Emma's rudeness to kind, silly Miss Bates), but it's also laced with some entertaining dialogue (\\"Silly things do cease to be silly if they are done by sensible people in an impudent way\\") and barbed humor (the ridiculous and obnoxious Mrs. Elton).Modern readers tend to be squicked by the idea of Emma falling for a guy who's known her literally all her life, but Austen makes the subtle relationship between Knightley and Emma one of affectionate bickering and beautiful romantic moments (\\"If I loved you less, I might be able to talk about it more. But you know what I am. You hear nothing but truth from me\\").Emma is a character who is likable despite her flaws -- she's young, bright, well-meaning and assured of her own knowledge of the human heart, but also naive and sometimes snobbish. She flits around like a clumsy butterfly, but is endearing even when she screws up. Mr. Knightley is her ideal counterpoint, being enjoyably blunt and sharp-witted at all times. And there's a fairly colorful supporting cast -- Emma's neurotic but sweet dad, her kindly ex-governess, the charming Frank, the fluttery Miss Bates, and even the smarmy Mr. Elton and his bulldozing wife.\\"Emma\\" is the most lightweight and openly comedic of all Jane Austen's novels, with a likable (if clueless) heroine and a multilayered plot full of half-hidden feelings. A lesser delight."},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"I read this book in college and I reread it every so often. Emma is a funny, light story that is more than a little touching.

Emma has all the Jane Austen hallmarks - wit, exuberance, and laugh out loud moments, coupled with realistic, well drawn characters and a real feeling of being in the Regency (which is hardly surprising, as that's when the book was written).Emma is a spoiled young woman who has everything she can possibly want in life: a doting father who lets her do as she pleases, friends, family and a beautiful home. She is understandably please with herself, and this leads to complications as she tries to sort out everyone else's life. She's meddling and interfering, and yet so well meaning she comes across as a likeable character rather than as a busybody.She takes up Harriet, a young woman of doubtful birth, and encourages her to set her sights on Mr Elton, the local vicar, as a future husband. Poor Harriet is completely bowled over by Emma, and is persuaded to like Mr Elton over the farmer's son she is really in love with. Emma is oblivious to the fact that Harriet and Mr Elton are completely unsuited, and that Harriet and her farmer are made for each other.Through a variety of hilarious scenes, Emma comes to realize she doesn't know as much as she thought, and learns that it's better to let other people manage their own lives.The minor characters are wonderful: Mrs Elton with her barouche landau (anyone who's read the book will know what I mean), sweet Miss Bates, and dreadful Mr Elton, who has designs on Emma.Eventually, Emma learns how to understand her own feelings, and leaves everyone else free to listen to theirs, which leads to a satisfying ending all round.Hugely enjoyable."},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"Lovable Emma Woodhouse, Pretty, bright, and rich, not to mention a little mischievious.

The scoundrel who pretends to be an angel of light;Frank Churchill. The concerned friends; Mrs. Weston, Mr. knightly. Then there is Emma, who belongs in a class of her own. She is the most fortunate, yet the most flawed Austen heroine, which flaws only endear her all the more. And in the end they pay off, when she falls in love with someone as imperfect as herself.The language and diolouge are as shining, bright, and charming as the characters themselves.

The same goes for Emma's father with his hypochondriac tendensies.We see Emma growing up during the book, from a spoiled girl who likes to matchmake her best friends, into a (still spoiled) woman who has given up the matchmaking after she realizes that time after time her meddeling in the love-life of other people did a lot more harm than good.Also not of this time (I hope) are the class-differences. Of course, we still have them, but it is not like they cannot mix, these days. Or that we still have those rules about visiting and inviting. or at least nog were I live."},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"I do like 19th Century fiction. I do like Pride and Predjudice. I know lots of people don't like saying Classics are uninteresting. Apparantly Jane Austen said after writing this book that she had wanted to create a character that no-one would like but herself. I am the only person I know who hates Emma. I agree that the book is well written but I just don't like Emma. Sorry if you do."},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"I'm sure for some people out there, this book's a godsend, and I'm sure some people actually like Emma. Me personally, the book's not all that great, and I despise Emma. Why?, you may ask; because a) too many words, there's at least twice as many words to describe one thing as there is necessary. Yeah, so maybe I don't feel like 'hard reading' but it doesn't leave much to the imagination, and I'm a person who likes to have my imagination do the driving. The other reason I didn't particularly like the book - well, I don't get my kicks from reading about manipulative, immature women, which is my opinion of Emma. Manipulative, because she assumes it's her right to make matches, immature because she doesn't see anything wrong with it, especially when she's confronted with it. she has the 'i'm always right' feeling you'll sometimes find in a five year old. Other than that, for people who like wordy books, and as someone else said, like soaps, then read the book."},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"This book tell us such a simple story.

I have to say that I am very pleased with Amazon's CS. I am a frequent customer and will continue to be."},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"If you have not yet read this book, and are not a regular reader of literary fiction, be forewarned. Though Jane Austen has skyrocketed in popularity these days (what with all her novels being made into movies) do not think that what you have seen on the screen is what you will get between the book covers. Emma Thompson did not get the Oscar for BEST ADAPTATION for a screenplay for nothing (Sense and Sensibility).Contemporary readers are used to being drawn immediately into a story and kept interested by a novel's action. Emma does neither. Emma was written at a time in history when there was no film industry, television, or radio to compete with a leisurely journey through a book. For those of us born in the 20th Century, Emma is boring at times. Emma is confusing at times (did she say that or did Frank Churchill?). And Emma is sometimes too subtle for the backwoods American public to pick up on (I'm being cute, not derogatory). I personally will admit to liking the movie (with Gweneth Paltrow) better than the novel. Emma is the third Jane Austen novel I have read, and I oh, so long to feel like Meg Ryan does in &quot;You've Got Mail&quot; wondering if Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy will get together each time she reads Pride and Prejudice. But I don't. I just want to know when I'm going to be finished.And this is coming from someone who studied Shakespeare in college and found it so frustrating that I couldn't share his hilarious jokes with my roommates because they never understood them. So I'm not as uncultured as I seem (to all you Jane Austen fans).Historically, however, Jane Austen deserves to be read. Her rhythm and her magical way of putting together a sentence are things to be experienced. She deserves the place she holds in Literary History. However, a Jane Austen virgin must come to the table with that understanding. You must read for the experience, read for the erudition, and expect to push through some dialogue that runs longer than one page.As for what the book is about-- Well, read everyone else's review! :)"},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"Emma complete illustrated novel by Jane AustenAusten's witty exploration of social relationships in \\"Emma\\" is both humorous and insightful.

Be prepared for a long, tedious read that turns a millon corners. Sometimes you want to just hit Emma because of either her lack of insight or her arrogance. It was very long, and I admit I got bored with parts. The characters are great though and it is funny."},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"Emma is Jane Austen's penultimate novel. It is a long but engaging story of Emma Woodhouse who lives in the fictional village of Highbury 16 miles from London. The novel is in many ways a \\"bildungsroman\\" as Emma changes and matures to win her man and a place in literary lovers' hearts.The major players in this Jane Austen classic are:Emma Woodhouse-Emma is the spoiled daughter of widower Woodhouse. She loves playing matchmaker to young couples resulting in disastrous results!Emma is flawed but lovable and good hearted.Mr. Woodhouse-One of Austen's most hilarious characters. Mr. Woodhouse is a foolish nincimpoop always worried about the temperature and catching a cold. He does not want Emma to marry since he prefers she stay home and take care of his fussbudget needs. He reminds this reviewer of a character who could have fit in well in a Dickens novel.Mr. Knightley. This wealthy landowner has been in love with Emma since she was 13. One of the charms of this comedy of manners is the conversation he engages in with Emma. He is a wise man and good judge of moral character. Emma foolishly thinks the merchant's daughter Harriet is in love with him. His name says it all for he is a knight in shining armor!Harriet Smith-Emma seeks to mate her with the odious Rev. Mr. Elton but her plans go awry with he weds the foolish Mrs. Augusta Elton. Harriet is an innocent young lady who wrongly allows Emma to advice her on matters of the heart. She will later wed the mundane farmer Robert Martin.Frank Churchill; He is the son of Mr. Weston a local landowner. Weston had married Ms. Taylor who had been the maid at Emma's home for 18 years.Frank is a charmer with a weak character. Emma is briefly infatuated by him but learns his true nature from the faithful Mr. Knightley. He is anything but frank in explaining his past amours to Emma and Harriet.Jane Fairfax is a lovely lass who has been secretly engaged to Frank Churchill. As the novel ends this pair wed. Jane is lovely but strikes this reviewer has lacking mental strength!Miss Bates-A minor character who has the gift of gab! She rattles on withlittle thought in several of the novel's chapters. I see her as an early form in English fiction of stream of consciousness monologue later mastered by such masters as James Joyce and William Faulkner.Emma is usually rated alongside \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" as one of the two best novels written by Jane Austen. I enjoyed it immensely but note that there is a lot of talking and not much action. Austen liked to take a few country families and discuss a love affair or two in her narrowly focused works. She is the indisputed queen of romance fiction and is as popular today as she was when the book was published in 1816. This fall Masterpiece Theatre will be airing dramatizations of all six novels. We Janeites are a growing army of devoted fans. Jane only wrote 6 books but each is a masterpiece!"},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"Genteel society in early 19th century England proved resourceful in conjuring up their own rural entertainment. Dinner parties, amateur musicales, cards, charades and balls provided indoor amusement, while picnics, local excursions or taking the waters in fancy resorts took the restless upper crust out of doors. Lacking telephones and even telegrams Austen's characters relied on local mail delivery by their servants or trusted in the efficiency of the British Post to bring detailed, epistolary news into their information-starved lives.While the men discussed politics and their farming interests, most ladies devoted great mental and verbal energy to schemes for romance-encouraging or quashing. The fair sex plotted and surmised about their neighbors and relatives'affections for one another. In true Victorian style pregnancy was hushed over, but village gossips took great delight in pondering such weighty matters as one's birth, social station and probable inheritance.In addition the whims of older relatives must be humored at all cost, since they held the of purse strings which could make or break the success of a young person's suit. Marriage after all was still more in the interest of the parents than for the sake of actual love.Twenty-one-year old Emma Woodhouse is the younger daughter and mistress of the home of her elderly father. Having recently lost her young governess/companion to marriage, Emma undertakes a new social challenge: to mentor in her turn 17-year-old Harriet-a recent graduate of a local boarding school. The plot revolves around Emma\`s subtle attempt to mold Harriet's immature heart in certain directions, indicated by insincere behavior on the part of various young men. Having frustrated what she considers an inferior proposal on Harriet's behalf, Emma gradually learns that she has meddled too much and caused needless unhappiness.Several young couples court and become engaged in the course of this light novel, but all is not as it seems on the surface, due to a secret engagement and surprising twists of Cupid's darts. Harriet's heart is easily swayed by suggestions and appearances--without direct, verbal confirmation--so it is Emma who matures the most. She has long been sensitive of the good opinion of her 31-year-old neighbor, Mr. Knightly, who on two occasions finds it necessary to reprove her thoughtless behavior. What does she care, since she has already declared that will never marry-which would mean deserting her doting butdoddering father.This novel is Austen-lite, though in extensive format (over 400 pages), with many long letters which fill in the off stage action--which proves to be wherever our Emma is Not present. The heroine's own tender heart is swayed first by this man, then by another. The advent of young persons into the village of Highbury is welcomed by local society-ever appreciative of newcomers to the social mix. Inside these pages one encounters the typical village gossips and snobs of course, who make everyone's business their private agenda. Ah, how will these impetuous young persons sort out their feelings andrelationships? Especially without antagonizing or distressing their elders? EMMA is almost a sly treatise on early Victorian social and moral restrictions, delightfully disguised as a novel."},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"Although I enjoyed the novel, I believe it is really a matter of personal preference. If you like this kind of books that don't take place in our century and are common to Austen's style (that is, long and elaborate expositions and extensive character development), then Emma is a perfect read. However, if those books are not exactly what you enjoy, then it would no longer be as captivating for you."},{"Title":"Emma (World's Classics)","review":"Emma is a must read for Austen fans. Filled with the wit, the scandal, the light-hearted fun and the 17th century morals we have come to expect.
