Is it the cup used by Christ at the Last Supper? A more ancient vessel of healing and longevity? or perhaps a Celtic cauldron offering wisdom to its seeker, and only satisfying those with heroic qualities? For centuries it has been discussed, debated, and occasionally, actively sought. What might it have been like, then, for the eager knights of King Arthur's court to quest after this legendary artifact, the object of their greatest adventures? First-time novelist Edwin Del Wollert offers a glimpse of the old heroes, one unlike the other tellings that have come before. Here are the younger knights of the realm: a daydreaming errant and a headstrong offspring of one of Arthur's champions. Together these two will venture forth in the name of Camelot. For the dream is fading from ancient Britain. Arthur has reigned for more than a score of years, but benefits no longer from Merlin's wise counsel nor the idealism felt when he first took the crown. Camelot has earned the rank of greatness, but not without cost. As dark elements of the past threaten rebellion, Arthur must trust his knights to preserve the legacy of his vision.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=sKVoKAAACAAJ&dq=Dreamers+of+the+Grail&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"College Algebra (Barron's EZ-101 Study Keys)","description":"Books in the EZ-101 Study Keys series are intended as brush-up reviews for a variety of college-101 courses.

His shock, disappointment and anger over Indiana University's manner of firing a twenty-nine-year employee comes through clearly in his account of his last turbulent year there. And it is his account. Few people in sports have had more books written about them. This is the first by Bob Knight - one of the most literate, candid, quoted and outspoken men in American public life telling in this first-person account of his full, rich life. Much of that life has been in basketball, most of it because of basketball, but it also has brought him forward as a coach who has proved academic responsibility and production of championship college athletic teams not only can co-exist but should. His excitement as things start anew for him at Texas Tech is matched here by his characteristic frankness and remarkable recollection of a life he clearly has enjoyed. You'll see why, as he tells story after story - some delightful, some hilarious, some poignant, none of them dull. Knight, as a sophomore front-line reserve on the Ohio State team that won the NCAA championship, became the first man to play on and coach a championship team when he led his 1975-76 Indiana team to a 32-0 season that was capped by an 86-68 victory over Michigan in the NCAA championship game at Philadelphia. His Indiana teams in 1980-81 and 1986-87 also won NCAA titles, making him one of just four coaches in history to win as many as three championships. Twenty-six years later, the 1975-76 Indiana team still stands as the last unbeaten team in major- college men's basketball. Knight's coaching career includes six seasons at Army, where his teams - during the years when the Vietnam War made recruiting for West Point difficult - won 102 games and lost 50. He is one of five coaches who have won seven hundred games, and the only coach whose teams have won championships in the NCAA tournament, the National Invitation Tournament, the Olympic Games and the Pan American Games. During all that he has been at the heart of more controversies while running a winning and squeaky-clean program than any coach of any sport any time or anywhere. His excitement as things start anew for him is matched here by his candor and remarkable recollection of a life he clearly has enjoyed. You'll see why, with story after story - some delightful, some hilarious, some poignant, none of them dull: the story of Bob Knight's life.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=_rdgIvj0SsEC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Bicycle Touring Manual: Using the Bicycle for Touring and Camping","description":"For those who will be taking medium or long trips via bicycle, this is a guide to equipment, gear, riding techniques,and safety measures.

House and Street re-creates the working and personal lives of these women, drawing on a wealth of documentation from archival, court, and church records. Lauderdale Graham traces the intricate and ambivalent relations that existed between masters and servants. She shows how for servants the house could be a place of protection as well as oppression while the street could be dangerous but also more autonomous. She integrates her discoveries with larger events taking place in Rio de Janeiro during the period, including the epidemics of the 1850s, the abolition of slavery, the demolition of slums, and major improvements in sanitation during the first decade of the 1900s. House and Street was originally published by Cambridge University Press in 1988.

His work, in its originality and impact, easily ranks with that of Goethe, Holderlin, or Rilke. Yet George's reach extended far beyond the sphere of literature. Particularly during his last three decades, George gathered around himself a group of men who subscribed to his homoerotic and idiosyncratic vision of life and sought to transform that vision into reality. George considered his circle to be the embodiment and defender of the \\"real\\" but \\"secret\\" Germany, opposed to the false values of contemporary bourgeois society. Some of his disciples, friends, and admirers were themselves historians, philosophers, and poets. Their works profoundly affected the intellectual and cultural attitudes of Germany's elite during the critical postwar years of the Weimar Republic. Essentially conservative in temperament and outlook, George and his circle occupy a central, but problematic, place in the rise of proto-fascism in Germany. Their own surrogate state offered a miniature model of a future German state: enthusiastic followers submitting themselves without question to the figure and will of a charismatic leader believed to be in possession of mysterious, even quasi-divine, powers. When he died several months after the Nazi takeover, George was one of the most famous and revered figures in Germany. Today the importance of George and his circle has largely been forgotten. In this, the first full biography of George to appear in any language, Robert E. Norton traces the poet's life and rise to fame.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=5FhuDwAAQBAJ&dq=Secret+Germany&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sacred Theology","description":"A theologian and a theatre artist examine both the nature of theatrical performance within contemporary culture and its relationship to Christian life, faith, and worship.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=SqRzBQAAQBAJ&dq=Sacred+Theology&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Que han hecho con mi pais, tio?","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=_8g3AAAACAAJ&dq=Que+han+hecho+con+mi+pais,+tio%3F&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cat Man","description":"\\"In the midst of the Syrian Civil War, Alaa takes care of Aleppo's abandoned cats.\\"--","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=pVLXDwAAQBAJ&dq=Cat+Man&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Ciano Diaries, 1939-1943","description":"\\"Gian Galeazzo Ciano, 2nd Count of Cortellazzo and Buccari (Italian pronunciation: [aleattso tano]) ; 18 March 1903 ? 11 January 1944 (executed) was an Italian Minister of Foreign Affairs and Benito Mussolini's son-in-law.

During his short life he was beset by many difficulties. As a result, his biography has become a source of inspiration and encouragement to many Christians, including missionaries such as William Carey and Jim Elliot, and Brainerd's cousin, the Second Great Awakening evangelist James Brainerd Taylor (1801-1829). Much of Brainerd's influence on future generations can be attributed to the biography compiled by Jonathan Edwards and first published in 1749 under the title of An Account of the Life of the Late Reverend Mr. David Brainerd. Edwards believed that a biography about Brainerd would have great value and set aside the anti-Arminian treatise he was writing (later published as Freedom of the Will) in order to create one. The result was an edited version of Brainerd's diary, with some passages documenting Brainerd's despair removed. It gained immediate recognition, with eighteenth-century theologian John Wesley urging: 'Let every preacher read carefully over the Life of David Brainerd. The most reprinted of Edwards's books, it has never been out of print and has thus influenced subsequent generations, mainly because of Brainerd's single-minded perseverance in his work in the face of significant suffering. Clyde Kilby summarised Brainerd's influence as being based on the fact that, 'in our timidity and our shoddy opportunism we are always stirred when a man appears on the horizon willing to stake his all on a conviction'. From the eighteenth century, missionaries also found inspiration and encouragement from the biography.

To the Dreamland, where seven Sleepers dream the ever-changing landscape drawn by trillions of sleeping minds from the Waking World. Where form follows function, so a hovel today may be a castle or a cave tomorrow. Where the people battle nightmares with only the strength of their will and sanity. Juele is the youngest and most promising new student to enter the strange new world of the School of Light. At this legendary institution, she will learn how to master illusion, the highest form of art in the Dreamland. Her talent has excited the interest of many of the senior students, the professors, but most important of all, the Idealists. They are the elite of the Illusionists, a tightly knit group of talents who admit Juele to their mysterious circle in the Ivory Tower. Her mentor, an Idealist named Rutaro, has embarked upon a project to surround the Castle of Dreams with an image of perfection, in which Juele will play a key role. But other students who are jealous of Juele's good fortune set out to pervert Rutaro's design. What they have in mind bears no resemblance to reality. The worst part is that no one, not Rutaro, nor the King, the ministers, or even Roan, the King's Investigator, seems to notice that the government of the Dreamland is plunging into deadly chaos. Juele is faced with having to find the reality within the fantasy with the only skill she has at hanillusion.

In the same way, says Tara Bennett-Goleman, we all have the natural ability to turn our moments of confusion or emotional pain into insightful clarity. Emotional Alchemy maps the mind and shows how, according to recent advances in cognitive therapy, most of what troubles us falls into ten basic emotional patterns, including fear of abandonment, social exclusion (the feeling we don't belong), and vulnerability (the feeling that some catastrophe will occur). Through the simple practice of mindfulness taught in this book, we can free ourselves of such patterns and replace them with empathy for ourselves and others, as well as the freedom to be more creative and alive. You'll find the very latest research in neuroscience--including the neurological \\"magic quarter second,\\" during which it is possible for a thought to be \\"caught\\" before it turns into an emotional reaction. And you'll discover the fascinating parallels of this science with the wisdom of ancient Buddhism--for Buddhists knew centuries ago that we can end our self-destructive habits. This remarkable book also teaches the practice of mindfulness, an awareness that lets us see things as they truly are without distortion or judgment, giving the most insightful explanation of how mindfulness can change not only our lives, but the very structure of our brains. Here is a beautifully rendered work full of Buddhist wisdom and stories of how people have used mindfulness to conquer their self-defeating habits. The result is a whole new way of approaching our relationships, work, and internal lives.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=sXwwZWYhlLAC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Impact Earth: Asteroids, Comets and Meteoroids: The Growing Threat","description":"As more asteroids enter our solar system, our chances of a collision increase by the day.

At its apogee, it stretched from the Castilian plateau to the high peaks of the Andes; from the cosmopolitan cities of Seville, Naples, or Mexico City to Santa Fe and San Francisco; from Brussels to Buenos Aires and from Milan to Manila. During those centuries, Spain left its imprint across vast continents and distant oceans contributing in no minor way to the emergence of our globalised era. This was true not only in an economic sense-the Hispano-American silver peso transported across the Atlantic and the Pacific by the Spanish fleets was arguably the first global currency, thus facilitating the creation of a world economic system-but intellectually and artistically as well. The most extraordinary cultural exchanges took place in practically every corner of the Hispanic world, no matter how distant from the metropolis. At various times a descendant of the Aztec nobility was translating a Baroque play into Nahuatl to the delight of an Amerindian and mixed audience in the market of Tlatelolco; an Andalusian Dominican priest was writing the first Western grammar of the Chinese language in Fuzhou, a Chinese city that enjoyed a trade monopoly with the Spanish Philippines; a Franciscan friar was composing a piece of polyphonic music with lyrics in Quechua to be played in a church decorated with Moorish-style ceilings in a Peruvian valley; or a multi-ethnic team of Amerindian and Spanish naturalists was describing in Latin, Spanish and local vernacular languages thousands of medicinal plants, animals and minerals previously unknown to the West. And, most probably, at the same time that one of those exchanges were happening, the members of the School of Salamanca were laying the foundations of modern international law or formulating some of the first modern theories of price, value and money, Cervantes was writing Don Quixote, Vel zquez was painting Las Meninas, or Goya was exposing both the dark and bright sides of the European Enlightenment. Actually, whenever we contemplate the galleries devoted to Vel zquez, El Greco, Zurbar n, Murillo or Goya in the Prado Museum in Madrid; when we visit the National Palace in Mexico City, a mission in California, a Jesuit church in Rome or the Intramuros quarter in Manila; or when we hear Spanish being spoken in a myriad of accents in the streets of San Francisco, New Orleans or Manhattan we are experiencing some of the past and present fruits of an always vibrant and still expanding cultural community. As the reader can infer by now, this book is about how Spain and the larger Hispanic world have contributed to world history and in particular to the history of civilisation, not only at the zenith of the Hispanic Monarchy but throughout a much longer span of time.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ddVSzQEACAAJ&dq=Sundials:+Their+Theory+and+Construction+(Anywhere+But+Naxos)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Step by Step 1B -- An Introduction to Successful Practice for Violin (Step by Step (Suzuki))","description":"The Step by Step series is a collection of exercise books/CDs for violin based on the Mother-Tongue approach.

It is decided that Husayn, 12, and Elahe, 11, will go to Manchester, England to stay with the Townsend family, and attend school with Elizabeth, 14 and Thomas, 12.

The author may have been associated with the \\"Friends of God,\\" led by Dominicans, John Tauler and Blessed Henry Suso. This book came to the attention of Martin Luther, and he is credited with giving the treatise its modern name. Written over a century before Luther's time, its theology draws upon the Latin Christianity of the Rhineland. The Theologia Germanica has appeared in many editions and languages over its 600-year history, and has taken its place beside the Imitation of Christ, in literature of devotion. Susanna Winkworth (1820-1884), translated the most complete version of the Theologia Germanica known, based on the Wurtzburg Manuscript, discovered in the 19th century. Her translation, first published in 1854, includes additional passages not found in the editions made popular by Martin Luther. In this Modern English Edition of the Theologia Germanica from Scriptoria Books, only obsolete, archaic, and poetic words have been edited. The grammar and syntax of Susanna Winkworth's original translation from the German manuscript, have been preserved. This creates an edition that is true to the composition of the original translation, while providing a more-modern easier-reading text. Scriptoria Books has transcribed this edition from the original text. It was then edited, formatted, and proofread through each revision. Our procedures are not automated.

Each essay rests on the underlying question: is it possible or desirable to construct or discover political foundations without resorting to metaphysical or essentialist constructs? The introduction focuses on the two nineteenth century thinkers, Nietzsche and Husserl, who have framed the debate about modernity and postmodernity; thereafter, the book examines Voegelin's ideas as compared to those of other twentieth century thinkers. Discussed within the volume are Levinas and the precedence of ethics, Ricoeur's theory of narrative representation, Deleuze and the philosophy of immanence, Voegelin's relationship to a speech dimension theory of human behavior, and Patocka's theory of pre metaphysical transcendence in Socrates. What will impress scholars most about this collection is the provocative dialogue created between Voegelin and other major thinkers of postmodernism that addresses the issue of establishing foundations without foundationalism.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=tXGM-ddBHjEC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Chitty Chitty Bang Bang","description":"Ian Fleming s beloved original text   newly illustrated by Joe Berger!

Dr. John Cocker, a retired Family Physician and Publisher of STITCHES, the Journal of Medical Humour, decided at age 67 that he still had time for one more adventure. The book relates the planning and purchase of the vessel and then the adventures that happened along the way. A motley crew was assembeld and left Fort Lauderdale in November, 2000. Dr. Cocker, with 20,000 miles of blue water sailing experience, was the only one on board who had sailed out of sight of land before. Heading down the Caribbean to Trinidad and then the Panama Canal, Dr. Cocker relates stories of the sailing, along with anecdotes and incidents that occurred. The vast space of the Pacific, the 3,000 mile leg to the Marquises, when no other boat was seen for three weeks, and the events that occurred on scattered Pacific Islands, together with some natural history, economics and gossip make fascinating reading. From Australia, the voyage headed from Bali through the South China Seas, where they were boarded at night by pirates, then through 'Pirate Alley', the straights of Malacca and to Phucket. Next came the Indian Ocean, Red Sea, Mediterreanean, and home across the Atlantic. Dr. Cocker's interest in foreign land, history, geography and people is evident, and his outspoken criticism of regimes and religions make fascinating reading for those of us who choose to stay at home and a guide for those of us who wish to sail.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=aohhwjwdslUC&dq=Sailing+in+Stitches&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Paroles: Introductory French","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=rpBKAAAACAAJ&dq=Paroles:+Introductory+French&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Recreating Asia: Visions for a New Century","description":"The World Economic Forum is an international organization committed to improving the state of the world.

This definitive study takes readers into the cockpits and onto the flight decks of the versatile and hardy U.S. escort carriers (CVEs) to tell of their vital, yet little-known contribution to the anti-U-boat campaign. Sailing apart from the Allied convoys, the CVE captains had complete freedom of action and frequently took their ships on \\"hunt and kill\\" missions against the enemy. The German submarines were allowed no respite and no place to relax without the fear of discovery. World War II historian William Y'Blood explains that in the eighteen months between the spring of 1943, when the escort carriers began to prowl the Atlantic, to November 1944, the average number of U-boats in daily operation was reduced from 108 to a mere 31. Though land-based aircraft, various support groups, and the convoy system itself helped win the Battle of the Atlantic, the escort carrier groups' influence was profound. In addition to documenting the escort carriers' exciting operational history, the author also traces the CVE's development and construction and examines its tactical and strategic uses.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=H6f6VLTgSSAC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mid-Sized and Manageable Track Plans (Model Railroader Books)","description":"Use modules, linked dioramas, and stacking concepts to fit a model railroad into a small sapce.

Before then, national ideology was shaped by American exceptionalism and bourgeois nationalism: elites saw themselves as the children of a homogeneous nation standing outside the history and culture of the Old World. This view repressed the cultures of those who did not fit the elite vision: people of color, Catholics, Jews, and immigrants. David W. Noble, a preeminent figure in American studies, inherited this ideology. However, like many who entered the field in the 1940s, he rejected the ideals of his intellectual predecessors and sought a new, multicultural, post-national scholarship. Throughout his career, Noble has examined this rupture in American intellectual life. In Death of a Nation, he presents the culmination of decades of thought in a sweeping treatise on the shaping of contemporary American studies and an eloquent summation of his distinguished career. Exploring the roots of American exceptionalism, Noble demonstrates that it was a doomed ideology. Capitalists who believed in a bounded nationalism also depended on a boundless, international marketplace. This contradiction was inherently unstable, and the belief in a unified national landscape exploded in World War II. The rupture provided an opening for alternative narratives as class, ethnicity, race, and region were reclaimed as part of the nation's history. Noble traces the effects of this shift among scholars and artists, and shows how even today they struggle to imagine an alternative postnational narrative and seek the meaning of local and national cultures in an increasingly transnational world. While Noble illustrates the challenges thatthe paradigm shift created, he also suggests solutions that will help scholars avoid romanticized and reductive approaches toward the study of American culture in the future.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=xC-hW6OfwfwC&dq=Death+of+a+Nation:+American+Culture+and+the+End+of+Exceptionalism+(Critical+American+Studies)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ancient and Medieval Modelling (Modelling Masterclass)","description":"Sculptor and Master Modeller, Pete Armstrong, shares the skills and techniques that have made him one of the great figure modellers working today.

But when a journey through an interdimensional portal lands him in a world of talking animals and ominous sorcery, he finds he is on a very different trip indeed. Here, when he plays a strange instrument called a duar, peculiar things happen-powerful magic that may be the only way to stop a dark force that threatens his new world-and his old one.

It dates back to the time of cavemen -- food plus fire equals good. But when it comes to healthy food from the grill, evolution has been slow, producing lots of nutritionally sound but incredibly bland recipes. Until now. Bobby Flay's Grilling for Life is, first and foremost, about getting the biggest, boldest flavor possible from food and fire while making healthy choices all the way. Imagine a lifetime of Espresso Rubbed BBQ Ribs with Mustard-Vinegar Basting Sauce; Bricked Rosemary Chicken with Lemon; Chinese Chicken Salad with Red Chile-Peanut Dressing; Grilled Beef Filet with Arugula and Parmesan; Grilled Salmon with Lemon, Dill, and Caper Vinaigrette; and Garlic-Red Chile-Thyme-Marinated Shrimp. For food that is good for you and full of his signature big style and big flavor, Bobby Flay will teach you how to use herbs, spices, heart-healthy oils, citrus zests and juices, honey, and vinegars in place of sugary commercial sauces and marinades. He'll show you how to enhance flavor by toasting nuts, seeds, and spices on the grill; roasting garlic in a covered grill to add to vinaigrettes and marinades; and grilling slices of lemon, lime, and grapefruit to serve on the side. Bobby believes that we all need a full and balanced diet to be happy and healthy, so the book has everything you need to keep grilling for life: veggies chock-full of fiber; delicious complex carbohydrates (the right carbs) that not only fight heart disease but break down slowly, leaving you feeling fuller longer; fish rich in omega-3 oils; and, of course, the full range of proteins. To sharpen your skills by the fire, Bobby Flay's Grilling for Life includes the sections \\"Equipment\\" (a very short list); \\"Fahrenheit 101,\\" a temperature chart that helps you navigate rare, medium, and well-done; \\"Meals in Minutes,\\" offering suggestions for the time-challenged; and \\"Party Foods,\\" great party menus for everything from a cocktail party to an Italian feast.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=wQ-vT_51rowC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Encyclopedia Of The Spinal Touch Treatment","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=LPYJtAEACAAJ&dq=Encyclopedia+Of+The+Spinal+Touch+Treatment&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The All New All Purpose: Joy of Cooking","description":"Information on foods and cooking techniques accompanies recipes for hors d'oeuvres, soups, salads, main dishes, side dishes, breads, pies, cookies, candies, and desserts","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=tbyW2LeXIOkC&dq=The+All+New+All+Purpose:+Joy+of+Cooking&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"America Twice Betrayed: Reversing Fifty Years of Government Security Failure","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=osGBAAAACAAJ&dq=America+Twice+Betrayed:+Reversing+Fifty+Years+of+Government+Security+Failure&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Company of Strangers: Christians & the Renewal of America's Public Life","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=e-gPAQAAIAAJ&dq=The+Company+of+Strangers:+Christians&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Musculoskeletal Mri","description":"Whether you are a resident, practicing radiologist, or new fellow, this authoritative resource offers expert guidance on all the essential information you need to approach musculoskeletal MRI and recognize abnormalities.

Artie is handsome, athletic, and popular, but he possesses a hidden, powerful sadistic streak and a desire to dominate. Judd is a weedy introvert, a genius who longs for a companion whom he can idolize and worship. Obsessed with Nietzsche s idea of the superhuman, both boys decide to prove that they are above the laws of man by arbitrarily picking and murdering a Jewish boy in their neighborhood. This new edition of Meyer Levin's classic literary thriller Compulsion reintroduces the fictionalized case of Leopold and Loeb  once considered the \\"crime of the century\\"  to a new generation.

Here, author Kendall Phillips selects ten of the most popular and influential horror films including Dracula, Night of the Living Dead, Halloween, The Silence of the Lambs, and Scream, each of which has become a film landmark and spawned countless imitators, and all having implications that transcend their cinematic influence and achievement. By tracing the production history, contemporary audience response, and lasting cultural influence of each picture, Phillips offers a unique new approach to thinking about the popular attraction to horror films, and the ways in which they reflect both cultural and individual fears. Though stylistically and thematically very different, all of these movies have scared millions of eager moviegoers. This book tries to figure out why.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=axFSjNH1oRkC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Science is a sacred cow (A Dutton Everyman Paperback)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=EovYugAACAAJ&dq=Science+is+a+sacred+cow+(A+Dutton+Everyman+Paperback)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Christian social manifesto;: An interpretative study of the encyclicals Rerum novarum and Quadragesimo anno of Pope Leo XIII and Pope Pius XI, (Half-title: Science and culture series)","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=LKEhAQAAIAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Doris Day: Her Own Story","description":"The events of the popular, thrice-married, blonde singer-actress's life, as told to Hotchner, are given a wider frame through candid interviews with her son, mother, friends, and co-stars.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=A-6I_62A4t8C&dq=Doris+Day:+Her+Own+Story&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Flashpoint: Gay Male Sexual Writing","description":"Go with Josh and his friends as they are sent by God, their spiritual leader, on dangerous and challenging voyages to conquer the forces of darkness in the new world.

The work is hailed as a major contribution to the development of an ethics of care. Where society is viewed as an association of equal and autonomous persons, the work of caring for dependents figure neither in political theory nor in social policy. While some women have made many gains, equality continues to elude many others, as in large measure, social institutions fail to take into account the dependency of childhood, illness, disability and frail old age and fail to adequately support those who care for dependents. Using a narrative of her experiences caring for her disabled daughter, she discusses the relevance of her analysis of dependency to significant cognitive disability. Eva Feder Kittay explores the significance of dependency work by analyzing John Rawls' influential liberal theory, and two examples of public policy--welfare reform and family leave--to show how theory and policy fail women when they miss the centrality of dependency to issues of justice. This second edition has updated material on care workers, her adult disabled daughter and key changes in welfare reform. Using a mix of personal reflection and political argument, this new edition of a classic text will continue to be an innovative and influential contribution to the debate on searching for greater equality and justice for women. Love's Laborhas spoken to audiences around the world and has had an impact on readers from many countries and over many disciplines: philosophy, sociology, disability studies, nursing. It has been required and supplementary reading on many undergraduate courses on Ethics, Feminist Ethics, Gender and Religious Ethics, Political Theory, Bioethics and Disability Studies.

In the years from 1885 to 1910 most Ozark communities were still relatively isolated from the outside and from each other. Thus they had to rely on their own resources for diversion from the difficult and often solitary business of everyday living. The most popular of their entertainments were those that brought some \\"theater\\" into their lives. They especially delighted in \\"literaries,\\" debates, mock trials, closing-of-school programs, suppers, picnics, brush-arbor revivals, and baptizings. Then there was the occasional hanging that for audience attention was rivaled only by the political rally. The hanging took on all the flavor of high drama, even to the impassioned farewell address by the condemned, who was carried away by the excitement of it all. By their entertainments shall we know them, and this account of Ozarkers' diversions reveals them in all their independence, conservatism, sense of place, humor, dedication to learning, love of the spoken language, and religious and political intensity. No \\"come-here\\" (an Ozarker's term for a newcomer), Robert K. Gilmore grew up on an Ozark farm, reared by grandparents who were young in the era described in this book. Years later he went back to the rural Ozarks and encouraged the people to recall the early days for him. They described the entertainments of their youth with a special clarity of recall. The files of the Ozark weeklies also proved richly rewarding. The editors and their rural \\"correspondents\\" delighted in describing the local entertainments in vivid reportage loaded with editorial comment. This book, illustrated with rare photographs of turn-of-the-century diversions celebrates the centennial of an era.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=vNq4uZg8hHoC&dq=Ozark+Baptizings,+Hangings,+and+Other+Diversions:+Theatrical+Folkways+of+Rural+Missouri,+1885-1910&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"La Salle and the discovery of the great West (France and England in North America, pt. 3rd)","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=gHfSFu0YC_oC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The strange adventures of Bromley Barnes","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ftQgAAAAMAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Complete Crockery Cookbook: Create Spectacular Meals in Your Slow Cooker (The Complete Crockpot Cookbook, 1)","description":"90 Really Good Slow Cooker Recipes For Freezer + 105 Amazing Make-Ahead Meals For Busy Families!

Not only is the freezer a great place to store frozen food and ready meals, it can also save you money by allowing you to take advantage of cheap special offers and leftovers. Used properly, your freezer will save you time and money. Most foods can be frozen with little to no loss of taste and texture.

Presents new scientific evidence revealing the cause of the end of the last ice age and the cycles of geological events and species extinctions that followed ? Connects physical data to the dramatic earth changes recounted in oral traditions around the world ? Describes the impending danger from a continuing cycle of catastrophes and extinctions There are a number of puzzling mysteries in the history of Earth that have yet to be satisfactorily explained by mainstream science: the extinction of the dinosaurs, the vanishing of ancient Indian tribes, the formation of the mysterious Carolina Bays, the disappearance of the mammoths, the sudden ending of the last Ice Age, and the cause of huge underwater landslides that sent massive tsunamis racing across the oceans millennia ago. Eyewitness accounts of these events are chronicled in rich oral traditions handed down through generations of native peoples. The authors  recent scientific discoveries link all these events to a single cause. In The Cycle of Cosmic Catastrophes Richard Firestone, Allen West, and Simon Warwick-Smith present new scientific evidence about a series of prehistoric cosmic events that explains why the last Ice Age ended so abruptly. Their findings validate the ubiquitous legends and myths of floods, fires, and weather extremes passed down by our ancestors and show how these legendary events relate to each other. Their findings also support the idea that we are entering a thousand-year cycle of increasing danger and possibly a new cycle of extinctions.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=8yRevwEACAAJ&dq=Catastrophes&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"ALIAS 2006 WALL","description":"This encyclopedia is the most comprehensive guide available to international product design of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries.

Heidegger's task here is to reassert the question of the essence of truth, not as a \\"problem\\" or as a matter of \\"logic,\\" but precisely as a genuine philosophical question, in fact the one basic question of philosophy. Thus, this course is about the essence of truth and the essence of philosophy. On both sides Heidegger draws extensively upon the ancient Greeks, on their understanding of truth as aletheia and their determination of the beginning of philosophy as the disposition of wonder. In addition, these lectures were presented at the time that Heidegger was composing his second magnum opus, Beitr?ge zur Philosophie, and provide the single best introduction to that complex and crucial text.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=fGjEDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Anxiety Relief (Guided Self-Healing Practices)","description":"If you are looking to learn how to meditate for healing, anxiety and stress management to improve your life without having to go to a meditation class or engage in long, expensive and time-consuming therapy, then you have chosen the perfect book.

Often the only boy in the dance studio, he was called a sissy, a term he wore like a badge of honor. He was unlike anyone else, deeply gifted and spirited. Moving to New York at nineteen, he arrived to one of the great booms of dance in America. Audiences in 1976 had the luxury of Merce Cunningham s finest experiments with time and space, of Twyla Tharp s virtuosity, and Lucinda Childs's genius. Morris was flat broke but found a group of likeminded artists that danced together, travelled together, slept together. No one wanted to break the spell or miss a thing, because  if you missed anything, you missed everything.  This collective, led by Morris s fiercely original vision, became the famed Mark Morris Dance Group. Suddenly, Morris was making a fast ascent. Celebrated by The New Yorker s critic as one of the great young talents, an androgynous beauty in the vein of Michelangelo s David, he and his company had arrived. Collaborations with the likes of Mikhail Baryshnikov, Yo-Yo Ma, Lou Harrison, and Howard Hodgkin followed. And so did controversy: from the circus of his tenure at La Monnaie in Belgium to his work on the biggest flop in Broadway history. But through the Reagan-Bush era, the worst of the AIDS epidemic, through rehearsal squabbles and backstage intrigues, Morris emerged as one of the great visionaries of modern dance, a force of nature with a dedication to beauty and a love of the body, an artist as joyful as he is provocative. Out Loud is the bighearted and outspoken story of a man as formidable on the page as he is on the boards. With unusual candor and disarming wit, Morris s memoir captures the life of a performer who broke the mold, a brilliant maverick who found his home in the collective and liberating world of music and dance.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=c-1DEAAAQBAJ&dq=Out,+Loud,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Parliamo Italiano!: A Communicative Approach (Workbook / Laboratory Manual) (Italian and English Edition)","description":"\\"This combined Workbook/Laborartoy Manual is an integrated part of the Parliamo italiano! program.

Rogers was a humanist who believed that there were no scientifically evident racial divisions all humans belong to one  race.  He believed that color prejudice generally evolved from issues of domination and power between two physiologically different groups. According to Rogers, color prejudice was then used a rationale for domination, subjugation and warfare. Societies developed myths and prejudices in order to pursue their own interests at the expense of other groups. This book argues that many instances of the contributions of black people had been left out of the history books, and gives many examples.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=0T0HBgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sara's Father (American Heroes Against All Odds: New Hampshire #29)","description":"Sara's Father Once, skinny Erin Delaney and popular Sam Stone shared teenage high jinks, loads of laughter...and a breathless, tentative passion.

There, in the bitter cold, he stood naked while a companion covered his body with brown stain, squirted lemon juice into his blue eyes to darken them. Thus disguised as a coolie, he arrived in the Forbidden City without being detected, but disclosed himself to the civilian officials. A fanatical mob led by Buddhist monks stoned his house.

A masonry heater s design, placement in the home, and luxurious radiant heat redefine the hearth for the modern era, turning it into a piece of the sun right inside the home. Like the feeling one gets from the sun on a spring day, the environment around a masonry heater feels fresh. The radiant heat feels better on the skin. It warms the home both gently and efficiently. In fact, the value of a masonry heater lies in its durability, quality, serviceability, dependability, and health-supporting features. And it is an investment in self-sufficiency and freedom from fossil fuels. The book discusses different masonry heater designs, including variations extant in Europe, and explains the growth of their popularity in the United States beginning in the late 1970s. For the reader who may be familiar only with open fireplaces and metal woodstoves, Masonry Heaters will bring a new understanding and appreciation of massive heat storage and gentle-but-persistent radiant heat. Masonry heaters offer a unique comfort that is superior to that from convection heat from forced-air systems, and more personal than that offered by  radiant  floors. As Matesz demonstrates, the heat from the sun or from a masonry heater is genuine heat instead of just insulation against the loss of heat. Those who are looking to build, add onto, or remodel a house will find comprehensive and practical advice for designing and installing a masonry heater, including detailed discussion of materials, code considerations, and many photos and illustrations. While this is not a do-it-yourself guide for building a masonry heater, it provides facts every heater builder should know. Professional contractors will find this a useful tool to consult, and homeowners considering a new method of home heating will find all they need to know about masonry heaters within these pages.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=YhbG2vi9WQoC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Habima","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=AUXtAAAAMAAJ&dq=Habima&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Spy for Hannibal: A Novel of Carthage","description":"A historical romance between Hasdrubal, a high priest of Carthage and Elissa, a Roman feminist.

He felt that he might have lost touch with the country, with its speech, the smell of its grass and trees, its color and quality of light, the pulse of its people. To reassure himself, he set out on a voyage of rediscovery of the American identity, accompanied by a distinguished French poodle named Charley; and riding in a three-quarter-ton pickup truck named Rocinante. His course took him through almost forty states: northward from Long Island to Maine; through the Midwest to Chicago; onward by way of Minnesota, North Dakota, Montana (with which he fell in love), and Idaho to Seattle, south to San Francisco and his birthplace, Salinas; eastward through the Mojave, New Mexico, Arizona, to the vast hospitality of Texas, to New Orleans and a shocking drama of desegregation; finally, on the last leg, through Alabama, Virginia, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey to New York. Travels with Charley in Search of America is an intimate look at one of America's most beloved writers in the later years of his life a self-portrait of a man who never wrote an explicit autobiography. Written during a time of upheaval and racial tension in the South which Steinbeck witnessed firsthand Travels with Charley is a stunning evocation of America on the eve of a tumultuous decade.

This book presents, for the first time in the West, a wide selection of these fascinating myths preserved among four related peoples whose ancient cultures today survive by a thread. In ninety-two straightforward tales populated by extraordinary characters and exploits, by giants who humble haughty Narts, by horses and sorceresses, Nart Sagas from the Caucasus brings these cultures to life in a powerful epos. In these colorful tales, women, not least the beautiful temptress Satanaya, the mother of all Narts, are not only fertility figures but also pillars of authority and wisdom. In one variation on a recurring theme, a shepherd, overcome with passion on observing Satanaya bathing alone, shoots a \\"bolt of lust\\" that strikes a rock--a rock that gives birth to the Achilles-like Sawseruquo, or Sosruquo. With steely skin but tender knees, Sawseruquo is a man the Narts come to love and hate. Despite a tragic history, the Circassians, Abazas, Abkhaz, and Ubykhs have retained the Nart sagas as a living tradition. The memory of their elaborate warrior culture, so richly expressed by these tales, helped them resist Tsarist imperialism in the nineteenth century, Stalinist suppression in the twentieth, and has bolstered their ongoing cultural journey into the post-Soviet future. Because these peoples were at the crossroads of Eurasia for millennia, their myths exhibit striking parallels with the lore of ancient India, classical Greece, and pagan Scandinavia. The Nart sagas may also have formed a crucial component of the Arthurian cycle. Notes after each tale reveal these parallels; an appendix offers extensive linguistic commentary. With this book, no longer will the analysis of ancient Eurasian myth be possible without a close look at the Nart sagas. And no longer will the lover of myth be satisfied without the pleasure of having read them. Excerpts from the Nart sagas ? \\"The Narts were a tribe of heroes. They were huge, tall people, and their horses were also exuberant Alyps or Durduls. They were wealthy, and they also had a state. That is how the Narts lived their lives. . . .\\" \\"The Narts were courageous, energetic, bold, and good-hearted. Thus they lived until God sent down a small swallow. . . .\\" \\"The Narts were very cruel to one another. They were envious of one another. They disputed among themselves over who was the most courageous. But most of all they hated Sosruquo. . . . A rock gave birth to him. He is the son of a rock, illegally born a mere shepherd's son. . . .\\"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=BaE5BAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Divine Conduct or the Mystery of Providence","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=flcFAAAAQAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cowboy Sam and Miss Lily","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=9TwbnwEACAAJ&dq=Cowboy+Sam+and+Miss+Lily&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Del Amor y Otros Demonios","description":"Premio Nobel de Literatura Una obra atrevida y cautivadora Garc a M rquez retiene una voz admirable y vital, y la pluma de un  ngel.

At a time when scientific and technological breakthroughs keep our eyes focused on the latest software upgrades or the newest cell-phone wizardry, a group of today's most innovative thinkers are looking beyond the horizon to explore both the promise and the peril of our technological future. Human ingenuity has granted us a world of unprecedented personal power -- enabling us to communicate instantaneously with anyone anywhere on the globe, to transport ourselves in both real and virtual worlds to distant places with ease, to fill our bellies with engineered commodities once available to only a privileged elite. Through our technologies, we have sought to free ourselves from the shackles of nature and become its master. Yet science and technology continually transform our experience and society in ways that often seem to be beyond our control. Today, different areas of research and innovation are advancing synergistically, multiplying the rate and magnitude of technological and societal change, with consequences that no one can predict. Living with the Genie explores the origins, nature, and meaning of such change, and our capacity to govern it. As the power of technology continues to accelerate, who, this book asks, will be the master of whom? In Living with the Genie, leading writers and thinkers come together to confront this question from many perspectives, including: Richard Powers's whimsical investigation of the limits of artificial intelligence; Philip Kitcher's confrontation of the moral implications of science; Richard Rhodes's exploration of the role of technology in reducing violence; Shiv Visvanathan's analysis of technology's genocidal potential; Lori Andrews's insights into the quest for human genetic enhancement; Alan Lightman's reflections on how technology changes the experience of our humanness. These and ten other provocative essays open the door to a new dialogue on how, in the quest for human mastery, technology may be changing what it means to be human, in ways we scarcely comprehend.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=5lkmgpowN5EC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The American Gun Mystery: Death at the Rodeo","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=7EkJMwEACAAJ&dq=The+American+Gun+Mystery:+Death+at+the+Rodeo&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Richard Misrach: Golden Gate","description":"\\"The photographs in this book were made between 1997 and 2002 from the front porch of my house in the Berkeley Hills; this special oversized edition presents a selection of forty key images from this series, and was created to commemorate the seventy-fiith anniversary of the 1937 construction of the Golden Gate Bridge, Richard Misrach\\"--Colophon.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=VrgOywAACAAJ&dq=Richard+Misrach:+Golden+Gate&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Caribbean Pantry Cookbook: Condiments and Seasonings from the Land of Spice and Sun","description":"s, tropical fruit preserves, jams, and cool rum drinks--this cookbook captures the flavors and tropical abundance of this diverse region.

The book provides a clear and current exposition of statistical concepts and methodology, including many examples and exercises based on real data gleaned from publicly available sources. Here is a small but representative selection of scenarios for our examples and exercises based on information in recent articles: Use of the  Big Mac index  by the publication The Economist as a humorous way to compare product costs across nations Visualizing how the concentration of lead levels in cartridges varies for each of five brands of e-cigarettes Describing the distribution of grip size among surgeons and how it impacts their ability to use a particular brand of surgical stapler Estimating the true average odometer reading of used Porsche Boxsters listed for sale on www.cars.com Comparing head acceleration after impact when wearing a football helmet with acceleration without a helmet Investigating the relationship between body mass index and foot load while running The main focus of the book is on presenting and illustrating methods of inferential statistics used by investigators in a wide variety of disciplines, from actuarial science all the way to zoology. It begins with a chapter on descriptive statistics that immediately exposes the reader to the analysis of real data. The next six chapters develop the probability material that facilitates the transition from simply describing data to drawing formal conclusions based on inferential methodology. Point estimation, the use of statistical intervals, and hypothesis testing are the topics of the first three inferential chapters. The remainder of the book explores the use of these methods in a variety of more complex settings. This edition includes many new examples and exercises as well as an introduction to the simulation of events and probability distributions. There are more than 1300 exercises in the book, ranging from very straightforward to reasonably challenging. Many sections have been rewritten with the goal of streamlining and providing a more accessible exposition. Output from the most common statistical software packages is included wherever appropriate (a feature absent from virtually all other mathematical statistics textbooks). The authors hope that their enthusiasm for the theory and applicability of statistics to real world problems will encourage students to pursue more training in the discipline.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ghcsEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The torrents of spring","description":"The Torrents of Spring is a novella written by Ernest Hemingway, published in 1926.

Machik's Complete Explanation, the most famous book of the teachings of Machik Lapdr?n, the great female saint and yogini of eleventh- to twelfth-century Tibet, addresses these issues in a practical, direct way. Machik developed a system, the Mahamudra Ch?d, that takes the Buddha's teachings as a basis and applies them to the immediate experiences of negative mind states and malignant forces. Her unique feminine approach is to invoke and nurture the very \\"demons\\" that we fear and hate, transforming those reactive emotions into love. It is the tantric version of developing compassion and fearlessness, a radical method of cutting through ego-fixation. This expanded edition includes Machik Lapdr?n's earliest known teaching, the original source text for the tradition, The Great Bundle of Precepts on Severance (Ch?d). This pithy set of instructions reveals that the teachings of the perfection of wisdom are the true inspiration for Ch?d. It is beautifully clarified in a short commentary by Rangjung Dorje, the Third Karmapa.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=j7xvDwAAQBAJ&dq=Machik%27s+Complete+Explanation:+Clarifying+the+Meaning+of+Chod+(Tsadra+Foundation)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Mantra Healing Collection","description":"\\"Sound is more than simply a medium of artistic expression. Sound has practical and powerful applications in the real world.\\" Mantras, or simple chants, are short phrases packed with energy and intention--specifically designed to generate powerful sound waves that promote healing, insight, creativity, and spiritual growth. Healing Mantras is the practical, how-to guide that makes the strengths and benefits of mantras available to everyone. The transformative power of sound has been passed down to the present from the sages of India, the classical scientists of ancient Greece, and the medieval monks of Europe. Mantras, sounds, and chants have inspired, comforted, and mended the lives of individuals, religious orders, and even entire cultures. Even though the science and discipline of chanting and formal prayer are practiced in every religion around the world, this is the first time that ancient Sanskrit mantras have been explained and adapted to Western needs. One of the few Western experts in Hindu and Buddhist mantras, Thomas Ashley-Farrand has practiced mantra-based spiritual disciplines for twenty-five years. In this illuminating book, he explains how and why mantras work and shows how to use them for everything from controlling habits to overcoming fear, from curing specific ailments to finding inner peace. In each of the more than fifty mantras, all translated from the original Sanskrit, Ashley-Farrand unlocks the power of every word, explains its appropriate application, and tells you how to pronounce it in easy-to-follow phonetic symbols. Inside, you'll find mantras for - Health - Worldly Success - Habit Control - Protection - Grief - Anger - Controlling Fear - Personal Attraction - Wisdom - Concentration and Mental Clarity - Healing Life Issues - and more! These mantras can be repeated aloud or in silence and can be used by people of any religion or spiritual practice, \\"as you wash dishes, as you drive on the freeway, as you meditate, or as you cook.\\" Sound can help and sound can heal, and Healing Mantras now makes this sound medicine available to everyone.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=zbKv3Jk-3YQC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Book of the Glyph","description":"Poetry. Art. A BOOK OF GLYPHS is a facsimile, color reproduction of legendary author, musician and Fugs founder Ed Sanders' first book-length work of glyphs, which he created in Florence, Italy in 2008, using colored pencils and a small sketchbook. Though each piece stands on its own, collectively the 72 glyphs convey, with characteristic humility and humor, many of the themes explored by Sanders over his long and diverse career, including history, myth, activism and pacifism. The glyph \\"a drawing that is charged with literary, emotional, historical or mythic and poetic intensity\\" has been a dimension of Sanders' poetry since 1962; he cites Zen rock gardens, the markings on Egyptian tombs and the typographic designs in John Cage's writings as influences in the development of the form. Sanders' name for the original notebook is \\"Smile-Book of Grace-Joy,\\" which aptly describes the range of concerns explored in this important and joyful work.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=JEkGoAEACAAJ&dq=The+Book+of+the+Glyph&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Bible And The Future","description":"'Anthony Hoekema brings to the study of biblical prophecy and eschatology a maturity that is rare among contemporary works on the subject.

Yet at the same time the law created the means to escape that relationship. How was this possible? And how did wives and husbands experience marriage within that legal regime? These are the complexities that Hendrik Hartog plumbs in a study of the powers of law and its limits. Exploring a century and a half of marriage through stories of struggle and conflict mined from case records, Hartog shatters the myth of a golden age of stable marriage. He describes the myriad ways the law shaped and defined marital relations and spousal identities, and how individuals manipulated and reshaped the rules of the American states to fit their needs. We witness a compelling cast of characters: wives who attempted to leave abusive husbands, women who manipulated their marital status for personal advantage, accidental and intentional bigamists, men who killed their wives' lovers, couples who insisted on divorce in a legal culture that denied them that right. As we watch and listen to these men and women, enmeshed in law and escaping from marriages, we catch reflected images both of ourselves and our parents, of our desires and our anxieties about marriage. Hartog shows how our own conflicts and confusions about marital roles and identities are rooted in the history of marriage and the legal struggles that defined and transformed it.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=_6cvEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Better Homes and Gardens Decorating Book 1968","description":"Offers guidance in selecting and arranging furniture and accessories as well as choosing color schemes and creating a personalized environment","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=mSA4AQAAIAAJ&dq=Better+Homes+and+Gardens+Decorating+Book+1968&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Life and limb","description":"'Like Joe Simpson, Andrew has discovered a latent talent for writing that only a mountaineering epic seems to have allowed him to uncover.

The victory of the Battle of Britain ranks with Marathon and the Marne as a decisive point in history. At the end of June 1940, having overrun much of Western Europe, the Nazi war leaders knew that they had to defeat the Royal Air Force Fighter Command before they could invade the British mainland. With a finely-struck balance of historical background and dramatic renderings of RAF and Luftwaffe engagements over the English countryside, Hough and Richards offer a history that is at once deep and wide-ranging. They offer insight into how the British laid the groundwork for victory through aircraft research and production, the development and implementation of command and control structures, and research into new technologies, the most important of which was radar. Hough and Richards also utilize first-person accounts of the battle whenever possible, rendering the battle scenes with cinematic intensity.

This opening suggests the panoramic sweep of his history of that famous trail. In chiseled, colorful prose, Lavender illustrates the  westward vision  that impelled the early explorers of the American interior looking for a northwest passage and send fur trappers into the region charted by Lewis and Clark. For the emigrants following the trappers  routes, that vision gradually grew into a sense of a manifest American destiny. Lavender describes the efforts of emigration societies, of missionaries like Marcus and Narcissa Whitman, and of early pioneer settlers like Hall Jackson Kelley, Jason Lee, and Thomas Jefferson Farnham, as well as the routes they took to the  Promised Land.  He concludes by recounting the first large-scale emigrations of 184345, which steeled the U. S. government for war with Mexico and agreements with Britain over the Oregon boundary.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=LeG2JAAACAAJ&dq=Westward+Vision:+The+Story+of+the+Oregon+Trail+(Bison+Book)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Bandit Gold (Slocum Series #65)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=yWjrPQAACAAJ&dq=Bandit+Gold+(Slocum+Series&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"C: Industrial Economics I: Dynamic Models of Oligopoly (Fundamentals of Pure and Applied Economics)","description":"Jacques Lesourne uses rigorous modelling to analyse the emergence, working, and dissolution of institutions in economics.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=UXdV351g6X8C&dq=C:+Industrial+Economics+I:+Dynamic+Models+of+Oligopoly+(Fundamentals+of+Pure+and+Applied+Economics)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Certain Small Shepherd","description":"Jamie wins the coveted role of a shepherd in the school Christmas play.

In July 1993, a scientific event made front-page news: the discovery that genetics plays a significant role in determining homosexuality. In The Science of Desire, Dean Hamer the scientist behind the groundbreaking study tells the inside story of how the discovery was made and what it means, not only for our understanding of sexuality, but for human behavior in general. In this accessible and remarkably clear book, Dean Hamer expands on the account of his history-making research to explore the scientific, social, and ethical issues raised by his findings. Dr. Hamer addresses such tough questions as whether it would be possible or ethical to test in utero for the gay gene; whether genetic manipulation could or should be used to alter a person's sexuality; and how a gay gene could have survived evolution. A compelling behind-the-scenes look at cutting-edge scientific inquiry, as well as a brilliant examination of the ramifications of genetic research, The Science of Desire is a lasting resource in the increasingly significant debate over the role that genetics plays in our lives.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=-q7tNRUn6b8C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Touching My Father's Soul: A Sherpa's Journey to the Top of Everest","description":"In a story of Everest unlike any told before, Jamling Tenzing Norgay gives us an insider's view of the Sherpa world.

Rejected by Notre Dame, discarded by the Pittsburgh Steelers, he started on a Pennsylvania sandlot making six dollars a game and ended as the most commanding presence in the National Football League, calling the critical plays and completing the crucial passes at the moment his sport came of age. Johnny U is the first authoritative biography of Unitas, based on hundreds of hours of interviews with teammates and opponents, coaches, family and friends. The depth of Tom Callahan s research allows him to present something more than a biography, something approaching an oral history of a bygone sporting era. It was a time when players were paid a pittance and superstars painted houses and tiled floors in the off-season when ex-soldiers and marines like Gino Marchetti, Art Donovan, and  Big Daddy  Lipscomb fell in behind a special field general in Baltimore. Few took more punishment than Unitas. His refusal to leave the field, even when savagely bloodied by opposing linemen, won his teammates  respect. His insistence on taking the blame for others  mistakes inspired their love. His encyclopedic football mind, in which he d filed every play the Colts had ever run, was a wonder. In the seminal championship game of 1958, when Unitas led the Colts over the Giants in the NFL s first sudden-death overtime, Sundays changed. John didn t.

Increasingly, the distinction between the spaces considered public and private or work and home is becoming more blurred. As a result, innovative designs are needed to meet the challenges of our ever-changing environment. Our streets, parks, dwellings and tools are designed to a \\"one-size-fits-all\\" standard, and the responses of the design community to meet diverse needs have been mixed at best. Design and Feminism offers feminist critiques of these inadequate design standards, and suggest ideas, projects, and programs for change. The interdisciplinary essays reflect the writers' diverse fields- architecture, planning, industrial and graphic design, and architectural, urban, and design history. Essays cover such subject as rethinking the American city, graphic design and the urban landscape, working at home, theories of women and design, and a trio of essays on industrial designs. A review essay of the literature in these fields- the first of its kind- rounds out the collection. Contributors are Amelia Amon, Wendy E.

Patriarch Maestro acts as surrogate father, employing him to collect debts and perform thuggish tasks. Except for brief moments interacting with the gang,  the beast  spends his life alone, wandering Berlin s streets and sleeping in its vast housing projects. This changes in a flash when one of Maestro s sons is implicated in a crime. The only hope of saving him is to protect the sole witness, beautiful but eccentric Hanna Wyoczik. Maestro calls on  the beast  to move in with her until the trial.

Publishers Weekly In 1935, Heinrich Himmler established a Nazi research institute called The Ahnenerbe, whose mission was to send teams of scholars around the world to search for proof of ancient Aryan conquests. But history was not their most important focus. Rather, the Ahnenerbe was an essential part of Himmler s master plan for the Final Solution. The findings of the institute were used to convince armies of SS men that they were entitled to slaughter Jews and other groups. And Himmler also hoped to use the research as a blueprint for the breeding of a new Europe in a racially purer mold. The Master Plan is a groundbreaking expose of the work of German scientists and scholars who allowed their research to be warped to justify extermination, and who directly participated in the slaughter many of whom resumed their academic positions at war s end. It is based on Heather Pringle s extensive original research, including previously ignored archival material and unpublished photographs, and interviews with living members of the institute and their survivors. A sweeping history told with the drama of fiction, The Master Plan is at once horrifying, transfixing, and monumentally important to our comprehension of how something as unimaginable as the Holocaust could have progressed from fantasy to reality.  Pringle s engrossing book . . . explores a little-known corner of Nazi history: the story of the Ahnenerbe . . . rich in such bizarre characters, ridiculous theories and colorful anecdotes.

Her examination centers around two distinct though related figures: the Nightingale nurse and the New Woman doctor. The medical women in the fiction of Elizabeth Gaskell (Ruth), Wilkie Collins (The Woman in White), Dr. Margaret Todd (Mona McLean, Medical Student), Hilda Gregg (Peace with Honour), and others are analyzed in relation to nonfictional discussions of nurses and women doctors in medical publications, nursing tracts, feminist histories, and newspapers. Victorian anxieties over sexuality, disease, and moral corruption came together most persistently around the figure of a prostitute. However, Swenson takes as her focus for this volume an opposing figure, the medical woman, whom Victorians deployed to combat these social ills. As symbols of traditional female morality informed and transformed by the new social and medical sciences, representations of medical women influenced public debate surrounding women's education and employment, the Contagious Diseases Acts, and the health of the empire. At the same time, the presence of these educated, independent women, who received payment for performing tasks traditionally assigned to domestic women or servants, inevitably altered the meaning of womanhood and the positions of other women in Victorian culture. Swenson challenges more conventional histories of the rise of the actual nurse and the woman doctor by treating as equally important the development of cultural representations of these figures.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=8SpyhptLxecC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Gandhi on Non-Violence: A Selection From the Writings of Mahatma Gandi","description":"An essential compendium for understanding Gandhi's profound legacy. \\"One has to speak out and stand up for one's convictions. Inaction at a time of conflagration is inexcusable.\\" Mahatma Gandhi The basic principles of Gandhi's philosophy of non-violence (Ahimsa) and non-violent action (Satyagraha) were chosen by Thomas Merton for this volume in 1965. In his challenging Introduction, \\"Gandhi and the One-Eyed Giant,\\" Merton emphasizes the importance of action rather than mere pacifism as a central component of non-violence, and illustrates how the foundations of Gandhi's universal truths are linked to traditional Hindu Dharma, the Greek philosophers, and the teachings of Christ and Thomas Aquinas. Educated as a Westerner in South Africa, it was Gandhi's desire to set aside the caste system as well as his political struggles in India which led him to discover the dynamic power of non-cooperation. But, non-violence for Gandhi \\"was not simply a political tactic,\\" as Merton observes: \\"the spirit of non-violence sprang from an inner realization of spiritual unity in himself.\\" Gandhi's politics of spiritual integrity have influenced generations of people around the world, as well as civil rights leaders from Martin Luther King, Jr. and Steve Biko to V clav Havel and Aung San Suu Kyi. Mark Kurlansky has written an insightful preface for this edition that touches upon the history of non-violence and reflects the core of Gandhi's spiritual and ethical doctrine in the context of current global conflicts.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=-ipmQlPdVQIC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Student Audio Cd To Accompany Paroles, Second Edition","description":"Here's a fun and easy way to help learners understand and remember comprehension strategies!

Ashton argues first that the thought-world of the gospel is Jewish, not Greek, and secondly that the text is many-layered, not simple, and composed over an extended period as the evangelist responded to the changing situation of the community he was addressing. Ashton seeks to provide new and coherent answers to what Rudolf Bultmann called the two great riddles of the gospel: its position in the development of Christian thought and its central or governing idea. In arguing that the first of these should be concerned rather with Jewish thought Ashton offers a partial answer to the most important and fascinating of all the questions confronted by New Testament scholarship: how did Christianity emerge from Judaism? Bultmann's second riddle is exegetical, and concerns the message of the book. Ashton's answer highlights a generally neglected feature of the gospel's concept of revelation: its debt to Jewish apocalyptic.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=9tBfPwAACAAJ&dq=Understanding+the+Fourth+Gospel&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Heavy Metal: A Tank Company's Battle to Baghdad","description":"A no-holds-barred account from the tip of the Army's spear","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=GeBDYsm1dcYC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Tim Tim.

Its literary readings are couched in the history of Caribbean cricket and studies by Hilary Beckles and Gordon Rohlehr. C.L.R James  foundational Beyond a Boundary provides its theoretical grounding. Literary depictions of iconic West Indies players  including Constantine, Headley, Worrell, Walcott, Sobers, Richards, and Lara  feature throughout.

Attention is also paid to mother-daughter relations and female engagement with cricket, with examples from Anim-Addo, Breeze, Wynter and others. Cricket holds a prominent place in the history, culture, politics and popular imaginary of the Caribbean.

History is what we remember and write about that past, the narratives we craft to make sense out of our memories and their sources. But what does it mean to look at the past and to remember that \\"nothing happened\\"? Why might we feel as if \\"nothing is the way it was\\"? This book transforms these utterly ordinary observations and redefines \\"Nothing\\" as something we have known and can remember. \\"Nothing\\" has been a catch-all term for everything that is supposedly uninteresting or is just not there. It will take some possibly considerable mental adjustment before we can see Nothing as Susan A. Crane does here, with a capital \\"n.\\" But Nothing has actually been happening all along. As Crane shows in her witty and provocative discussion, Nothing is nothing less than fascinating. When Nothing has changed but we think that it should have, we might call that injustice; when Nothing has happened over a long, slow period of time, we might call that boring. Justice and boredom have histories. So too does being relieved or disappointed when Nothing happens for instance, when a forecasted end of the world does not occur, and millennial movements have to regroup. By paying attention to how we understand Nothing to be happening in the present, what it means to \\"know Nothing\\" or to \\"do Nothing,\\" we can begin to ask how those experiences will be remembered. Susan A. Crane moves effortlessly between different modes of seeing Nothing, drawing on visual analysis and cultural studies to suggest a new way of thinking about history. By remembering how Nothing happened, or how Nothing is the way it was, or how Nothing has changed, we can recover histories that were there all along.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=1TkCEAAAQBAJ&dq=Nothing+Happened&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"She Said, He Said (Harlequin Flipside)","description":"She Said, He Said by Cheryl Kushner released on Jan 11, 2005 is available now for purchase.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=SdoJ0d0ONxIC&dq=She+Said,+He+Said+(Harlequin+Flipside)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Bio of a Space Tyrant Volume 5: Statesman","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Secrets Can Kill","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Golden Bowl","description":"The Golden Bowl is a 1904 novel by Henry James.

Three thousand years ago on a battlefield in ancient Palestine, a shepherd boy felled a mighty warrior with nothing more than a stone and a sling, and ever since then the names of David and Goliath have stood for battles between underdogs and giants. David's victory was improbable and miraculous. He shouldn't have won. Or should he have? In David and Goliath, Malcolm Gladwellchallenges how we think about obstacles and disadvantages, offering a new interpretation of what it means to be discriminated against, or cope with a disability, or lose a parent, or attend a mediocre school, or suffer from any number of other apparent setbacks. Gladwell begins with the real story of what happened between the giant and the shepherd boy those many years ago. From there, David and Goliath examines Northern Ireland's Troubles, the minds of cancer researchers and civil rights leaders, murder and the high costs of revenge, and the dynamics of successful and unsuccessful classrooms all to demonstrate how much of what is beautiful and important in the world arises from what looks like suffering and adversity. In the tradition of Gladwell's previous bestsellers The Tipping Point, Blink, Outliers and What the Dog Saw David and Goliath draws upon history, psychology, and powerful storytelling to reshape the way we think of the world around us.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=oICRAwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"God Without the Supernatural: A Defense of Scientific Theism (Cornell Studies in the Philosophy of Religion)","description":"Peter Forrest expounds a program of best-explanation apologetics. He contends that since the existence of God would provide the best possible explanation of various facts, those facts support theism. Among the facts cited are the suitability of the universe for life, the regularity of the universe, the human capacity for intellectual progress, the experience of a moral order, and various forms of beauty. The beauty that interests Forrest as evidence for the existence of God includes sensuous beauty; the beauty of the natural order, as revealed by the sciences; and the beauty of necessity discovered by mathematicians. In addressing the need for an adequate motive for creation, Forrest conjectures that God created the universe for embodied persons not for their life on earth alone but also for an afterlife. Forrest acknowledges the speculative nature of such an account. He suggests that philosophical speculation is also required to defend theism against the charge that it is too extravagant a hypothesis to be warranted. Providing a speculative defense against the argument from evil, he explains how such speculations can be used to support best-explanation arguments without the conclusions themselves being rendered purely speculative.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=cW0u5-jn3okC&dq=God+Without+the+Supernatural:+A+Defense+of+Scientific+Theism+(Cornell+Studies+in+the+Philosophy+of+Religion)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"AN Improper Pursuit (A Zebra Regency Romance)","description":"Chastity Hartford, whose prospects for marriage had been ruined by a society scandal, is drawn to handsome military officer Alex Fitzsimmons, an undercover British agent on a secret mission that sweeps them both into a perilous encounter with spies--and love.

But his advice on the simple life has seemed too rugged for later generations, brought up in cities, pampered with conveniences and scared of nature. Vena and Brad Angier were fed up with their city bound existence and longtime readers and admirers of Thoreau, they set out to see if his discoveries were valid today. This is the account of two wilderness-loving tenderfeet, who headed for the tall timber on the banks of the Peace River, British Columbia. There near the trading post of Hudson Hope they found their Walden. How they made themselves  At Home in the Woods,  stocked their cabin, met their interesting wilderness neighbors who helped them get settled and who saw them through their first winter makes honest and exciting reading.

Yet the smoking gun that accounts for the hole in the foot, is, more often than not, in the hand of the protagonist complaining of the pain. Self-delusion courts self-destruction in these stories, but not without relief, since revelation is always possible and redemption just might come tumbling after. Though the stakes are sometimes low and the circumstances more rueful than tragic, Yates illuminates the gulf between expectation and reality with humor and compassion. Seduction does not inevitably lead to abandonment in these tales, although that is certainly one outcome. A disastrous young marriage is another. In one case, a seducer comes to see that a chance encounter with an old flame has not closed an incomplete narrative from the past, but most likely has opened a perilous new chapter. Other stories investigate dormant dread awakened by the hiccup of circumstance. A family man's decision to stop and assist a stalled motorist does not imperil his family as his wife fears. Yet the encounter reveals a burden of faith and guilt that continues to haunt this Samaritan and prompts his irrational, yet perhaps admirable, behavior. In another family tale, a father struggles with the imminent independence of his daughter, a struggle that, like much in his life, is distorted by his curious infatuation with the insomnia afflicting him. The collection's final piece concerns an aging, retired accountant who, stricken with intimations of mortality, hastily attempts to become well loved and eventually handsomely eulogized by undertaking good works, an undertaking he persists in pursuing against mounting odds. Men and women tell many of their own stories here. In other outings, the telling rests with bemused and attentive narrators, crowding in close, better to witness the charm and folly of the memorable characters assembled in this prize-winning collection.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ofZlAAAAMAAJ&dq=Bring+Everybody:+Stories+(Juniper+Prize+for+Fiction)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Notable Twentieth-Century Scientists (4 Volumes)","description":"V. 1, A-E -- v. 2, F-K -- v. 3, L-R -- v. 4, S-Z.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=HfI5AQAAIAAJ&dq=Notable+Twentieth-Century+Scientists+(4+Volumes)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"SAFE IN HEAVEN DEAD: INTERVIEWS WITH JACK KEROUAC","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=mE4zAAAAIAAJ&dq=SAFE+IN+HEAVEN+DEAD:+INTERVIEWS+WITH+JACK+KEROUAC&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Taijiquan Theory of Dr. Yang, Jwing-Ming: The Root of Taijiquan","description":"This profound work is guaranteed to raise the bar and demand debate on this ancient art.

It is one of the author's most popular works, along with The Three Musketeers. Like many of his novels, it is expanded from plot outlines suggested by his collaborating ghostwriter Auguste Maquet.The story takes place in France, Italy, and islands in the Mediterranean during the historical events of 1815-1839: the era of the Bourbon Restoration through the reign of Louis-Philippe of France. It begins just before the Hundred Days period (when Napoleon returned to power after his exile). The historical setting is a fundamental element of the book, an adventure story primarily concerned with themes of hope, justice, vengeance, mercy, and forgiveness. It centres around a man who is wrongfully imprisoned, escapes from jail, acquires a fortune, and sets about getting revenge on those responsible for his imprisonment. However, his plans have devastating consequences for the innocent as well as the guilty. In addition, it is a story that involves romance, loyalty, betrayal, and selfishness, shown throughout the story as characters slowly reveal their true inner nature.The book is considered a literary classic today. According to Luc Sante, \\"The Count of Monte Cristo has become a fixture of Western civilization's literature, as inescapable and immediately identifiable as Mickey Mouse, Noah's flood, and the story of Little Red Riding Hood.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=RyEEAAAAQAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Mayor of Aln","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=19XEAwAAQBAJ&dq=The+Mayor+of+Aln&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Quick Clicks: 40 Fast and Fun Behaviors to Train with a Clicker","description":"Learn clicker training without confusing jargon, using step-by-step instructions for training a variety of fun and useful behaviors.

The \\"frontier fictions,\\" or the ways in which the Iranians viewed their often fluctuating borders and the conflicts surrounding them, played a dominant role in defining the nation. On these borderlands, new ideas of citizenship and nationality were unleashed, refining older ideas of ethnicity. Kashani-Sabet maintains that land-based conceptions of countries existed before the advent of the modern nation-state. Her focus on geography enables her to explore and document fully a wide range of aspects of modern citizenship in Iran, including love of homeland, the hegemony of the Persian language, and widespread interest in archaeology, travel, and map-making. While many historians have focused on the concept of the \\"imagined community\\" in their explanations of the rise of nationalism, Kashani-Sabet is able to complement this perspective with a very tangible explanation of what connects people to a specific place. Her approach is intended to enrich our understanding not only of Iranian nationalism, but also of nationalism everywhere.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=cWeYDwAAQBAJ&dq=Frontier+Fictions&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The New Westminster Dictionary of Liturgy and Worship","description":"This distinguished and comprehensive dictionary should stand as the definitive reference work on all aspects of liturgical practice and belief for many years to come.

Hayek's social philosophy, often regarded as the centre piece of his famous work, and the fundamental findings about human thinking, society, the market system and social rules of conduct it is based on, is evaluated by leading contemporary social philosophers.

The Catholic Church contributes first and foremost to the common good by forming the consciences of the faithful. Faith helps reason achieve an understanding of the common good and guides individuals in living justly and harmoniously. In this book, J. Brian Benestad provides a detailed, accessible introduction to Catholic social doctrine (CSD), the Church s teachings on the human person, the family, society, political life, charity, justice, and social justice. Church, State, and Society explains the nuanced understanding of human dignity and the common good found in the Catholic intellectual tradition. It makes the case that liberal-arts education is an essential part of the common good because it helps people understand their dignity and all that justice requires. The author shows the influence of ancient and modern political philosophy and examines St. Augustine, St. Thomas Aquinas, papal social encyclicals, Vatican Council II, and postconciliar magisterial teaching. Benestad highlights the teachings of popes John Paul II and Benedict XVI that the attainment of the common good depends on the practice of the virtues by citizens and leaders alike. In addition to discussing the tension between CSD and liberal democracy, the book takes an in-depth look at: Key themes of social life: the dignity of the human person, human rights, natural law, and the common good Three principal mediating institutions of civil society: family, Church, and Catholic university The economy, work, poverty, immigration, and the environment The international community and just war principles  Excellent . . .

The most important thing, he observed, was to have strong convictions that guided your life this was the common denominator he saw in all successful people and enterprises. Fortunately for us, he was eager to share his own blueprint for personal success and happiness with the rest of the world.

These principles were grounded in virtues that he considered important enough to be considered the  laws of life  they include honesty, perseverance, thrift, enthusiasm, humility, and altruism. From this moral foundation, Templeton formulated a step-by-step plan to help improve anyone s personal and professional life. Among the steps he enumerates, readers will find:   Four exercises that will help anyone find the positive in every negative   How to be the one person in ten that will productively use more time than they waste   The secret trait that separates great workers from good workers   How to control your thoughts for effective action   The practical applications of a sense of humility   How successful people approach risks differently from most people Taken as a whole, the lessons contained within his twenty-one steps will help readers make lasting friendships, reap significant financial rewards, and find personal satisfaction.

He freely admitted that he didn t know everything and that there was yet much to be discovered about prosperity and joy.

Recently orphaned when his parents were killed in an auto accident, his only blood relative is Harry Rowe. Rowe is the wealthy C.E.O. of a company that searches out and destroys computer viruses, NetPro, Inc. Married to a very beautiful and youthful wife, Pamela, who is nearly as young as Martin, Rowe has always been so Bohemian that he has been a virtual outcast from Martins family. When Martin makes a Christmas visit to the Rowe mansion hoping to become better acquainted with the Rowes, Harry is murdered. His dying word is peccavi. The F.B.I. has had an interest in Harry because it, in the personage of Special Agent Teresa Kingsley, thinks that he or his colleagues might be involved in causing the bankruptcy of several companies, the failure of each being precipitated by virus-spawned destruction of the companys computer system. After much puzzlement and searching, young Thorpe finds that peccavi is the password to an obscure computer file belonging to Harry. On opening the file, he discovers that it contains a curious series of numbers and letters, undoubtedly an code of some type, but one that neither the F.B.I. nor the National Security Agency can break. Meanwhile Pamela, Rowes youthful widow, is making a serious flirtation with Thorpe. Somewhat callow, he resists but not long nor successfully. The reader now learns that the Exeter hedge fund with its Mafia connections, is involved with the computer viruses, with the resultant company failures, and even in the murder of Harry Rowe. Moreover, Exeter is being deprived of profits because some unknown person has been contacting companies that have had viruses implanted but as yet not activated. For a very high price, this unknown person has supplied various companies with their particular virus signature. The result is that then the virus can be isolated and removed before it causes harm and that company is no longer a potential profit source to Exeter whose shorts and puts and derivatives are all geared to gain from the bankruptcy of that firm. A number of murders now are committed as Exeter tries to eliminate any person who could possibly have the knowledge or access to sufficient information to carry out this elaborate blackmail scheme. Thorpe and Special Agent Kingsley take separate but parallel courses of analysis and investigation. Gradually it becomes clear that Harry Rowe had indeed been the brains behind the implantation of very sophisticated stealth viruses in the computers of a number of companies and had gained significant wealth from his past efforts. Next, the Reader learns from the Rowe lawyer that Harrys offshore accounts total nearly $40,000,000 and that, as Pamela had earlier suspected, this money is going to be left to his nephew, Martin Thorpe, instead of being hers to inherit. Martin is unaware of this impending good fortune. As all but one of Harrys partners and their spouses are killed at the behest of Exeter and a murder attempt is made on Rowes widow, Kingsley finally locates an offshore account in Belize belonging to Pamela. Suspicion supplants sympathy for her. When Pamela is convinced that the F.B.I. suspects her and is closing in, she attempts to flee by herself to Buenos Aires. How involved was she in Harry Rowes murder? Can she identify and implicate individuals in the Exeter Fund? Is she the blackmailer of companies that have bought their liberation from the stealth viruses? If so, does she possess the $26,000,000 the various companies have paid? Can companies already infected with the viruses that are as yet not triggered be saved? Does Pamela know the key to the Peccavi code and have the information to neutralize it?

The activities create an exciting context for students to engage in creative learning, gaining a great deal of astronomical knowledge.The unit begins when students attempt to decode a fictitious message from outer space. Imagining that they are SETI scientists, students begin to analyze where, in the solar system and beyond, there may be conditions favorable for life. They investigate how our solar system and other planetary systems may have formed, and consider how what we know about the solar system fits into a bigger picture of the universe. Throughout, students consider whether life could exist out there and, if so, how we might communicate with those lifeforms. In doing so, students also gain valuable experience distinguishing science fact from sensationalized fiction. Messages from Space includes background information and diverse resources. Teachers do not need to have special knowledge of astronomy to present this unit successfully. All GEMS guides are thoroughly tested in classrooms nationwide and come complete with clear step-by-step instructions, assessment suggestions, literature connections, and ideas for further investigation.I must say that I enjoyed this unit more than any other GEMS unit I've used and so did my students. The underlying theme of the message held everyone's attention and was a useful hook to grasp onto throughout the unit. And the travel brochure and science fiction storiesprovided excellent opportunities for assessment.-Teacher, Alexandria, VirginiaI would strongly recommend these creative, interesting, and attention-grabbing activities.

For over thirty years, in over twenty international bestsellers, he has a set a standard that has never been equaled. Now, with the Prometheus Deception, he proves that he is at the very pinnacle of his craft. Nicholas Bryson spent years as a deep cover operative for the American secret intelligence group, the Directorate. After critical undercover mission went horribly wrong, Bryson was retired to a new identity. Years later, his closely held cover is cracked and Bryson learns that the Directorate was not what it claimed - that he was a pawn in a complex scheme against his own country's interests. Now, it has become increasingly clear that the shadowy Directorate is headed for some dangerous endgame - but no one knows precisely who they are and what they are planning. With Bryson their only possible asset, the director of the CIA recruits Bryson to find, reinfiltrate, and stop the Directorate. But after years on the sidelines, Bryson's field skills are rusty, his contacts unreliable, and his instincts suspect. With everything he thought he knew about his own life in question, Bryson is all alone in a wilderness of mirrors - unsure what is and isn't true and who, if anyone, he can trust - with the future of millions in the balance.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=gQriDEUE7-UC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Underground Man","description":"Fyodor Dostoyevsky s  Notes from Underground  is considered by many to be the first existentialist novel.

Frank King traces this rich history from its beginnings in 1886 to the railroads' disappearance around 1937 when the last of the giant sawmills closed down. King profiles every logging railroad in Minnesota and examines all aspects of their operations, including locomotives such as the geared Shays and Heislers, McGiffert log loaders, Russel log cars, dump trestles, hot ponds, logging camp life, railroad finances, and the impact on communities as timber supplies ran out and lumbering and sawmill operations shut down, causing thousands to lose their jobs. Heavily illustrated throughout, Minnesota Logging Railroads contains maps, photographs, postcards, engineering drawings, and railroad memorabilia such as timetables, passes, fare receipts, and freight tariffs.

These fantastic stories have travelled across cultural borders, and been passed on from generation to generation, ever-changing, renewed with each re-telling. Few forms of literature have greater power to enchant us and rekindle our imagination than a fairy tale. But what is a fairy tale? Where do they come from and what do they mean? What do they try and communicate to us about morality, sexuality, and society? The range of fairy tales stretches across great distances and time; their history is entangled with folklore and myth, and their inspiration draws on ideas about nature and the supernatural, imagination and fantasy, psychoanalysis, and feminism. Marina Warner has loved fairy tales over a long writing life, and she explores here a multitude of tales through the ages, their different manifestations on the page, the stage, and the screen. From the phenomenal rise of Victorian and Edwardian literature to contemporary children's stories, Warner unfolds a glittering array of examples, from classics such as Red Riding Hood, Cinderella, and The Sleeping Beauty, the Grimm Brothers' Hansel and Gretel, and Hans Andersen's The Little Mermaid, to modern-day realizations including Walt Disney's Snow White and gothic interpretations such as Pan's Labyrinth. In ten succinct chapters, Marina Warner digs into a rich hoard of fairy tales in their brilliant and fantastical variations, in order to define a genre and evaluate a literary form that keeps shifting through time and history. Her book makes a persuasive case for fairy tale as a crucial repository of human understanding and culture.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=OkaPBQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Julie and Debbie's Guide to Getting Rich on Just $10 a Week: We're Making a Fortune, And You Can Too, Using Dividend Re-Investment Plans","description":"Provides information on how to invest with dividends","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=VTdw2CL49mYC&dq=Julie+and+Debbie%27s+Guide+to+Getting+Rich+on+Just+%2410+a+Week:+We%27re+Making+a+Fortune,+And+You+Can+Too,+Using+Dividend+Re-Investment+Plans&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Environmental Geology (8th Edition)","description":"Presenting the student with a broad overview of environmental geology, Montgomery looks both at how the Earth developed into its present condition and where matters seem to be moving for the future in order to provide a useful foundation for discussing and evaluating specific environmental issues.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=s_GYvAEACAAJ&dq=Environmental+Geology+(8th+Edition)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Pembroke","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"What the Bible Says about Child Training","description":"This is a study to help parents better discover the mechanics for successfully raising children.

Hailsham seems like a pleasant English boarding school, far from the influences of the city. Its students are well tended and supported, trained in art and literature, and become just the sort of people the world wants them to be. But, curiously, they are taught nothing of the outside world and are allowed little contact with it. Within the grounds of Hailsham, Kathy grows from schoolgirl to young woman, but it s only when she and her friends Ruth and Tommy leave the safe grounds of the school (as they always knew they would) that they realize the full truth of what Hailsham is. Never Let Me Go breaks through the boundaries of the literary novel. It is a gripping mystery, a beautiful love story, and also a scathing critique of human arrogance and a moral examination of how we treat the vulnerable and different in our society. In exploring the themes of memory and the impact of the past, Ishiguro takes on the idea of a possible future to create his most moving and powerful book to date.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=OBwDg13MGkMC&dq=Never+Let+Me+Go+(A+Regency+Romance)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Beacons of South Carolina","description":"This book is being reprinted in a new edition.

As the group slowly moved across the rocky moonscape of the caldera near the heart of the volcano, Galeras erupted, its crater exploding in a barrage of burning rocks and glowing shrapnel. Nine men died instantly, their bodies torn apart by the blast. While others watched helplessly from the rim, Colombian geologist Marta Calvache raced into the rumbling crater, praying to find survivors. This was Calvache's second volcanic disaster in less than a decade. In 1985 Calvache was part of a group of Colombia's brightest young scientists that had been studying activity at Nevado del Ruiz, a volcano three hundred miles north of Galeras. They had warned of the dire consequences of an eruption for months, but their fledgling coalition lacked the resources and muscle to implement a plan of action or sway public opinion. When Nevado del Ruiz erupted suddenly in November 1985, it wiped the city of Armero off the face of the earth and killed more than twenty-three thousand people -- one of the worst natural disasters of the twentieth century. No Apparent Danger links the characters and events of these two eruptions to tell a riveting story of scientific tragedy and human heroism. In the aftermath of Nevado del Ruiz, volcanologists from all over the world came to Galeras -- some to ensure that such horrors would never be repeated, some to conduct cutting-edge research, and some for personal gain. Seismologists, gas chemists, geologists, and geophysicists hoped to combine their separate areas of expertise to better understand and predict the behavior of monumental forces at work deep within the earth. And yet, despite such expertise, experience, and training, crucial data were ignored or overlooked, essential safety precautions were bypassed, and fifteen people descended into a death trap at Galeras. Incredibly, expedition leader Stanley Williams was one of five who survived, aided bravely by Marta Calvache and her colleagues. But nine others were not so lucky. Expertly detailing the turbulent history of Colombia and the geology of its snow-peaked volcanoes, Victoria Bruce weaves together the stories of the heroes, victims, survivors, and bystanders, evoking with great sensitivity what it means to live in the shadow of a volcano, a hair's-breadth away from unthinkable natural calamity, and shows how clashing cultures and scientific arrogance resulted in tragic and unnecessary loss of life.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=GPw7VI5dN68C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Living from Your Center (Inner Vision Series)","description":"These divas represent the voices of past and future generations, such as Tyra Banks, Terry McMillan, Harriette Cole, Maya Angelou, Iyanla Vanzant, Nikki Giovanni, Dawn Davis, Adrienne Ingrum, Carol Mackey, Oprah Winfrey, Rosa Parks, Shirley Chisholm, Coretta Scott King, Zora Neal Hurston, and Octavia Butler.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=jdCAQJwYeXMC&dq=Living+from+Your+Center+(Inner+Vision+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Bare Truth: Stars of Burlesque From the '40s and '50s","description":"Len Rothe has again pulled from his collection of original photographs of entertainers this delightful selection of over 100 images of Burlesque stars.

Golf Digest Tom Coyne s A Course Called Scotland is a heartfelt and humorous celebration of his quest to play golf on every links course in Scotland, the birthplace of the game he loves. For much of his adult life, bestselling author Tom Coyne has been chasing a golf ball around the globe. When he was in college, studying abroad in London, he entered the lottery for a prized tee time in Scotland, grabbing his clubs and jumping the train to St. Andrews as his friends partied in Amsterdam; later, he golfed the entirety of Ireland s coastline, chased pros through the mini-tours, and attended grueling Qualifying Schools in Australia, Canada, and Latin America. Yet, as he watched the greats compete, he felt something was missing. Then one day a friend suggested he attempt to play every links course in Scotland and qualify for the greatest championship in golf. The result is A Course Called Scotland,  a fast-moving, insightful, often funny travelogue encompassing the width of much of the British Isles  (GolfWeek), including St. Andrews, Turnberry, Dornoch, Prestwick, Troon, and Carnoustie. With his signature blend of storytelling, humor, history, and insight, Coyne weaves together his  witty and charming  (Publishers Weekly) journey to more than 100 legendary courses in Scotland with compelling threads of golf history and insights into the contemporary home of golf. As he journeys Scotland in search of the game s secrets, he discovers new and old friends, rediscovers the peace and power of the sport, and, most importantly, reaffirms the ultimate connection between the game and the soul. It is  a must-read  (Golf Advisor) rollicking love letter to Scotland and golf as no one has attempted it before.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=nbGWDwAAQBAJ&dq=The+Championship+Courses+of+Scotland&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Sustainable Kitchen: Passionate Cooking Inspired by Farms, Forests and Oceans","description":"Offers a collection of tasty and earth-friendly recipes for fine cuisine that promotes economic, environmental, and social health of communities through cooking with seasonal ingredients grown locally.

Chapter I, \\"The Whimper Carter Tales\\" portrays, in a vivid manner, the art of storytelling. It brings the reader vis-a-vis with Winfrey \\"Whimper\\" Carter who epitomized Appalachian storytelling and imagination. Imagine a preacher re-learning profanity because a lawnmower will not start. Alternatively, a teenager thinking a snake bites him when he was actually shot. Humor is to life what blood is to the heart, and Chapter I contains a huge dose of humor. In addition, it's interspersed with historical facts which provide interesting reading. Chapter II, \\"A Lad's Heroes\\" is a poignant true story of a small boy who develops a her worship for two older cousins who served with Airborne units in World War II. This hero worship leads the lad into the United States Army and the Airborne. He, too, becomes a paratrooper as a memorial to his relatives, one who was killed in action at the Battle of the Bulge. It is a story that any combat veteran or those interested in military history will enjoy. Chapter III, \\"A Towheaded Boy and a Fifty-Dollar Rooster\\" is an equally emotional story that contains some levity. This chapter describes the love and devotion that can develop between a boy and his pets. it further denotes how experiences in childhood may affect a person for life. Chapter IV, \\"The Day of the Sermon\\" is a fictional account of a historical episode that shows the suffering of slaves in the ante-bellum South without being academic. It also deals with a devout preacher having the courage to challenge the slave holders in his congregation to determine a way to free those in bondage. Chapter IV invites people to examine the memories of slavery and its effect on this nation. Chapter V, \\"The Taking of a Deer\\" is a serious historical fiction account based on a true story of an underdog who was defended in court, gratis, by a wealthy and influential lawyer who once served as a Governor of Tennessee. It demonstrates that the laws of God and commons sense can prevail over laws and justice can be served to the underprivileged. Chapter VI, \\"The Uncle Cad Tales\\" depicts humans as they actually exist. This entire chapter consists of humorous tales spoken by a real character who has never received any attention other than through those who have known him. Overall, Bridges is a book that will be enjoyable to people of both sexes and all ages. Everyone, regardless of social status, will find something in Bridges that is fulfilling.

Hinayana flourished in Ceylon, Burma, Siam and Cambodia; Mystic Buddhism developed in Tibet; Mahayana grew in China. In Japan the whole of Buddhism became the living and active faith of the mass of the people. The present study relates to Japanese Buddhism, as in Japan alone the whole of Buddhism has been preserved. The author presents Buddhist Philosophy in an ideological sequence, but it is not the sequence in the development of ideas; it is rather the systematization of the different schools of thought for the purpose of easier approach. Divided into fifteen chapters, the book deals with different schools of Buddhist Philosophy. The author has grouped these schools under two heads: (1) the schools of Negative Rationalism, i.e. the Religion of Dialectic Investigation, and (2) the schools of Introspective Intuitionism, i.e. the Religion of Meditative Experience.

However, the tiny kingdom of Khoraja - with a mixed Hyborian/Shemite population, culture, and religion - stands in his way. Khoraja is presently ruled by the beautiful Yasmela, sister of the king, who is now a prisoner in neighboring Ophir. In fear of Natohk's potential invasion, Yasmela seeks advice from the long-forgotten god of her ancestors, Mitra.

National Security Advisor Greg Lambert must keep and tell secrets that may lead to Armageddon; Reservist David Chandler must leave his pregnant wife in order to drive a tank; U.S. President Walter Livingston, eager for peace, must endure the ignominy of impeachment; Russian General Yuri Razov must deal with the consequences of his initial decision to launch nuclear missiles. Ground, air and submarine battles alternate with scenes of anarchy stateside as exhausted leaders are forced to make instant decisions that might snuff out humanity forever. With a masterful grasp of military strategy and geopolitics, Harry moves his characters through nightmares of blood and death; his intricately detailed scenes of nuclear devastation are particularly horrifying. Told through a series of rapid-fire climaxes, this novel, a political and military cautionary tale of considerable power and conviction, will keep readers riveted.

Patton Anderson, Confederate General: A Biography","description":"J. Patton Anderson was from Florida, the seceding state that was referred to as the \\"tadpole\\" of the Confederate states, but nevertheless he was one of the Confederacy's great military leaders. Anderson oversaw a large plantation, Casa Bianca, and his views meshed with secessionist views sufficiently for him to be elected as a delegate to the Secession Conference held in Montgomery, Alabama. After Florida seceded, President Davis appointed Anderson as a Brigadier General. Anderson engaged the enemy in the Western theater for four years under his mentor, General Braxton Bragg, who advanced him to Major General in command of the District of Florida. This is a complete biography of Anderson's life, including his service in the Mexican War, his appointment as United States Marshal to the distant Washington Territory, his adventure (with his wife, Etta Adair) of taking the 1853 Washington Territory census by canoe, his election as territorial delegate to Washington City, and his entire Civil War service.

The book revolves around the central idea that writers improve most quickly by combining the powers of technique (craft) with creativity (magic). Applying this method to news and feature writing--both print and online--it focuses on leads, organization, transition, clarity, drama, and other elements that drive good writing toward excellence. Aimed at students in upper-level undergraduate writing and reporting courses, Writing as Craft and Magic provides a clear and succinct instructional system--with practical models, a wealth of examples, and step-by-step guides--to help students understand and apply craft and magic to daily assignments. Author Carl Sessions Stepp, a seasoned journalist at the national level, structures his system in three parts. He first evokes the art of writing, then applies that art to standard journalistic writing, and concludes with a strong section on advanced writing techniques for features. He also offers advice and tips on how newsrooms currently operate in the age of multimedia journalism. This revised edition includes an expanded exercise section at the end of each chapter, more coverage of the demands of multimedia journalism (convergence), and updated chapters on incorporating the Internet into research and writing for the daily news cycle.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=HpgLAQAAMAAJ&dq=Writing+as+Craft+and+Magic&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Aristophanes Peace","description":"This is a new edition, the first for thirty years, with introduction and commentary, of one of only eleven preserved plays of Aristophanes, the greatest master of the Athenian comic theatre.

This book charts the exploration of an unknown world: our own. Just as Renaissance travelers set out to map the terra incognito of the New World, the mapmakers of Terra Forma have set out to rediscover the world that we think we know. They do this with a new kind of cartography that maps living things rather than space emptied of life and available to be conquered or colonized. The maps in Terra Forma lead us inward, not off into the distance, moving from the horizon line of conventional cartography to the thickness of the ground, from the global to the local. Each map in Terra Forma is based on a specific territory or territories, and each tool, or model, creates a new focal point through which the territory is redrawn. The maps are  living maps,  always under construction, spaces where stories and situations unfold. They may map the Earth s underside rather than its surface, suggest turning the layers of the Earth inside out, link the biological physiology of living inhabitants and the physiology of the land, or trace a journey oriented not by the Euclidean space of GPS but by points of life. These speculative visualizations can constitute the foundation for a new kind of atlas.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=uLZNEAAAQBAJ&dq=Terra&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Harry the Dirty Dog","description":"There's never been another dog as delightfulor dirtyas Harry.

Houses and mansions, castles and abbeys - Simon has left no stone unturned in his quest to capture the ghostly nature of these strange places on film.

Nearly all those punished were women. This episode in French history continues to provoke shame and unease and as a result has never been the subject of a thorough examination.This groundbreaking book by Fabrice Virgili throws new light on these acts of retribution and reveals that, contrary to popular belief, a vast number of those women accused were innocent of any sexual involvement with Germans. Further, this form of punishment was in evidence well before the Liberation and in fact occurred in most European countries both in the twentieth century and earlier.Why were these punishments largely directed at women? Was a relationship with a German emblematic of female collaboration and betrayal, or were contemporary feelings of violence towards the enemy subsequently re-directed? Answering these questions and many more, Virgili suggests that the punishment was not only meted out for 'horizontal collaboration' but also for many other forms of involvement, and that the act of shaving the head was itself a form of sexual punishment. For Virgili, the public nature of the punishment was a defence strategy, a response to the German Occupation and a reaction to the suffering and violence that had preceded the Liberation.This pioneering investigation of one of France's darkest moments will be fascinating reading for anyone interested in World War II, French history or women's studies.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=JwbBwAEACAAJ&dq=Shorn+Women&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Three Jacobean tragedies (Penguin English library)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=YpodMwEACAAJ&dq=Three+Jacobean+tragedies+(Penguin+English+library)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"American War Poetry: An Anthology","description":"Arranged by war, the book begins with the Colonial period and proceeds through Whitman admiring Civil War soldiers crossing a river to end with Brian Turner, who published his first book in 2005, beckoning a bullet in contemporary Iraq.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=GMV1-DVh4sIC&dq=American+War+Poetry:+An+Anthology&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Book of Ephesians: An Annotated Bibliography (Books of the Bible)","description":"Cites and describes 1,571 monographs, articles, introductions to editions, essays, and dissertations produced over the past 50 years on Paul's letters to the Ephesians.

It begins with the shock of hammer blows as the Titan Prometheus is shackled to a rock in the Caucasus. This is his punishment for giving the gift of fire to humankind and for thwarting Zeus s decision to exterminate the human race. Prometheus s pain is unceasing, but he refuses to recant his commitment to humanity, to whom he has also brought the knowledge of writing, mathematics, medicine, and architecture. He hints that he knows how Zeus will be brought low in the future, but when Hermes demands that Prometheus divulge his secret, he refuses and is sent spinning into the abyss by a divine thunderbolt. To whom does humanity look for guidance: to the supreme deity or to the rebel Titan? What law controls the cosmos? Prometheus Bound, one of the great poetic achievements of the ancient world, appears here in a splendid new translation by Joel Agee that does full justice to the harsh and keening music of the original Greek.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=TGA9DwAAQBAJ&dq=Prometheus+Bound&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The 8 Essential Traits of Couples Who Thrive","description":"The author of If I m So Wonderful, Why Am I Still Single? shows you how to have a joyful relationship by internally shifting your concept of marriage.

L. R. James's classic Beyond a Boundary, the sport is cricket and the scene is the colonial West Indies. Always eloquent and provocative, James--the \\"black Plato,\\" (as coined by the London Times)--shows us how, in the rituals of performance and conflict on the field, we are watching not just prowess but politics and psychology at play. Part memoir of a boyhood in a black colony (by one of the founding fathers of African nationalism), part passionate celebration of an unusual and unexpected game, Beyond a Boundary raises, in a warm and witty voice, serious questions about race, class, politics, and the facts of colonial oppression. Originally published in England in 1963 and in the United States twenty years later (Pantheon, 1983), this second American edition brings back into print this prophetic statement on race and sport in society.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=hqonvbosbG4C&dq=Beyond+a+Boundary&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Great War and the Language of Modernism","description":"With the expressions \\"Lost Generation\\" and \\"The Men of 1914,\\" the major authors of modernism designated the overwhelming effect the First World War exerted on their era. Literary critics have long employed the same phrases in an attempt to place a radically experimental, specifically modernist writing in its formative, historical setting. What real basis did that Great War provide for the verbal inventiveness of modernist poetry and fiction? Does the literature we bring under this heading respond directly to that provocation, and, if so, what historical memories or revelations can be heard to stir in these words? Vincent Sherry reopens these long unanswered questions by focusing attention on the public culture of the English war. He reads the discourses through which the Liberal party constructed its cause, its Great Campaign. A breakdown in the established language of liberal modernity--the idioms of public reason and civic rationality--marked the sizable crisis this event represents in the mainstream traditions of post-Reformation Europe. If modernist writing characteristically attempts to challenge the standard values of Enlightenment rationalism, this study recovers the historical cultural setting of its most substantial and daring opportunity. And this moment was the occasion for great artistic innovations in the work of Virginia Woolf, T.S. Eliot, and Ezra Pound. Combining the records of political journalism and popular intellectual culture with abundant visual illustration, Vincent Sherry provides the framework for new interpretations of the major texts of Woolf, Eliot, and Pound. With its relocation of the verbal imagination of modernism in the context of the English war, The Great War and the Language of Modernism restores the historical content and depth of this literature, revealing its most daunting import.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=0MjhBwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Homer in English (Poets in Translation, Penguin)","description":"\\"Pope spent his formative years as a poet translating Homer, beginning with the Iliad, and in his translation he successfully found a style that answers the sublimity and grace of Homer.

The conference -The Maternal Roots of the Gift Economy, - held in Rome in 2015, brought together women and men from around the world to discuss this important issue.In a moment when the values of Patriarchy and the market seem to have triumphed, the values of mothering and care are more sorely needed than ever. This book explores many aspects of the gift paradigm from a variety of points of view, taking into account theory and practice, activism and spirituality, as well as the experience of Indigenous societies North and South where maternal values are still at the centre for both women and men. Readers will find abundant evidence of ways of thinking and being that are possible beyond the Patriarchal Capitalism that is now threatening the existence of life on Mother Earth.

As such, the Arabists exerted considerable influence both as career diplomats and as bureaucrats within the State Department from the early nineteenth century to the present. But over time, as this work shows, the group increasingly lost touch with a rapidly changing American society, growing both more insular and headstrong and showing a marked tendency to assert the Arab point of view. Drawing on interviews, memoirs, and other official and private sources, Kaplan reconstructs the 100-year history of the Arabist elite, demonstrating their profound influence on American attitudes toward the Middle East, and tracing their decline as an influx of ethnic and regional specialists has transformed the State Department and challenged the power of the old elite.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=o5bFOoSeHlAC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cities Ranked& Rated: More than 400 Metropolitan Areas Evaluated in the U.S. and Canada","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Photography The Concise Guide","description":"The perfect companion while in the field or in the lab, PHOTOGRAPHY: THE CONCISE GUIDE provides a straightforward, comprehensive introduction to photography for the film and digital photographer.

All are difficult, but in one instant of anger one of the most powerful emotions lives can be ruined, and health and spiritual development can be destroyed.

It hones in on the three key measures necessary for aspiring authors to conceptualize, sell, and market their memoirs.

Brooks and Richardson use the latest social networking, marketing, and promotional trends and explain how to conceptualize and strategize campaigns that cause buzz, dramatically fueling word-of-mouth and attracting attention in the publishing world and beyond.

A group of English Catholics, seeking to unseat the king and reintroduce Catholicism as the state religion, daringly placed thirty-six barrels of gunpowder in a cellar under the Palace of Westminster. Their aim was to ignite the gunpowder at the opening of the Parliamentary session. Though the charismatic Catholic, Robert Catesby, was the group's leader, it was the devout Guy Fawkes who emerged as its most famous member, as he was the one who was captured and who revealed under torture the names of his fellow plotters. In the aftermath of their arrests, conditions grew worse for English Catholics, as legal penalties against them were stiffened and public sentiment became rabidly intolerant. In a narrative that reads like a gripping detective story, Antonia Fraser has untangled the web of religion, politics, and personalities that surrounded that fateful night of November 5. And, in examining the lengths to which individuals will go for their faith, she finds in this long-ago event a reflection of the religion-inspired terrorism that has produced gunpowder plots of our own time.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=qk9GAwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Pictorial Library of the Bible Lands: Pictorial Library of Bible Lands-Galilee & the North: Volume 1","description":"The most complete collection of high resolution Bible Land images available!

Like Eats, Shoots & Leaves, Talk to the Hand is not a stuffy guidebook, and is sure to inspire spirited conversation. Why hasn t your nephew ever thanked you for your carefully selected gift? What makes your contractor think it s fine to snub you in the midst of a major renovation? Why do crowds spawn selfishness? What accounts for the appalling treatment you receive in stores (if you re lucky enough to get a clerk s attention at all)? Most important, what will it take to roll back a culture that applauds those who are disrespectful? In a recent U.S. survey, 79 percent of adults said that lack of courtesy was a serious problem.

With parallels to Osama bin Laden, Alamut tells the story of how Sabbah was able to instill fear into the ruling class by creating a small army of devotees who were willing to kill, and be killed, in order to achieve paradise. Believing in the supreme Ismaili motto  Nothing is true, everything is permitted,  Sabbah wanted to  experiment  with how far he could manipulate religious devotion for his own political gain through appealing to what he called the stupidity and gullibility of people and their passion for pleasure and selfish desires. The novel focuses on Sabbah as he unveils his plan to his inner circle, and on two of his young followers   the beautiful slave girl Halima, who has come to Alamut to join Sabbah's paradise on earth, and young ibn Tahir, Sabbah's most gifted fighter. As both Halima and ibn Tahir become disillusioned with Sabbah's vision, their lives take unexpected turns. Alamut was originally written in 1938 as an allegory to Mussolini's fascist state. In the 1960's it became a cult favorite throughout Tito's Yugoslavia, and in the 1990s, during the Balkan's War, it was read as an allegory of the region's strife and became a bestseller in Germany, France and Spain. Following the attacks of September 11, 2001, the book once again took on a new life, selling more than 20,000 copies in a new Slovenian edition, and being translated around the world in more than 19 languages.

His case has generated more controversy and received more attention, both national and international, than that of any other inmate currently under sentence of death in the United States of America. Mumia Abu Jamal, black, was convicted and sentenced to death in July 1982 for the murder of white police officer Daniel Faulkner on December 9, 1981. He has steadfastly maintained his innocence. Since the trial, those advocating his release or retrial have contested the validity of much of the evidence used to obtain his conviction. These accusations have been countered by members of the law enforcement community and their supporters, who have agitated for Abu-Jamal's execution while maintaining that the trial was unbiased. Based on its review of the trial transcript and other original documents, human rights organization Amnesty International believes that the interests of justice would best be served by the granting of a new trial to Mumia Abu-Jamal.

As ingenious at capturing the surreal as he is at documenting the very real social landscape of modern Cairo, Mahfouz guides these restless spirits as they migrate from the shadowy realms of other worlds to the haunted precincts of our own.

Full facsimile of the original edition, not reproduced with Optical Recognition Software. Originally published as part of the Rosicrucian library Volume 5, this work is divided into 12 sections, and offers timeless advice on ethics, morality, man's duty to himself, his family and his society and his place in the universe. The book is thought by some to have been written by the Egyptian Pharaoh Amenhotep IV during the years 1360 to 1350 B.C. More commonly known as Akenaton, the pharaoh is generally credited as being the founder of the world's earliest monotheistic religion. The language is poetic and the advice is timeless. Written in a style similar to the biblical Book of Proverbs, \\"Unto The I Grant\\" uses vivid sayings so its counsel will be easily remembered when needed. For example, when the author warns against seeking revenge for earthly slights, he writes: Revenge is painful in the intent, and it dangerous in the execution; seldom doth the axe fall where he who lifted it up intended; and lo, he remembereth not that it will recoil against him. It is noteworthy how true these discourses remain 3000 years after they were written. The sections on dealing with servants and subordinates are a text book modern managers could learn much from. Whether you are looking for a code of ethics, a manual for modern living or just good literature, Unto Thee I Grant would be a must for the library of any sincere seeker.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=CsHGoAEACAAJ&dq=Unto+Thee+I+Grant+(Rosicrucian+Library,+Vol.+V)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Fox Farm","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=BHlCAQAAMAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Marvel Universe Roleplaying Game: Guide to Spider-Man's NYC (Marvel Role Playing Game)","description":"A role-playing game enables Marvel fans to emulate more than forty favorite heroes or villains including Spider-Man, the X-Men, and Daredevil, in a guide that includes game system rules, character profiles, and a beginning adventure complete with maps.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Dj8BAAAACAAJ&dq=Marvel+Universe+Roleplaying+Game:+Guide+to+Spider-Man%27s+NYC+(Marvel+Role+Playing+Game)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Introducing Microsft Windows 98 (Introducing (Microsoft))","description":"An update of the popular beta edition of \\"Introducing Microsoft Windows 98\\", this second edition has been fully revised to cover the release version of Windows 98.

A bloody thirty-year struggle between the dynastic houses of Lancaster and York, they embraced localised vendetta (such as the bitter northern feud between the Percies and Nevilles) as well as the formal clash of royalist and rebel armies at St Albans, Ludford Bridge, Mortimer's Cross, Towton, Tewkesbury and finally Bosworth, when the usurping Yorkist king, Richard III, was crushed by Henry Tudor. Powerful personalities dominate the period: the charismatic and enigmatic Richard III, immortalized by Shakespeare; the slippery Warwick, the Kingmaker', who finally over-reached ambition to be cut down at the Battle of Barnet; and guileful women like Elizabeth Woodville and Margaret of Anjou, who for a time ruled the kingdom in her husband's stead. David Grummitt places the violent events of this complex time in the wider context of fifteenth-century kingship and the development of English political culture.Never losing sight of the traumatic impact of war on the lives of those who either fought in or were touched by battle, this captivating new history will make compelling reading for students of the late medieval period and Tudor England, as well as for general readers.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=QsqJDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Frommer'sBarcelona (Frommer's Complete)","description":"Discover Barcelona's most colorfulneighborhoods one step at a time.

Think of her overall themes: Mennonites and sex, a novel connection. Yet Eve's Striptease uses these two lenses to focus on the world. However, viewing the book only in terms of ethnicity and biology trivializes what is a significant work by a brilliant young poet. . . . It is a book about coming to terms with one's sexuality and how that affects one's place in the world.\\" --Pittsburgh Quarterly \\"Most readers will be grateful for the gift outright of Kasdorf's achingly beautiful language of desire and of a \\"full store\\" of unavoidable passings from discovery to dark discovery and from expectations and surprises of childhood to retrospections and surprises of adulthood.\\" --Mennonite Quarterly Review \\"Crosshatched by body, spirit, and the relation between them; animated by bright instinctive exchanges between carnal and religious zones of experience; driven by an honest, explicitly female consciousness of what 'animal' and 'soul' might mean, the poems in Eve's Striptease keep pace with a considered life in its search for some consoling 'homeliness' in the world.\\" --Eamon Grennan Julia Kasdorf grew up in Western Pennsylvania. Her previous collection, Sleeping Preacher, was the winner of the 1991 Agnes Lynch Starrett Poetry Prize and was awarded the 1993 Great Lakes Colleges Association Award for New Writing.

The frigid waters of winter and early spring sometimes swallow the city, leaving mud, disease, and devastation in their wake. The more than two hundred images featured in Jeffersonville, Indiana tell the city's tale from the earliest days of settlement, through the boom days of the late 19th century, and on to the tragedy of the Great Flood in 1937. Those who observed the bawdy days of Jeffersonville's marriage parlors, gambling halls, and saloons called the city \\"Little Chicago.\\" Those who marveled at the diversity of its religious establishments called it the \\"City of Churches.\\" Citizens of Jeffersonville enjoyed its nightlife on Saturday and filled its pews on Sunday, but have never failed to work hard throughout the week.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=w912qyiVTEQC&dq=Jeffersonville,+Indiana+(IN)+(Images+of+America)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Bioelectronics Handbook: MOSFETs, Biosensors, and Neurons","description":"Here is the first introduction to the fast-growing field of bioelectronics - the comparative study phenomena and mechanisms in biology and electronics.

The subsidiary treatment by the professional theologians, argues Hendrick Kraemer, is an inexcusable lack and an indication of a partly mis-oriented understanding of the Church in its wholeness. Kraemer's A Theology of the Laity, first published in 1958 was one of the first comprehensive attempts at constructing a theology of the whole people of God. It remains a foundational and important work on the subject. Hendrik Kraemer (1888-1965), a layman, was a Dutch Reformed theologian, linguist, and missiologist is recognized as one of the most significant theologians of Christian mission. Kraemer studied Indonesian languages at Leiden University and was awarded a PhD. in 1922. He then served with the Netherlands Bible Society in Indonesia until 1937, when he as appointed professor of the history and phenomenology of religion at Leiden Unversity. From 1948-1955 Kraemer served as the first director of the World Council of Churches' Ecumenical Institute at Chateau de Bossey, Celigny near Geneva. Following his return from Indonesia, Kraemer involved himself heavily in the Dutch church and in mission work, contributing significantly to the revival of the Cutch Reformed church after World War II. One of his last endeavours was to develop a theology of the laity.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=KajUAAAACAAJ&dq=A+Theology+of+the+Laity&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"One-Pot & Clay Pot Cookbook","description":"Healthy, Hearty Paleo Meals Without the Dishes, Mess or Stress Paleo cooking has never been so easy!

By analysing Wolsey s role in key events such as the Field of Cloth of Gold, the study highlights how significant Wolsey was in directing and conducting England s foreign relations as the king s most trusted advisor. Based on up-to-date research, Richardson not only newly appraises the circumstances of Wolsey s fall but also challenges accusations of treason made against him. This study provides a new appreciation of Wolsey s importance as a cultural and artistic patron, as well as a royal administrator and politician; roles which helped to bring both Henry VIII and England to the forefront of foreign relations in the early-sixteenth century. Presenting Wolsey in his contemporary and historiographical contexts more fully than any currently available study, Wolsey is perfect for students of Tudor England.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=3q7uDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Oh, Say, Can You See?: The Semiotics of the Military in Hawai'i (Borderlines)","description":"Everywhere you look in Hawai'i, you might see the military. And yet, in daily life few residents see the military at all -- it is hidden in plain sight. This paradox of invisibility and visibility is the subject of Oh, Say, Can You See?, which maps the power relations involving gender, race, and class that define Hawai'i in relation to the national security state. Authors Kathy E. Ferguson and Phyllis Turnbull locate and \\"excavate\\" cemeteries, memorials, monuments, and museums, to show how the military constructs its gendered narrative upon prior colonial discourses. Among the sites considered are Fort DeRussy, Pearl Harbor, and Punchbowl Cemetery. This semiotic investigation of ways the military marks Hawai'i necessarily explores the intersection of immigration, colonialism, military expansion, and tourism on the islands. Attending to the ways in which the military represents itself and others represent the military, the authors locate the particular representational elements that both conceal and reveal the military's presence and power.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=PlX8iXR33PQC&dq=Oh,+Say,+Can+You+See%3F:+The+Semiotics+of+the+Military+in+Hawai%27i+(Borderlines)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Overload: Art of Juan Gimenez","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Complete Book of Laser Sailing","description":"CHAPTER 1.

Some years ago never mind how long precisely having little or no money in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on shore, I thought I would sail about a little and see the watery part of the world. It is a way I have of driving off the spleen and regulating the circulation. Whenever I find myself growing grim about the mouth; whenever it is a damp, drizzly November in my soul; whenever I find myself involuntarily pausing before coffin warehouses, and bringing up the rear of every funeral I meet; and especially whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of me, that it requires a strong moral principle to prevent me from deliberately stepping into the street, and methodically knocking people s hats off then, I account it high time to get to sea as soon as I can. This is my substitute for pistol and ball. With a philosophical flourish Cato throws himself upon his sword; I quietly take to the ship. There is nothing surprising in this.

Between the time that the first European settlers established a colony at Jamestown in 1607 through the signing of the Declaration of Independence, the outlines of America's distinctive political culture, economic system, social life, and cultural patterns had begun to emerge. Designed to complement the high school American history curriculum as well as undergraduate survey courses, \\"Colonial America: An Encyclopedia of Social, Political, Cultural, and Economic History\\" captures it all: the people, institutions, ideas, and events of the first three hundred years of American history. While it focuses on the thirteen British colonies stretching along the Atlantic, Colonial America sets this history in its larger contexts. Entries also cover Canada, the American Southwest and Mexico, and the Caribbean and Atlantic world directly impacting the history of the thirteen colonies. This encyclopedia explores the complete early history of what would become the United States, including portraits of Native American life in the immediate pre-contact period, early Spanish exploration, and the first settlements by Spanish, French, Dutch, Swedish, and English colonists. This monumental five-volume set brings America's colonial heritage vibrantly to life for today's readers. It includes: thematic essays on major issues and topics; detailed A-Z entries on hundreds of people, institutions, events, and ideas; thematic and regional chronologies; hundreds of illustrations; primary documents; and a glossary and multiple indexes.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=VDiPDQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"We Would Have Played Forever: The Story of the Coastal Plain Baseball League","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=TgHWAQAACAAJ&dq=We+Would+Have+Played+Forever:+The+Story+of+the+Coastal+Plain+Baseball+League&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"How to build and use a 360-degree feedback system (Info-line)","description":"This issue defines and describes a 360-degree feedback program.

For more than twenty years Van Sant repeatedly surveyed nearly 200 anchorages between Florida and South America. He racked up well over 80,000 sea miles doing it, mostly single-handed. Why? You'll find some interesting answers in his book of stories, Margarita Cat, but es-sentially, he did it because he liked doing it. Sailing up and down the chain of islands so much and so often, he got to looking for shorter and easier ways to navigate between each link in the chain, and he kept refining detailed nav plans for every leg. He has systematically taken the thorns out of the route they used to call the Thorny Path. For example, he exploits the calming effects on wind and sea which result from land cooling on each side of an inter-island passage. Applying his many methods, both sail and power can make safe, comfortable and pleasant progress even against normally impenetrable trade winds and seas. Passages South offers an illustrated manual of instruction for specific passages and harbors down islands as well as a cruising guide for the Greater Antilles islands of Hispaniola and Puerto Rico.

When did America give up on fairness? The author of Fantasyland tells the epic history of how America decided that big business gets whatever it wants, only the rich get richer, and nothing should ever change and charts a way back to the future.  Essential, absorbing . . . a graceful, authoritative guide . . . a radicalized moderate s moderate case for radical change.  The New York Times Book Review During the twentieth century, America managed to make its economic and social systems both more and more fair and more and more prosperous. A huge, secure, and contented middle class emerged. All boats rose together. But then the New Deal gave way to the Raw Deal. Beginning in the early 1970s, by means of a long war conceived of and executed by a confederacy of big business CEOs, the superrich, and right-wing zealots, the rules and norms that made the American middle class possible were undermined and dismantled. The clock was turned back on a century of economic progress, making greed good, workers powerless, and the market all-powerful while weaponizing nostalgia, lifting up an oligarchy that served only its own interests, and leaving the huge majority of Americans with dwindling economic prospects and hope. Why and how did America take such a wrong turn? In this deeply researched and brilliantly woven cultural, economic, and political chronicle, Kurt Andersen offers a fresh, provocative, and eye-opening history of America s undoing, naming names, showing receipts, and unsparingly assigning blame to the radical right in economics and the law, the high priests of high finance, a complacent and complicit Establishment, and liberal  useful idiots,  among whom he includes himself. Only a writer with Andersen s crackling energy, deep insight, and ability to connect disparate dots and see complex systems with clarity could make such a book both intellectually formidable and vastly entertaining. And only a writer of Andersen s vision could reckon with our current high-stakes inflection point, and show the way out of this man-made disaster.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=hFbSDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Northern Spain Handbook (Footprint Northern Spain Handbook)","description":"- Comprehensive coverage of northern Spain- Includes extensive treatment of where to eat, stay, and play, with emphasis on the good life- Focuses on the cultural and historic heritage- Covers the entire pilgrim route to Santiago de Compostela","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=O1DDwAEACAAJ&dq=Northern+Spain+Handbook+(Footprint+Northern+Spain+Handbook)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Neopets THE OFFICIAL MAGAZINE Issue 16, Vol 4 No 2","description":"A comprehensive book about the video game industry.

Nearing his 60th birthday, he led the world's oldest major championship with one hole to play and came within an unlucky bounce of winning his sixth Open championship, losing in a playoff. Known at the highest levels of the game as a shotmaker's shotmaker, a master of any shot under any conditions, and the finest foul-weather golfer of all time, Watson relied on a swing that has lasted as an unmatched model of good mechanics, rhythm and repeatability. Jack Nicklaus and other peers believe Watson is swinging better today than when he was a dominant player on the regular PGA Tour 30-plus years ago. In THE TIMELESS SWING, Watson offers a lifetime's worth of wisdom and insight into the game of golf, showing how to become a better player at any age. In Watson's plain-spoken voice, the book will distil the most important lessons for how to improve your swing and score and will be laced with the anecdotal stories and bits of wisdom that have been accumulated by Watson during his forty year professional career.

The Ashmolean holds the greatest collection of Raphael drawings in the world, and the Albertina is the custodian of a major collection including some of the most beautiful and important of the artist's sketches. Taken together, the two collections provide extraordinary resources that, amplified by carefully-selected international loans, will allow us to transform our understanding of the art of Raphael. The Oxford exhibition is based on new research by Dr Catherine Whistler of the Ashmolean Museum and Dr Ben Thomas from the University of Kent, in collaboration with Dr Achim Gnann of the Albertina. It will take Raphael's art of drawing as its focus, with the concept of eloquence as its underlying structure. Oratory runs as a linking thread in Raphael's drawings, which stand out for the importance given to the study of gestures, facial expressions, and drapery. Moreover, Raphael treated the expressive figure of the orator - poet, philosopher, muse, apostle, saint or sibyl - in fascinating and significant ways throughout his life. This selection of drawings demonstrates how Raphael created a specific mode of visual invention and persuasive communication through drawing. He used drawing both as conceptual art (including brainstorming sheets) and as a practice based on attentive observation (such as drawing from the posed model). Yet Raphael's drawings also reveal how the process of drawing in itself, with its gestural rhythms and spontaneity, can be a form of thought, generating new ideas. The Oxford exhibition will present drawings that span Raphael's entire career, encompassing many of his major projects and exploring his visual language from inventive ideas to full compositions. The extraordinary range of drawings by Raphael in the Ashmolean and the Albertina, enhanced by appropriate loans, will enable this exhibition to cast new light on this familiar artist, transforming our understanding of Raphael's art. This book preludes a major exhibition, which will run from June to September 2017, with a range of events happening throughout this time.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=CJxGvgAACAAJ&dq=Raphael,+drawings&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Zen Buddhism, selected writings (Doubleday anchor books, A90)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=zk8FAAAAYAAJ&dq=Zen+Buddhism,+selected+writings+(Doubleday+anchor+books,+A90)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hawaii (A Bantam Book)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=BLWlzgEACAAJ&dq=Hawaii+(A+Bantam+Book)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Jacob Boehme (Western Esoteric Masters)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Going West","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"e-Commerce Applications Using Oracle8i and Java From Scratch","description":"This book on creating a complete e-commerce project using Oracle8i and Java targets Oracle users who want to develop Java database applications for e-commerce.

Forced to sell thousands of acres of his lands and nearly all of his furniture and artwork, in 1831 his heirs bid a final goodbye to Monticello itself. The house their illustrious patriarch had lovingly designed in the Blue Ridge Mountains of Virginia, his beloved \\"essay in architecture,\\" was sold to the highest bidder. Saving Monticello offers the first complete post-Jefferson history of this American icon and reveals the amazing story of how one Jewish family saved the house that became a family home to them for 89 years -- longer than it ever was to the Jeffersons. With a dramatic narrative sweep across generations, Marc Leepson vividly recounts the turbulent saga of this fabled estate. Twice the house came to the brink of ruin, and twice it was saved, by two different generations of the Levy family. United by a fierce love of country, they venerated the Founding Fathers for establishing a religiously tolerant and democratic nation where their family had thrived since the founding of the Georgia colony in 1733, largely free of the persecutions and prejudices of the Old World. Monticello's first savior was the mercurial U.S. Navy Commodore Uriah Phillips Levy, a colorful and controversial sailor, celebrated for his successful campaign to ban flogging in the Navy and excoriated for his stubborn willfulness. Prompted in 1833 by the Marquis de Lafayette's inquiry about \\"the most beautiful house in America,\\" Levy discovered that Jefferson's mansion had fallen into a miserable state of decay. Acquiring the ruined estate and committing his considerable resources to its renewal, he began what became a tumultuous nine-decade relationship between his family and Jefferson's home. After passing from Levy control at the time of the commodore's death, Monticello fell once more into hard times, cattle being housed on its first floor and grain in its once elegant upper rooms. Again, remarkably, a member of the Levy family came to the rescue. Uriah's nephew, the aptly named Jefferson Monroe Levy, a three-term New York congressman and wealthy real estate and stock speculator, gained possession in 1879. After Jefferson Levy poured hundreds of thousands of dollars into its repair and upkeep, his chief reward was to face a vicious national campaign, with anti-Semitic overtones, to expropriate the house and turn it over to the government. Only after the campaign had failed, with Levy declaring that he would sell Monticello only when the White House itself was offered for sale, did Levy relinquish it to the Thomas Jefferson Foundation in 1923. Rich with memorable, larger-than-life characters, beginning with Thomas Jefferson himself, the story is cast with such figures as James Turner Barclay, a messianic visionary who owned the house from 1831 to 1834; the fiery Uriah Levy, he of the six courts-martial and teenage wife; the colorful Confederate Colonel Benjamin Franklin Ficklin, who controlled Monticello during the Civil War; and the eccentric, high-living, deal-making egoist Jefferson Monroe Levy. Pulling back the veil of history to reveal a story we thought we knew, Saving Monticello establishes this most American of houses as more truly reflective of the American experience than has ever been fully appreciated.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=GGK1XO0jVEoC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"My seventy-five years along the Mexican border","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=0IsKGQAACAAJ&dq=My+seventy-five+years+along+the+Mexican+border&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"What Would Sipowicz Do?

It is a global unevenness within which the barriers to in-migration of Third World migrants to wealthy first world nations go ever higher, whilst the barriers to travel in the reverse direction are all but extinct. So how exactly can tourism contribute to narrowing this glaring inequality and gap between the rich and the poor? Are ever expanding tourism markets  and the new, responsible, forms of tourism in particular  a smoke free, socio-culturally sensitive form of human industrialisation? Is alternative tourism really a credible lever for lifting poverty stricken countries out of the mire of global inequality, setting them on the right track to  development , and making poverty history? Tourism and Sustainability critically explores and challenges what have emerged as the most significant universal geopolitical norms of the last half century  development, globalization and sustainability  and through the lens of new forms of tourism demonstrates how we can better understand and get to grips with the rapidly changing new global order. This third edition has been extensively updated and includes new material on: poverty reduction, livelihoods and pro-poor tourism new forms of tourism in cities continuing growth of the fair trade movement tourism s contribution to climate change volunteer and  gap  tourism affect of disasters on new tourism. Drawing on a range of examples from across the Third World, Tourism and Sustainability illustrates the social, economic and environmental conditions for the growth of new tourism. The book is original in its assessment of tourism through the lens of power  who holds it; how it is used; and who benefits from the exercise of power in the tourism industry. Additionally, the analysis is an interdisciplinary one and the book will therefore be useful to students of Human Geography, Environmental Sciences and Studies, Politics, Development Studies, Anthropology and Business Studies as well as Tourism itself.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=hbB8AgAAQBAJ&dq=Tourism+and+Sustainability:+New+Tourism+in+the+Third+World&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sola Come Un Gambo Di Sedano","description":"Una donna tragicamente e comicamente contemporanea raduna i suoi sfoghi.

It gathers momentum as the reader is exposed to the ego, soul, and the Divine by understanding their role in the evolution of human consciousness. What is blocking us from embracing our greatness? As the human mind and brain developed over the millennia, humanity's true nature was obscured by a human intellect and belief system in its early stages of evolution. We have all witnessed what this has led to. There is a way out of this box we have built for ourselves. The breakout begins when we allow ourselves to take a fresh look at the core human condition that spiritual traditions have been dealing with for thousands of years. This book shows the reader how to look at their soul in a refreshing and new way. In this new century, the time is ripe for an exciting and innovative way of approaching spirituality and rediscovering our souls. Ego, Soul, & Beyond is a life-changing and provocative book that offers a clear, comprehensive, and practical way to usher in the next stage of human evolution. It doesn't replace psychology or spirituality - it takes them to a new level. The reader is challenged to wake up their soul and embrace reality below the symptom level. The intellect, heart, and belly soul-centers, which the world's spiritual traditions target in different ways, are explained and reconceived in a way that speaks to the fullness of what it means to be human. Fundamental change has never been more possible. The human mind has evolved to a place where many are perched for a dive into a new reality where contemporary and historical problems can finally be resolved.

It's so simple and obvious, each side maintains, only a fanatic could disagree. Deciding where the truth lies between these two extremes is the main purpose of John Haugeland's marvelously lucid and witty book on what artificial intelligence is all about. Although presented entirely in non-technical terms, it neither oversimplifies the science nor evades the fundamental philosophical issues. Far from ducking the really hard questions, it takes them on, one by one. Artificial intelligence, Haugeland notes, is based on a very good idea, which might well be right, and just as well might not. That idea, the idea that human thinking and machine computing are \\"radically the same,\\" provides the central theme for his illuminating and provocative book about this exciting new field. After a brief but revealing digression in intellectual history, Haugeland systematically tackles such basic questions as: What is a computer really? How can a physical object \\"mean\\" anything? What are the options for computational organization? and What structures have been proposed and tried as actual scientific models for intelligence? In a concluding chapter he takes up several outstanding problems and puzzles including intelligence in action, imagery, feelings and personality and their enigmatic prospects for solution.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=zLFSPdIuqKsC&dq=Artificial+Intelligence:+The+very+Idea&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Thirty four families of old Somerset County, Maryland,","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=OUtnAAAAMAAJ&dq=Thirty+four+families+of+old+Somerset+County,+Maryland,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Earthbag Building: The Tools, Tricks and Techniques (Natural Building Series)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Every Teaching Of Jesus In The Bible Everything In The Bible Series","description":"Designed to help you discover important basic Bible truths for yourself, this series takes you carefully through each book of the New Testament and six other subjects crucial to the understanding of all growing Christians.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=tIhxXwlz5DkC&dq=Every+Teaching+Of+Jesus+In+The+Bible+Everything+In+The+Bible+Series&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Perfect Balance: Ayurvedic Nutrition for Mind, Body, and Soul","description":"Describes the Indian holistic system of Ayurvedic nutrition and healing, which incorporates diet, meditation, breathing, and visualization to gain physical and mental well-being.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=v4Hat6niCzoC&dq=Perfect+Balance:+Ayurvedic+Nutrition+for+Mind,+Body,+and+Soul&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Philosophy and Myth in Karl Marx","description":"In Karl Marx's early writing (first made available many years after his death) his economic interpretation of history and his concept of communism were set in a comprehensive philosophical framework. Marx's main preoccupation at this time was with man estranged from himself in an alienated world: a subjective, almost religious theme. Taking full account of these earlier writings, Robert Tucker critiques and reinterprets Marx's thought. He shows how its origins can be located in earlier German philosophers, in particular Kant, Hegel, and Feuerbach. Reconstructing the genesis of Marxism in its founder's own mind, he clarifies Marx's mystifying contention that Marxism represented Hegelianism turned 'on its head'. He then presents a new interpretation, based on close textual analysis, of the relation between Marx's early philosophical system and the subsequent materialist conception of history as expounded in the later and best known writings of Marx and Engels. Against this background, Tucker presents Das Kapital as a work belonging to the post-Hegelian mythical development of Germany philosophy. Considering in turn the genesis of Marxism and the underlying continuity of his thought from the early writings to Das Kapital, Tucker shows the theme of alienation is central throughout. In the years since the book was first written, comments and criticism have encouraged Tucker to change his position somewhat. This is explained in a new introduction that goes beyond the interpretative enterprise of the rest of the book to assess Marx in relation to contemporary concerns: first it presents a critique of Marx's treatment of alienation and then it comments on the moot problem of the continuing relevance of his social and economic thought. On the latter point his views have matured and altered during the intervening years and he now finds the economic and social aspects of Marx's thought considerably more relevant than he did before.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=UUCJswEACAAJ&dq=Philosophy+and+Myth+in+Karl+Marx&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Idiot (Signet classic)","description":"\\"The still, radiant center of an ambitious and remarkable novel, Prince Myshkin - the idiot - stands above and apart from characters who vividly and violently embody the passions and conflicts of nineteenth-century Russia.

This book presents a study of human intelligence beginning with a semantic theory and leading into a critique of music. By implication it sets up a theory of all the arts; the transference of its basic concepts to other arts than music is not developed, but it is sketched, mainly in the chapter on artistic import. Thoughtful readers of the original edition discovered these far-reaching ideas quickly enough as the career of the book shows: it is as applicable to literature, art and music as to the field of philosophy itself. The topics it deals with are many: language, sacrament, myth, music, abstraction, fact, knowledge--to name only the main ones. But through them all goes the principal theme, symbolic transformation as the essential activity of human minds. This central idea, emphasizing as it does the notion of symbolism, brings Mrs. Langer's book into line with the prevailing interest in semantics. All profound issues of our age seem to center around the basic concepts of symbolism and meaning. The formative, creative, articulating power of symbols is the tonic chord which thinkers of all schools and many diverse fields are unmistakably striking; the surprising, far-reaching implications of this new fundamental conception constitute what Mrs. Langer has called philosophy in a new key. Mrs. Langer's book brings the discussion of symbolism into a wider general use than criticism of word meaning. Her volume is vigorous, effective, and well written and will appeal to everyone interested in the contemporary problems of philosophy.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=TL4xbZojMh0C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Place to Bloom","description":"Colorful pictures and rhyming text explain that not everyone or everything sees the world around them in the same way.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=xf8IAQAAMAAJ&dq=A+Place+to+Bloom&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Rutgers Students' Unofficial Guide to College","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=NPefAAAACAAJ&dq=The+Rutgers+Students%27+Unofficial+Guide+to+College&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Oxford Book of Christian Verse, the","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Late for Work","description":"A debut compilation of poems by the winner of the 2005 Bakeless Prize for poetry journeys into the world of journalism as it follows the lives and careers of reporters competing for headlines.

The book does not offer solutions to environmental questions, but it does offer the hope that there can be new ways of thinking and flexibility in human/environmental relations.

Her cult was particularly prominent in central Anatolia (modern Turkey), and spread from there through the Greek and Roman world. She was an enormously popular figure, attracting devotion from common people and potentates alike. This book is the first comprehensive assembly and discussion of the entire extant evidence concerning the worship of the Phrygian Mother Goddess, from her earliest appearance in the prehistoric record to the early centuries of the Roman Empire. Lynn E. Roller presents and analyzes literary, historiographic, and archaeological data with equal acuity and flair. While previous studies have tended to emphasize the more outrageous aspects of the Mother Goddess's cult, such as her orgiastic rituals and the eunuch priests who attended her, this book places a special focus on Cybele's position in Anatolia and the ways in which the identity of the goddess changed as her cult was transmitted to Greece and Rome. Roller gives a detailed account of the growth, spread, and evolution of her cult, her ceremonies, and her meaning for her adherents. This book will introduce students of Classical antiquity to many aspects of the Great Mother which have been previously unexamined, and will interest anyone who has ever been piqued by curiosity about the Mother Goddess of the ancient Western world.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=e9r2semlxPwC&dq=In+Search+of+God+the+Mother:+The+Cult+of+Anatolian+Cybele&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Baby Stuff","description":"Aranzify your Baby Aranzi Aronzo s Newest Craft Book The long-awaited edition to your Aranzi collection is here, Baby Stuff!!

Organized around eight simple yet critical principles of the new workplace, Work Naked challenges long-held beliefs about the appropriate time, place, look, and feel of productivity in the knowledge era, showing how a wealth of hidden potential can be released by giving employees the freedom to work how, when, and where they want. Cindy Froggatt suggests workplace options that can help balance work and personal life, and helps managers address the needs of the many knowledge workers who require a greater degree of autonomy to perform, create, and innovate. She presents numerous examples of companies of different sizes and types that have instituted telework or alternative programs--and clearly explains the benefits and pitfalls of implementing them. Cindy Froggatt (New York, NY) is Principal of Froggatt Consulting, whose clients include Compaq, Mercedes-Benz, Capital One, and Nova Corporation.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=gJpwQgAACAAJ&dq=Work+Naked:+Eight+Essential+Principles+for+Peak+Performance+in+the+Virtual+Workplace&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"THE PETAYBEE SEQUENCE: Book (1) One: Powers that Be; Book (2) Two: Power Lines; Book (3) Three: Power Play","description":"The spellbinding sequel to  Powers That Be,  by Hugo and Nebula Award-winning authors Anne McCaffrey and Elizabeth Ann Scarborough.

He draws on the fields of conversation analysis, ethnomethodology, linguistic anthropology and social theory to show how language practices shape--and are shaped by--culture and the law, particularly in the social construction of rape as a legal fact. This analysis examines linguistic strategies from both defense and prosecutorial viewpoints, and how they relate to issues of gender, sexual identity, and power.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=lWlRMHhAZkUC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The 21 Irrefutable Truths of Trading: A Traders Guide to Developing a Mind to Win","description":"A Certified Trading Advisor (CTA) gives traders strategies for mastering the most important trading tool--their minds.

Jon Lee Anderson s biography traces Che s extraordinary life, from his comfortable Argentine upbringing to the battlefields of the Cuban revolution, from the halls of power in Castro s government to his failed campaign in the Congo and assassination in the Bolivian jungle. Anderson has had unprecedented access to the personal archives maintained by Guevara s widow and carefully guarded Cuban government documents. He has conducted extensive interviews with Che s comrades some of whom speak here for the first time and with the CIA men and Bolivian officers who hunted him down. Anderson broke the story of where Guevara s body was buried, which led to the exhumation and state burial of the bones. Many of the details of Che s life have long been cloaked in secrecy and intrigue. Meticulously researched and full of exclusive information, Che Guevara illuminates as never before this mythic figure who embodied the high-water mark of revolutionary communism as a force in history.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=aCw19CUXpqkC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Treasure Man (Harlequin American Romance)","description":"The Treasure Man by Pamela Browning released on Apr 11, 2006 is available now for purchase.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=H0ItJ2GNJHYC&dq=The+Treasure+Man+(Harlequin+American+Romance)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"50 Companies That Changed the World","description":"Incisive Profiles of the 50 Organizations, Large and Small, That have Shaped the Course of Modern Business 50 Companies That Changed the World shows how some of the greatest businesses of all time achieved their success - found untapped niches, stayed on top of trends, managed progressively, and encouraged creativity.

What was she that so many myths surround her? Born in Carthage, Missouri, in 1848, the daughter of a well-to-do hotel owner, she died forty-one years later, gunned down near her cabin in the Cherokee Nation in Oklahoma. After her death she was called  a bandit queen,   a female Jesse James,   the Petticoat Terror of the Plains.  Fantastic legends proliferated about her. In this book Glenn Shirley sifts through those myths and unearths the facts. In a highly readable and informative style Shirley presents a complex and intriguing portrait. Belle Starr loved horses, music, the outdoors-and outlaws. Familiar with some of the worst bad men of her day, she was, however, convicted of no crime worse than horse thievery. Shirley also describes the historical context in which Belles Starr lived. After knowing the violence of the Civil War as a child in the Ozarks, She moves to Dallas in the 1860s and married a former Confederate guerilla who specialized in armed robbery. After he was killed, she found a home among renegade Cherokees in the Indian Territory, on her second husband s allotment. She traveled as far west as Los Angeles to escape the law and as far north as Detroit to go to jail. She married three times and had two children, whom she idolized and tormented. Ironically she was shot when she had decided to go straight, probably murdered by a neighbor who feared that she would turn him in to the police. This book will find a wide readership among western-history and outlaw buffs, folklorists, sociologists, and regional historians. Shirley s summary of the literature about Belle Starr is as interesting as the true story of Belle herself, who has become the West s best-known woman outlaw.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Fpr_BwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Storey's Guide to Raising Chickens: Care / Feeding / Facilities","description":"A guide to raising one chicken or one hundred.

While still in his early teens he earned his way playing piano in the honky-tonks of villages and towns in the Mississippi Valley.

Imagine my surprise when I discovered well into my sixth decade that losing fish can prepare us for a blessing as well as for pain.\\" Confronting loss -- of an elusive fish or something larger -- is at the heart of The One That Got Away, the graceful sequel to Raines's much-loved, bestselling memoir Fly Fishing Through the Midlife Crisis, published to great acclaim in 1993. With the same winning combination of reminiscences, anecdotes, philosophy and fishing lore, his bold new memoir covers the eventful years in this latest passage of his life, and the realization that in relinquishing his former identity as a newspaperman he has actually gotten what he wanted, just in the most unlikely way. In wry and witty prose, Raines shifts between fishing vignettes and personal reflections on his childhood, his second marriage, his relationships with his two sons, the trajectory of his career at The New York Times and his move toward old age. At the center of his narrative is his most thrilling fishing adventure -- an epic battle with a marlin he hooked and fought for more than seven hours in the South Pacific -- which comes to symbolize his growing understanding and acceptance of the unpredictability of luck, love, lies and life, and how the unexpected can, in fact, be an opportunity to make life more interesting. Raines's wonderful descriptions of streams, people and fish; his passion for angling and writing; and his wise and perceptive commentary on the vagaries of his own life combine to create a profound book -- one of undeniable appeal and uncommon heart.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=YRSUxb0Us9QC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Giving to Yourself (Inner Vision (Sounds True))","description":"These divas represent the voices of past and future generations, such as Tyra Banks, Terry McMillan, Harriette Cole, Maya Angelou, Iyanla Vanzant, Nikki Giovanni, Dawn Davis, Adrienne Ingrum, Carol Mackey, Oprah Winfrey, Rosa Parks, Shirley Chisholm, Coretta Scott King, Zora Neal Hurston, and Octavia Butler.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=jdCAQJwYeXMC&dq=Giving+to+Yourself+(Inner+Vision+(Sounds+True))&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Quiet Moments with God/Teens (Quiet Moments with God Devotional)","description":"This devotional is tailored towards the unique experiences faced by teens in life.

How do we get it back? Have you ever followed your GPS device to a deserted parking lot? Or unquestioningly followed the advice of an expert perhaps a doctor or financial adviser only to learn later that your own thoughts and doubts were correct? And what about the stories we've all heard over the years about sick patients whether infected with Ebola or COVID-19 who were sent home or allowed to travel because busy staff people were following a protocol to the letter rather than using common sense? Why and how do these kinds of things happen? As Harvard lecturer and global trend watcher Vikram Mansharamani shows in this eye-opening and perspective-shifting book, our complex, data-flooded world has made us ever more reliant on experts, protocols, and technology. Too often, we've stopped thinking for ourselves. With stark and compelling examples drawn from business, sports, and everyday life, Mansharamani illustrates how in a very real sense we have outsourced our thinking to a troubling degree, relinquishing our autonomy. Of course, experts, protocols, and computer-based systems are essential to helping us make informed decisions. What we need is a new approach for integrating these information sources more effectively, harnessing the value they provide without undermining our ability to think for ourselves. The author provides principles and techniques for doing just that, empowering readers with a more critical and nuanced approach to making decisions. Think for Yourself is an indispensable guide for those looking to restore self-reliant thinking in a data-driven and technology-dependent yet overwhelmingly uncertain world.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Ca28DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Time Exposure: The Autobiography","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=EOVTAAAAMAAJ&dq=Time+Exposure:+The+Autobiography&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Theory & Practice of GO","description":"Now you can clearly present even the most complex computational theory topics to your students with Sipser's distinct, market-leading INTRODUCTION TO THE THEORY OF COMPUTATION, 3E.

In this book, Janneke Adema proposes that we reimagine the scholarly book as a living and collaborative project--not as linear, bound, and fixed, but as fluid, remixed, and liquid, a space for experimentation. She presents a series of cutting-edge experiments in arts and humanities book publishing, showcasing the radical new forms that book-based scholarly work might take in the digital age. Adema's proposed alternative futures for the scholarly book go beyond such print-based assumptions as fixity, stability, the single author, originality, and copyright, reaching instead for a dynamic and emergent materiality. Adema suggests ways to unbind the book, describing experiments in scholarly book publishing with new forms of anonymous collaborative authorship, radical open access publishing, and processual, living, and remixed publications, among other practices. She doesn't cast digital as the solution and print as the problem; the problem in scholarly publishing, she argues, is not print itself, but the way print has been commodified and essentialized. Adema explores alternative, more ethical models of authorship; constructs an alternative genealogy of openness; and examines opportunities for intervention in current cultures of knowledge production. Finally, asking why it is that we cut and bind our research together at all, she examines two book publishing projects that experiment with remix and reuse and try to rethink and reperform the book-apparatus by taking responsibility for the cuts they make.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=g_gLEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The master of game,","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=dwM2AAAAMAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Stupid Web Tricks","description":"Presenting some of the flashiest--and most useful--ways to make a Web site more compelling, this title shows how to add interactivity and permit better use of data.

If you've been asked to be a maid of honor (or matron of honor), first of all, congrats! This is a big honor and can be fun and exciting. Just in case you aren't clear on the definition, the maid of honor is defined as the bride's right-hand woman throughout her engagement and wedding day, leading the rest of the bridesmaids in their own duties. The bride will typically tap her BFF, sibling, or another close friend to serve in this important role, because of the wide range of hats, a maid of honor will have to wear: confidant, assistant, the voice of reason, shoulder to cry on, if needed, as well as bridesmaid leader (and sometimes wrangler). As such, there are a slew of maid of honor duties and responsibilities that fall under the MOH's purview. So what does a maid of honor do, exactly?

It was published on 8 June 1949 by Secker & Warburg as Orwell's ninth and final book completed in his lifetime. Thematically, \\"Nineteen Eighty-Four\\" centres on the consequences of totalitarianism, mass surveillance, and repressive regimentation of persons and behaviours within society. Orwell, himself a democratic socialist, modelled the authoritarian government in the novel after Stalinist Russia. More broadly, the novel examines the role of truth and facts within politics and the ways in which they are manipulated. The story takes place in an imagined future, the year 1984, when much of the world has fallen victim to perpetual war, omnipresent government surveillance, historical negationism, and propaganda. Great Britain, known as Airstrip One, has become a province of a totalitarian superstate named Oceania that is ruled by the Party who employ the Thought Police to persecute individuality and independent thinking. Big Brother, the leader of the Party, enjoys an intense cult of personality despite the fact that he may not even exist. The protagonist, Winston Smith, is a diligent and skillful rank-and-file worker and Outer Party member who secretly hates the Party and dreams of rebellion. He enters into a forbidden relationship with a colleague, Julia, and starts to remember what life was like before the Party came to power.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=PEpoEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"But the morning will come, novel.","description":"The reactions of a southern white girl who discovers her unborn child will inherit Negro blood.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=FFBbAAAAMAAJ&dq=But+the+morning+will+come,+novel.&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"An Introductory Course in Commutative Algebra (Oxford Science Publications)","description":"This book is a concise account of topics in commutative algebra.

What do children mean to their parents, and how far do parental obligations go? What, from the beginning of life to its end, is the worth of a child? Ethicist Murray leaves the rarefied air of abstract moral philosophy in order to reflect on the moral perplexities of ordinary life and ordinary people. Observing that abstract moral terms such as altruism and selfishness can be buried in the everyday doings of families, he maintains that ethical theory needs a richer description than it now has of the moral life of parents and children. How far should adults go in their quest for children? What options are available to women who do not want to bear a child now? Should couples be allowed to reject a child because of genetic disability or \\"wrong\\" gender? How can we weigh the competing claims of the genetic and the rearing parents to a particular child? The Worth of a Child couples impressive learning with a conversational style. Only by getting down to cases, Murray insists, can we reach moral conclusions that are unsentimental, farsighted, and just. In an era of intense public and private acrimony about the place and meaning of \\"family values,\\" his practical wisdom about extraordinary difficult moral issues offers compelling reading for both experienced and prospective parents, as well as for ethicists, social and behavioral scientists, and legal theorists.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=tRTMbjvUrS0C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Thistle Princess","description":"A king and queen are so happy with the child created for them by the flowers in their royal garden, that they become overly protective of her and shut out all the other children in their kingdom.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ZDcIAAAACAAJ&dq=The+Thistle+Princess&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Christianity and the Images of Science","description":"The relationship of Christianity to science can best be handled by isolating images of science that influence Christianity.

There Roy Moxham buys the memoir of a nineteenth-century British colonial administrative officer, who makes a passing reference to a giant hedge planted by the British across the Indian subcontinent. That hedge--which for fifty years had been manned and cared for by 12,000 men and had run a length of 2,500 miles--becomes what Moxham calls his \\"ridiculous obsession.\\" Recounting a journey that takes him to exotic isolated villages deep in the interior of India, Moxham chronicles his efforts to confirm the existence of the extraordinary, impenetrable green wall that had virtually disappeared from two nations' memories. Not only does he discover the shameful role the hedge played in the exploitative Raj and the famines of the late nineteenth century, but he also uncovers what remains of this British grand folly and restores to history what must be counted one of the world's wonders--and a monument to one of the great injustices of Victorian imperialism. \\"Grandly entertaining ... close to being a perfect story of a fanciful quest.\\"--Boston Globe","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=4mCgAAAAMAAJ&dq=Great+Hedge+of+India&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"How to Draw Crash Bandicoot & Friends (How to Draw)","description":"Provides step-by-step instructions for using basic shapes to draw Crash and other cartoon characters from the \\"Crash Bandicoot\\" video game.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=AIT3AQAACAAJ&dq=How+to+Draw+Crash+Bandicoot&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Stones of Aran: Labyrinth","description":"Tim Robinson s Stones of Aran is one of the most striking and original literary undertakings of our time. Robinson s ambition is to find out both what it is to know a landscape, know it as extensively and intimately as possible, and what it takes to make that knowledge, the sense of the landscape itself, come alive in writing. It is a project that draws on the legacies of Thoreau and Joyce, to which Robinson brings his own polymathic gifts as cartographer, mathematician, historian, and, above all, shaper of words. In Pilgrimage Robinson walked the entire coast of Airann, largest of the Aran islands. In Labyrinth he turns in to the island s interior. These two books parts of an inseparable whole that can, for all that, be read quite separately from each other constitute a vast polyphonic composition, at once encyclopedic and lyrical, scientific and surprisingly personal. Exploring the illimitable complexity and bounty contained in the seemingly limited confines of a single island, Robinson invites us to look without and within and to see the wonder of the world.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=omzXKUGYMaQC&dq=Stones+of+Aran:+Labyrinth&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Flag Of Childhood: Poems From The Middle East (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","description":"Larry McMurtry declares, \\"Texas itself doesn't have anything to do with why I write. It never did.\\" Horton Foote, on the other hand, says, \\"I've just never had a desire to write about any place else.\\" In between those figurative bookends are hundreds of other writers some internationally recognized, others just becoming known who draw inspiration and often subject matter from the unique places and people that are Texas. To give everyone who is interested in Texas writing a representative sampling of the breadth and vitality of the state's current literary production, this volume features conversations with fifty of Texas's most notable established writers and emerging talents. The writers included here work in a wide variety of genres novels, short stories, poetry, plays, screenplays, essays, nonfiction, and magazine journalism. In their conversations with interviewers from the Writers' League of Texas and other authors' organizations, the writers speak of their apprenticeships, literary influences, working habits, connections with their readers, and the domestic and public events that have shaped their writing. Accompanying the interviews are excerpts from the writers' work, as well as their photographs, biographies, and bibliographies. Joe Holley's introductory essay an overview of Texas writing from Cabeza de Vaca's 1542 Relaci n to the work of today's generation of writers, who are equally at home in Hollywood as in Texas provides the necessary context to appreciate such a diverse collection of literary voices. A sampling from the book: \\"This land has been my subject matter. One thing that distinguishes me from the true naturalist is that I've never been able to look at land without thinking of the people who've been on it. It's fundamental to me.\\"  John Graves \\"Writing is a way to keep ourselves more in touch with everything we experience. It seems the best gifts and thoughts are given to us when we pause, take a deep breath, look around, see what's there, and return to where we were, revived.\\"  Naomi Shihab Nye \\"I've said this many times in print: the novel is the middle-age genre. Very few people have written really good novels when they are young, and few people have written really good novels when they are old. You just tail off, and lose a certain level of concentration. Your imaginative energy begins to lag. I feel like I'm repeating myself, and most writers do repeat themselves.\\"  Larry McMurtry \\"I was a pretty poor cowhand. I grew up on the Macaraw Ranch, east of Crane, Texas. My father tried very hard to make a cowboy out of me, but in my case it never seemed to work too well. I had more of a literary bent. I loved to read, and very early on I began to write small stories, short stories, out of the things I liked to read.\\"  Elmer Kelton","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=SRDUAAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Practice Makes Perfect: Intermediate English Grammar for ESL Learners (Practice Makes Perfect Series)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=m2skvgAACAAJ&dq=Practice+Makes+Perfect:+Intermediate+English+Grammar+for+ESL+Learners+(Practice+Makes+Perfect+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"More Ideas About Parenting with Less Stress","description":"This book is filled with excellent short stories that provide you with easy to use techniques that can be put to use immediately.

Retracing the Vanishing Footprints of Our Appalachian Ancestors  represents a genealogical history of thirteen major pioneer families who settled in eastern Kentucky during the 18th and 19th Centuries. The surnames include Adams, Berry, Brooks, Brown, Burton, Castle, Chaffin, Daniel, Large, Thompson, Ward, Wellman, and Young. To fully appreciate their social and economic hardships and challenges requires the reader to visualize what life was like on the early frontier. After the American Revolution and the Civil War, many of these early pioneers traveled from North Carolina and Virginia into the sheltering hills of eastern Kentucky via Cumberland Gap and Pound Gap. Others came from Pennsylvania. They settled in early Floyd and Lawrence Counties, which were later divided into present day Boyd, Elliott, Floyd, Johnson, Lawrence, and Martin Counties. They were mostly of English, Irish, Scotch-Irish or Anglo-Saxon extraction and made their living by farming the hilly terrain or working in the coalmines. Some supplemented their income by trapping and hunting. They may have been poor by economic standards, but they remained a proud and independent people with strong character traits.

An idea charged with paradox, eros has always defied categorization, and yet it cannot it will not be ignored. Erotikon aims to raise the difficult question of what, if anything, unifies the erotic manifold. How is eros in a sculpture like eros in a poem?

While we know that these never existed, we do have evidence that Mars once had rivers, shallow lakes, glaciers, huge active volcanoes, and intense flooding. In this book Peter Cattermole, a geologist who has been studying the planet for many years, captures the sense of continuing excitement about Mars and its history. He builds his story on the foundations of his earlier book, Mars: The Story of the Red Planet (Chapman Hall, 1992) At that time, although a large data archive and an overall picture of Mars' geological development existed, relatively little was known of the planet's volatile history, of short-term changes in climate and weather, and of the possible existence of large bodies of surfaced water. The discovery of what might be organic remains in an Antartic meteorite from Mars was completely unanticipated as well. Since then, new studies from the Mariner 9 and the Viking probes have appeared, new Earth-based spectroscopic measurements and oservations from the Hubble space telescope have been made, the meteorite has been analyzed (inconclusively) and, of course, Mars Pathfinder and Mars Global Surveyor have arrived. An immense amount of visual, geochemical, and physical data concerning the rocks, landscape, and weather is now available. The new book draws on this wealth of new information, providing a clear account of current scientific understanding of the Red Planet.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=qc45PwAACAAJ&dq=Mars:+The+Mystery+Unfolds&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"the greeks in america","description":"This historic book may have numerous typos and missing text.

Greeks, like other immigrants, adapt themselves to circumstances. Those who arrive at any port in the United States searching for work are glad to find a place to put their head. The whole family of four, five or more get along for a time in one room, hut as soon as they get work and improve their circumstances, they seek hetter quarters with improved conditions of living. EECBEATION Coffee-houses.--Greeks have brought to America their customs and modes of recreation from the old country. Coffee-houses provide the principal recreation for men. People flock to these places day and night, sitting around tables, sipping black coffee, smoking cigars, or more commonly cigarettes, or the narghile, and discussing everything, --business, news of national interest, and of course the politics of Greece and the attitude of Americans towards them. At times they discuss American politics. There are often animated discussions that might be taken for quarrels by those who do not understand Greek, but it is all verbal, no blows exchanged excepting the blows the tables or chairs receive. Greeks, like the Latin people, accompany their words with multiple gestures of hands and head, maybe even the foot, or the whole body. Games.--Certain games are played in almost all the coffee-houses, --cards, backgammon, chess, and dominoes. Cards are the most common game. They are often played for pastime and recreation. Gambling.--But unfortunately gambling is frequently connected with them. Almost every answer to my questionnaire mentioned gambling as the chief evil among the Greeks in America.

To fully appreciate their social and economic hardships and challenges requires the reader to visualize what life was like on the early frontier. After the American Revolution and the Civil War, many of these early pioneers traveled from North Carolina and Virginia into the sheltering hills of eastern Kentucky via Cumberland Gap and Pound Gap. Others came from Pennsylvania. They settled in early Floyd and Lawrence Counties, which were later divided into present day Boyd, Elliott, Floyd, Johnson, Lawrence, and Martin Counties. They were mostly of English, Irish, Scotch-Irish or Anglo-Saxon extraction and made their living by farming the hilly terrain or working in the coalmines. Some supplemented their income by trapping and hunting. They may have been poor by economic standards, but they remained a proud and independent people with strong character traits.

Now, after the bestselling Covert-One novels The Hades Factor and The Cassandra Compact comes the third thrilling novel in the series - The Paris Option. A fiery explosion in the dark of night shatters one of the laboratory buildings in Paris's esteemed Pasteur Institute. Among the dead is Emile Chambord, one of the leaders in the global race to create a molecular - or DNA - computer. Unfortunately, Professor Chambord kept the details of his work secret, and his notes were apparently destroyed in either the bomb blast or the raging fire that followed. The scientific community does not expect a workable DNA computer to be developed for years. But suddenly U.S. fighter jets disappear from radar screens for a full five minutes, and there's no explanation. Utilities across the Western states cease functioning, and all telecommunications abruptly stop, with devastating consequences. This is not the work of a clever hacker, although Washington, worried about a panic, assures the public it is. Only the enormous power and speed of a DNA computer could have caused such havoc. Under the cover of visiting his friend Marty Zellerbach, who was severely injured when the Pasteur lab was destroyed, Covert-One agent Jon Smith flies to Paris to search for the connection between the Pasteur explosion and the forces now wielding the computer.

Using the concept of the twelve layers that cover an awakened state Mary Mueller Shutan addresses every step of the spiritual journey, starting with the Self and showing how family, ancestral, past lives, karmic, archetypal, and other larger layers such as societal, cultural, global, and cosmic energies condition us to sleep and obscure our realization of an awakened state. Instructions for how to navigate through each of these layers and how to recognize where we are in our spiritual journey are included each step of the way along with common physical, emotional, and spiritual symptoms that may be experienced. By addressing post-awakening states, oneness, dark nights of the soul, ego death, near-death and severe illness, psychic abilities, addictions, dietary changes, the God self, personal and collective shadow, and psychosis vs. awakening we understand the experiences we may go through while struggling with spiritual awakenings. This practical book opens new understandings of how to live in the world while going through an awakening process, and offers the revolutionary idea that we are meant to be humans, to have a physical body with physical, sensate experiences and emotions. We are meant to live in the world and be a part of it even as fully awakened individuals. This guide proposes a look at the possibility of leading a grounded, earth-bound life of work, family, friends, and other experiences in an awakened state.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=vwK3rQEACAAJ&dq=Spiritual+awakening&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Bringing It All Back Home","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Beyond the Marathon : The Grand Slam of Trail Ultrarunning","description":"In 1994, Robert Boeder completed the Grand Slam of trail ultrarunning finishing four 100 mile trail races in one summer (14 weeks).

It's the book Great-Great-Grandmother grabbed off the shelf whenever the horse was constipated, when she was entertaining a person of high degree, or when she required directions for canning okra. The advice and voice are quaint now, and sometimes uproariously funny. But it tells me story of daily life in a time when the country was binding its wounds from the Civil War -- a time before electricity, telephones, cars, and shopping malls. Keeping Hearth and Home is more than a great cover to cover read. It's a book where readers can turn to any page and be totally amused and enchanted, not to mention edified. Learn how to rid mattresses of bedbugs, remove stains from Irish linen, and substitute squirrels for chicken in the stew. So welcome to the family household. Come indoors, pull up a fireside rocker, and listen to the Great-Great-Grandparents tell how they walked these same floorboards, sat in that very chair, and lived under this same roof. Most of all, discover how the everyday rituals of a bustling nineteenth-century home can bring history to life more vividly than ever. Everyone has prepared for the visit: cleaning iron moulds and cut glass...whitening ivory knife handles with sand and the walls with Paris White...scrubbing floors with sawdust and oiling them with linseed and burnt sienna. And the dining room table creaks with a feast of favorite dishes from recipes passed down through generations. With Keeping Hearth and Home on the coffee table, the wolf will never dare venture across the threshold, and the household will carry on flawlessly -- like a well-oiled wagon wheel. From the recipefor Virginia Verder (Bottled Milk-Punch) to the medicinal uses of Virginia Snake-Root, this book will delight readers with descriptions of daily life during the late 1800s.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=okiZkgEACAAJ&dq=Keeping+Hearth&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Myriad Worlds (The Treasury of Knowledge, Book 1)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Where Love Endures (5 Star Romance)","description":"An unplanned pregnancy.

Anna Karenina . . . A Hero of Our Time . . . The People s Act of Love will remind you of all these books . . . Magnificent  (The Washington Post Book World). Set in a time of great social upheaval, warfare, and terrorism, and against a stark, lawless Siberia at the end of the Russian Revolution, The People s Act of Love portrays the fragile coexistence of a beautiful, independent mother raising her son alone, a megalomaniac Czech captain and his restless regiment, and a mystical separatist Christian sect. When a mysterious, charismatic stranger trudges into their snowy village with a frighteningly outlandish story to tell, its balance is shaken to the core.  The narrative drive is amazing. So is the cold clarity of Meek s imagination.   Stephen King  Meeks builds multiple narratives to a bloody, satisfying, yet unsettling conclusion. People s Act of Love stands not only as a keenly observed historical thriller but as a resonant tale of how one man s moral fervor can turn to horror.   Entertainment Weekly  Meek expertly renders each man s devotion to the task of securing paradise on earth, and exposes the unsettling affinity between the devout servant of God and the cold, calculating murderer.   The New Yorker  Set during the waning days of the Russian revolution, Meek s utterly absorbing novel captivates with its depiction of human nature in all its wartime extremes.

American investment banker Ben Hartman arrives in Zurich for a ski holiday, the first time he's been back to Switzerland since his twin brother died there in a tragic accident four years earlier. But his arrival in Zurich triggers something far more sinister than his brother's fate. When Ben chances upon Jimmy Cavanaugh, an old college friend, Cavanaugh promptly pulls out a gun and tries to kill him. In a matter of minutes, several innocent bystanders are dead - as well as Cavanaugh - and Ben has barely managed to survive. Plunged into an unspeakable nightmare, Hartman suddenly finds himself on the run. Department of Justice field agent Anna Navarro is being stalked around the world by a relentless killer, managing to survive the killer's attacks only by a combination of luck, skill and her own quick wits. These attacks are somehow related to her current assignment: investigating the sudden - and seemingly unrelated - deaths of a number of very old men throughout the world. The only thing that connects them is a file in the CIA archives, over a half-century old, marked with the same puzzling code word: SIGMA. But someone or something is always seemingly one step ahead of her, the survivors are rapidly dwindling, and her own life is in ever increasing danger. Brought together by accident, Ben and Anna soon realize that their only hope of survival lies with each other. Together they race to uncover the diabolical secrets long hidden behind the code word, Sigma. Secrets that threaten everything they think they know about themselves, everything they believed true about their friends and families, and everything they were ever taught about history itself. For behind Sigma lies a vast deception that is finally coming to fruition and the fate and future of the world is in their hands.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=PZCaLXz7nGIC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"India's China War","description":"This is one of those rare books that puts an entirely new light on a chapter of history, and it must be read by anyone concerned with international affairs.

It is an important work of revisionist history and a gruesome study of the way in which wars start, superbly documented (largely from official Indian sources but also from secret Indian papers) and beautifully sustained. By showing how India led the world up the garden path it demolishes and throws to the wind a pillar of the 'contain China' doctrine -- the belief that in 1962 India was the victim of unprovoked Chinese aggression.

Nonetheless, Susan Sontag has called Bresson \\"the master of the reflective mode in film.\\"Martin Scorsese suggested that a young filmmaker should ask: \\"Is it as tough as Bresson?... Is Ymeaning ? as ruthlessly pared down, as direct, as unflinching in its gaze at aspects of life I might feel more comfortable ignoring?\\" Questions that every reader of this book and every viewer of Bresson's films will also ask.Joseph Cunneen's book, now in paperback, introduces Bresson's movies to a broader audience, assesses thirteen of his most significant films in the context of detailed plot summaries, vivid descriptions of characters and settings, and perceptive, jargon-free insights into the director's execution, intention, and technique. Each of these films in its own way illustrates what Joseph Cunneen calls Bresson's \\"spiritual style.\\" Though not necessarily focused on the explicitly religious, they illustrate two complementary principles: on the negative side, the rejection of what the director called \\"photographed theater\\" with its artificiality and dependence on celebrity performers. On the more positive side, as Bresson himself expressed it, the conviction that, \\"The supernatural is only the real rendered more precise; real things seen close up.\\"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ysdK6r6mtjAC&dq=Robert+Bresson:+A+Spiritual+Style+in+Film&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Deathwork: Defending The Condemned","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=hlLOhGCGIkwC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sailor's Guide to the Windward Islands","description":"By Chris Doyle and Lexi Fisher.

To understand some aspects of such dynamics, various complementary methods and viewpoints are of crucial importance. In this book the perspectives generated by analytical, topological and computational methods, and interplays between them, are developed in a variety of contexts. This book is a comprehensive introduction to this field, suited to a broad readership, and reflecting a wide range of applications. Some of the concepts considered are: topological equivalence; embeddings; dimensions and fractals; Poincar  maps and map-dynamics; empirical computational sciences vis- -vis mathematics; Ulam's synergetics; Turing's instability and dissipative structures; chaos; dynamic entropies; Lorenz and Rossler models; predator-prey and replicator models; FPU and KAM phenomena; solitons and nonsolitons; coupled maps and pattern dynamics; cellular automata.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=z2E0AAAAIAAJ&dq=Perspectives+of+Nonlinear+Dynamics:+Volume+1&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Bulletproof Diva","description":"In Bulletproof Diva, Lisa Jones brings the wit and candor of her infamous Village Voice column, \\"Skin Trade,\\" to a much larger audience.

What drives them? What are their experiences in a male-dominated profession? How do they function within the contexts - and constraints - of patriarchal societies? The answers are complex and sometimes surprising, as complex and surprising as the vastly different films these women direct. In this unprecedented book, Rebecca Hillauer assembles a comprehensive and penetrating look into the history of Arab women's filmmaking, as well as the political and social background of the countries - Egypt, Iraq, Lebanon, Syria, Algeria, among others - from which these artists emerged. In addition to the biographies, filmographies, and discussions of their most important works, lively, in-depth interviews allow us to hear from the filmmakers themselves. Collectively, these women, who hail from a wide range of professional, religious, and social backgrounds, provide a varied and vivid picture of what it means to work in creative and journalistic fields in the modern Arab world. For Hillauer, the subject of a film, its genesis, and the personal story of the artist who created it reveal far more than a particular approach to cinematography. Arab women filmmakers and their main characters (who are often semi-autobiographical) not only afford us a look at seldom-seen facets of Arab societies, they personify an alternative women's 'model,' one that is far removed from western clich s. Broad in scope, and rich in insight, Arab Women Filmmakers is a must read for cineastes as well as students of film, feminism, and the Middle East.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=yv1BH5Wz-ekC&dq=Encyclopedia+of+Arab+Women+Filmmakers&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Power in the Global Information Age: From Realism to Globalization","description":"'Power in the Global Information Age' collects together many of Joseph S.

And yet it is no surprise that in many places throughout the United States, getting an abortion can be a monumental challenge. Anti-choice politicians and activists have worked tirelessly to impose needless restrictions on this straightforward medical procedure that, at best, delay it and, at worst, create medical risks and deny women their constitutionally protected right to choose. Obstacle Course tells the story of abortion in America, capturing a disturbing reality of insurmountable barriers people face when trying to exercise their legal rights to medical services. Authors David S. Cohen and Carole Joffe lay bare the often arduous and unnecessarily burdensome process of terminating a pregnancy: the sabotaged decision-making, clinics in remote locations, insurance bans, harassing protesters, forced ultrasounds and dishonest medical information, arbitrary waiting periods, and unjustified procedure limitations. Based on patients' stories as well as interviews with abortion providers and allies from every state in the country, Obstacle Course reveals the unstoppable determination required of women in the pursuit of reproductive autonomy as well as the incredible commitment of abortion providers. Without the efforts of an unheralded army of medical professionals, clinic administrators, counselors, activists, and volunteers, what is a legal right would be meaningless for the almost one million people per year who get abortions. There is a better way--treating abortion like any other form of health care--but the United States is a long way from that ideal.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=0nI-EAAAQBAJ&dq=The+Obstacle+Course&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Butterfly Secret","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=OhbnswEACAAJ&dq=The+Butterfly+Secret&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"We Should Never Meet: Stories","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Hiking the Big South Fork","description":"Hiking the Big South Fork combines natural history with folk culture and legend to provide an interpretive guide to the trails of this relatively new National Park Service area.

From a large Irish family, Flanagan suffered through ill health and setbacks to pursue his desire to join the priesthood. Following his older brother and fellow priest to the plains of Nebraska, he served several parishes and opened a hotel for homeless men before finding his life's mission to care for and give a voice to young boys whom society had despaired of and cast aside. Father Flanagan opened his home in 1917 for boys of any race and creed. In this definitive biography, the authors recount his struggles with drought, fire, lack of funds, and skeptical citizens to create a safe haven for these boys. He welcomed Hollywood to Boys Town to recount his story in two films, sent off scores of his boys to do battle in World War II, and toured the orphanages of Asia and Europe to report on the needs of children victimized by that war. At the time of his death in 1948, Father Flanagan was seen as one of the world's foremost advocates for children, especially those without parents or relatives to care for them and those judged guilty of some crime and locked away in reform schools or prisons. The legacy of Father Flanagan is one that inspires all who care for the welfare of children today.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=no6IoVfanBwC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Pictorial Library of Bible Lands-Judah & the Dead Sea (Pictorial Library of the Bible Lands)","description":"The most complete collection of high resolution Bible land images available!

Now, Marshall Silverstein offers the first analysis of the application of self psychology to projective diagnostic assessment. Differentiating the self psychological approach from an ego psychological interpretation of classical drive theory, he clearly outlines the principal contributions of Kohut, including the concepts of selfobject functions, empathy, transmuting internalization, and compensatory structure. Providing numerous clinical examples, he shows how the major selfobject functions of mirroring, idealization, and twinship can be identified on projective tests. Silverstein then demonstrates how conventional assessment approaches to grandiosity, self-esteem, and idealization can be reconceptualized within the framework of self psychology, and he also contrasts ego psychological interpretations with self psychological interpretations. This book makes a strong case for the importance of the clinical identification of self states. It will help practitioners understand their patients' varied attempts to repair an injury to the self to restore self-esteem (compensatory structure) and the clinical consequences of self-disorders, including disintegration products such as narcissistic rage and affect states characterized by empty depression, chronic boredom, and lack of zest.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=YnA7vgAACAAJ&dq=Self+Psychology+and+Diagnostic+Assessment:+Identifying+Selfobject+Functions+Through+Psychological+Testing+(Personality+and+Clinical+Psychology+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Print It Yourself","description":"The aim of this book is to unleash the process of Print Book Publishing to those who are having interest.

Thomas tells the story of the village where Abraham Lincoln lived from 1831 to 1837. His three-part examination of the village often referred to as Lincoln s  Alma Mater  features the founding and early history of New Salem, Lincoln s impact on the village and its effect on him, and the story of the Lincoln legend and the reconstruction of the town. Thomas argues convincingly that New Salem was the town where Lincoln acquired faith in himself, faith in people. At 22 the future president drifted into town seeking to become a blacksmith. Thomas introduces us to the people who created New Salem and who knew, influenced, and befriended Lincoln. Thomas highlights Lincoln s arrival, his relationships with his neighbors, his important wrestling match with Jack Armstrong, his self-education, his quiet career as an Indian fighter, his experience as a postmaster largely indifferent to postal regulations, his financial woes as a businessman, his loyal friends who often came to his aid, and his election to the legislature. This colorful history closes with a discussion of the Lincoln legend. The truth of the stories is unimportant. What matters is that the growing Lincoln legend prompted the gradual realization that New Salem was not a dismal mire from which President Lincoln had had to extricate himself but was, in fact, an energizing force. This realization led to research and finally to the restoration of New Salem, which began in 1932.  No other portion of Lincoln s life lends itself so readily to intensive study of his environment as do his six years at New Salem.  Benjamin P.

And it is true that, many times in the course of history, they have been nearly decimated: when the First and Second Temples were destroyed, when the Jews were expelled from Spain, when Hitler proposed his Final Solution. Astoundingly, the Jewish people have survived catastrophe after catastrophe and remained a thriving and vibrant community. The question Rabbi Jonathan Sacks asks is, quite simply: How? How, in the face of such adversity, has Judaism remained and flourished, making a mark on human history out of all proportion to its numbers? Written originally as a wedding gift to his son and daughter-in-law, A Letter in the Scroll is Rabbi Sacks's personal answer to that question, a testimony to the enduring strength of his religion. Tracing the revolutionary series of philosophical and theological ideas that Judaism created -- from covenant to sabbath to formal education -- and showing us how they remain compellingly relevant in our time, Sacks portrays Jewish identity as an honor as well as a duty. The Ba'al Shem Tov, an eighteenth-century rabbi and founder of the Hasidic movement, famously noted that the Jewish people are like a living Torah scroll, and every individual Jew is a letter within it. If a single letter is damaged or missing or incorrectly drawn, a Torah scroll is considered invalid. So too, in Judaism, each individual is considered a crucial part of the people, without whom the entire religion would suffer. Rabbi Sacks uses this metaphor to make a passionate argument in favor of affiliation and practice in our secular times, and invites us to engage in our dynamic and inclusive tradition. Never has a book more eloquently expressed the joys of being a Jew. This is the story of one man's hope for the future -- a future in which the next generation, his children and ours, will happily embrace the beauty of the world's oldest religion.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=sc-gCvgjeRYC&dq=A+Letter+in+the+Scroll:+Understanding+Our+Jewish+Identity+and+Exploring+the+Legacy+of+the+World%27s+Oldest+Religion&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Attack alarm","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=yPwEAQAAIAAJ&dq=Attack+alarm&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Secret Sisters Handbook","description":"Every young girl who has ever had a best friend knows: great girl friends are like sisters...Secret Sisters, in fact.

Individually, they were recognized as extraordinary actors, each one a star celebrated, imitated, sought after. Together, they were legend. The Lunts. A name to conjure with. Alfred Lunt and Lynn Fontanne worked together so imaginatively, so seamlessly onstage that they seemed to fuse into one person. Offstage, they brawled so famously and raucously over every detail of every performance that they inspired the musical Kiss Me, Kate. At home on Broadway, in London s West End, touring the United States and Great Britain, and even playing  the foxhole circuit  of World War II, the Lunts stunned, moved, and mystified audiences for more than four decades. They were considered to be a rarefied taste, but when they toured Texas in the 1930s, the audience threw cowboy hats onto the stage. Their private life was equally fascinating, as unusual as the one they led in public. Friends like the critic Alexander Woollcott (whom Edna Ferber once described as  the little New Jersey Nero who thinks his pinafore is a toga ), No?l Coward, Laurette Taylor, and Sidney Greenstreet received lifelong loyalty and hospitality. Ten Chimneys, their country home in Genesee Depot, Wisconsin,  is to performers what the Vatican is to Catholics,  Carol Channing once said.  The Lunts are where we all spring from.  In this new biography, Margot Peters catches the magic of Lunt and Fontanne their period, their work, their intimacy and its contradictions with candor, delicacy, intelligence, and wit. She writes about their personal and creative choices as deftly as she captures their world, from their meeting (backstage, naturally) when Fontanne was a young actress in the first flush of stardom and Lunt a lanky midwesterner who came in the stage door, bowed to her elaborately, lost his balance, and fell down the stairs and the early days when an unknown and very hungry No?l Coward lived in a swank hotel in a room the size of a closet and cadged meals at their table to the telegram the famous couple once sent to a movie mogul, turning down a studio contract worth a fortune ( We can be bought, my dear Mr. Laemmle, but we can t be bored ). We follow the Lunts through triumphs in plays such as The Guardsman, The Taming of the Shrew, and Design for Living; through friendships and feuds; through the intricate way they worked with such playwrights and directors as S. N. Behrman, Robert Sherwood, Giraudoux, D rrenmatt, Peter Brook, and with each other. Margot Peters captures the gallantry of two remarkably gifted people who lived for their art and for each other. Alfred Lunt and Lynn Fontanne were once described as an  amazing duet of intelligence and gaiety.  Margot Peters re-creates the fun and the fireworks.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=TYVyHYA_oc4C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dake Annotated Reference Bible : Indexed","description":"Red letter 35,000 commentary notes 3-column format Text and notes side-by-side 500,000 cross/chain references 9,000 headings dividing text Complete concordance lists every Bible word 8,000 sermon outlines Summary at end of each book Key Hebrew and Greek words defined 2,352 pp.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=RK4CAAAACAAJ&dq=Dake+Annotated+Reference+Bible+:+Indexed&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Howie Monroe and the Doghouse of Doom","description":"Dear possible reader of this book, My editor asked me to write a third book in my series, Tales from the House of Bunnicula.

With an unbroken string of bestsellers in almost every country in the world, Robert Ludlum's books have been enjoyed by hundreds of millions of readers, and are widely acknowledged as classics in the field. Now, after the bestselling Covert-One novels The Hades Factor and The Cassandra Compact comes the third thrilling novel in the series - The Paris Option. A fiery explosion in the dark of night shatters one of the laboratory buildings in Paris's esteemed Pasteur Institute. Among the dead is Emile Chambord, one of the leaders in the global race to create a molecular - or DNA - computer. Unfortunately, Professor Chambord kept the details of his work secret, and his notes were apparently destroyed in either the bomb blast or the raging fire that followed. The scientific community does not expect a workable DNA computer to be developed for years. But suddenly U.S. fighter jets disappear from radar screens for a full five minutes, and there's no explanation. Utilities across the Western states cease functioning, and all telecommunications abruptly stop, with devastating consequences. This is not the work of a clever hacker, although Washington, worried about a panic, assures the public it is. Only the enormous power and speed of a DNA computer could have caused such havoc. Under the cover of visiting his friend Marty Zellerbach, who was severely injured when the Pasteur lab was destroyed, Covert-One agent Jon Smith flies to Paris to search for the connection between the Pasteur explosion and the forces now wielding the computer. Following a trail that leads him across two continents, Smith uncovers a web of deception that threatens to wreck havoc and forever reshape the world.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Pl9fzBKTscsC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Callese y Venda (Spanish Edition)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=WUAkAQAAMAAJ&dq=Callese+y+Venda+(Spanish+Edition)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Valentines and Killer Chili: One Act Drama","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=hfMARAAACAAJ&dq=Valentines+and+Killer+Chili:+One+Act+Drama&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Handbook of Chaos Control","description":"This long-awaited revised second edition of the standard reference on the subject has been considerably expanded to include such recent developments as novel control schemes, control of chaotic space-time patterns, control of noisy nonlinear systems, and communication with chaos, as well as promising new directions in research.

Lusitania-pride of the Cunard Line and one of the greatest ocean liners afloat-became the target of a terrifying new weapon and a casualty of a terrible new kind of war. Sunk off the southern coast of Ireland by a torpedo fired from the German submarine U-20, she exploded and sank in eighteen minutes, taking with her some twelve hundred people, more than half of the passengers and crew. Cold-blooded, deliberate, and unprecedented in the annals of war, the sinking of the Lusitania shocked the world. It also jolted the United States out of its neutrality and hastened the nation's entry into World War I. In her riveting account of this enormous and controversial tragedy, Diana Preston recalls both a pivotal moment in history and a remarkable human drama. The story of the Lusitania is a window on the maritime world of the early twentieth century: the heyday of the luxury liner, the first days of the modern submarine, and the climax of the decades-long German-British rivalry for supremacy of the Atlantic. Above all, it is the story of the passengers and crew on that fateful voyage-a story of terror and cowardice, of self-sacrifice and heroism, of death and miraculous survival.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Ci92BwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Keepsake","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Research Paper: Process, Form, and Content - (7th / Seventh Edition)","description":"The Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association is the style manual of choice for writers, editors, students, and educators in the social and behavioral sciences, nursing, education, business, and related disciplines.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=o0BFyAEACAAJ&dq=The+Research+Paper:+Process,+Form,+and+Content+-+(7th+/+Seventh+Edition)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Last Minute Meetings","description":"Got a few weeks till the big meeting?

In the couse of the last ten years, competition paintball has gone from playing in the woods (running and crawling through the bushes while wearing camoflage) to being played in venues like the Toronto Skydome (running diving, sliding and hiding behind air filled, vinyl bunkers while wearing loud clothing spoecifically designed for paintball). The game itself is getting faster and more exciting every year. Due to the elevation in speed and aggresiveness in the game, there are greater physical demands being placed on the athletes. Competition paintball is no longer for the out of shape individual. The Next Level is a training guide to help increase the overall athleticism of the competition player. In the course of a game, players might have to: sprint repeatedly over short distances, power slide, dive, make very quick abrupt movements (dodging flying paintballs), hold awkward positions (for minutes at a time), and to be able to think and react rapidly. To address all of the physical and mental demands of the game, The Next Level, with the use of clear diagrams and detailed descriptions, shows athletes how to increase their abilities in the following: flexibility, explosiveness, running speed, reaction speed, hand and eye coordination, agility, and game related vision. All of the exercises and techniques have been specifically selected, for the physical and mental demands of competition paintball.

Tracing them all in Topsy The Startling Story of the Crooked Tailed Elephant, P.T. Barnum, and the American Wizard, Thomas Edison, journalist Michael Daly weaves together a fascinating popular history, the first book on this astonishing tale. At the turn of the century, the circus in America was at its apex with the circuses of P.T. Barnum and Adam Forepaugh (or 4-Paw) competing in a War of the Elephants, with declarations of whose pachyderms were younger, bigger, or more  sacred . This brought Topsy to America, fraudulently billed as the first native-born, and caught between the circus disputes and the War of the Currents, in which Edison and George Westinghouse (and Nikola Tesla) battled over alternating versus direct current. Rich in period Americana, and full of circus tidbits and larger than life characters both human and elephant Topsy is a touching tale and an entertaining read.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=330u5DmlWTYC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Moms with ADD: A Self-Help Manual","description":"Guaranteed to make moms with ADD happier at home and at the office.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Ls59u_KAKDQC&dq=Moms+with+ADD:+A+Self-Help+Manual&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"How Mickey Made It","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=JN5tQgAACAAJ&dq=How+Mickey+Made+It&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Subject to Debate: Sense and Dissents on Women, Politics, and Culture","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Franois Mitterrand","description":"Tiersky examines the three major themes of Mitterrand's presidency-socialism, national reconciliation, and the reconstruction of Europe-and shows that on each count, Mitterrand left a decisive mark.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=LiHLZQ6XtzEC&dq=Franois+Mitterrand&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"In Search of Women's Passionate Soul: Revealing the Daimon Lover Within","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Higher Judo","description":"Dr. Moshe Feldenkrais is best known for pioneering the somatic therapy that bears his name.

He reveals judo s potential for creating a sense of rhythm of movement and improving mental and physical coordination.

In thrall of the supernatural, he talked to the ghosts of his dead pilots, proclaimed that Hitler was defeated only by the personal intervention of God, and believed in the existence of faeries. How could it be that such a man should be put in charge of evaluating technical developments for the British air ministry? Yet it was he who brought the modern multi-gunned fighter into existence. And he insisted that his scientists investigate the mysterious invisible rays that would prove to be the salvation of Britain: radar. Dowding, who provided the organization and training that led to victory, has been all but ignored by U. S. biographers of Churchill and historians of the Battle of Britain. Yet his story is vital to tell, for its importance to the defense of Britain and the free world, and for the intriguing character study that emerges from his ongoing conflict with Churchill and the British government during the crisis years of the empire. Part military history, part science narrative, part biography; this an incredible story.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=a4EViyz2CdUC&dq=A+Summer+Bright+and+Terrible:+Winston+Churchill,+Lord+Dowding,+Radar,+and+the+Impossible+Triumph+of+the+Battle+of+Britain&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The lady of the linden tree","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=j0Z4tAEACAAJ&dq=The+lady+of+the+linden+tree&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Modern Hatreds: The Symbolic Politics of Ethnic War (Cornell Studies in Security Affairs)","description":"Ethnic conflict has been the driving force of wars all over the world, yet it remains an enigma. What is it about ethnicity that breaks countries apart and drives people to acts of savage violence against their lifelong neighbors? Stuart Kaufman rejects the notion of permanent \\"ancient hatreds\\" as the answer. Dissatisfied as well with a purely rationalist explanation, he finds the roots of ethnic violence in myths and symbols, the stories ethnic groups tell about who they are. Ethnic wars, Kaufman argues, result from the politics of these myths and symbols appeals to flags and faded glories that aim to stir emotions rather than to address interests. Popular hostility based on these myths impels groups to follow extremist leaders invoking such emotion-laden ethnic symbols. If ethnic domination becomes their goal, ethnic war is the likely result. Kaufman examines contemporary ethnic wars in the Caucasus and southeastern Europe. Drawing on information from a variety of sources, including visits to the regions and dozens of personal interviews, he demonstrates that diplomacy and economic incentives are not enough to prevent or end ethnic wars. The key to real conflict resolution is peacebuilding the often-overlooked effort by nongovernmental organizations to change hostile attitudes at both the elite and the grassroots levels.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=u7mdDgAAQBAJ&dq=Modern+Hatreds:+The+Symbolic+Politics+of+Ethnic+War+(Cornell+Studies+in+Security+Affairs)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cruise Vacations For Dummies 2006 (Dummies Travel)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=4bX_eMsXqyQC&dq=Cruise+Vacations+For+Dummies+2006+(Dummies+Travel)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"El Rey Arturo y Los Caballeros (Spanish Edition)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Unnatural Affection","description":"The purpose of this book of poetry entitled \\"Wisdom Of The Soul,\\" is to attempt to strengthen and enlighten, not to judge nor condemn. Its purpose also is to touch the lives, and to share in the encouragement of others and hopefully touching their hearts and saving of souls. The author speaks out through her poetry for those who want and need to be heard. Her desire is to reach the world of the needy, whether it be a spiritual need, natural need, emotional need or any or all of these factors. She desire her poetry to be a positive orator conveying the fact that love, faith, hope and all goodness and truth overcomes hatred, fear, prejudice, and all wrong-doings, and evil intentions. Through the writing of poetry, the author submerge deeply within herself going beyond her mind, but into her heart and soul emerging with the truths which convicted her to write with experience, strong conviction, and ardent passion for those who have been and still are victimized by various forms of conflicts and adversities in their lives. She desire the words of her poetry to come forth pure and clean-edged; going beyond the surface, from depth to depth, and to be a blessing and beneficial to all. The author continually attempt to instill in others through poetry the importance of living within the bounds of righteousness in order to inherit the kingdom of God, \\"for unrighteousness shall not inherit the kingdom of God.\\" She emphasize the fact that we need to get ourselves ready for the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. We are living in the last time, and Jesus Christ is still extending his love and mercy toward mankind wanting all men to be saved, and come to the knowledge of the truth. We must put aside all ungodliness, and seek Gods face; putting him first in our lives. The author desires her poems to capture the suppressed emotions that ones are too shy, embarrassed, or intimidated to express openly for fear of retaliation from others. We must not be afraid to speak out for truth and justice, fearing no man, who can only destroy our bodies, but fearing only God who can destroy both body and soul. The author writes about life and about death. She attest to the belief that our mortal lives should be lived to the fulliest daily in Gods way and after his will in order to obtain immortality and eternal life. Thus death in the end shall have no dominion over Eternal Life, and there is hope beyond the grave; if we die in Christ Jesus. To fear the Lord Jesus, to grow in grace and knowledge of him, to love, to be pure and faithful and to do all things in spirit and in truth is to truly obtain spiritual wisdom.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=rWO-0iul72AC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Summer Place","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Rules for Roommates: The Ultimate Guide to Reclaiming Your Space and Your Sanity","description":"What could be more fun than having a roommate?

Ken Lawrence profiles Donald Trump, using actual (and often controversial) quotes from the Donald himself. \\"You're fired.\\" Those two words increased Donald Trump's popularity in this country a thousandfold in the spring of 2004. Trump is the dealmaker's dealmaker. His forays into real estate, golf, casinos, and now television have made him one of the most successful people in the world. Often considered brash, arrogant, and outrageous, Trump's views on succeeding--and failing--in life, as well as in business, are depicted in The World According to Trump. Author Ken Lawrence uses Trump's actual words on the art of making the deal. Some quotes may surprise, others may offend, but certainly all are entertaining. * I've had bright people ask me why I talk to porters and maids. . . . Those are the people who make it all work. If they like me, they will work harder and I pay well. * It was a little bit by accident that the term \\"You're fired\\" came about. But when you think about it, it's a very precise, very beautiful two words. * If someone screws you, screw them back harder. * The reason my hair looks so neat all the time is because I don't have to deal with the elements very often. * Every successful person has a very large ego. * My life is an open book. I am a good son. I am a good parent. I've got four wonderful kids. I've been married twice. I don't smoke. I've never had a glass of alcohol. I've never taken illegal drugs of any kind.
