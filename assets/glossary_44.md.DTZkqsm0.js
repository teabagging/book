Samurai, merchants, and villagers wrote of minor flooding and damage. Some noted having felt no earthquake; they wondered what had set off the waves but had no way of knowing that the tsunami was spawned during an earthquake along the coast of northwestern North America. This orphan tsunami would not be linked to its parent earthquake until the mid-twentieth century, through an extraordinary series of discoveries in both North America and Japan. The Orphan Tsunami of 1700, now in its second edition, tells this scientific detective story through its North American and Japanese clues. The story underpins many of today?s precautions against earthquake and tsunami hazards in the Cascadia region of northwestern North America. The Japanese tsunami of March 2011 called attention to these hazards as a mirror image of the transpacific waves of January 1700.

Drawing together two cultural fantasies from different periods--one literary and one architectural--Bloomer uses the allegorical strategies she finds in James Joyce's Finnegans Wake to analyze three works of Giambattista Piranesi (Campo Marzio, Collegio, and the Carceri). Bloomer argues that architecture is a system of representation, with signifying possibilities that go beyond the merely symbolic. Bloomer reads the texts and ideas of Joyce and Piranesi against one another, further illuminating them with insights from myth, religion, linguistics, film theory, nursery rhymes, and personal anecdotes, as well as from poststructuralist, Marxist, and feminist criticism. Combining the strategies of Finnegans Wake, which Joyce himself called architectural, with conventional strategies of architectural thinking, Bloomer creates a new way of thinking architecturally that is not dominated by linear models and that appropriates ideas, parts, and theoretical frameworks from many other disciplines. Demonstrating her argument by dramatic example, Bloomer's treatise--like Joyce's word-play and Piranesi's play with visual representation--offers the pleasure of ongoing discovery.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=5r2uHZ7CKLoC&dq=Architecture+and+the+Text:+The+(S)crypts+of+Joyce+and+Piranesi+(Theoretical+Perspectives+in+Architectura)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Of the nature of things;","description":"The seminal Epicurean text, in a brilliant new translation The Epicureans of ancient Rome discarded the ideas of life after death and of an interventionist God in favor of the tactile pleasures of nature.

Whitehead presents a collection of recent fieldwork and the latest theoretical perspectives that illuminate how a range of Native communities in the Amazon River basin, and those they encounter, use the past to make sense of their world and themselves. In recent decades, scholars have become increasingly aware of the role the past plays in the construction of culture and identity. Not only can the past be represented and codified overtly in various ways and media as a history, it also operates more fundamentally and pervasively in cultures as a mode of consciousness or way of thinking about the world, a historicity. ? In addition to examining the particular foundations and significance of history and historicity in such communities as the Guaj?, Wapishana, Dekuana, and Patamuna, the contributors to this volume consider more broadly how different natural and cultural features can help shape historical consciousness: landscape and territory; rituals such as feasting; genealogy and kinship; and even the practice of archaeology. Also of interest are activist uses of historicity to promote and legitimize the cultural integrity and political agendas of Native communities, especially in contact situations past and present where multiple and often competing forms of history and historicity play important political roles in articulating relations between colonizers and the colonized. ? As this volume makes clear, understanding the powerful cultural role of the past helps scholars better appreciate the inherent dynamic quality of all cultures and recognize a rich resource of agency that can be used both to comprehend and to transform the present","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=EVNn33kQddoC&dq=Histories+and+Historicities+in+Amazonia&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"What Not To Wear for Every Occasion","description":"Susannah and Trinny's straight-talking fashion advice has made them Britain's best-known style duo.

After World War I, the fear of the stranger overwhelmed America's confidence in our ability to create one nation out of many peoples. We slammed the door shut, only to realize our error and re-open it four decades later. Today, a record-high foreign-born population, global instability, and economic uncertainty have once again pushed America to a tipping point in our attitudes not only toward immigration but toward our role in the world and the stakes have risen dramatically. Our economy depends more than ever on immigrants, not only for stereotypical low-skilled jobs, but much more so for maintaining our technological edge and promoting American products and services abroad. So far, America has reaped the lion's share of the gains of globalization. Yet for the first time ever, the world's best and brightest no longer see this country as the only destination of choice. In Lock Out, Michele Wucker documents the mistakes that led to our predicament today, and clarifies why it would be a catastrophic error of judgment, as well as a demonstration of a colossal lack of self-knowledge, if America attempted to turn its back on rest of the world and in so doing on the best of itself.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=7E5JswEACAAJ&dq=Lockout:+Why+America+Keeps+Getting+Immigration+Wrong+When+Our+Prosperity+Depends+on+Getting+It+Right&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Emotional Intelligence Quickbook","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Handbook for Public Relations Writing","description":"With a wealth of illustrations, examples, and practice assignments, this book covers every key PR document needed on the job: press releases, PSAs, annual reports, newsletters, magazines, trade journals, brochures, print ads, and speeches and presentations.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=aWO4AAAAIAAJ&dq=Handbook+for+Public+Relations+Writing&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Terapia con los chakras","description":"The ABC's of Chakra Therapy is a practical, user-friendly workbook that leads readers on a journey of self-healing and transformation through the exploration of the human energy field, specifically the seven main energy centers, or chakras.

Monitor and the C.S.S. Virginia (formerly the U.S.S. Merrimack) were to change the course of not only the Civil War but also naval warfare forever. Using letters, diaries, and memoirs of men who lived through the epic battle of the Monitor and the Merrimack and of those who witnessed it from afar, William C. Davis documents and analyzes this famous confrontation of the first two modern warships. The result is a full-scale history that is as exciting as a novel. Besides a thorough discussion of the designs of each ship, Davis portrays come of the men involved in the building and operation of America's first ironclads-John Ericsson, supreme egoist and engineering genius who designed the Monitor; John Brooke, designer of the Virginia; John Worden, the well-loved captain of the Monitor; Captain Franklin Buchanan of the Virginia; and a host of other men on both Union and Confederate sides whose contributions make this history as much a story of men as of ships and war.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=-KbN-xWTj7kC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dark Majesty: The Secret Brotherhood and the Magic of a Thousand Points of Light","description":"In this explosive new book, bestselling author Texe Marrs unmasks the men of the Secret Brotherhood.

Set in late nineteenth century Central America and New York City, The Divine Husband tells the story of Mar a de las Nieves Moran, whose brief career as a nun is ended in the wake of revolution. Forced to make her way in the secular world, Mar a is surrounded by an unforgettable cast of characters: Jos  Mart , the poet and hero of Cuban independence and the first man Mar a loves; Mack Chinchilla, the Yankee-Indio entrepreneur intent on winning her hand; a British diplomat setting up a political impostor plot; and Mathilde, the daughter whose birth perhaps fathered by one of these men ruins Mar a s reputation and launches her on a journey toward a new future. This joyfully imagined novel of ideas is populated by Indian girls, wandering Jewish coffee farmers, the founder of the rubber-balloon industry, and one of Latin America s greatest and most complex men. The Divine Husband is a sweeping, poetic novel rich in historical detail and vivid characterization.  Goldman echoes Flaubert, Garc a Marquez, and even DeLillo.

At age eleven, Mithridates inherited a small mountain kingdom of wild tribesmen, which his wicked mother governed in his place. Sweeping to power at age twenty-one, he proved to be a military genius and quickly consolidated various fiefdoms under his command. Since Rome also had expansionist designs in this region, bloody conflict was inevitable. Over forty years, Rome sent its greatest generals to contain Mithridates and gained tenuous control over his empire only after suffering a series of devastating defeats at the hands of this cunning and ruthless king. Each time Rome declared victory, Mithridates considered it merely a strategic retreat, and soon came roaring back with a more powerful army than before. Bursting with heroic battle scenes and eloquent storytelling, Michael Curtis Ford has crafted a riveting novel of the ancient world and resurrected one of history's greatest warriors.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=XEo32GzGjFYC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Delta: An Airline and Its Aircraft : The Illustrated History of a Major U.S. Airline and the People Who Made It","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ktGqPAAACAAJ&dq=Delta:+An+Airline+and+Its+Aircraft+:+The+Illustrated+History+of+a+Major+U.S.+Airline+and+the+People+Who+Made+It&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Arming & Fitting of English Ships of War (Conway's History of Sail)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=CpzfLAAACAAJ&dq=Arming&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Where Tigers Prowl","description":"Maris Rhodes would tell you that a Ph.D. in Classics is okay?if you?re into dead Greek philosophers.

For those of us lacking the resources to excavate occult secrets hidden beneath the Louvre or the Rosslyn Chapel, or within CIA Headquarters, The Shadow of Solomon is the next best thing. These pages reveal the true secrets of Solomon, from masonry to magic. Laurence Gardner's personal experience as both a Templar and a mason makes this fascinating journey through the history of the Bible, Knights Templar, Freemasons, and everything that followed all the more striking and immediate. Is it an accident that the world's attention should be turned to these men and their strange lexicon of symbols and secrets RIGHT NOW? What will happen when we understand that there is something we all have in common that is greater than nation or religion? Freemasons are often said to be the world's most influential secret society, yet the story of this enigmatic fraternity is wrapped in mystery and intrigue. Their involvement in shaping political world events has stretched over centuries, even to the extent that masonic principles lie beneath the establishment of the United States and its Constitution. The Shadow of Solomon is the definitive insider's account of the startling truth behind masonic history and the centuries-long search that the fraternity has undertaken to find its own lost secrets.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=JTPcRXdUahQC&dq=Shadow+of+Solomon&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Flash, Crash, Rumble, and Roll","description":"Read and find out about what causes the flash, crash, rumble, and roll of thunderstorms in this colorfully illustrated nonfiction picture book.

George Takei has captured hearts and minds worldwide with his magnetic performances, sharp wit, and outspoken commitment to equal rights.

But Isabel is only the most recent in a long line of people that find the Axons impossible. Meanwhile, Isabel has her own problems: a married lover, Colin. He is a history teacher to unresponsive children and father to a passel of his own horrible kids. With all this to worry about, how can Isabel even begin to understand what is going on in the Axon household? When Evelyn finally moves to defend Muriel, and Muriel, in turn, acts to protect herself, the results are by turns hilarious and terrifying.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=WDlq-5EHIi0C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ask the Cards a Question","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Deceived","description":"A novelization of plots in the online video game \\"Star Wars: The Old Republic\\" shares the story of a mysterious Sith Lord who defies the Empire and destroys the Jedi Temple, setting the stage for the Treaty of Coruscant.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=grAoAwEACAAJ&dq=Deceived&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"George Washington Had No Middle Name","description":"A reexamination of strange historical trivia disproves those stories of history that have been generally accepted but are simply not so, such as the belief that gunpowder was invented by the Chinese.

De Castro and J.A. Silva","description":"The postromantic works of the Spaniard Rosal a de Castro and the Colombian Jos  Asunci n Silva are indispensable in any anthology of 19th century Spanish and Latin American poetry. However, they found few appreciative readers during their lifetimes, even while displaying two of the most sincere voices of the day. Dever's book is unique: it is the first comparison of Castro's and Silva's poetry. Their works have meaningful differences but share remarkable likenesses in theme, tone, and style, though it is doubtful that either was aware of the other's existence. Of interest to feminist critics is an interpretation of Castro's literary vocation within a patriarchal society. Using the ideas of three 20th century Spanish thinkers, Jos  Ortega y Gasset, Xavier Zubiri, and Pedro La n Entralgo, Dever applies the concept of radical insufficiency to a comparison of the poets' works. Radical insufficiency holds that humans lack a determined being and fixed course for life, thus norms are not available to make the world intelligible. Humans experience feelings of uncertainty and emptiness, which inevitably lead to anxiety. Confronted by the mystery and pathos of human life, Castro and Silva both describe futile attempts to overcome this insufficiency through creation and contemplation of art, human relationships, and religion. The significance of these writers has transcended their own time; when examined in the context of Spanish and Latin American authors and thinkers who succeeded them, the importance of their works will continue to grow.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=GpBB3rFI4YYC&dq=The+Radical+Insufficiency+of+Human+Life:+The+Poetry+of+R.+De+Castro+and+J.A.+Silva&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"SBA Loans: A Step-by-Step Guide","description":"This step-by-step guide shows how the Small Business Administration (SBA) of America can help to start or maintain a small business.

The existence of structure in the physical processes leads to structure in the solutions. For group theory to be useful this structure need not be an exact symmetry, although as examples of exact symmetries we have that the identity of electrons leads to permutation symmetries in many-electron wave functions, the spatial structure of crystals leads to the Bloch theory of crystal eigenfunctions, and the rotational invariance of the hydrogenic Hamiltonian leads to its factorization into angular and radial parts. In the 1930's Wigner extended what is known to mathematicians as the theory of group representations and the theory of group algebras to study the coupling coefficients of angular momentum, relating various properties of the coefficients to the properties of the abstract group of rotations in 3-space. In 1949 Racah, in a paper on rare earth spectra, showed that similar coefficients occur in other situations. Immediately a number of studies of the coefficients were begun, notably by Jahn, with his applications in nuclear physics. In the years since then a large number of physicists and chemists have added to the development of a general theory of the coefficients, or have produced specialized tables for a specific application. Applications now range from high-energy physics to biology.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=jmDSBwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Patrick White Letters","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=PRwgtAEACAAJ&dq=Patrick+White+Letters&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hawaiian Dick Volume 1: Byrd Of Paradise","description":"In this fourth volume of the HAWAIIAN DICK series, an enemy from the past returns to exact deadly retribution, and Byrd has to deal with the FBI probing his past.

When he came to Vietnam in 1962, Lieutenant Colonel John Paul Vann was the one clear-sighted participant in an enterprise riddled with arrogance and self-deception, a charismatic soldier who put his life and career on the line in an attempt to convince his superiors that the war should be fought another way. By the time he died in 1972, Vann had embraced the follies he once decried. He died believing that the war had been won. In this magisterial book, a monument of history and biography that was awarded the National Book Award and the Pulitzer Prize for Nonfiction, a renowned journalist tells the story of John Vann \\"the one irreplaceable American in Vietnam\\" and of the tragedy that destroyed a country and squandered so much of America's young manhood and resources.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=I_ECCk6SQQIC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Blue Skidoos to the Planets!

Kirk's five-year mission as captain of the Starship Enterprise,? a mysterious alien threat called \\"The Totality\\" commenced its invasion, intending to conquer the Milky Way galaxy as it had conquered the Andromeda. A war unlike any other is about to begin -- one that threatens to destroy the Federation. Captain Kirk has encountered the Totality before. It took the beguiling form of Norinda, an irresistible alien who becomes the woman each person most desperately desires. In his first encounter, Kirk almost lost the Enterprise. In his second encounter, he almost lost his child, and watched in horror as the Totality absorbed Spock in its monstrous dimensional tendrils. But now, Kirk faces an even more devastating personal challenge. The battle lines have been drawn, and he and his friend Captain Jean-Luc Picard are on opposite sides. With Captain William Riker of the Starship Titan caught in the cross fire of the conflict between Kirk and Picard, and with Kirk's own child poised on the brink of a startling destiny millions of years in the making, Kirk must prepare for his final encounter with the Totality. But how can Kirk fight an enemy whose greatest weapon is love?

The occurrence of such phenomena sheds much light on the nature of medieval society and medieval religion. It also forms a chapter in the history of women. Previous scholars have occasionally noted the various phenomena in isolation from each other and have sometimes applied modern medical or psychological theories to them. Using materials based on saints' lives and the religious and mystical writings of medieval women and men, Caroline Walker Bynum uncovers the pattern lying behind these aspects of women's religiosity and behind the fascination men and women felt for such miracles and devotional practices. She argues that food lies at the heart of much of women's piety. Women renounced ordinary food through fasting in order to prepare for receiving extraordinary food in the eucharist. They also offered themselves as food in miracles of feeding and bodily manipulation. Providing both functionalist and phenomenological explanations, Bynum explores the ways in which food practices enabled women to exert control within the family and to define their religious vocations. She also describes what women meant by seeing their own bodies and God's body as food and what men meant when they too associated women with food and flesh. The author's interpretation of women's piety offers a new view of the nature of medieval asceticism and, drawing upon both anthropology and feminist theory, she illuminates the distinctive features of women's use of symbols. Rejecting presentist interpretations of women as exploited or masochistic, she shows the power and creativity of women's writing and women's lives.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=9DUgmJGxZyEC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Complete Book of Fly Tying","description":"Step-by-step, illustrated instructions for tying all the basic flies are augmented by details for tying hundreds of traditional flies of all kinds and for all patterns.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=uEhpitk81uUC&dq=Complete+Book+of+Fly+Tying&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Jimmie Moore of Bucktown: a Vivid Story of a Waif of the Slums","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=7zQXAAAAYAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Essentials of Oral Pathology and Oral Medicine, 6e","description":"This is a new edition of a classic textbook of oral pathology and oral medicine for dental students and candidates for postgraduate dentistry exams.

Alongside the harrowing accounts of survivors and their testimony before the Senate investigation, there are chapters of newspaper editorials and sermons preached by prominent clergy. Thus we find that even a hundred years ago, opinion columns were despairing of the modern need for speed, and were calling for stern regulation of the new-fangled  Marconigrams  (radio), while churchmen lauded the spirit of  women and children first,  and preached on  How Shall We View God in the Light of Such a Disaster.

They can be found in any number of entertainment, commercial, and other contexts, but popular media or commodified representations of ghosts can be quite different from the beliefs people hold about them, based on tradition or direct experience. Personal belief and cultural tradition on the one hand, and popular and commercial representation on the other, nevertheless continually feed each other. They frequently share space in how people think about the supernatural. In Haunting Experiences, three well-known folklorists seek to broaden the discussion of ghost lore by examining it from a variety of angles in various modern contexts. Diane E. Goldstein, Sylvia Ann Grider, and Jeannie Banks Thomas take ghosts seriously, as they draw on contemporary scholarship that emphasizes both the basis of belief in experience (rather than mere fantasy) and the usefulness of ghost stories. They look closely at the narrative role of such lore in matters such as socialization and gender. And they unravel the complex mix of mass media, commodification, and popular culture that today puts old spirits into new contexts.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=BmrgCwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Lady Be Good: Erotic Love Stories by Naiad Press Authors","description":"An intimate collection of short stories featuring all your favorite Naiad authors.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=xwxaAAAAMAAJ&dq=Lady+Be+Good:+Erotic+Love+Stories+by+Naiad+Press+Authors&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Have You Seen My Mother: True Story of Parental Kidnap","description":"A handsome hardbound 5 1/2\\" x 8 1/2\\" book with full color dust jacket and 16 pages of color illustations.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Rt1EkIF9bY0C&dq=Have+You+Seen+My+Mother:+True+Story+of+Parental+Kidnap&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Coming in First: Twelve Keys to Being a Winner Every Day","description":"Renowned sports psychologist Dr. Jack Llewellyn offers up valuable advice on how to develop a winning attitude in work and life, based on the principles behind his successful consulting program.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Ng-su_Nwa2EC&dq=Coming+in+First:+Twelve+Keys+to+Being+a+Winner+Every+Day&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Notes to Each Other","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Z26iUmpH-mkC&dq=Notes+to+Each+Other&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"This Golfing Life","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Strong Measures: Contemporary American Poetry In Traditional Form","description":"Presents a new, wide-ranging selection of contemporary but structured American verse by almost two hundred poets.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=rHstnwEACAAJ&dq=Strong+Measures:+Contemporary+American+Poetry+In+Traditional+Form&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Sweetness of A Bitter Cup: Journey of A Pastor's Wife","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=nShzN7pYa8IC&dq=The+Sweetness+of+A+Bitter+Cup:+Journey+of+A+Pastor%27s+Wife&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Novelist's Guide: Powerful Techniques for Creating Character, Dialogue and Plot","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Yankee girls in Oom Paul's land, (Undine library)","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=LYVLAQAAMAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Oh the Glory of It All","description":" [An] irreverent and remarkably candid memoir about growing up in wealthy eighties San Francisco . . . rollicking, ruthless . . . ultimately generous-hearted.

Kirkus Reviews  In the beginning we were happy. And we were always excessive. So in the beginning we were happy to excess.  With these opening lines Sean Wilsey takes us on an exhilarating tour of life in the strangest, wealthiest, and most grandiose of families. Sean's blond-bombshell mother (one of the thinly veiled characters in Armistead Maupin's bestselling Tales of the City) is a 1980s society-page staple, regularly entertaining Black Panthers and movie stars in her marble and glass penthouse, \\"eight hundred feet in the air above San Francisco; an apartment at the top of a building at the top of a hill: full of light, full of voices, full of windows full of water and bridges and hills.\\" His enigmatic father uses a jet helicopter to drop Sean off at the video arcade and lectures his son on proper hygiene in public restrooms, \\"You should wash your hands first, before you use the urinal. Not after. Your penis isn't dirty. But your hands are.\\" When Sean, \\"the kind of child who sings songs to sick flowers,\\" turns nine years old, his father divorces his mother and marries her best friend. Sean's life blows apart. His mother first invites him to commit suicide with her, then has a \\"vision\\" of salvation that requires packing her Louis Vuitton luggage and traveling the globe, a retinue of multiracial children in tow. Her goal: peace on earth (and a Nobel Prize). Sean meets Indira Gandhi, Helmut Kohl, Menachem Begin, and the pope, hoping each one might come back to San Francisco and persuade his father to rejoin the family.

But what many don't know was that within the White House's walls, the Lincoln's family would soon find itself suffering turmoil mirroring that of the nation he led. Savagely criticized for her extravagance by the American public and widely distrusted because of her southern roots, first lady Mary Lincoln's increasing instability would deeply strain her marriage and eventually end in her mental collapse. The couple was devastated when eleven-year-old Willie died in the White House of typhoid fever. Tad, the youngest son, remained the family joy despite his physical impairments. Though their son Robert's success at Harvard made his parents proud, his relationship with them was troubled and would result in a painful estrangement, one which would eventually permanently separate him from his mother. The president's assassination brutally crushed Mary's always-fragile spirits. After leaving the White House and following Tad's early death, the former first lady retreated into increasing eccentricity and seclusion until her death in 1882. A moving and poignant portrait of the family life of America's greatest president.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=dTWcAAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Communications Policy and the Public Interest: The Telecommunications Act of 1996","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"How to Invest in Condominiums: The Low-Risk Option for Long-Term Cash Flow","description":"A simple proven method for improving cash flow so you can live rent-free and retire early How to Invest in Condominiums provides a simple, low-risk blueprint for building cash flow by buying and renting out condominiums.

It was a time when Jesus was going to return any day, according to the bestselling book \\"The Late Great Planet Earth\\". It was a time of the Rapture, Armageddon, and the Antichrist. Dave Warnock's faith took root during this intoxicating era, and soon he was speaking in tongues, casting out demons, and praying for legs to grow. That raw, emotional faith grew into a mature Christian lifestyle over the next three and a half decades, including pastoral roles on three different church staffs, where the innocence of Dave's early faith evolved into staff meetings, budgets, and carefully planned worship services. Dave's spiritual journey included the sudden loss of friends and loved ones, job losses, and marital struggles. And an increasingly frustrating search for God's involvement. But what if it's not true? What if there's not an active God doing things for His people?

The original 'spatial scenes' provide the foundation for the extension of meaning from the spatial to the more abstract. This analysis articulates an alternative methodology that distinguishes between a conventional meaning and an interpretation produced for understanding the preposition in context, as well as establishing which of several competing senses should be taken as the primary sense. Together, the methodology and framework are sufficiently articulated to generate testable predictions and allow the analysis to be applied to additional prepositions.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=OCMCWSt6aQkC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Pearl Stallion (March Madness) (Harlequin Historical, No 308)","description":"Spearhead of Logistics is a narrative branch history of the U.S. Army's Transportation Corps, first published in 1994 for transportation personnel and reprinted in 2001 for the larger Army community. The Quartermaster Department coordinated transportation support for the Army until World War I revealed the need for a dedicated corps of specialists. The newly established Transportation Corps, however, lasted for only a few years. Its significant utility for coordinating military transportation became again transparent during World War II, and it was resurrected in mid-1942 to meet the unparalleled logistical demands of fighting in distant theaters. Finally becoming a permanent branch in 1950, the Transportation Corps continued to demonstrate its capability of rapidly supporting U.S. Army operations in global theaters over the next fifty years. With useful lessons of high-quality support that validate the necessity of adequate transportation in a viable national defense posture, it is an important resource for those now involved in military transportation and movement for ongoing expeditionary operations. This text should be useful to both officers and noncommissioned officers who can take examples from the past and apply the successful principles to future operations, thus ensuring a continuing legacy of Transportation excellence within Army operations. Additionally, military science students and military historians may be interested in this volume.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ZYLkW5TV2GAC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Object Relations Psychotherapy","description":"\\"Glickauf-Hughes and Wells present a clear and well-organized review of personality development according to object relations theorists. They offer an explanation and critique of each major theorist, note issues on which there is disagreement (along with areas of investigation not fully explored), and present implications for treatment. Concepts are well defined, and one gets the sense of a cohesive body of knowledge (possibly more cohesive than it actually is). Those unfamiliar with object-relations theory will have a good outline; those who know enough to be confused will find some clarification.\\"  Journal of Psychotherapy Practice and Research","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=rhzffB6VtyEC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Shadow City Ghost Hunters Vol. 1: The Mystery of Mapleshade Manor","description":"Involved for over thirty years in the politics of Iraq, Ali A. Allawi was a long-time opposition leader against the Baathist regime. In the post-Saddam years he has held important government positions and participated in crucial national decisions and events. In this book, the former Minister of Defense and Finance draws on his unique personal experience, extensive relationships with members of the main political groups and parties in Iraq, and deep understanding of the history and society of his country to answer the baffling questions that persist about its current crises. What really led the United States to invade Iraq, and why have events failed to unfold as planned? The Occupation of Iraq examines what the United States did and didn't know at the time of the invasion, the reasons for the confused and contradictory policies that were enacted, and the emergence of the Iraqi political class during the difficult transition process. The book tracks the growth of the insurgency and illuminates the complex relationships among Sunnis, Shias, and Kurds. Bringing the discussion forward to the reconfiguration of political forces in 2006, Allawi provides in these pages the clearest view to date of the modern history of Iraq and the invasion that changed its course in unpredicted ways.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Cwc3_TTqYhsC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ella Fitzgerald: The Tale of a Vocal Virtuosa","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Randee","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"THE LITTLE COLONEL'S KNIGHT COMES RIDING","description":"Upon returning to Kentucky from Washington D.C., the Little Colonel and friends find that the boys they grew up with have matured into graceful young men.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=-kVXAAAAYAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Nemesis: Indigo Book One","description":"This first book of the series establishes the setting for the following seven.

Every developed nation in the world at one time went through the transformation from predominantly informal, extralegal ownership to a formal, unified legal property system. In the West we've forgotten that creating this system is also what allowed people everywhere to leverage property into wealth.

Starting with first principles, this book develops the reader s understanding of the rationale behind design practices by illustrating how basic formulae and modeling procedures are derived and used. Simplifies presentation and emphasizes fundamentals, making it easy to apply presented results to your own designs The models, formulae, and methods illustrated in this book cover the crucial electrical, mechanical, and thermal aspects that must be satisfied in transformer design. The text also provides detailed mathematical techniques that enable users to implement these models on a computer. The authors take advantage of the increased availability of electromagnetic 2D and 3D finite element programs, using them to make calculations, especially in conjunction with the impedance boundary method for dealing with eddy current losses in high-permeability materials such as tank walls.

They are missing from the portraits of booming Shanghai, or Beijing. Many of China's underclass live under a feudalistic system unchanged since the fifteenth century. They are truly the voiceless in modern China. They are also, perhaps, the reason that China will not be able to make the great social and economic leap forward, because if it is to leap it must carry the 900 million with it. Chinese journalists Wu Chuntao and Chen Guidi returned to Wu's home province of Anhui, one of China's poorest, to undertake a three-year survey of what had happened to the peasants there, asking the question: Have the peasants been betrayed by the revolution undertaken in their name by Mao and his successors? The result is a brilliant narrative of life among the 900 million, and a vivid portrait of the petty dictators that run China's villages and counties and the consequences of their bullying despotism on the people they administer. Told principally through four dramatic narratives of paricular Anhui people, Will the Boat Sink the Water? gives voice to the unheard masses and looks beneath the gloss of the new China to find the truth of daily life for its vast population of rural poor.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=4sMwENiki7wC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Science of Spirit: Beyond the Bleep","description":"Providing unequivocal Proof of Spirit.

After a wandering, precarious life during which he produced poems, essays, stories, and novels, Walser entered an insane asylum, saying,  I am not here to write, but to be mad.  Many of the unpublished works he left were in fact written in an idiosyncratically abbreviated script that was for years dismissed as an impenetrable private cipher. Fourteen texts from these so-called pencil manuscripts are included in this volume rich evidence that Walser s microscripts, rather than the work of incipient madness, were in actuality the product of desperate genius building a last reserve, and as such, a treasure in modern literature. With a brisk preface and a chronology of Walser s life and work, this collection of fifty translations of short prose pieces covers the middle to later years of the writer s oeuvre. It provides unparalleled insight into Walser s creative process, along with a unique opportunity to experience the unfolding of his rare and eccentric gift.

Entirely modern in its data and conclusions, it reveals the surprising sophistication of certain areas of early science, particularly Babylonian mathematics. After a discussion of the number systems used in the ancient Near East (contrasting the Egyptian method of additive computations with unit fractions and Babylonian place values), Dr. Neugebauer covers Babylonian tables for numerical computation, approximations of the square root of 2 (with implications that the Pythagorean Theorem was known more than a thousand years before Pythagoras), Pythagorean numbers, quadratic equations with two unknowns, special cases of logarithms and various other algebraic and geometric cases. Babylonian strength in algebraic and numerical work reveals a level of mathematical development in many aspects comparable to the mathematics of the early Renaissance in Europe. This is in contrast to the relatively primitive Egyptian mathematics. In the realm of astronomy, too, Dr. Neugebauer describes an unexpected sophistication, which is interpreted less as the result of millennia of observations (as used to be the interpretation) than as a competent mathematical apparatus. The transmission of this early science and its further development in Hellenistic times is also described. An Appendix discusses certain aspects of Greek astronomy and the indebtedness of the Copernican system to Ptolemaic and Islamic methods. Dr. Neugebauer has long enjoyed an international reputation as one of the foremost workers in the area of premodern science. Many of his discoveries have revolutionized earlier understandings. In this volume he presents a non-technical survey, with much material unique on this level, which can be read with great profit by all interested in the history of science or history of culture. 14 plates. 52 figures.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=JVhTtVA2zr8C&dq=The+exact+sciences+in+antiquity&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ibsen and Hitler: The Playwright, the Plagiarist, and the Plot for the Third Reich","description":"The author reveals how a series of actions initiated by Hitler align with episodes in three Ibsen scripts, and that Hitler adopted characters as analogs to his own career path.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=_tGpAAAACAAJ&dq=Ibsen+and+Hitler:+The+Playwright,+the+Plagiarist,+and+the+Plot+for+the+Third+Reich&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Maximize Your Memory","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Magnificent Missourian;: The life of Thomas Hart Benton","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Travels With Charley, In Search of America","description":"A collectible 50th anniversary deluxe edition featuring an updated introduction by Jay Parini and first edition cover art and illustrated maps of Steinbeck s route by Don Freeman A Penguin Classic In September 1960, John Steinbeck embarked on a journey across America. He felt that he might have lost touch with the country, with its speech, the smell of its grass and trees, its color and quality of light, the pulse of its people. To reassure himself, he set out on a voyage of rediscovery of the American identity, accompanied by a distinguished French poodle named Charley; and riding in a three-quarter-ton pickup truck named Rocinante. His course took him through almost forty states: northward from Long Island to Maine; through the Midwest to Chicago; onward by way of Minnesota, North Dakota, Montana (with which he fell in love), and Idaho to Seattle, south to San Francisco and his birthplace, Salinas; eastward through the Mojave, New Mexico, Arizona, to the vast hospitality of Texas, to New Orleans and a shocking drama of desegregation; finally, on the last leg, through Alabama, Virginia, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey to New York. Travels with Charley in Search of America is an intimate look at one of America's most beloved writers in the later years of his life a self-portrait of a man who never wrote an explicit autobiography. Written during a time of upheaval and racial tension in the South which Steinbeck witnessed firsthand Travels with Charley is a stunning evocation of America on the eve of a tumultuous decade. This Penguin Classics Deluxe Edition also features French flaps and deckle-edged paper. For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world.

They are the families considered worthy of a listing in the exclusive Green Book a discriminative diary created by the niece of Edith Roosevelt s social secretary. Their aristocratic bloodlines are woven into the very fabric of Washington generation after generation. Their old money and manner lurk through the cobblestone streets of Georgetown, Kalorama, and Capitol Hill. They only socialize within their inner circle, turning a blind eye to those who come and go on the political merry-go-round.

May recognizes tavern talk as a form of social play and symbolic performace within the tavern, as well as an indication of the social problems African Americans confront on a daily basis. Following a long tradition of research on informal gathering places, May's work reveals, though close description and analysis of ethnographic data, how African Americans come to understand the racial dynamics of American society which impact their jobs, entertainment particularly television programs and their social interactions with peers, employers, and others. Talking at Trena's provides a window into the laughs, complaints, experiences, and strategies which Trena's regulars share for managing daily life outside the safety and comfort of the tavern.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=F3QVCgAAQBAJ&dq=Talking+at+Trena%27s:+Everyday+Conversations+at+an+African+American+Tavern&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Far from the Church Bells: Settlement and Society in an Apulian Town","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Abundance: A Novel of Marie Antoinette","description":"Marie Antoinette was a child of fourteen when her mother, the Empress of Austria, arranged for her to leave her family and her country to become the wife of the fifteen-year-old Dauphin, the future King of France.

She shows her new husband nothing but love and encouragement, though he repeatedly fails to consummate their marriage and in so doing is unable to give what she and the people of France desire most: a child and an heir to the throne. Deeply disappointed and isolated in her own intimate circle, and apart from the social life of the court, she allows herself to remain ignorant of the country's growing economic and political crises, even as poor harvests, bitter winters, war debts, and poverty precipitate rebellion and revenge.

Bogle stumbled upon mutual funds by accident in 1949 as a college student at Princeton. In his junior year, he read a Fortune article about the burgeoning fund industry that sparked his interest, and he wrote his now famous senior thesis about it. What began as an intellectual pursuit would turn into Bogle s life mission. The House That Bogle Built chronicles the years of Bogle s development from college whiz kid into a titan of the mutual fund industry and shareholder advocate highlighting his creation of the Vanguard Group and the Vanguard 500 Index Fund and his frequent battles to shake up the status quo. It takes you through the two decades he spent running Vanguard, until his forced retirement in 1999, and discloses what he thinks about the fund industry today. Bogle has always stood out for his extraordinary talents in math, analysis, management, and investing. But his most noteworthy trait is his most basic: his humanism in an industry not exactly famous for placing people over profit. It s Bogle s dedication to clients  interests above all else that has earned him the reputation as the  conscience  of the investing industry. In his ninth decade of life, Bogle is remarkably candid about the role he plays at Vanguard today and about his opinion of Jack Brennan, his successor.  How do you keep Vanguard a place where judgment has at least a fighting chance to triumph over process?  he asks. Skeptical but never defeatist, Bogle maintains a retired-but-active status at the company, keeping a close watch over those now at the helm of Vanguard. The House That Bogle Built reveals one of the investing world s most fascinating and complex figures. A dogged advocate of shareholder democracy, he was a self-confessed  dictator  at Vanguard. A brilliant mathematician, he is more interested in people than numbers. Fiercely competitive, he bemoans the cut-throat approach that drives his industry of choice. Always, though, Bogle places the good of the client before anything else a practice that has become steadily rarer in his business. The House That Bogle Built provides an insightful look at the past, present, and future of one of today s largest industries, through the eyes of one of its most influential pioneer.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=BSDLxqoLNmUC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Old Testament Survey","description":"This second edition of the widely used and highly praised Old Testament Survey revises the original edition and greatly expands its attention to historical and geographical topics.

Although the general strategy of theoretical molecular magnetism has been in place for decades, its performance for extended systems of interacting magnetic units can be very complicated. Professor Boca's book treats the \\"mosaic\\" of the theoretical approaches currently used in the field. This book presents a review of the theoretical concepts of molecular magnetism. The first chapter of the book recapitulates the necessary mathematical background. An overview of macroscopic magnetic properties is then presented. Formulation of magnetic parameters and methods of their calculation are given, followed by a brief summary of magnetic behaviour. The core of the book deals with the temperature dependence of magnetic susceptibility for mononuclear complexes, dimers, and exchange-coupled clusters. This book will be particularly useful for those scientists and students working in the field of molecular magnetism who need to refer to a complete and systematic treatment of the mathematics of magneto-chemical theory.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=W4Ombeaz1t4C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The history of Henry Esmond, esq (The complete works of William Makepeace Thackeray)","description":"This work has been selected by scholars as being culturally important, and is part of the knowledge base of civilization as we know it.

Lilienthal,","description":"ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT BOOKS EVER PUBLSHED, it's the work of a creative genius whose observation, analysis, ingenuity, and daring laid the foundation for the development of aviation! It includes over 100 fascinating drawings, graphs, and diagrams, as well as engineering analyses, and many historic photographs of Lilienthal flying-in the 1890s, as well as a handy index. After a comprehensive scientific study of how birds fly, Lilienthal recognized the superiority of curved wing surfaces, and then developed a theory of flight. From 1891 to 1896 he designed, built, and flew a series of hanggliders, becoming the first man to fly. He made over 2,000 glides-bridging the gap between those who dreamed of flying and those who actually flew. Learning of Lilienthal's tragic fatal gliding accident of August 9, 1896, the Wright Brothers became inspired to investigate \\"the problem of human flight.\\" Moved by his last words, \\"Sacrifices must be made,\\" Lilienthal's work had a tremendous influence on the Wrights, who considered him a hero. They carefully studied his work, developed their own theories and designs, and invented the airplane. WILBUR WRIGHT PRAISES OTTO LILIENTHAL FOR HIS CONTRIBUTIONS TO AVIATION Wilbur wrote this short article about what Otto meant to him, just a few days before he took ill and died of typhoid fever on May 30, 1912. It was published posthumously in the September 1912 issue of The Bulletin of the Aero Club of America. \\"Of all the men who attacked the flying problem in the 19th century, Otto Lilienthal was easily the most important. His greatness appeared in every phase of the problem. No one equaled him in power to draw new recruits to the cause; no one equaled him in fullness and dearness of understanding and the principles of flight; no one did so much to convince the world of the advantages of curved wing surfaces; and no one did so much to transfer the problem of human flight to the open air where it belonged. As a missionary he was wonderful. He presented the cause of human flight to his readers so earnestly, so attractively, and so convincingly that it was difficult for anyone to resist the temptation to make an attempt at it himself, even though his sober judgment and the misfortunes of all predecessors warned him to avoid touching it. If Lilienthal had done nothing more than this, he still would have been one of the greatest contributors to the final success. But he was much more than a missionary. As a scientific investigator, none of his contemporaries was his equal. He set forth the advantages of arched wings in such convincing manner as to make him the real originator of this feature. Others had noted that birds' wings were arched and had speculated on the possibility that an arched wing was superior to an absolutely true plane, but Lilienthal demonstrated the reason why it was better, and changed mere speculation into accepted knowledge. He also devoted an enormous amount of time and patience to experiment with test surfaces for the purpose of determining the best shapes for wings and for the amount of pressures to be obtained at the various angles of incidence. For nearly twenty years, his tables and charts were the best to be found in print. His work in this line alone would have been sufficient to place Lilienthal on the front rank, yet there still remains to be mentioned his greatest contribution to the cause. Lilienthal was the real founder of out-of-door experimenting.\\" --Wilbur Wright It is hoped that repunlishing this great book will give 21st Century people a genuine appreciation of what Otto Lilienthal did for mankind.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=HnZTAAAAMAAJ&dq=Birdflight+as+the+basis+of+aviation%3B:+A+contribution+towards+a+system+of+aviation,+compiled+from+the+results+of+numerous+experiments+made+by+O.+and+G.+Lilienthal,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hadith: A Re-evaluation","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=klcBAAAACAAJ&dq=Hadith:+A+Re-evaluation&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Speeders Guide to Avoiding Tickets","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Mom and Dad and I Are Having a Baby","description":"Told through the voice of the excited big sister, an informative look at how babies come about traces the embryo's development, explains conception, and shows the process of her mother going into labor.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=TjM9NwAACAAJ&dq=Mom+and+Dad+and+I+Are+Having+a+Baby&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Religious freedom in China: policy, administration, and regulation; a research handbook.","description":"\\"This Research Handbook collects, for the first time in English, laws, regulations and major policy pronouncements about religion in China.\\"--Foreword.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=pUlVOQAACAAJ&dq=Religious+freedom+in+China:+policy,+administration,+and+regulation%3B+a+research+handbook.&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sam Loyd and his chess problems","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=oMXMiHP38kEC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A study of Kahlil Gibran, this man from Lebanon","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=nqIeAAAAIAAJ&dq=A+study+of+Kahlil+Gibran,+this+man+from+Lebanon&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Man From the Sea","description":"DigiCat Publishing presents to you this special edition of \\"The Old Man and the Sea\\" by Ernest Hemingway.

James L. Machor explores this question in a provocative analysis of American responses to urbanization in the context of the culture's tendency to valorize nature and the rural world. Although much attention has been paid to American rural-urban relations, Machor focuses on a dimension largely overlooked by those seeking to explain American conceptions of the city. While urban historians and literary critics have explicitly or implicitly emphasized the opposition between urban and rural sensibilities in America, an equally important feature of American thought and writing has been the widespread interest in collapsing that division. Convinced that the native landscape has offered special opportunities, Americans since the age of settlement have sought to build a harmonious urban-pastoral society combining the best of both worlds. Moreover, this goal has gone largely unchallenged in the culture except for the sophisticated responses in the writings of some of America's most eminent literary artists. Pastoral Cities explains the development of urban pastoralism from its origins in the prophetic vision of the New Jerusalem, applied to America in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, through its secularization in the urban planning and reform of the 1800s. Machor critiques the sophisticated treatment of urban pastoralism by writers such as Emerson, Whitman, Hawthorne, Wharton, and James by skillfully by combining cultural analysis with a close reading of urban plans, travel narratives, sermons, and popular novels. The product of this multifaceted approach is an analysis that works to reveal both the strengths and weaknesses of the pastoral ideal as cultural mythology.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=8-lOEIfzr4oC&dq=Pastoral+Cities:+Urban+Ideals+and+the+Symbolic+Landscape+of+America+(History+of+American+Thought+and+Culture)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Rough Guide to the Greek Islands - 5th Edition","description":"The Rough Guide to the Greek Islands is an essential guide to the varied and beautiful archipelagos of the Aegean and Ionian seas.

More exercises (of the kind a student may expect in examination papers) are grouped at the end of each section. The book covers the most important basics of any first course on linear algebra, explaining the algebra of matrices with applications to analytic geometry, systems of linear equations, difference equations and complex numbers. Linear equations are treated via Hermite normal forms which provides a successful and concrete explanation of the notion of linear independence. Another important highlight is the connection between linear mappings and matrices leading to the change of basis theorem which opens the door to the notion of similarity. This new and revised edition features additional exercises and coverage of Cramer's rule (omitted from the first edition). However, it is the new, extra chapter on computer assistance that will be of particular interest to readers: this will take the form of a tutorial on the use of the \\"LinearAlgebra\\" package in MAPLE 7 and will deal with all the aspects of linear algebra developed within the book.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=TubpBwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Miracleman Book Three Olympus","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Feminist Theory: A Philosophical Anthology","description":"Feminist Theory: A Philosophical Anthology addresses seven philosophically significant questions regarding feminism, its central concepts of sex and gender, and the project of centering women s experience.

Not only does it introduce with remarkable clarity the ideas and issues that are the stuff of legal education; it brings alive the anxiety and competiveness--with others and, even more, with oneself--that set the tone in this crucible of character building. Each September, a new crop of students enter Harvard Law School to begin an intense, often grueling, sometimes harrowing year of introduction to the law. Turow's group of One Ls are fresh, bright, ambitious, and more than a little daunting. Even more impressive are the faculty. Will the One Ls survive? Will they excel? Will they make the Law Review, the outward and visible sign of success in this ultra-conservative microcosm? With remarkable insight into both his fellows and himself, Turow leads us through the ups and downs, the small triumphs and tragedies of the year, in an absorbing and thought-provoking narrative that teaches the reader not only about law school and the law but about the human beings who make them what they are. In the new afterword for this edition of One L, the author looks back on law school from the perspective of ten years' work as a lawyer and offers some suggestions for reforming legal education.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=P1MR_E6Sxr0C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Origins of Evening: Poems (National Poetry Series Books)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"30 Day Essentials for Marriage","description":"A daily blueprint for a vibrant marriage, with one inspiring thought and exercise for each day.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=AdgOAAAACAAJ&dq=30+Day+Essentials+for+Marriage&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Camden County, New Jersey: The Making of a Metropolitan Community, 1626-2000","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"We The People's Guide to Bankruptcy: A Do-It-Yourself Plan for Getting Out of Debt","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=4995dz1C_ToC&dq=We+The+People%27s+Guide+to+Bankruptcy:+A+Do-It-Yourself+Plan+for+Getting+Out+of+Debt&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The CERT Guide to System and Network Security Practices","description":"Showing how to improve system and network security, this guide explores the practices and policies of deploying firewalls, securing network servers, securing desktop workstations, intrusion detection, response, and recovery.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Mt5QAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+CERT+Guide+to+System+and+Network+Security+Practices&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dictionary of Hispanic Biography 1","description":"Profiles both prominent and important but less-familiar people who have made significant contributions in their fields","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=RlIUAQAAIAAJ&dq=Dictionary+of+Hispanic+Biography+1&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Test Driven Development: By Example","description":"Write clean code that works with the help of this groundbreaking software method.

Debates about his meaning have deflected attention from his personality, yet his personality is an important key to understanding his theological ideas. This book redresses the balance. Jerome Murphy-O'Connor's disciplined imagination, nourished by a lifetime of research, shapes numerous textual, historical, and archaeological details into a colourful and enjoyable story of which Paul is the flawed but undefeated hero. This chronological narrative offers new insights into Paul's intellectual, emotional, and religious development and puts his travels, mission, and theological ideas into a plausible biographical context. As he changes from an assimilated Jewish teenager in Tarsus to a competitive Pharisee in Jerusalem and then to a driven missionary of Christ, the sometimes contradictory components of Paul's complex personality emerge from the way he interacts with people and problems. His theology was forged in dialogue and becomes more intelligible as our appreciation of his person deepens. In Jerome Murphy-O'Connor's engaging biography, the Apostle comes to life as a complex, intensely human individual.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=NLEGzAnb9RUC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mundo feliz/ Happy World","description":"Street Art.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=8qc-t3pkkVUC&dq=Mundo+feliz/+Happy+World&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Paradigm Volume 1: Segue To An Interlude","description":"Paradigm is a planned and outlined trip into the unknown.

On Easter day, 1939, at Marian Anderson's epochal concert on the Washington Mall, David Strom, a German Jewish  migr  scientist, meets Delia Daley, a young Philadelphia Negro studying to be a singer. Their mutual love of music draws them together, and--against all odds and better judgment--they marry. They vow to raise their children beyond time, beyond identity, steeped in song. But their three children must survive America's brutal here and now. Jonah, Joseph, and Ruth grow up during the Civil Rights era, come of age in the violent 1960s, and live out adulthood in the racially retrenched late century. Jonah, the eldest, \\"whose voice could make heads of state repent,\\" follows a life in his parents' beloved classical music. Ruth, the youngest, chooses a militant activism and repudiates the white culture her brother represents. Joseph, the middle child and the narrator of this generational tale, struggles to remain connected to them both. The Time of Our Singing is a story of self-invention, allegiance, race, cultural ownership, the compromised power of music, and the tangled loops of time that rewrite all belonging.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=_DR5OvGlpWcC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Hand-Me-Down PC: Upgrading and Repairing Personal Computers","description":"Explains PCs and their components in non-technical language, offers advice for troubleshooting and repairing PCs, and includes directions for twenty-five easy upgrades","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=3QMZNAAACAAJ&dq=The+Hand-Me-Down+PC:+Upgrading+and+Repairing+Personal+Computers&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Tales to Tease the Senses","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Manila Bay (Penguin Crime Fiction)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Crayon World","description":"The reader is invited to help Blue and Steve finish coloring the pictures in Crayon World.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=xtcBAAAACAAJ&dq=Crayon+World&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"How to Overcome Snoring: (With warm Fuzzies in Recovery and Ecstasy)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Encouragements for the Emotionally Abused Woman: Wisdom and Hope for Women at Any Stage of Emotional Abuse Recovery","description":"Organized to follow the recovery path, this book is filled with reminders that give women the strength they need to change and grow stronger.

From buffalo hunting to the hub of twentieth-century urban life, this book chronicles the momentous changes in the life of a prominent Plains Indian family over three generations. At the center of the story is Rosebud (1907?92), whose personal recollections, family memoirs, letters, and stories form the basis of this book. Rosebud?s father, Chauncey Yellow Robe, was the son of a Lakota chief and had a traditional childhood until he was sent to the Carlisle Indian School, where he became an advocate for Indian education and citizenship. He was instrumental in planning the 1927 ceremony that brought his daughter into national prominence?an induction of Calvin Coolidge into the Lakota tribe, capped by Rosebud placing a feathered war bonnet on the president?s head. Marjorie Weinberg follows the young woman from Rapid City, South Dakota, to New York City, where she became a noted lecturer and teller of Indian tales (and where her broadcasting career brought her name to the attention of Orson Welles, who may indeed have used her name for his famous sled in Citizen Kane). Reflecting a lifelong interest and a friendship that provided Weinberg access to family archives and a rich reservoir of family oral tradition, The Real Rosebud offers an intimate picture of a century and a half of a remarkable Lakota family.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=uId0XfLwvEEC&dq=The+Real+Rosebud:+The+Triumph+of+a+Lakota+Woman&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Perceptualistics","description":"Richly imagined, these Perceptualistics are woven from the very stuff of fantasy.

Capitalism is again ripping apart & restructuring the world, and nothing will be the same. Not race, not nation, not gender, and certainly not whatever culture you used to have. Now you have outcast groups as diverse as the Aryan Nation and the Queer Nation and the Hip Hop Nation publicly rejecting the right of the u.s. government to rule them. All the building blocks of human culture-race, gender, nation, and especially class-are being transformed under great pressure to embody the spirit of this neo-colonial age. The definitive analysis of postmodern capitalism, the decline of u.s. hegemony, and the need and possibilities for a revolutionary movement of the oppressed to overthrow it all. -bell hooks: Night-Vision was so compelling to me because it has a spirit of militancy which reformist feminism tries to kill because militant feminism is seen as a threat to the liberal bourgeois feminism that just wants to be equal with men.

It was the forty-fifth month of World War II, and by the end of May the Germans were forced to acknowledge defeat and recall almost all of their remaining U-boats from the major traffic lanes of the North Atlantic. At U-Boat Headquarters in Berlin, despondent naval officers spoke of \\"Black May.\\" It was a defeat from which the German U-boat fleet never recovered. Black May is a triumph of scholarship and narrative, an important work of history, and a great sea story. Acclaimed historian Michael Gannon, author of Operation Drumbeat, has done enormous research and produced the most thoroughly documented study ever done of these battles. In his compelling historical saga, the people are as significant as the technical information. Given the strategic importance of the events of May 1943, it is natural to ask, How did Black May happen and why? Who or what was responsible? Were new Allied tactics adopted or new weapons employed? This book answers those questions and many others. Drawing on original documents in German, British, U.S., and Canadian archives, as well as interviews with surviving participants, Gannon describes the exciting sea and air battles, frequently taking the reader inside the U-boats themselves, aboard British warships, onto the decks of torpedoed merchant ships, and into the cockpits of British and U.S. aircraft. Throughout, Gannon tells the Black May story from both the German and Allied perspectives, often using the actual words of captains and crews. Finally, he allows the reader to \\"listen in\\" on secretly recorded conversations of captured U-boat men in POW quarters during that same incredible month, giving intimate and moving access to the thoughts and emotions of seamen that is unparalleled in naval literature. Rarely, if ever, has the U-boat war been presented so accurately, so graphically, and so personally as in Black May.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=DB16C1plLBsC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"From Stamps to Memories- A complete guide to Scrapbooking with Stamps","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=A9Kshx4zIR0C&dq=From+Stamps+to+Memories-+A+complete+guide+to+Scrapbooking+with+Stamps&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Steel Inferno: I SS Panzer Corps In Normandy","description":"The story of Panzer fighters on the European front is vividly told by an American military expert who takes readers inside the stifling World War II-era tanks to show how the Germans resisted the Allied march with skillful tactics and a fierce fighting spirit, counterattacking occasionally with devastating results.

Feynman was all these and more. Perfectly Reasonable Deviations From the Beaten Track--collecting over forty years' worth of Feynman's letters--offers an unprecedented look at the writer and thinker whose scientific mind and lust for life made him a legend in his own time. Containing missives to and from such scientific luminaries as Victor Weisskopf, Stephen Wolfram, James Watson, and Edward Teller, as well as a remarkable selection of letters to and from fans, students, family, and people from around the world eager for Feynman's advice and counsel, Perfectly Reasonable Deviations From the Beaten Track not only illuminates the personal relationships that underwrote the key developments in modern science, but also forms the most intimate look at Feynman yet available. Feynman was a man many felt close to but few really knew, and this collection reveals the full wisdom and private passion of a personality that captivated everyone it touched. Perfectly Reasonable Deviations From the Beaten Track is an eloquent testimony to the virtue of approaching the world with an inquiring eye; it demonstrates the full extent of the Feynman legacy like never before. Edited and with additional commentary by his daughter Michelle, it's a must-read for Feynman fans everywhere, and for anyone seeking to better understand one of the towering figures--and defining personalities--of the twentieth century.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=9wcRtAEACAAJ&dq=Perfectly+Reasonable+Deviations+from+the+Beaten+Track:+Selected+Letters+of+Richard+Feynman&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Debrett's Etiquette & Modern Manners: Correct Behaviour for Every Sphere of Social and Business Life : Dress, Table Manners, Correspondence, Enterta (Debrett's guides)","description":"There is no better time than now for a definitive guide to contemporary civilized living.

John Adams chose the 33-year-old Jefferson to draft the Declaration of Independence largely because of his \\"masterly Pen.\\" The genius of the Declaration and Jefferson's later writings amply confirmed Adams's judgment. Few writers have said so much on so many subjects--and said it so well--as Jefferson. The Quotable Jefferson--the most comprehensive and authoritative book of Jefferson quotations ever published--demonstrates that as does no other book. Drawing primarily on The Papers of Thomas Jefferson, published by Princeton University Press, John Kaminski has carefully collected and cleverly arranged Jefferson's pronouncements on almost 500 subjects, ranging from the profound and public--the Constitution--to the personal and peculiar--cold water bathing. The Quotable Jefferson is the first book to put Jefferson's words in context with a substantial introduction, a chronology of Jefferson's life, the source of each quotation, an appendix identifying Jefferson's correspondents, and a comprehensive index. The main section of Jefferson quotations, which are arranged alphabetically by topic, is followed by three other fascinating sections of quotations: Jefferson on his contemporaries, his contemporaries on him, and Jefferson on himself. This book will delight the casual reader and browser, but it is also a serious and carefully edited reference work.

In the process, Morrison presents a scathing indictment of psychoanalysis and its impact on the study of sexuality. In bold but graceful leaps, Morrison applies his critique to a diversity of examples: subjectivity in Oscar Wilde, the cultural construction and reception of AIDS, the work of Robert Mapplethorpe, the practice of bodybuilding, and the contemporary reception of the sexual politics of fascism. Analytical, witty and astute, The Explanation for Everything will challenge and amuse, establishing Paul Morrison as one of our most exciting cultural critics.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=SvSgBwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"With love, Ann Marie;: Letters for growing up","description":"Diary of a girl chronicling her emotional and physical development from her fourteenth to her eighteenth year.

Visually compelling and always modern, it is the perfect metaphor for man's place in the contemporary world. In this provocative collection of essays, films as diverse as The Man with the Movie Camera, Annie Hall, Street of Crocodiles, Boyz N the Hood, Three Colors Red, and Crash are examined in terms of the relationship between cinema and the changing urban experience in Europe and the United States since the early twentieth century. Peter Jelavich, for example, links the suppression of the creative, liberal Weimar Berlin in the 1931 film Berlin Alexanderplatz to the rise of the Nazi regime and the end of one of the great eras of modernist experimentation in German visual culture; Jessie Labov considers Kieslowski's treatment of the Warsaw housing blok in Dekalog in terms of Solidarity's strategy of resisting totalitarianism in 1980s Poland; Allan Siegel examines the motif of the city in a broad range of American and international cinema to demonstrate how film and society since the 1960s have been driven by the fading of mass political radicalism and the triumph of privatization and capital; Paula Massood uses the socially illuminating theories of Mikhail Bakhtin to examine the representation of the ghetto and urban underclass in recent African-American films such as Menace II Society; and Matthew Gandy examines the focus on disease in Todd Haynes's [Safe] as a metaphor for social and spatial breakdown in contemporary Los Angeles.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=GWBiMuAWq5YC&dq=Screening+the+City&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Charge to glory!","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=UQAJjwEACAAJ&dq=Charge+to+glory!&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Asian Renaissance","description":"An East Asian Renaissance, by a World Bank team led by Chief Economist for East Asia & Pacific, Dr Homi Kharas and Economic Adviser, Dr Indermit Gill is the first comprehensive analysis of the new forces and challenges at play in the region since the Bank's seminal report of 1993, The East Asian Miracle. The report argues that regional flows of goods, finance and technology are helping even smaller East Asian countries reap the benefits of economies of scale and that this regional integration must be encouraged. But it also points out that these measures have to be supported by actions at the domestic level to ease the stresses and strains that rapid economic growth leaves in its wake.

The world is becoming less religious. Since 2007, there has been a pervasive decline in religious belief and most of the world's people now say that God is less important in their lives than they said He was in the quarter century before 2007. The American public showed the most dramatic shift of all. The United States, which for many years stood as a highly religious outlier among the world's high-income countries, now ranks as the 12th least religious country for which data are available. Many factors contributed to this dramatic worldwide shift, but as Inglehart shows, certain ones stand out. For centuries, virtually all major religions encouraged women to stay home and produce as many children as possible; and they sternly discouraged divorce, abortion, homosexuality, contraception, and any other form of sexual behavior not linked with reproduction. These norms were necessary for societies to survive when facing high infant mortality and low life expectancy: societies that didn't instill them tended to die out. Recent technological advances have greatly increased life expectancy and cut infant mortality to a tiny fraction of its historic levels, making these norms no longer necessary for societal survival. These norms require repressing strong natural urges, but, since they present traditional norms as absolute values, most religions strongly resist change. The resulting tension, together with the fact that rising existential security has made people less dependent on religion, opened the way for an exodus from religion. Utilizing a massive global data base, Inglehart analyzes the conditions under which religiosity collapses, and explores its implications for the future.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=NI26zQEACAAJ&dq=Sudden&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"American Art Analog: Volume II 1842-1874","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Cooking TLC: Truly Low Carb Cooking Volume 1","description":"The time has come for a gourmet complement to the extraordinarily popular low carb, high protein diet popularized by Dr. Atkins.

The great politician, agriculturalist, economist, author, and businessman loved and reviled, and finally now revealed. The first full biography of Henry A. Wallace, a visionary intellectual and one of this century's most important and controversial figures. Henry Agard Wallace was a geneticist of international renown, a prolific author, a groundbreaking economist, and a businessman whose company paved the way for a worldwide agricultural revolution. He also held two cabinet posts, served four tumultuous years as America's wartime vice president under FDR, and waged a quixotic campaign for president in 1948. Wallace was a figure of Sphinx-like paradox: a shy man, uncomfortable in the world of politics, who only narrowly missed becoming president of the United States; the scion of prominent Midwestern Republicans and the philosophical voice of New Deal liberalism; loved by millions as the Prophet of the Common Man, and reviled by millions more as a dangerous, misguided radical. John C. Culver and John Hyde have combed through thousands of document pages and family papers, from Wallace's letters and diaries to previously unavailable files sealed within the archives of the Soviet Union.

He reflects that there are ultimately only three philosophies of life and each one is represented by one of these books of the Bible-life is vanity; life is suffering; life is love. In these three books Kreeft shows how we have Dante's great epic The Divine Comedy played out, from Hell to Purgatory to Heaven. But it is an epic played out in our hearts and lives, here and now. Just as there is movement in Dante's epic, so there is movement in these books, from Ecclesiates to Job, from Job to Song of Songs. Love is the final answer to Ecclesiastes' quest, the alternative to vanity, and the true meaning of life.

There, she gives herself a new name George Sand and pursues her dream of becoming a writer, embracing an unconventional and even scandalous lifestyle. Paris in the nineteenth century comes vividly alive, illuminated by the story of the loves, passions, and fierce struggles of a woman who defied the confines of society. Sand s many lovers and friends include Fr d ric Chopin, Gustave Flaubert, Franz Liszt, Eug ne Delacroix, Victor Hugo, Marie Dorval, and Alfred de Musset. As Sand welcomes fame and friendship, she fights to overcome heartbreak and prejudice, failure and loss. Though considered the most gifted genius of her time, she works to reconcile the pain of her childhood, of disturbing relationships with her mother and daughter, and of her intimacies with women and men. Will the life she longs for always be just out of reach a dream?

After some initial hesitation on Jo's part, they became a couple in December 1888, and were separated by Theo's mental breakdown in early October 1890. His death in January 1891 brought their life together to an end. Their correspondence, comprising 101 letters, is kept in the Van Gogh Museum and presents an endearing picture of two young people planning the necessary arrangements for their life together in Paris.

The correspondence also offers a unique picture of the views of a man who played an important role in the Parisian art world of the 1880s. Theo, and his brother Vincent, amassed a great number of works which are now the core of the Van Gogh Museum collection.

Then the authors dive into the actual writing process itself, with tips on setting up a workspace, brainstorming great book ideas, researching the subject you decide on, even speaking with the sorts of kids you hope will eventually read the book. They show you how to create compelling characters and develop them in the manuscript; how to outline and write a plot \\"arc\\" of conflict, change, and resolution; how to master the difficult art of writing dialogue; and how to use active (rather than passive) language to keep your story moving along and interesting to young minds. Or, if you're planning to write a creative nonfiction children's book on a topic such as science, nature, or a historical figure, for example the authors include a chapter on this, too. Ready, set, go... it's time to sit down and write! Once you've finished your book, however, the process has only begun. Now you will refine, submit, and hopefully sell your manuscript. Here again, the authors of Writing Children's Books For Dummies come through for you. They deliver solid advice on hiring an illustrator or not; participating in workshops and conferences to learn the business and hone a story; finding an agent; and, finally, submitting the manuscript to publishers and if you are successful signing a contract. Along the way, the authors also include tips on handling rejection; a quick primer on the various editors in publishing houses (and how they work to make your book its best); and making a plan to publicize the book, including hiring a publicist if necessary. Like all For Dummies? books, Writing Children's Books For Dummies highlights \\"The Part of Tens,\\" which includes the Ten Best Ways to Promote Your Story and More Than Ten Great Sources for Storylines. And the ever-helpful Cheat Sheet includes Tips for Editing your Children's Book Manuscript, Children's Book No-No's, Twelve Commandments for Writing Younger Children's Books, and Tips on Promotion.

Their works are a radical departure from previous art about the Holocaust, which centered on tragic images of victims. Instead, these artists dare to invite the viewer into the world of the perpetrators. The viewer, therefore, faces an unsettling moral dilemma: How is one to react to these menacing and indicting images, drawn from a history that can never be forgotten? The artists represented in Mirroring Evil impel us to examine what these images of Nazism might mean in our lives today. Essays in the catalogue explore themes of moral ambiguity in makers and viewers of art, institutional responsibility in exhibiting controversial artworks, and the complicated issues of representing or even imagining the perpetrators. Entries about the individual artworks discuss in greater depth the artistic, ethical, and historical complexity of the images that the artists dare to engage.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=h6hkQgAACAAJ&dq=Mirroring+Evil:+Nazi+Imagery/Recent+Art&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Object Orientation: Concepts, Analysis & Design, Languages, Databases, Graphical User Interfaces, Standards, 2nd Edition","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"House Beautiful Small Spaces","description":"Make the most of small living spaces Do you live in tight quarters?

Following the completion of a pipeline from the oil field to a marine terminal in the Gulf of Papua south of Kikori in 1992, the Kutubu Petroleum Development Project became the country's first oil producer. The activity accompanying the oil project has dramatically affected life in the Project area, but social change did not begin with the discovery of oil. By the time the pipeline was completed, people living in the Lake Kutubu and Kikori areas had experienced decades of government influence and Christian mission activity. This book offers a picture of daily life in the Project area during 1991 and 1992. Settlement and residence patterns, subsistence, material culture, and exchange, all show a mixture of old and new. A consideration of the changing meanings that objects and customs have for the local people give a sense of contemporary life not only in the Project area but in rural Papua New Guinea in general.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=OFB0AAAAMAAJ&dq=The+people+of+Lake+Kutubu+and+Kikori:+Changing+meanings+of+daily+life&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Boys of Winter: Life and Death in the U.S. Ski Troops During the Second World War","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Magadan","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=nXlBAQAAIAAJ&dq=Magadan&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"George Washington (American Lives: Presidents)","description":"A biography of America's founding father and those on whose land he based the nation's futureGeorge Washington dominates the narrative of the nation's birth, yet American history has largely forgotten what he knew: that the country's fate depended less on grand rhetorical statements of independence and self-governance than on land - Indian land. While other histories have overlooked thecentral importance of Indian power during the country's formative years, Colin G. Calloway here gives Native American leaders their due, revealing the relationship between the man who rose to become the most powerful figure in his country and the Native tribes whose dominion he usurped.In this sweeping new biography, Calloway uses the prism of Washington's life to bring focus to the great Native leaders of his time - Shingas, Tanaghrisson, Bloody Fellow, Joseph Brant, Red Jacket, Little Turtle - and the tribes they represented: the Iroquois Confederacy, Lenape, Miami, Creek,Delaware; in the process, he returns them to their rightful place in the story of America's founding. The Indian World of George Washington spans decades of Native American leaders' interaction with Washington, from his early days as surveyor of Indian lands, to his military career against both theFrench and the British, to his presidency, when he dealt with Native Americans as a head of state would with a foreign power, using every means of diplomacy and persuasion to fulfill the new republic's destiny by appropriating their land. By the end of his life, Washington knew more than anyone elsein America about the frontier and its significance to the future of his country.The Indian World of George Washington offers a fresh portrait of the most revered American and the Native Americans whose story has been only partially told. Calloway's biography invites us to look again at the story of America's beginnings and see the country in a whole new light.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=YyJLDwAAQBAJ&dq=George+Washington+(American+Lives:+Presidents)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Tomar","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Tuned Out","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=8WSMZwEACAAJ&dq=Tuned+Out&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Planet Earth Home","description":"Describes Earth, discussing its position, composition, rotation, moon, and capacity to support life.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=1WCYBAAAQBAJ&dq=Planet+Earth+Home&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Where Judaism Differed: An Inquiry Into the Distinctiveness of Judaism","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=qDYBoQEACAAJ&dq=Where+Judaism+Differed:+An+Inquiry+Into+the+Distinctiveness+of+Judaism&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Robert Herrick Eman Poet Lib #12 (Everyman Poetry)","description":"Volume II breaks new ground by printing the fifty-nine surviving manuscript poems by which Herrick was known for most of his life.

The New York Times, established in 1851, was one of the few newspapers with correspondents on the front lines throughout the Civil War. The Complete Civil War collects articles written about the war from 1861 to 1865, plus select pieces before and after the war and is filled with the action, politics, and personal stories of this monumental event. From the first shot fired at Fort Sumter to the surrender at Appomattox, and from the Battle of Antietam to the Battle of Atlanta, as well as articles on slavery, states rights, the role of women, and profiles of noted heroes such as Ulysses S. Grant and Robert E. Lee, the era comes alive through these daily first-hand accounts. More than 600 of the most crucial and interesting articles from the war?typeset and designed for easy reading?have been hand-selected by editors and Civil War scholars Harold Holzer and Craig Symonds who also provide commentary throughout the book. Illustrated with hundreds of maps, historical photographs, and engravings, this book is a treasure for Civil War and history buffs everywhere. \\"This is a fascinating and riveting look at the most important event in American history as seen through the eyes of an institution that was emerging as the most important newspaper in American history. In these pages, the Civil War seems new and fresh, unfolding day after anxious day, as the fate of the republic hangs in the balance.\\" Ken Burns \\"Serious historians and casual readers alike will find this extraordinary collection of 600 articles and editorials about the Civil War published in The New York Times before and during the war of great value and interest...enough to keep the most assiduous student busy for the next four years of the war's sesquicentennial observations.\\" James McPherson \\"This fascinating work catapults readers back in time, allowing us to live through the Civil War as daily readers of The New York Times, worrying about the outcome of battles, wondering about our generals, debating what to do about slavery, hearing the words that Lincoln spoke, feeling passionate about our politics. Symonds and Holzer have found an ingenious new way to experience the most dramatic event in our nation's history.\\" Doris Kearns Goodwin \\"Harold Holzer and Craig Symonds have included not only every pertinent article from the pages of The Times, but enhanced and illuminated them with editorial commentary that adds context and perspective, making the articles more informative and useful here than they were in the original issues. Nowhere else can readers of today get such an understanding of how readers of 1861-1865 learned of and understood their war.\\" William C Davis","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Q1hpAwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Colusi County Historical Society Wagon Wheels, 1978.

Stark writes engagingly of the nomadic peoples who inhabit the region's valleys and brings to life the stories of the ancient kingdoms of the Middle East, including that of the Lords of Alamut, a band of hashish-eating terrorists whose stronghold in the Elburz Mountains Stark was the first to document for the Royal Geographical Society.

A man persuades his wife to start a family, but her reluctant pregnancy comes with a dreadful side effect. A substitute teacher's curiosity about a veteran teacher's methodology provides her with a lesson she won't soon forget. An affluent, xenophobic lawyer callously kills two immigrants with her car with seeming impunity; a childless couple plays a sadistic game with a neglected juvenile each Halloween. An abusive father, a dating site predator, a neglected concierge, and an obsessed co-worker: they are all among the residents of Rebecca Rowland's universe, and they dwell in the everyday realm of crime and punishment tempered with fixation and madness. There are no vampires, zombies, or magical beings here; no, what lurk in this world are even more terrifying. Once you meet them, you will think twice before turning your back on that seemingly innocuous neighbor or coming to the aid of the helpless damsel in the dark parking lot. These monsters don't lurk under your bed or in the shadows: they are the people you see every day at work, in the supermarket, and in broad daylight. They are the horrors that hide in plain sight, and they will unsettle you more than any supernatural being ever could.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=FRZOuAEACAAJ&dq=Horrors+in+Hiding&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Jaguar (Dual Language)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Remember Me: A Lively Tour of the New American Way of Death","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Carries War (New Windmill)","description":"Adapted from a novel by much-loved childrens' writer","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ExM6PgAACAAJ&dq=Carries+War+(New+Windmill)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Close to Home : A Novel of Suspense","description":"The past returns to haunt Chief Inspector Alan Banks in this harrowing novel of suspense from New York Times bestselling author Peter Robinson.

This powerful novel is set against the background of Italy from 1939 to 1944, from the anxious months before the country entered the war, through the war years, to the allied victory with its trailing wake of anxiety, disappointment, and grief. In the foreground are the members of two families. One is rich, the other is not. In All Our Yesterdays, as in all of Ms. Ginzburg s novels, terrible things happen suicide, murder, air raids, and bombings. But seemingly less overwhelming events, like a family quarrel, adultery, or a deception, are given equal space, as if to say that, to a victim, adultery and air raids can be equally maiming. All Our Yesterdays gives a sharp portrait of a society hungry for change, but betrayed by war. During the period described in the novel, Natalia Ginzburg was married to the writer Leone Ginzburg. Because of his underground activities, he was interned under Mussolini s reign, along with his family, in a restricted area in the Abruzzi. When the Ginzburgs later moved to Rome, Leone was arrested and tortured by the fascists, and killed, leaving Natalia alone to raise her three children.

It is well-known that in Brazil and in the Caribbean area, Negroes do not suffer legal or even major social disabilities on account of color, and that a long history of acceptance and miscegenation has erased the sharp line between white and colored. Professor Tannenbaum, one of our leading authorities on Latin America, asks why there has been such a sharp distinction between the United States and the other parts of the New World into which Negroes were originally brought as slaves. In the legal structure of the United States, the Negro slave became property. There has been little experience with Negro slaves in England, and the ancient and medieval traditions affecting slavery had died out. As property, the slave was without rights to marriage, to children, to the product of his work, or to freedom. In the Iberian peninsula, on the other hand, Negro slaves were common, and the laws affecting them were well developed. Therefore, in the colonies of Spain and Portugal, while the slave was the lowest person in the social order, he was still a human being, with some rights, and some means by which he might achieve freedom. Only the United States made a radical split with the tradition in which all men, even slaves, had certain inalienable rights.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=7hedUCOrWNUC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Vocabulary, spelling, poetry II","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=dCgPRAAACAAJ&dq=Vocabulary,+spelling,+poetry+II&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Chez Nous: Branche Sur le Monde Francophone (Testing Program (Loose & Unbound), Not Text)","description":"Note: If you are purchasing the standalone text or electronic version, MyFrenchLab does not come automatically packaged with the text.

In Christianity, this tension is particularly acute as God is understood to be both omnipotent and benevolent. This tension underlies numerous other questions: about the nature of God, the meaning of human freedom and choice, the concept of divine repentance, the reign of God and supremely, the significance of the incarnation. Dr. Carson brings clear, scholarly insights and finely-honed exegetical skills to this all-pervasive issue, seeing it not so much as a problem to be solved as a framework to be explored. He examines the sovereignty-responsibility themes in the Old Testament, intertestamental literature and in the theology of John's gospel and concludes with a reflection on the theological implications for ministry and mission today.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=gLxKAwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Journal of the Plague Year","description":" The surprise  must-read  for people facing the Covid-19 epidemic.   The Telegraph In 1665 the plague swept through London, claiming over 97,000 lives. Daniel Defoe was just five at the time of the plague, but he later called on his own memories, as well as his writing experience, to create this vivid chronicle of the epidemic and its victims. A Journal (1722) follows Defoe's fictional narrator as he traces the devastating progress of the plague through the streets of London. Here we see a city transformed: some of its streets suspiciously empty, some with crosses on their doors overwhelmingly full of the sounds and smells of human suffering. And every living citizen he meets has a horrifying story that demands to be heard.

Now Parker presents Spenser with a deceptively dangerous and multi-layered case: Someone has been killing racehorses at stables across the south, and the Boston P.I. travels to Georgia to protect the two-year-old destined to become the next Secretariat. When Spenser is approached by Walter Clive, president of Three Fillies Stables, to find out who is threatening his horse Hugger Mugger, he can hardly say no: He's been doing pro bono work for so long his cupboards are just about bare. Disregarding the resentment of the local Georgia law enforcement, Spenser takes the case. Though Clive has hired a separate security firm, he wants someone with Spenser's experience to supervise the operation. Despite a veneer of civility, Spenser encounters tensions beneath the surface southern gentility. The case takes an even more deadly turn when the attacker claims a human victim, and Spenser must revise his impressions of the whole Three Fillies organization--and watch his own back as well. With razor-sharp dialogue, eloquently spare prose, and some of the best supporting characters to grace the printed page, Hugger Mugger is grand entertainment.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=qEiPnkjYy9QC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Successful IT Outsourcing: From Choosing a Provider to Managing the Project (Practitioner Series)","description":"The first book to provide practical guidance on how to get the most from an outsourced IS service and written specifically for IS and IT professionals and not senior business managers.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=t5PzBwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Where's the Fish","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"FAIR TOMORROW.","description":"Motivated by potentially turning Flushing Meadows, literally a land of refuse, into his greatest public park, Robert Moses New York's \\"Master Builder\\" brought the World's Fair to the Big Apple for 1964 and '65. Though considered a financial failure, the 1964-65 World' s Fair was a Sixties flashpoint in areas from politics to pop culture, technology to urban planning, and civil rights to violent crime. In an epic narrative, the New York Times bestseller Tomorrow-Land shows the astonishing pivots taken by New York City, America, and the world during the Fair. It fetched Disney's empire from California and Michelangelo's La Pieta from Europe; and displayed flickers of innovation from Ford, GM, and NASA from undersea and outerspace colonies to personal computers. It housed the controversial work of Warhol (until Governor Rockefeller had it removed); and lured Ken Kesey and the Merry Pranksters. Meanwhile, the Fair and its house band, Guy Lombardo and his Royal Canadians sat in the musical shadows of the Beatles and Bob Dylan, who changed rock-and-roll right there in Queens. And as Southern civil rights efforts turned deadly, and violent protests also occurred in and around the Fair, Harlem-based Malcolm X predicted a frightening future of inner-city racial conflict. World's Fairs have always been collisions of eras, cultures, nations, technologies, ideas, and art. But the trippy, turbulent, Technicolor, Disney, corporate, and often misguided 1964-65 Fair was truly exceptional.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=3vJABAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"On Trying to Teach: The Mind in Correspondence","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The history of the Civil War in America: Comprising a full and impartial account of the origin and progress of the rebellion, of the various naval and ... field, the camp, the hospital, and the cabin","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=iW0FAAAAQAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Relationships Made by God","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Why Men Hate Women","description":"What makes a man like John, in every respect a cultured and charming man, successful in his career and liked by his friends and acquaintances, behave violently towards a woman he says he loves? Is he sick? Is he different from other men? Is it, as he says, Jane's fault? Does she like being beaten? Otherwise why would she go on doing what she knows upsets him? Adam Jukes hopes that by the end of his demanding but gripping book, the reader will be able to answer these questions. Adam Jukes works with men who are abusive and violent to women. In the last five years he has been involved in the London Men's Centre, which offers dedicated programmes to men who are violent. He began working with abusive men as a psychodynamic psychotherapist, but as his work continued he found that the work of feminists in the refuge movement and in the 'speaking bitterness' literature could not be ignored. He integrates these two perspectives in his work. The way in which he presents men in this book will generate distress for those men who experience their masculinity as a burden - for he argues that misogyny, the hatred of women, is an inescapable element in the development of masculinity. But he also shows how the model of misogyny which informs the book is applied to an intervention programme to stop male abusiveness. This is a shocking book. Its thought-provoking view of the issues will be of great interest to mental health professionals and all concerned readers.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=jE1gPgAACAAJ&dq=Why+Men+Hate+Women&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Planet Dog: A Doglopedia","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Queen's Curse (Charmed)","description":"Paige falls in love with the prince of the magical kingdom of Tarsina, and the Charmed try to save his realm from the evil forces which are gathering there.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=HRa0NwAACAAJ&dq=The+Queen%27s+Curse+(Charmed)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Italian Cooking For Dummies (For Dummies (Computer/Tech))","description":"From award-winning, bestselling  queen of Italian cooking  (Chicago Tribune), a culinary bible for anyone looking to master the art of Italian cooking.

(18991984) was the first and is still the most famous photographer to chronicle Paris after dark. Born in Hungary, he came to the French capital in 1924, working first as a journalist and then embracing photography, but it was the Paris of the 1930s that came to form the bedrock of his body of work. Walking the city streets at night, Brassa? discovered a previously unseen world and captured it on camera. He shows us every face and every facet, from tough guys and showgirls to prostitutes and pleasure-seekers, from the bustling caf s and dance halls to the stillness of deserted streets and mist-shrouded monuments. Through his eyes, Paris becomes a world of shadows, in which light, the prerequisite for any photograph, is reduced to dimly lit windows, streetlamps in the fog, or reflections on a rain-soaked pavement. Although firmly rooted in its time and place, Brassa?s night photography is nonetheless timeless in its appeal. Full of beauty, bleakness and insight, these images assure his place among the greatest photographers of the 20th century.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=psoYlAEACAAJ&dq=Brassai&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hot, Throbbing Dykes to Watch Out for","description":"Alison's Bechdel's cartoons are a libidinous commentary on the tsunami of lesbian erotica surging through the culture.

There never was but one Doctor A. W. Chase. The im1nense sale of his former works is evidence that the public demand all that ever came from his prolific and philanthropic pen. There is no man now living, and none dead, whose writings have been so eagerly sought for, and no man, whose whole life was so devoted to the good of others.

His quiet confidence helped shape the civil rights movement, and he inspired generations of young people looking to make a difference  Barack Obama At a time when popular solutions to the educational plight of poor children of color are imposed from the outside national standards, high-stakes tests, charismatic individual saviors the acclaimed Algebra Project and its founder, Robert Moses, offer a vision of school reform based in the power of communities. Begun in 1982, the Algebra Project is transforming math education in twenty-five cities. Founded on the belief that math-science literacy is a prerequisite for full citizenship in society, the Project works with entire communities parents, teachers, and especially students to create a culture of literacy around algebra, a crucial stepping-stone to college math and opportunity. Telling the story of this remarkable program, Robert Moses draws on lessons from the 1960s Southern voter registration he famously helped organize:  Everyone said sharecroppers didn't want to vote. It wasn't until we got them demanding to vote that we got attention. Today, when kids are falling wholesale through the cracks, people say they don't want to learn. We have to get the kids themselves to demand what everyone says they don't want.  We see the Algebra Project organizing community by community. Older kids serve as coaches for younger students and build a self-sustained tradition of leadership. Teachers use innovative techniques. And we see the remarkable success stories of schools like the predominately poor Hart School in Bessemer, Alabama, which outscored the city's middle-class flagship school in just three years. Radical Equations provides a model for anyone looking for a community-based solution to the problems of our disadvantaged schools.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=5h0n7RmXDQ8C&dq=Radical+Equations:+Math+Literacy+and+Civil+Rights&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Red Stag: A Novel","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Russian Fairy Tales","description":"Retells four Russian folk tales: The Firebird, Vassilissa the Fair, Maria Morevna, and The Snow Maiden.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=TcEnAAAAMAAJ&dq=Russian+Fairy+Tales&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Encyclopedia Brown Tracks Them Down","description":"Challenges readers to solve ten mysteries using the same clues as the ten-year-old detective Encyclopedia Brown, with answers given in a separate section.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=YiC_3S40B20C&dq=Encyclopedia+Brown+Tracks+Them+Down&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"GOTHIC TALES","description":"Written in 1934 by Karen Blixen (1885-1962), using the pseudonym Isak Dinesen, \\"Seven Gothic Tales\\" is a collection of short stories set mostly in the nineteenth century and being concerned with aristocracy; breeding and legitimacy; and self-delusion; and combine romantic and supernatural elements with subtle narrative irony.

In this book he convincingly shows that an irreducible minimum of experience underlies the New Testament account of the resurrection, however much of the details of the narrative may be open to objection. He maintains that life after death is part of the Jewish faith experience, and that it is Jesus' messiahship, not his resurrection, which marks the division between Christianity and Judaism. Dr. Lapide quotes Moses Maimonides, the greatest Jewish thinker, in his support: All these matters which refer to Jesus of Nazareth...only served to make the way free for the King Messiah and to prepare the whole world for the worship of God with a united heart.

Eventually he courted her, building nests inside household furniture during mating season and trying to coax her into them.

How would this city and its people recover and what meaning would its story have, for America and the world?

Mahkno and his people were fighting for a society \\"without masters or slaves, with neither rich nor poor.\\" They acted towards that idea by establishing \\"free soviets.\\" Unlike the soviets drained of all significance by the dictatorship of a one-party State, the \\"free soviets\\" became the grassroots organs of a direct democracy - a living embodiment of the free society - until they were betrayed, and smashed, by the Red Army.

Everyone of us knows someone who runs. He is one of the symp-toms of our times from the little man who shoves you out of the way on the street to the go-getter who shoves you out of a job in the office to the Fuehrer who shoves you out of the world. And all of us have stopped to wonder, at some time or another, what it is that makes these people tick. What makes them run? This is the question Schulberg has asked himself, and the answer is the first novel written with the indignation that only a young writer with talent and ideals could concentrate into a manuscript. It is the story of Sammy Glick, the man with a positive genius for being a heel, who runs through New York's East Side, through newspaper ranks and finally through Hollywood, leaving in his wake the wrecked careers of his associates; for this is his tragedy and his chief characteristic his congenital incapacity for friendship. An older and more experienced novelist might have tempered his story and, in so doing, destroyed one of its outstanding qualities. Compromise would mar the portrait of Sammy Glick. Schulberg has etched it in pure vitriol, and dissected his victim with a precision that is almost frightening. When a fragment of this book appeared as a short story in a national magazine, Schulberg was surprised at the number of letters he received from people convinced they knew Sammy Glick's real name. But speculation as to his real identity would be utterly fruitless, for Sammy is a composite picture of a loud and spectacular minority bitterly resented by the many decent and sincere artists who are trying honestly to realize the measureless potentialities of motion pictures. To this group belongs Schulberg himself, who has not only worked as a screen writer since his graduation from Dartmouth College in 1936, but has spent his life, literally, in the heart of the motion-picture colony. In the course of finding out what makes Sammy run (an operation in which the reader is spared none of the grue-some details) Schulberg has poured out everything he has felt about that place. The result is a book which the publishers not only believe to be the most honest ever written about Hollywood, but a penetrating study of one kind of twentieth-century success that is peculiar to no single race of people or walk of life.

It prompts us to trust in the ability we have to use and direct our energies to purify our bodies and minds... so that we can discover and develop our spirituality. Dr Brian Weiss, author of the million copy bestseller Many Lives, Many Masters, has written a very special book to help with the practice of meditation (an audio download is also included to help guide you through the process). Meditation: Achieving Inner Peace and Tranquility in Your Life includes the techniques Dr Weiss uses on his patients for past life regression, many of whom have conquered insomnia, anxiety, phobias, weight issues and disease. Meditation can also lower blood pressure, strengthen the immune system and reduce stress. As Dr Weiss says, 'It all starts by closing our eyes, relaxing our muscles, and slowing down our breathing. Little by little, we ask our minds to block out the clamouring voices that usually bombard it... this means living this moment intensely, letting go and surrendering.'

Lee, as Told in His Own Words and Those of His Contemporaries","description":"Robert E. Lee is well known as a Confederate general and as an educator later in life, but most people are exposed to the same handful of images of one of America s most famous sons. It has been almost seven decades since anyone has attempted a serious study of Lee in photographs, and with Don Hopkins s painstakingly researched and lavishly illustrated Robert E. Lee in War and Peace, the wait is finally over. Dr. Hopkins, a Mississippi surgeon and lifelong student of the Civil War and Southern history with a recent interest in Robert E. Lee s  from life  photographs, scoured manuscript repositories and private collections across the country to locate every known Lee image (61 in all) in existence today. The detailed text accompanying these images provides a sweeping history of Lee s life and a compelling discussion of antique photography, with biographical sketches of all of Lee s known photographers. The importance of information within the photographer s imprint or backmark is emphasized throughout the book. Hopkins offers a substantial amount of previously unknown information about these images, how each came to be, and the mistakes in fact and attribution other authors and writers have made describing photographs of Lee to the reading public. Many of the images in this book are being published for the first time. In addition to a few rare photographs and formats that were uncovered during the research phase of Robert E. Lee in War and Peace, the author offers for the first time definitive and conclusive attribution of the identity of the photographer of the well-known Lee  in the field  images, and reproduces a startling imperial-size photograph of Lee made by Alexander Gardner of Washington, D.C. Students of American history in general and the Civil War in particular, as well as collectors and dealers who deal with Civil War era photography, will find Hopkins s outstanding Robert E. Lee in War and Peace a true contribution to the growing literature on the Civil War. About the Author: Born in the rural South, Donald A.

A later article, 'Islamic Esoterism', has also been included, since it articulates so well the particularities of initiation in Islam by defining the fundamental elements of tasawwuf: shari'ah, tariqah, haqiqah. The first constitutes the necessary fundamental exoteric basis; the second, the Way and its means; the third, the goal or final result. In the other chapters, Gu non expresses with his usual synthetic clarity what tawhid and faqr are, and gives examples of traditional sciences, relating angelology to the Arabic alphabet, and chirology to the science of letters ('ilm al-huruf). A number of book and article reviews give further insights into Islamic cosmology. Some may feel that the essay 'Taoism and Confucianism' here included has little relevance to Sufism and Islam. However, such writers as Toshihiko Izutsu and Sachiko Murata have drawn many parallels between the two traditions. Confucianism, concentrating on social and interpersonal norms, functions as a kind of shari'ah in the context of Chinese religion, while Taoism, like Sufism, is precisely the esoteric Way.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=_MOAfAezJroC&dq=Islamic&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Talking Animals And Other People","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Acknowledged A Man","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=xGA-Bi5Zku0C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Leonardo da Vinci (Leonardo da Vinci, the artist, by Ludwig Goldscheider)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=vIr4zgEACAAJ&dq=Leonardo+da+Vinci+(Leonardo+da+Vinci,+the+artist,+by+Ludwig+Goldscheider)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The way of the bull","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=tHK8PwAACAAJ&dq=The+way+of+the+bull&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"From the American system to mass production, 1800-1932: The development of manufacturing technology in the United States (Studies in industry and society)","description":"David A. Houndshell's widely acclaimed history explores the American \\"genius for mass production\\" and races its origins in the nineteenth-century \\"American system\\" of manufacture. Previous writers on the American system have argued that the technical problems of mass production had been solved by armsmakers before the Civil War. Drawing upon the extensive business and manufacturing records if leading American firms, Hounshell demonstrates that the diffusion of arms production technology was neither as fast now as smooth as had been assumed. Exploring the manufacture of sewing machines and furniture, bicycles and reapers, he shows that both the expression \\"mass production\\" and the technology that lay behind it were developments of the twentieth century, attributable in large part to the Ford Motor Company. Hounshell examines the importance of individuals in the diffusion and development of production technology and the central place of marketing strategy in the success of selected American manufacturers. Whereaas Ford was the seedbed of the assembly line revolution, it was General motors that initiated a new era with its introduction of the annual model change. With the new marketing strategy, the technology of \\"the changeover\\" became of paramount importance. Hounshell chronicles how painfully Ford learned this lesson and recounts how the successful mass production of automobiles led to the establishment of an \\"ethos of mass production,\\" to an era in which propoments of \\"Fordism\\" argued that mass production would solve all of America's social problems.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=9H3tHKUFcfsC&dq=From+the+American+system+to+mass+production,+1800-1932:+The+development+of+manufacturing+technology+in+the+United+States+(Studies+in+industry+and+society)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Give War a Chance: Eyewitness Accounts of Mankind's Struggle Against Tyranny, Injustice and Alcohol-Free Beer","description":"The #1 New York Times bestseller from  one of America s most hilarious and provocative writers . . . a volatile brew of one-liners and vitriol  (Time).

'Georgic' means 'to work the earth', and this poetic guide to country living combines practical wisdom on tending the land with exuberant fantasy and eulogies to the rhythms of nature. It describes hills strewn with wild berries in 'vine-spread autumn'; recommends watching the stars to determine the right time to plant seeds; and gives guidance on making wine and keeping bees. Yet the Georgics also tells of angry gods, bloody battles and a natural world fraught with danger from storms, pests and plagues. Expansive in its scope, lush in its language, this extraordinary work is at once a reflection on the cycles of life, death and rebirth, an argument for the nobility of labour and an impassioned reflection on the Roman Empire of Virgil's times.

K. Prahalad and Venkat Ramaswamy explore why, despite unbounded opportunities for innovation, companies still can't satisfy customers and sustain profitable growth. The explanation for this apparent paradox lies in recognizing the structural changes brought about by the convergence of industries and technologies; ubiquitous connectivity and globalization; and, as a consequence, the evolving role of the consumer from passive recipient to active co-creator of value. Managers need a new framework for value creation. Increasingly, individual customers interact with a network of firms and consumer communities to co-create value. No longer can firms autonomously create value. Neither is value embedded in products and services per se. Products are but an artifact around which compelling individual experiences are created. As a result, the focus of innovation will shift from products and services to experience environments that individuals can interact with to co-construct their own experiences. These personalized co-creation experiences are the source of unique value for consumers and companies alike. In this emerging opportunity space, companies must build new strategic capital a new theory on how to compete. This book presents a detailed view of the new functional, organizational, infrastructure, and governance capabilities that will be required for competing on experiences and co-creating unique value.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=GO8wefdWmLIC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Wild Goose (Michigan Monograph Series in Japanese Studies)","description":"Mori Ogai (18621922), one of the giants of modern Japanese literature, wrote The Wild Goose at the turn of the century. Set in the early 1880s, it was, for contemporary readers, a nostalgic return to a time when the nation was embarking on an era of dramatic change. Ogai s narrator is a middle-aged man reminiscing about an unconsummated affair, dating to his student days, between his classmate and a young woman kept by a moneylender. At a time when writers tended to depict modern, alienated male intellectuals, the characters of The Wild Goose are diverse, including not only students preparing for a privileged intellectual life and members of the plebeian classes who provide services to them, but also a pair of highly developed female characters. The author s sympathetic and penetrating portrayal of the dilemmas and frustrations faced by women in this early period of Japan s modernization makes the story of particular interest to readers today. Ogai was not only a prolific and popular writer, but also a protean figure in early modern Japan: critic, translator, physician, military officer, and eventually Japan s Surgeon General. His rigorous and broad education included the Chinese classics as well as Dutch and German; he gained admittance to the Medical School of Tokyo Imperial University at the age of only fifteen. Once established as a military physician, he was sent to Germany for four years to study aspects of European medicine still unfamiliar to the Japanese.

The Norman s conquering of the known world was a phenomenon unlike anything Europe had seen up to that point in history. They emerged early in the tenth century but had disappeared from world affairs by the mid-thirteenth century. Yet in that time they had conquered England, Ireland, much of Wales and parts of Scotland. They also founded a new Mediterranean kingdom in southern Italy and Sicily, as well as a Crusader state in the Holy Land and in North Africa. Moreover, they had an extraordinary ability to adapt as time and place dictated, taking on the role of Norse invaders to Frankish crusaders, from Byzantine overlords to feudal monarchs. Drawing on archaeological and historical evidence, Trevor Rowley offers a comprehensive picture of the Normans and argues that despite the short time span of Norman ascendancy, it is clear that they were responsible for a permanent cultural and political legacy.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=3NADEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Jane's Warsaw Pact Merchant Ship Recognition Handbook","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Britain and the Great War: 1914-1918","description":"The course of events of the Great War has been told many times, spurred by an endless desire to understand 'the war to end all wars'. However, this book moves beyond military narrative to offer a much fuller analysis of of the conflict's strategic, political, economic, social and cultural impact. Starting with the context and origins of the war, including assasination, misunderstanding and differing national war aims, it then covers the treacherous course of the conflict and its social consequences for both soldiers and civilians, for science and technology, for national politics and for pan-European revolution. The war left a long-term legacy for victors and vanquished alike. It created new frontiers, changed the balance of power and influenced the arts, national memory and political thought. The reach of this acount is global, showing how a conflict among European powers came to involve their colonial empires, and embraced Japan, China, the Ottoman Empire, Latin America and the United States.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=t6SsAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Advanced Mathematical Methods in Science and Engineering","description":"Classroom-tested, Advanced Mathematical Methods in Science and Engineering, Second Edition presents methods of applied mathematics that are particularly suited to address physical problems in science and engineering.

By integrating practical knowledge with social science theory and research, it presents a comprehensive approach to the function, from its legal and ethical principles to the managerial process by which gifts are raised. Territory previously uncharted in the literature is explored, such as the historical and organizational contexts of contemporary practice. Explanations of programs, techniques, and publics introduce a new system for understanding fund raising's major concepts. Unlike efforts in established fields, most of the material represents original scholarship undertaken to produce a first-time text. The book's main purpose is to teach students about fund raising--a high-demand, high-paying occupation that will continue to expand into the 21st century as the need for trained practitioners exceeds the supply. During the last decade, fund-raising education moved into the formal classroom and away from an apprenticeship tradition of senior practitioners mentoring newcomers. Yet until now, there has not been a textbook to support this evolving professionalism. Faculty have been reluctant to define fund raising as an academic subject in the absence of a theory-based teaching resource, and courses usually have been assigned to part-time instructors hired from the practice. This textbook addresses the void. It is designed for graduate and upper-level undergraduate courses dealing with fund raising as a primary or secondary subject. Among its features, each chapter points out research gaps and opportunities--such as problems and theories for master's theses and doctoral dissertations--and ends with a list of suggested readings. The text is appropriate for the diverse academic areas in which fund raising, nonprofit management, and philanthropy are taught, including public administration, management, arts and humanities, education, social work, economics, and sociology. Because of its public relations orientation, it is particularly suited for courses offered in that discipline. Additional audiences are practitioners enrolled in professional development programs; CEOs, trustees, and others interested in self-study; and scholars who need serious literature on the subject. PROFESSIONAL PROMO PIECE COPY..............Recently, the field of fundraising seems to have taken a giant step backward. Rather than conducting principled efforts to support common political, educational, financial, or social causes, the entire process is making headlines as a venue offering opportunities for influence peddling, corruption and self-promotion. The need for a guide to ethical fund-raising management is greater than ever. Effective Fund-Raising Management addresses this need. The most successful fundraisers understand why certain practices are more effective than others. What works in one situation may not work in another similar--but slightly different--situation. That is why theoretical understanding is vital to fundraising professionals. To be an expert practitioner, one must have have enough theoretical understanding to adapt one's practice to a variety of situations. That is the purpose of Effective Fund-Raising Management--to provide the underlying theoretical and conceptual understandings that enable an effective practitioner to become an expert practitioner. Indispensable to fund-raising professionals, this invaluable resource: * reviews the entire scope of the fund-raising profession-- from its historical antecedents to the current legal, ethical, organizational, and theoretical principles underlying its practice today; * provides concise definitions and explanations of the fund-raising process and its position within the field of public relations; * links effective fund-raising practices to ethical considerations; and * examines four of the major methods of fund raising-- annual giving, major gifts, planned giving, and capital campaigns.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Yhqeyfyg47IC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Unlucky in Law","description":"Taking the case of a young man accused of murder and grave robbing, Nina Reilly investigates his claims that he was hired to dig up the grave and had nothing to do with the murder, which may be tied to the murders of the Russian royal family.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=bJGJxltnltkC&dq=Unlucky+in+Law&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Der Kleine Vampir (German Edition)","description":"Tony's exciting friendship with several vampires is complicated when their creepy Cousin Olga comes to visit and pursue a crush on him.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=KvgrAAAACAAJ&dq=Der+Kleine+Vampir+(German+Edition)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ministering to the Physically Sick","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=IKBqAAAAMAAJ&dq=Ministering+to+the+Physically+Sick&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Steel Wheels Rolling: A Personal Journey of Railroad Photography (Masters of Railroad Photography)","description":"Five decades of railroad exploration by J.Parker Lamb is distilled into over 200 stunning black and white photographs with fascinating personal anecdotes and historical notes.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=gZ4OAAAACAAJ&dq=Steel+Wheels+Rolling:+A+Personal+Journey+of+Railroad+Photography+(Masters+of+Railroad+Photography)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sassy: The Face of Courage","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=TUq5GwAACAAJ&dq=Sassy:+The+Face+of+Courage&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Brendan Behan.","description":"Brendan Behan s genius was to strike a chord between critic and common man.

Award-winning poet David Mura s critically acclaimed memoir Turning Japanese chronicles how a year in Japan transformed his sense of self and pulled into sharp focus his complicated inheritance. Mura is a sansei, a third-generation Japanese-American who grew up on baseball and hot dogs in a Chicago suburb where he heard more Yiddish than Japanese. Turning Japanese chronicles his quest for identity with honesty, intelligence, and poetic vision, and it stands as a classic meditation on difference and assimilation and is a valuable window onto a country that has long fascinated our own. Turning Japanese was a New York Times Notable Book and winner of an Oakland PEN Josephine Miles Book Award. This edition includes a new afterword by the author.  A dizzying interior voyage of self-discovery and splintered identity.   Chicago Tribune  There is brilliant writing in this book, observations of Japanese humanity and culture that are subtly different from and more penetrating than what we usually get from Westerners.   The New Yorker  Turning Japanese reads like a fascinating novel you can t put down . . . Mura s story is a universal one, and one that is accessible to everyone, even those whose experience in the U.S. is not that of a person of color.   Asian Week  [Mura] paints a portrait of Japan that is rich and satisfying . . . a refreshingly kindly and tolerant study, a powerful antidote to the venomous anti-Japanese mood that seems, distressingly, to be seizing some corners of the American mind.

Makine, whose work has been compared to that of Balzac, Chekhov, Pasternak, and Proust, brings to a stunning conclusion his epic trilogy that began with Dreams of My Russian Summers and continued with Requiem for a Lost Empire. The novel opens in 1942, in a burning, gutted Stalingrad, where the German and Russian armies are locked in a struggle to the death. Amid these ruins, a French pilot and a nurse, also French, are engaged in a passionate affair that each knows will be hopelessly brief. The pilot, Jacques Dorme, was shot down two years earlier. Imprisoned and sent east to a German POW camp, Dorme made a daring escape and crossed Germany stealthily by night until he arrived in an already devastated Russia, where, having proved his mettle as a pilot, he joined a Russian squadron stationed near Stalingrad. But during the brief time they have together there, the love between Dorme and Alexandra builds and blossoms into a relationship they both know comes but once in a lifetime. Several decades later, the narrator a Russian exiled in France, a war orphan haunted by his dark childhood and obsessively searching for his roots travels back to his native land, where in the icy and treacherous wastelands of Siberia he attempts to discover how his life and that of Jacques Dorme are inextricably intertwined.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=d_tnzt2zvWUC&dq=Earth+and+Sky+of+Jacques+Dorme&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Madrid Codex: New Approaches to Understanding an Ancient Maya Manuscript (Mesoamerican Worlds)","description":"This volume offers new calendrical models and methodologies for reading, dating, and interpreting the general significance of the Madrid Codex. The longest of the surviving Maya codices, this manuscript includes texts and images painted by scribes conversant in Maya hieroglyphic writing, a written means of communication practiced by Maya elites from the second to the fifteenth centuries A.D. Some scholars have recently argued that the Madrid Codex originated in the Pet n region of Guatemala and postdates European contact. The contributors to this volume challenge that view by demonstrating convincingly that it originated in northern Yucat n and was painted in the Pre-Columbian era. In addition, several contributors reveal provocative connections among the Madrid and Borgia group of codices from Central Mexico. Contributors include: Harvey M. Bricker, Victoria R. Bricker, John F. Chuchiak IV, Christine L. Hern ndez, Bryan R. Just, Merideth Paxton, and John Pohl. Additional support for this publication was generously provided by the Eugene M.

For more than two years, a rapist prowled the night streets of the homey, All-American city of Spokane, Washington, terrorizing women, sparking a run on gun stores, and finally causing one newspaper to offer a reward the calls taken by the distinguished managing editor himself, Gordon Coe. In March 1981, luck and inspired police work at last produced an arrest, and Spokane shuddered. The suspect was clean cut and conservative and Gordon Coe s son. For eighteen months, Jack Olsen researched the cases of Fred and Ruth Coe to try to learn not only what happened within that family, but how and why. He interviewed more than 150 people and built up a portrait not only of that extraordinary family, but of the mind of a psychopath. And searching the memories of the women in Fred Coe s life, he unearthed a most horrifying question: What is it like to love and live with a man for years and then discover he is a psychopathic criminal?

With their beautiful 3.75 square-island constantly in the media glare, Palm Beachers protect their impossibly rich society from outside scrutiny with vigilant police, ubiquitous personal security staffs, and screens of tall hedges encircling every mansion. To this bizarre suspicious, exclusive world, New York Times bestselling author Ronald Kessler brought his charm, insight, and award-winning investigative skills, and came to know Palm Beach, its celebrated and powerful residents, and its exotic social rituals as no outside writer ever has. In this colorful, entertaining, and compulsively readable book. Kessler reveals the inside story of Palm Beach society as it moves languidly through the summer months, quickens in the fall, and shifts into frenetic high speed as the season begins in December, peaks in January and February, and continues into April. When unimaginable wealth combines with unlimited leisure time oil an island barely three times the size of New York's Central Park, human foibles and desires, lust and greed, passion and avarice, become magnified and intensified. Like laboratory rats fed growth hormones, the 9,800 Palm Beach residents 87 percent of whom are millionaires exhibit the most outlandish extremes of their breed. To tell the story, Kessler follows four Palm Beachers through the season. These four characters the reigning queen of Palm Beach society, the night manager of Palm Beach's trendiest bar, a gay \\"walker\\" who escorts wealthy women to balls, and a thirty six-year-old gorgeous blonde who says she \\"can't find a guy in Palm Beach\\" know practically everyone on the island and tell what goes on behind the scenes. Interweaving the yarns of these unfor-gettable figures with the lifestyle, history, scandals, lore, and rituals of a unique island of excess, The Season creates a powerful, seamless, juicy narrative that no novelist could dream up.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Pjw7YRg23w0C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Jokes, Riddles and Wisdom","description":"If you have seen other joke and riddle books that called themselves the \\"best\\" or the \\"greatest,\\" but were disappointed because they did not deliver, then fear not.

I have never seen a game I hate so much in which all the children involved are so happy. So begins Under Deadman's Skin, a deceptively simple-and compellingly readable-teachers' tale. Jane Katch, in the tradition of Vivian Paley and Jonathan Kozol, uses her student's own vocabulary and storytelling to set the scene: a class of five-and six-year-olds obsessed with what is to their teacher hatefully violent fantasy play. Katch asks, 'Can I make a place in school for understanding these fantasies, instead of shutting them out?' Over the course of the year she holds group discussions to determine what kind of play creates or calms turmoil; she illustrates (or rather the children illustrate) the phenomenon of very young children needing to make sense of exceptionally violent imagery; and she consults with older grade-school boys who remember what it was like to be obsessed by violence and tell Katch what she can do to help. Katch's classroom journey-one that leads her to rules and limits that keep children secure-is an enabling blueprint for any teacher or parent disturbed by violent children's play.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=qUEi9TnDECIC&dq=Under+Deadman%27s+Skin:+Discovering+the+Meaning+of+Children%27s+Violent+Play&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Guide to Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 Server in the Enterprise","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"How to Form a Nonprofit Corporation: With Forms","description":"\\"Provides background information and step-by-step instructions that nonprofits need to apply for federal 501(c)(3) tax-exempt status and qualify as a public charity with the IRS.

What goal--if any--is the proper end of scientific activity? Is there a legitimating authority that scientists mayclaim? Howserious athreat are the anti-science movements? These questions have long been debated but, as Gerald Holton points out, every era must offer its own responses. This book examines these questions not in the abstract but shows their historic roots and the answers emerging from the scientific and political controversies of this century. Employing the case-study method and the concept of scientific thematathat he has pioneered, Holton displays the broad scope of his insight into the workings of science: from the influence of Ernst Mach on twentiethcentury physicists, biologists, psychologists, and other thinkers to the rhetorical strategies used in the work of Albert Einstein, Niels Bohr, and others; from the bickering between Thomas Jefferson and the U.S. Congress over the proper form of federal sponsorship of scientific research to philosophical debates since Oswald Spengier over whether our scientific knowledge will ever be \\"complete.\\" In a masterful final chapter, Holton scrutinizes the \\"anti-science phenomenon,\\" the increasingly common opposition to science as practiced today. He approaches this contentious issue by examining the world views and political ambitions of the proponents of science as well as those of its opponents-the critics of \\"establishment science\\" (including even those who fear that science threatens to overwhelm the individual in the postmodern world) and the adherents of \\"alternative science\\" (Creationists, New Age \\"healers,\\" astrologers). Through it all runs the thread of the author's deep historical knowledge and his humanistic understanding of science in modern culture. Science and Anti-Science will be of great interest not only to scientists and scholars in the field of science studies but also to educators, policymalcers, and all those who wish to gain a fuller understanding of challenges to and doubts about the role of science in our lives today.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=7JiHiUHrsgsC&dq=Science+and+Anti-Science&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cooperative Breeding in Birds: Long Term Studies of Ecology and Behaviour","description":"This book details the major empirical studies of cooperative breeding birds and explores the diversity of ideas and controversies which have developed in this field.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=HPIJ_DuUkaEC&dq=Cooperative+Breeding+in+Birds:+Long+Term+Studies+of+Ecology+and+Behaviour&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"International Directory of Military Aircraft, 1996/97","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Dame Care","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Self-Liberation Through Seeing With Naked Awareness","description":"A text belonging to the same cycle as The Tibetan Book of the Dead, this instruction on the method of self-liberation presents the essence of Dzogchen, The Great Perfection, regarded in Tibet as the highest and most esoteric teaching of the Buddha.

But first... Our promise: All of our works are complete and unabridged. As with all our titles, we have endeavoured to bring you modern editions of classic works. This work is not a scan, but is a completely digitized and updated version of the original. Unlike, many other publishers of classic works, our publications are easy to read. You won't find illegible, faded, poor quality photocopies here. Neither will you find poorly done OCR versions of those faded scans either with illegible \\"words\\" that contain all kinds of strange characters like ?, %, &, etc. Our publications have all been looked over and corrected by the human eye. We can't promise perfection, but we're sure gonna try! Our goal is to bring you high quality Christian publications at rock bottom prices. At the very beginning, I may as well tell you plainly that I am not going to talk about the topics that are usually regarded as most timely just now. I am not going to talk to you about the gold standard or about unemployment or about the NRA or about the Brain Trust. Possibly some of you may discover that certain things that I may say have a bearing upon those topics, but those topics are not the topics about which I am going to talk. Instead, I am going to talk to you about God, and about an unseen world. May I reasonably expect you to be interested in such very intangible topics as these? There are many persons who say, \\"No.\\" We are living, say these persons, in the midst of a serious emergency. One economic system, they say, seems to have broken down, and another is not quite ready to be put into its place. Everywhere are to be found unemployment and distress, almost everywhere there are wars or rumors of wars. In the midst of such distresses, who, these persons say, could be so heartless as to spend his efforts upon doubtful speculations regarding a life beyond the grave?

In terms of value, the robbery puts previous British capers, such as the Great Train Robbery, in the shade. This was a crime notable for its audacity, carried out by an unlikely crew of players that included a used car salesman, two Albanian casual workers and a roofer. Five men were convicted at the Old Bailey in January 2008, which attracted nationwide media coverage. A sixth man, Paul Allen, was sentenced in October 2009 for his part. Having become close to the Tonbridge gang and the police during three years of research, Sounes relates a classic crime caper in irresistible, almost forensic detail. After the robbery comes the exciting, sometimes comical story of the getaway. Money is found and arrests are made but key characters slip out of the country, and millions of pounds are still missing. HEIST is the definitive account of these compelling events, is wildly entertaining, and a must for all fans of well - written true crime.

Ralph W. McGehee was a patriot, dedicated to the American way of life and the international fight against Communism. Following his graduation with honors from Notre Dame, McGehee was recruited by the Central Intelligence Agency in 1952 and quickly became an able and enthusiastic cold warrior. Stationed in Southeast Asia in the mid-1960s, he worked to stem the Communist tide that was sweeping through the region, first in Thailand and later in Vietnam. But despite his notable successes in reversing enemy influence among the local peasants and villagers, McGehee found himself increasingly alienated from a company culture built on deceit and wholesale manipulation of the truth. While his country was being pulled deeper and deeper into the Vietnam quagmire, McGehee awoke to a chilling reality: The CIA was not a gatherer of actual intelligence to be employed in a legitimate war against dangerous enemies, but a tool of the president s foreign-policy staff designed solely to stifle the truth and fabricate  facts  that supported the agency s often immoral agenda. With courage and candor, Ralph McGehee illuminates the CIA s dark catalog of misdeeds in his stunning, no-holds-barred memoir of a life in the service of deception. Startling, eye-opening, and infuriating, Deadly Deceits is an honest and unflinching insider s look at a toxic government agency that the author cogently argues has no useful purpose and no moral right to exist.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=EOcsBgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ulysses,","description":"This account of several lower class citizens of Dublin describes their activities and tells what some of them were thinking one day in 1904","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=-M81yfXQ2LkC&dq=Ulysses,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Atlas of renal biopsy","description":"This book is intended as a practical bench manual phological abnormalities in renal diseases, and for the hospital pathologist who wishes to have where appropriate these have been illustrated. access to a simple informative account of renal Although the main emphasis is on the pathology, pathology, particularly for the interpretation of the relevant clinical aspects of the conditions cov percutaneous needle biopsy specimens.

She is a great example of perseverance in the face of what appears to be insurmountable hurdles. Her love of country is strong and carries through her joining the military and representing Team USA in the Paralympic Games. A true champion in many ways.  Jackie Joyner Kersee  Melissa s story of strength and courage is not only incredibly moving, it is a must-read for anyone facing any challenge. Clearly her passion for country and sport drives every one of her accomplishments. From a young gymnast like I was, to representing the United States in Paratriathlon, Melissa inspires us all with her story of overcoming unimaginable adversity and what it truly means to be unstoppable.  Shannon Miller Melissa Stockwell has been a restless force of nature from the time she was a little girl speeding around her neighborhood on her bike, to her tumbles and spills as a high-level gymnast and Olympic hopeful, to joining the ROTC in college as an outlet for her patriotism and love of America. After 9/11, she was deployed to Iraq as a commissioned Army officer, where she suffered the injury that would change her life forever. After a long and challenging recovery at Walter Reed Hospital, she exercised her power of choice to channel her energy into competition, winning three Paratriathlon World Championships and medaling at the 2016 Rio Paralympics. Her journey weaves service to her country and the heartache of a painful divorce along with founding a successful nonprofit, launching a career in prosthetics, finding new love, and becoming a mother to two children.

The sequel, The Unicorn Project, is coming Nov 26***  Every person involved in a failed IT project should be forced to read this book.  TIM O REILLY, Founder & CEO of O Reilly Media  The Phoenix Project is a must read for business and IT executives who are struggling with the growing complexity of IT.  JIM WHITEHURST, President and CEO, Red Hat, Inc. Five years after this sleeper hit took on the world of IT and flipped it on it's head, the 5th Anniversary Edition of The Phoenix Project continues to guide IT in the DevOps revolution. In this newly updated and expanded edition of the bestselling The Phoenix Project, co-author Gene Kim includes a new afterword and a deeper delve into the Three Ways as described in The DevOps Handbook. Bill, an IT manager at Parts Unlimited, has been tasked with taking on a project critical to the future of the business, code named Phoenix Project. But the project is massively over budget and behind schedule. The CEO demands Bill must fix the mess in ninety days or else Bill's entire department will be outsourced. With the help of a prospective board member and his mysterious philosophy of The Three Ways, Bill starts to see that IT work has more in common with a manufacturing plant work than he ever imagined. With the clock ticking, Bill must organize work flow streamline interdepartmental communications, and effectively serve the other business functions at Parts Unlimited. In a fast-paced and entertaining style, three luminaries of the DevOps movement deliver a story that anyone who works in IT will recognize. Readers will not only learn how to improve their own IT organizations, they'll never view IT the same way again.  This book is a gripping read that captures brilliantly the dilemmas that face companies which depend on IT, and offers real-world solutions.  JEZ HUMBLE, Co-author of Continuous Delivery, Lean Enterprise, Accelerate, and The DevOps Handbook       I m delighted at how The Phoenix Project has reshaped so many conversations in technology. My goal in writing The Unicorn Project was to explore and reveal the necessary but invisible structures required to make developers (and all engineers) productive, and reveal the devastating effects of technical debt and complexity. I hope this book can create common ground for technology and business leaders to leave the past behind, and co-create a better future together.

David Gilbert arrived at Columbia University just in time for the explosive Sixties. From the early anti-Vietnam War protests to the founding of SDS, from the Columbia Strike to the tragedy of the Townhouse, Gilbert was on the scene: as organizer, theoretician, and above all, activist. He was among the first militants who went underground to build the clandestine resistance to war and racism known as  Weatherman.  And he was among the last to emerge, in captivity, after the disaster of the 1981 Brink s robbery, an attempted expropriation that resulted in four deaths and long prison terms. In this extraordinary memoir, written from the maximum-security prison where he has lived for almost thirty years, Gilbert tells the intensely personal story of his own Long March from liberal to radical to revolutionary. Today a beloved and admired mentor to a new generation of activists, he assesses with rare humor, with an understanding stripped of illusions, and with uncommon candor the errors and advances, terrors and triumphs of the Sixties and beyond. It s a battle that was far from won, but is still not lost: the struggle to build a new world, and the love that drives that effort. A cautionary tale and a how-to as well, Love and Struggle is a book as candid, uncompromising, and humane as its author.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=tbdHEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The good companions (Harper's modern classics)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Knits from the Heart","description":"Knit up speedy gifts for friends, family, charities, and more!

This groundbreaking book addresses the connection between childhood trauma and juvenile delinquency. Trauma and Juvenile Delinquency: Theory, Research, and Interventions begins with two chapters presenting theoretical models of the relationship between trauma and the development/persistence of antisocial behavior. Another chapter addresses trauma-related assessment issues for juveniles, and several chapters present cutting-edge research on various aspects of the relationship between trauma and delinquency. Finally, several chapters focus on theory-based and empirically supported trauma-focused therapeutic interventions for juvenile delinquents. No other single source provides such breadth and depth of coverage on this topic! From the editor:  Disruptive behavior disorders are by far the largest type of mental health referral for children and adolescents, while juvenile crime and violence continue to be major social concerns. Several bodies of literature have converged to suggest that trauma is more than incidental to the problem of juvenile delinquency, it contributes to the problem.  Trauma and Juvenile Delinquency: Theory, Research, and Interventions explores: how trauma relates to conduct disorder the connection between traumatic victimization and oppositional/defiance problems ways to assess PTSD in adolescents how exposure to violence, delinquent activity, and posttraumatic stress symptomatology are related the unique trauma histories of incarcerated girls and the problems they have adjusting to life within the juvenile justice system how to develop group therapy services for incarcerated male juvenile offenders with PTSD This valuable book also examines the effectiveness of EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing) for boys with conduct problems, MASTR (Motivation - Adaptive Skills - Trauma Resolution) for teens with school-related problems, and CPT (Cognitive Processing Therapy) for juvenile delinquents with post-traumatic stress disorder.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=34vFBQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Copyright Handbook: How to Protect & Use Written Works with CDROM with CDROM","description":"A guide to the complicated world of copyright, with detailed examples of what is and is not protected.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=e4RPAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+Copyright+Handbook:+How+to+Protect&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Escape to Zion (Emma Trilogy)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Ship That Rocked The World","description":"Did you ever wonder why so much fantastic music started coming out of Britain in the 60s?

Ken Lawrence profiles Donald Trump, using actual (and often controversial) quotes from the Donald himself. \\"You're fired.\\" Those two words increased Donald Trump's popularity in this country a thousandfold in the spring of 2004. Trump is the dealmaker's dealmaker. His forays into real estate, golf, casinos, and now television have made him one of the most successful people in the world. Often considered brash, arrogant, and outrageous, Trump's views on succeeding--and failing--in life, as well as in business, are depicted in The World According to Trump. Author Ken Lawrence uses Trump's actual words on the art of making the deal. Some quotes may surprise, others may offend, but certainly all are entertaining. * I've had bright people ask me why I talk to porters and maids. . . . Those are the people who make it all work. If they like me, they will work harder and I pay well. * It was a little bit by accident that the term \\"You're fired\\" came about.

Focusing on literature and the visual arts, including cinema, this book suggests a parallelism between fetishism and artistic creativity, based on a poetics of detail, which has been brilliantly exemplified by Flaubert's style. After exploring canonical accounts of fetishism (Marx, Freud, Benjamin), by combining a historicist approach with theoretical speculation, Massimo Fusillo identifies a few interpretive patterns of object fetishism, such as seduction (from Apollonius of Rhodes to Max Oph?ls), memory activation (from Goethe to Louise Bourgeois and Pamuk), and the topos of the animation of the inanimate. Whereas all these patterns are characterized by a projection of emotional values onto objects, modernism highlights a more latent component of object fetishism: the fascination with the alterity of matter, variously inflected by Proust, Woolf, Joyce, Barnes, and Mann. The last turning point in Fusillo's analysis is postmodernism and its obsession with mass media icons-from DeLillo's maximalist frescos and Zadie Smith's reflections on autographs to Palahniuk's porn objects; from pop art to commodity sculpture.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=drktDwAAQBAJ&dq=The+fetish,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Formatting Your Screenplay","description":"In this unique manual, author and screenwriting teacher Reichman discusses all the major elements of an authentic authors script and gives strategies for using each element to maximum effect.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=RdRSPQAACAAJ&dq=Formatting+Your+Screenplay&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Sourcebook on Domestic and International Terrorism: An Analysis of Issues, Organizations, Tactics and Responses","description":"This book contains up-to-date available knowledge about domestic and international terrorism, focusing on important aspects of terrorism of concern to law enforcement in planning appropriate responses.

As the Lewis and Clark Expedition ventured into the territory of a sovereign Native nation, the Salish met the strangers with hospitality and vital provisions while receiving comparatively little in return. ? For the first time, a Native American community offers an in-depth examination of the events and historical significance of its encounter with the Lewis and Clark Expedition. The Salish People and the Lewis and Clark Expedition is a startling departure from previous accounts of the Lewis and Clark Expedition. Rather than looking at Indian people within the context of the expedition, it examines the expedition within the context of tribal history. The arrival of non-Indians is therefore framed not as the beginning of the history of Montana or the West but as only a recent chapter in a far longer Native history. The result is a new understanding of the expedition and its place in the wider context of the history of Indian-white relations. ? Based on three decades of research and oral histories, this book presents tribal elders recounting the Salish encounter with Lewis and Clark. Richly illustrated, The Salish People and the Lewis and Clark Expedition not only sheds new light on the meaning of the expedition but also illuminates the people who greeted Lewis and Clark and, despite much of what followed, thrive in their homeland today.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=cbExZ5YqpgwC&dq=The+Salish+People+and+the+Lewis+and+Clark+Expedition&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The practice of management","description":"This classic volume achieves a remarkable width of appeal without sacrificing scientific accuracy or depth of analysis.

Recently, blind source separation by ICA has received considerable attention because of its potential signal-processing applications such as speech enhancement systems, telecommunications, medical signal-processing and several data mining issues. This book presents theories and applications of ICA and includes invaluable examples of several real-world applications. Based on theories in probabilistic models, information theory and artificial neural networks, several unsupervised learning algorithms are presented that can perform ICA. The seemingly different theories such as infomax, maximum likelihood estimation, negentropy maximization, nonlinear PCA, Bussgang algorithm and cumulant-based methods are reviewed and put in an information theoretic framework to unify several lines of ICA research. An algorithm is presented that is able to blindly separate mixed signals with sub- and super-Gaussian source distributions. The learning algorithms can be extended to filter systems, which allows the separation of voices recorded in a real environment (cocktail party problem). The ICA algorithm has been successfully applied to many biomedical signal-processing problems such as the analysis of electroencephalographic data and functional magnetic resonance imaging data. ICA applied to images results in independent image components that can be used as features in pattern classification problems such as visual lip-reading and face recognition systems. The ICA algorithm can furthermore be embedded in an expectation maximization framework for unsupervised classification. Independent Component Analysis: Theory and Applications is the first book to successfully address this fairly new and generally applicable method of blind source separation. It is essential reading for researchers and practitioners with an interest in ICA.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=8LHaBwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Aprenda En Su Auto Ingles Nivel DOS CD (Learn in Your Car(r) Series) (Spanish Edition)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=7dMSAQAAMAAJ&dq=Aprenda+En+Su+Auto+Ingles+Nivel+DOS+CD+(Learn+in+Your+Car(r)+Series)+(Spanish+Edition)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Chilling Effect (Lucinda Hayes Mysteries)","description":"Equal parts courtroom drama, intellectual journey, and character study, Chilling Effect is Marianne Wesson's most provocative Lucinda Hayes mystery to date.

Archaeological discoveries over the past century and the dissemination of Moche artifacts to museums around the world have given rise to a widespread and continually increasing fascination with this complex culture, which expressed its beliefs about the human and supernatural worlds through finely crafted ceramic and metal objects of striking realism and visual sophistication. In this standard-setting work, an international, multidisciplinary team of scholars who are at the forefront of Moche research present a state-of-the-art overview of Moche culture. The contributors address various issues of Moche society, religion, and material culture based on multiple lines of evidence and methodologies, including iconographic studies, archaeological investigations, and forensic analyses. Some of the articles present the results of long-term studies of major issues in Moche iconography, while others focus on more specifically defined topics such as site studies, the influence of El Ni?o/Southern Oscillation on Moche society, the nature of Moche warfare and sacrifice, and the role of Moche visual culture in decoding social and political frameworks.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Jxy55o9k_E0C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater : Or Pearls Before Swine","description":"A lawyer schemes to gain control of a large fortune by having the present claimant declared insane.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=E8TZAAAAMAAJ&dq=God+Bless+You,+Mr.+Rosewater+:+Or+Pearls+Before+Swine&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Two lives of Charlemagne, (Penguin classics, L213)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=gS5RAQAAMAAJ&dq=Two+lives+of+Charlemagne,+(Penguin+classics,+L213)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Modernity and It's Discontents","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"User I.D.","description":"UNIX, UNIX LINUX & UNIX TCL/TK.

Cultivating a relationship to place often includes a negotiating process that involves both science and sensibility. While science is one key part of an adaptive and resilient society, the cultivation of a renewed sense of place and community is essential as well. Science and Sensibility argues for the need for ecology to engage with philosophical values and economic motivations in a political process of negotiation, with the goal of shaping humans' treatment of the natural world. Michael Vincent McGinnis aims to reframe ecology so it might have greater  trans-scientific  awareness of the roles and interactions among multiple stakeholders in socioecological systems, and he also maintains that deep ecological knowledge of specific places will be crucial to supporting a sustainable society. He uses numerous specific case studies from watershed, coastal, and marine habitats to illustrate how place-based ecological negotiation can occur, and how reframing our negotiation process can influence conservation, restoration, and environmental policy in effective ways.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=QUNNCwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Golden Veil","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Cooking with Smitty's Mom","description":"Michael W.
