It's a fine book, but it's not the book that Dickens would have written, had he chosen to do so. For one thing, this book has some curse words in it that Dickens wouldn't have been allowed to use even if he wanted to. But the vulgarities here are appropritate to the characters, so I have no objections to them. Louis Bayard does a fine job of evoking the London of 1860, and I think a lot of people will enjoy this book. But some people may be disappointed that Ebenezer Scrooge has a relatively small part in this book."},{"Title":"Mr. Timothy : A Novel (P.S.)","review":"Tiny Tim grows up amid the slums of London.

Relatively healthy(although his knee still acts up) he has left the suffocating embrace of his Uncle \\"N\\" and is currently employed as a tutor for a local madam who wishes to be able to read. Haunted by memories of his father whose ghost he sees everywhere, Tim is adrift in life lacking direction or focus. His situation changes suddenly when he is confronted with the body of a young girl and then the peril of another. This leads him to combat a societal evil that will prove all too obvious to a 21st century reader, but one whose impact is still horrifying by its mere existence.Tim is unsure of himself but driven to confront the evil placed before him, despite lacking the basic tools to combat it effectively. Teamed with a street urchin of with amazing survival skills and a young girl whose will belies her size and age, Tim Cratchit rises to the occasion and faces his fears, both physical and psychological.. By placing A CHRISTMAS CAROL's characters in a setting more befitting one of Dickens more dramatic works and, in essence, making them more real, Bayard has not truly succeeded in capturing the nature of those characters. It is a decent mystery and one that captures the time well, but the central conceit of having Tiny Tim grow into this \\"lost soul\\" adrift in the world just didn't work for me. I found the future that Bayard has created for Dickens's Cratchit family and the old miser was wanting."},{"Title":"Mr. Timothy : A Novel (P.S.)","review":"One might have wished that the author had used his Christmas Carol background as more than a stepping-off point for a mystery thriller that is occasionally Dickensian in subject matter but scarcely Dickensian in flavor or panache.

I enjoy historical fiction and really enjoy mysteries; it's not often you can find both.\\"The Dutchman\\" takes place in New York City in 1664 when it was called New Amsterdam. The Schout (sheriff) Pieter Tonneman is trying to solve a couple of murders during the time when the people of this \\"small\\" town are also concerned about the invasion of the English. Although one might think a story of this time is dull or stuffy, it is not. It's very interesting. The authors also throw in little known, but interesting facts. For example Wall Street was there from the very beginning, but not as a financial center as we know it now. It literally was a wall used as a protector against invaders. Also it tells about an island close by called Brueckelen, which is now Brooklyn.When I first started looking for this book, it was very hard to find. It was already out of print, although it had been published in 1992. I couldn't find it in bookstores , nor in my library. But now I see it's available in hardback and paperback here on ...

So if you like a mystery that has a little different twist and can find a copy I suggest you try this book out."},{"Title":"The Dutchman","review":"I enjoy history and this historical fiction was terrific.

Meadows has not only established himself as today's prolific author of military thrillers, he has stamped a style that TV producer Donald P. Bellisario loves. His characters have a sense of humor in the midst of dire circumstances. It's a playfulness that Bellisario hires scriptwriters to inject into each of his military TV series-currently JAG and NCIS. In his Joint Task Force series, Meadows develops ongoing characters, whom we meet in each book, depending on their mission or circumstance. We live with them. We feel for them. And they age just like us through the series as their responsibilities and duties draw them into even riskier missions, so we cheer them on, as real men doing impossible jobs. This is an endless expectation of the military since many of their political bosses have no similar experience or training to base their orders on. I saw this for myself on a magazine assignment with Canadian peacekeepers following the Rwanda genocide in 1994. Just the replacement of a small part to keep a lift truck running becomes a crisis that requires miracle intervention and innovative thinking in \`tactical' settings-you can't call them \`combat' when the parties aren't officially at war. And so Meadows' people survive doing the impossible while protecting the United States from terrorists and power-hungry allies.What has fascinated me through the Joint Task Force series is the rivalry with France along with the ongoing battle against terrorism. Most military and spy thrillers writers target potential enemies in Middle East or Asian countries, such as China and North Korea, whereas Meadows tackles a so-called ally. As I observed in Rwanda firsthand, the treachery of France is a realistic possibility.Aside from the background of Meadows' writing, he's a \`top gun' storyteller. In this book, \\"France,\\" he opens with a blood-curdling scene that begins with this dialogue, \\"I know what you're doing.\\" What is the culprit doing? Stealing plans for a laser weapon the U.S. Navy is developing. Who is running the spy? France. Why? Because France wants to shake up the balance of power in the world. Of course, none of this is revealed in the first chapter. The greedy technician kills two fellow workers to keep from being discovered and just as you think he's going to get away with it and live in luxury the rest of his life, he's arrested before he reaches the airport. How did the CIA know what he was up to and why did they wait until after he killed innocent bystanders to capture him? As you find in this example, Meadows holds the reader to every page with strings of suspense that unwind in snippets of revelations, and leaves you at the end with the question, What if France drew the U.S. into war over Africa? Now you can find out. The last of this series, AFRICA, has just been released."},{"Title":"Joint Task Force #3: France","review":"I have become such a fan of this fantastic writer and know if you are a fan of this amazing genre in no-time at all you will become a fan as well!

I started with an earlier one and a later one (AFRICA).JOINT TASK FORCE: FRANCE lives up to the \\"enviable, exciting\\" reputation of the others. I recommend the entire series because this man knows what he's talking about and knows how to build suspense to a fine pitch. I was practically panting with anticipation by the time I got to the last chapter. Great characters, dialogue, and unusual plots.The books in his first series, THE SIXTH FLEET, are MUST READS, also. Whether your \\"man\\" is in the Army, Navy, Marines, or Air Force, these books are for you!

I have always imagined what my family was experiencing on their journey. Linda Crew has made this a 3 dimensional saga. Not only can I hear the voices but can smell the wildflowers and the axel grease, the blood sweat and tears and the alkaline dust to the scent of new calico and old leather. I hear the song \\"Shennandoah\\" with the women's tears and the fireside dances. I see the countless stars of a prarie sky and the sun on the golden locks of a doomed child. I feel the heat of the shadeless terrain and the breaking of hearts and the hope of new life. I taste the bitterness of unimaginal losses, the crunch of an apple after near starvation and the sweetness of a first kiss. This is a book not just for young adults or Oregonians, but for all that seek their dreams of what may come. Thank you Linda, for putting flesh to the bones of my imagination. It was as if I was carried back and met my ancestors face to face, heart to heart."},{"Title":"A Heart for Any Fate","review":"As a 1845 Meek Cut-off descendant and researcher, I found this story not only entirely captivating, but also highly faithful to the time and place when events on this disastrous new route actually occurred. This book is a real tear-jerker, and if you were grabbed by reading about the 1846 Donner Party, you MUST read this book. Linda Crew has a remarkable talent for fitting her romantic novel neatly into a historically accurate true-life tragedy, in which only the heartiest souls survived. You will be enthralled from the moment you start reading about the King family, for whom Benton County's King's Valley is named."},{"Title":"A Heart for Any Fate","review":"Linda Crew has outdone herself with this heartfelt telling of one family's journey to Oregon on the fabled Oregon Trail. While many of the adventures and relationships of the King family told in this wonderful book may perhaps not be historically \\"accurate\\", they resonate with poignancy and truth. Readers of all ages can relate to sibling squabbles, first loves and the loss of someone dear. What may open many readers' eyes are the incredible hardships these pioneers endured, all for the hope of a better life in a better place. Those of us who are now reaping the benefits of their sacrifice should be especially grateful - I know I am. Buy one for yourself and for anyone else who could use a good read!"},{"Title":"A Heart for Any Fate","review":"Gold Star Award Winner!Lovisa King was just seventeen in the spring of 1845 when three generations of her family loaded up the green, canvas-covered wagons to make the two-thousand-mile journey from Missouri to Oregon.Born right in the middle of ten brothers and sisters, Lovisa begins their expedition with dauntless optimism and absolute certainty that her family's superior preparation will protect them from any hardships the Overland Trail may present. Even a last-minute reassignment to her sister Sarah and \\"bossy\\" brother-in-law Rowland Chambers' wagon can't diminish Lovisa's enthusiasm for the future that lies ahead.But the road west is cruel and indiscriminate, leaving a trail of fallen party members in its wake. The entire wagon train faces days of unanswered thirst, weeks of trekking across the barren plains in blistering heat, and storms of prairie sand so acidic that the only remedy is axle grease rubbed into raw skin.As death and disease ravage those she loves, with bone-deep weariness chipping away at Lovisa's soul, she begins to wonder if this expedition really has a terminus and when it does, how many Kings will be left standing when it ends.I'm a huge history buff, especially anything pertaining to the Old West. The problem with a lot of us enamored of these tales, though, is a tendency to romanticize a time and place full of brutal and harsh realities. Linda Crew effortlessly sidesteps this trap to capture Lovisa's story as it might have been. Opening A HEART FOR ANY FATE is a general introduction to the U.S.'s great expansion, circumstances leading up to the citizen's migration, and life along the trail itself.Lovisa and her family are the heart of this story; searching, like so many Americans at the time, for a more prosperous fate in a new land. Ms. Crew did such a wonderful job creating this young woman's voice, I had to continuously remind myself that I wasn't reading an actual account of her experience; although if the truth be told, I was moved to tears more than once during my reading.A HEART FOR ANY FATE is a fascinating and moving depiction that immerses the reader into a defining period of American history and definitely shouldn't be missed.Reviewed by: Cat"},{"Title":"A Heart for Any Fate","review":"I met the author, read the book, and marveled at it's truth.

There is no cohesive narrative and the actual words in the book are relatively few. However, there is still considerable merit in this account of the 1996 Everest tragedy, particularly if you're a woman climber. The author is a serene, spiritual sort and reminds you of that fact every few pages. That didn't represent a problem unless you violently eschew anything of that ilk. She repeats maxims such as, \\"Go slowly, think for yourself, be true to yourself.\\" Hogwash to some, faintly inspiring to others.She paints interesting word portraits of the other climbers, particularly Scott and Anatoly, the Russian climber (who has also written a book, available on Amazon). She's equally adept at explaining her own motivations and psyche. The primary criticism I have is that she spent a paltry amount of time explaining *why* she wanted to climb Everest and really didn't elaborate much on the mental and physical training she undertook in order to accomplish this incredible feat.I recommend this book wholeheartedly, but only if you embrace a more spiritual philosophy, and aren't irritated by an author who shoves that down your throat at every opportunity."},{"Title":"Climbing High: A Woman's Account of Surviving the Everest Tragedy","review":"In 1980, I successfully climbed Mt.

I was not aware of all the work and risks that are taken just to prepare for the final assault. Lene proved herself, showing incredible strength, fortitude and emotion. There must have been such a terrible sense of despair and fear knowing that death was probably inevitable and no help available.Lene gives the reader another perspective of this awesome event, using her professional knowledge as a clinician and writer.

Krakauer's Into Thin Air had too much speculation for my taste. Boukreev in The Climb didn't speculate but instead strictly described what he saw and did with no emotion. Lene Gammelgaard keeps the speculation to a minimum but also describes her feelings at different stages of the climb. Yes, I am sure that this is what it was like. - R.J.

The book is essentially a chronicle of that historic achievement. This is another in the long line of books that deal with the storm of 1996 that wiped out a number of great climbers and their clients. So far so good. The problems start right away for Gammelgaard when she starts to write.The book is written in a disjointed &quot;what I did on my summer vacation&quot; sort of way. There is little attempt at anything remotely resembling prose. Each paragraph is tersely written in a notepad jotting sentence structure. Gammelgaard makes a number of rookie grammatical errors that cry out for editing. For example, &quot;I, myself, have great difficulty...&quot; As Strunk and White would say, who else would I be other than myself. Another goes, &quot;Gonna be fun...&quot;. Even my six-year-old knows that gonna is not a proper word.As if this is not enough, Gammelgaard also throws in a few cheesy existential observations that shed no light on the true motivations of semi-suicidal mountaineers. To wit, &quot;I seek solitude, to connect with inner peace. Tai Chi among the giants of the universe. Belonging. Absolute serenity.&quot; I wonder how much solitude and inner peace Gammelgaard had while performing bodily functions in full view of male expedition members.There is very little to be gained by reading this book other than a personal profile and chronicle of Gammelgaards achievement. The book sheds no further light on the 1996 tragedy. I recommend passing on this one."},{"Title":"Climbing High: A Woman's Account of Surviving the Everest Tragedy","review":"STARRED REVIEW in Publishers Weekly, May 24, 1999Climbing High: A Woman's Account of Surviving the Everest Tragedy Lene Gammelgaard, Seal, $25 (224p) ISBN 1-58005-023-9&quot;Months before Jon Krakauer's Into Thin Air conquered bestseller lists, Gammelgaard, a member of the 1996 Mountain Madness Mt. Everest expedition, wrote an account of the catastrophe that became a bestseller in Denmark and is at last available in English. Those who have followed the controversy surrounding the tragedy will welcome this even-handed version. A lawyer and psychotherapist, Gammelgaard intended to become the first Scandinavian woman to climb Everest. Her physical and mental training for a grueling ascent without oxygen (a publicity stunt that was later aborted) may have saved her life: she climbed quickly and reached the summit early. During the team's descent in the deadly snowstorm, she was also able to trade her full canister of oxygen for a weaker teammate's nearly empty one. Gammelgaard offers keen insights into the motivations and characters of the lead climbers and guides, and frankly discusses the &quot;megalomania&quot; that drove her to risk her life. Dismissing accusations that hers was a glamour expedition for wealthy amateurs, she emphasizes that her co-climbers were accomplished mountaineers and that the high price of admission paid for the best quality food, equipment and support team. Still, she has powerful regrets about the loss of life, confessing, 'I just didn't know how high a price the Mother Goddess of the World would exact to show us humans the consequences of hubris.'&quot; Photos. 7-city author tour. (July)"},{"Title":"Climbing High: A Woman's Account of Surviving the Everest Tragedy","review":"This is yet another perspective of the 1996 Everest tragedy by a survivor of the fiasco. Written in journal style, the author at times frames her thoughts in a staccato, stream of consciousness, rambling fashion, coupled with new age psycho babble. At other times, she intones in a pseudo profound way about Everest. The author comes off as a silly, vapid individual.It is interesting to note that while the author refers to Scott Fischer's expedition (of which she was a member) as an environmental one with a mission to clean up the debris on Everest left by expeditioners, nowhere does she state what it was that those on Scott Fischer's expedition were going to do to ameliorate the mess on the mountain. While she climbs up and down Everest, acclimatizing herself, she does not appear to be doing anything that remotely resembles conservation or clean up.

Yet, she, who had never before climbed Everest, was insisting that she would climb it without oxygen. She was even getting into arguments about it with Scott Fischer, who had the sense to tell her she would be climbing with oxygen. As it turned out, he was right. She could barely make it with oxygen. She should thank her lucky stars that he was so insistent that she climb with oxygen, otherwise she, too, would probably have died on Everest.She also incessantly refers to herself as a mountain climber, but she didn't even know what gear she should take, relying on the recommendations of others, and then criticizing their recommendations when they ran counter to her expectations.

She saw Anatoli as an asset and misunderstood because of his taciturn demeanor. Anatoli comes off very well in this account. In fact, her take on him is much more sympathetic than her take on Scott Fischer, in whom she was apparently disappointed as an expedition leader. I must say if she acted the way she described in her book, then Scott Fischer, who was a true mountaineer, must of been heartily sick of her bravado about climbing Everest without oxygen. Her inflated sense of self is truly staggering at times. When she talks about hubris, she would do well to look no further than her own mirror.Notwithstanding all of this, her account has some merit.

I found Ruth Ann Kocour's &quot;Facing the Extreme&quot; (climbing Denali) much harder to put down. I got rather bored with Ms. Gammelgard's philosophical wanderings. She did seem rather preoccupied with herself at times, but she also displayed compassion for other team mates. I found it interesting that she blamed not being able to climb without oxygen on Scott Fisher, especially since she was always making the point that each person must look out for him or herself. She knew she wanted to climb without oxygen, and she also knew that she needed to properly acclimitize in order to do so. So what stopped her from making sure that she did what was necessary to acclimitize? I am going to read Anatouli Boukreev's &quot;The Climb&quot; to get his perspective. Perhaps he shall shed some light on this. So far, from what I have read, I liked Jon Krakaur's &quot;Into Thin Air&quot; better.

They are two of a kind, sliding over the more complex issues. Lene is obviously a super athlete whose ascent of Everest was quite a physical feat. But she does not address the meaning of Scott's invitation to climb Everest, \\"Let's make it happen and have fun,\\" in the context of his and eight other's deaths making it happen and having fun. She adds little to the controversies that swirl around the events pointing fingers at one or another of leaders or clients for their mistakes or even negligence because leaders wanted to get clients successfully up and down and clients wanted to claim victory. She only mentions Scotts unnecessary trip down which may have contributed to his exhaustion. She says nothing about the assistance rendered to the New York socialite and its possible ramifications or about the ropes not being set above camp III. She does nothing to clarify the lack of designation of an absolute turn back time by Scott. What she does do is exonerate Anatoli Boukreev whom some have accused of failing in his duties by neither using oxygen nor properly attending to the clients. For her, he is the paradigm of a great climber. Her books starts out impressionistically with little homilies about the meaning of life and accomplishing things. This part can easily be skipped. The book gets better when she goes into her inner narrative while climbing. I assume she kept a journal. Her struggles acclimatizing, her fear, and reliance on her past training are all interesting pictures of what it takes in this extreme sport. She does touch upon Beck Weathers', who came back from the dead twice on the mountain, observation that climbing is a way of avoiding other life issues. She wonders how men and women with families can so risk their lives. She gets off on the sociability and fraternity like atmosphere of the camps. But when it comes to the final ascent she is mostly concerned with taking care of herself. In the end she is saved from freezing to death by someone else. I wonder in reading all of these books how much hypoxia on the upper reaches of the mountain clouds everyone's minds making their rendition of the events questionable. I wouldn't recommend this book unless you, like me, are hooked on the madness of mountain climbers.

However, I found Lene's chronicle pretty weak, with little background or insight in the writing. This book was written more like a journal without analysis and should have been billed as such.

I had met her at a local bookstore where she did a slide show presentation and book signing and she is definitely a strong and impressive woman face to face. But I thought her book was poorly written (or poorly translated) and did not convey any of the drama or nail-biting suspense that the others did. Her thoughts jump around from sentence to sentence and never seem to stick together well enough to make what I consider a good read. I'm glad I didn't waste the energy to carry it around with me on my recent Everest trek as I was going to do.

I have never, not never will climb mountains, but I founbd this to be self-indulgent and full of new age psycho-babble.I found her atttitude towards others patronising, especially in an excrutiating couple of exchanges with Boukreev....one where she offers the &quot;poor boy&quot; from Kazakhstan rolls of film, beciuse she is so liberally endowed by her sponsors.In fact the whole book read like one written to satisfy some sponsorship deal. It was lazily written - much barely edited journal writings.Didn't add anything to my knowledge of or voracious interest in Everest and other high peaks, and doesn't capture the &quot;women's experience&quot; as well as, for example, Arlene Blum in &quot;Annapurna&quot;.Am still searching for something terrific by a woman climber on Everest!"},{"Title":"Climbing High: A Woman's Account of Surviving the Everest Tragedy","review":"If you feel you are interested in reading this book I suggest you save your money and wait till you find it at a garge sale for a quarter.

If you've read any of the reports on the tragedy on Mt. Everest in May 1996, it's evident that no one person knows the whole story yet each person on the mountain that day has their own version of what happened. I was hopeful that this book would add an insightful new perspective, but I was immensely disappointed. Lene Gammelgaard's account is nothing but an exercise in self-aggrandizement. She repeatedly suggests that the tragedy was the result of too many amateurs buying their way onto the mountain and putting everyone else in jeopardy. Undoubtedly true, but Gammelgaard is being hypocritical at best. Her silly &quot;spirit of the mountain&quot; claptrap, foolhardy demand that she be allowed to summit without oxygen and lack of familiarity with some of the most basic equipment mark her as one of the same crowd. While &quot;Into Thin Air&quot; may have reflected its authors' biases, at least he was willing to acknowledge that there might be some and to look at his own mistakes that fateful day. Gammelgaard makes no such concessions. I'm glad I read the book just because it gives me a fresh perspective on one of the players, but it's certainly not a favorable one."},{"Title":"Climbing High: A Woman's Account of Surviving the Everest Tragedy","review":"As another woman who has actually reached the summit of Mt.

The book has none of the gripping suspense of Into Thin Air and none of the factual reporting of The Climb.

There's a reason -- it's really a terrible book. Lene Gammelgaard presents herself as a self-absorbed, bitchy, shallow person who really has nothing to say about the people, the climb, or the tragedy. She provides no insights into the &quot;big issues&quot; (e.g., why people climb, the impacts of commercial expeditions and amateur climbers) or the specific events of these expeditions. Where she could offer unique perspectives -- the only living witness of a Fisher-Boukreev conversation that is mentioned in all other books, insights about the climb, return, and &quot;huddle&quot; -- her writing never advances beyond the emotional depth of a fitness trainer. &quot;I know I can do it! &quot; become her one size fits all answer to every situation she encounters. She barely seems to have been aware of the existence of her other team members, who essentially are invisible in the book. Even when she gets her claws out (as when she makes a few bitchy remarks about Sandy Hill Pittman), she doesn't really have anything to say. If Into Thin Air and The Climb still left you interested in Everest, better to move around to the other side of the mountain and buy a &quot;Mallory&quot; book."},{"Title":"Climbing High: A Woman's Account of Surviving the Everest Tragedy","review":"This is yet another perspective of the 1996 Everest tragedy by a survivor of the fiasco.

The author comes off as a silly, vapid individual.It is interesting to note that while the author refers to Scott Fischer's expedition (of which she was a member) as an environmental one with a mission to clean up the debris on Everest left by expeditioners, nowhere does she state what it was that those on Scott Fischer's expedition were going to do to ameliorate the mess on the mountain.

Involved were people from all walks of life who traveled to Nepal from around the world. However, I would say that 80 percent of the book dwells on Ms Gammelgaard and her bubble of &quot;feelings&quot; about her situation, all the while oblivious to events and people around her except inasmuch as they fall within her beam of self-focus.I found her initial insistence on summiting Everest without O's childishly arrogant and irresponsible. Having never topped an &quot;Eight,&quot; it shows Ms. Gammelgaard's lack of judgment to think she could go to the highest of them all without the life-saving supplement. Did she put herself on a par with Scott Fischer (who, by the way, climbed WITH O's that day), Anatoli Boukreev, Ed Viesturs? Apparently so. Fortunately, for both herself and the others, she was persuaded by Boukreev to abandon this folly. This incident is the most salient example of similar frivilous behaviors recounted in a primitive journal style that seems not to have profited from much editing.However, her narrow point of view and poor writing skills can in no way diminish Ms.Gammelgaard's accomplishment which is extraordinary under any circumstance. Unlike others, she was dragged neither up nor down the mountain; she made it under her own steam with little complaint and even sacrificed her oxygen cannister to a struggling climber during the descent.What made this book worth two stars was it's relation to the event. Having read everything else available on the 1996 climb, it is interesting and informative to add yet another point of view. I was disappointed that Ms Gammelgaard's was so limited."},{"Title":"Climbing High: A Woman's Account of Surviving the Everest Tragedy","review":"Of all that has been written about the 1996 Everest tragedy of errors, this is the weakest piece.

She is more sensitive to expedition's leaders than other authors who have written about this tragic event. It is also good to know that she didn't write this book after seeing all the fame that other authors received and try to cash in on this tragic event but in fact she was one of the first writers of the event and was only published later in the US.What is bad about it:I have a lot more bad to say then good. This is a steam of consciousness sort of writing and it just rambles. I am also in awe that this woman would write this way about herself. I don't know if that is bravery, some sort of moral adherence to the truth or if she hasn't figured out that she sounds like a high paying amateur that she complains about.

It is realistic and wonderful. I really understood the tragedy on a deep level and it is thanks to Lene Gammelgaard. Anyone can tell you what people should have done.

This book is about a personal journey Lene undertook and how she prepared for it. I never took from Lene that she thought Scott Fischer needed her on his team. (Other than the publicity of the first Danish woman to climb Mt. Everest and it is clear that there was a lot of thought behind additional clients on the permit and how they, individually, would contribute to publicity for Mountain Madness.)I think she portrayed her relationship with Scott as an understanding and respect of one another's shared passion and growing friendship. It is clear that Scott saw Lene as a capable climber technically, professional, and an asset to the overall social culture on the mountain. If you are an avid climber you know this is important regarding everyone's safety and experience on the mountain. I also enjoyed reading about her taking the time to get to know Anatoli and her representation of him as such a caring and intense man.Climbing High provides insight regarding her personal thoughts in preparing for a mental and physical challenge of this scale. I found her to be a lovely woman who never made harsh judgements, respected the climbers who shared her passion as well as the culture of the Sherpas and the spirit of the mountain. Her account expressing her positive attitude and discipline to achieve a goal that appears out of reach and comes with great risk made me feel as though I was preparing to climb Everest. This discipline can be incorporated into your everyday life - Clearly understanding goals, an understanding of the steps it takes to achieve them, and the passion to never give up.

To think that she thinks Scott Fischer needed to have her on his team in order for the expedition to make it is unreal. She will never be in the same league as true mountaineers like Fischer or Rob Hall. Save your money on this one. I have read almost everything about Mount Everest, and the 1996 tragedy, and this is by far the worst. It will never compare with &quot;Into Thin Air&quot; or &quot;The Climb&quot;.

Okay, perhaps that is a slight exaggeration, but I was pretty tired of Ms. Gammelgaard far before the end of this book. Additionally, her writing style is quite disjointed and distracting. I find it difficult to believe the claim that she has &quot;been a journalist,&quot; unless you understand that to include anyone who has, perhaps, simply kept a journal.If you want to get a feel for being a woman and climbing, better to try Stacy Allison or Ruth Anne Kocour.

And suddenly, you are surrounded by strangers! It's a different world on a mountain. Life is reduced to placing one foot in front of the other and truly living in the moment. Your entire being is challenged. But, often you reap incredible insightful rewards that probably do sound like psychobabble to non-climbers.

Lene doesn't hod back with her emotions in describing her climb, and so gives us a most colorful rendition of what happened.I agree the responsibilities of a wife and kids far outweigh any summit bid, no mater how easy or hard it turns out. Too many risks. Bravado can come at an enormous cost to those on the mountain and thousands of miles away.Lene is more grounded in reality, based on her Tai Chi philosophy. By her calculated risks, she has earned &quot;the most sensible climber on 1996&quot;. Too bad the media hype doesn't reward sensibility rather than sensationalism.I believe Lene and tthe others have been hoding back, giving us short 200 page synopses of their ordeals. Can they be pining for sequels? If so, I'll be in front of the line for her new book."},{"Title":"Climbing High: A Woman's Account of Surviving the Everest Tragedy","review":"This book draws a basic emotional response from the people I know who have read it so far - they either love it or hate it. And an emotional response is precicely what sets this book apart from two others, Into Thin Air and The Climb, written about the same expedition. In Climbing High, Ms. Gammelgaard does not get into the hows or whys, the could haves or should haves, or the blaming and explaining and of the other two. Climbing High isn't a book about the entire Everest expedition and the author doesn't try to tell everyone else's story or relay other people's intentions or motives. It is a tunnel vision book about what it took for one person to reach the summit; about what one person saw and thought and felt and experienced before, during, and after climbing Mt. Everest. I found the author's honesty about herself and her abilities courageous and refreshing. Her description of the physical effort and sheer will required to achieve her personal goal, &quot;to the summit and safe return&quot; didn't leave much to the imagination. Written almost as a journal, this book describes climbing the world's highest mountain while giving the reader a clear and uncompromising view into the soul of a strong and determined single woman. A woman whose achievements speak for themselves."},{"Title":"Climbing High: A Woman's Account of Surviving the Everest Tragedy","review":"I haven't read this book but I've read Krakauer &amp; Boukreev at least 7 times each. It is public knowledge that Lene G. did not pay Mountain Madness the full fee to be guided up the mountain. Ask Karen Dickenson. Maybe that's why Fischer's expedition had few (and inferior) radios. Hopefully LG paid Mountain Madness (after the fact) with the profits from her book. Otherwise she's just a user who used Fischer's good nature to sleaze her way into his expedition. Even if she paid, it's too late. I have zero respect for her. I would like to read her book but I won't buy it."},{"Title":"Climbing High: A Woman's Account of Surviving the Everest Tragedy","review":"As someone who has watched with dismay as rich Yuppies searching for the ultimate \`edge' adventure have been allowed to buy their way into the \\"Everest experience\\", I was quite interested in this personal account by one such adventurer lucky enough to survive one of the most disastrous accidents on the mountain. Based on her narrative, my own conclusion was that most of them simply had no business being that high on a mountain like Everest where there is no room for error, no forgiveness shown, and no way out once things go awry. Still, this young woman is an interesting combination of gung-ho enthusiasm and thoughtful consideration, although one wonders if she had a potential book deal in mind when she bought her way into the \\"adventure' in the first place. After all, there are a lot of sister women out there willing to buy into this pseudo-\\"bought and paid for adventure experience\\" nonsense. Of all things, this book reminds me of the recent pseudo-adventure memoir by Jon Katz, \\"Running To The Mountain\\". At least Jon had the sense to leave the crampons home and settle for a broken down cabin to repair in the Adirondacks.There seem to be two schools of thought in the reviews for this book. The first seems to be a single-minded endorsement of the experience full of the \\"yahoo!\\" Nike-like \\"just do it\\" credo that such hardy denizens of faux-macho tri-athletic events and celebrators of philosophies of personal punishment parading as self-discovery are wont to believe. I trust all of these ardent adventurers have never been to war, and come from backgrounds of affluence and comfort. The search for \\"edge experience\\" appear to be drowning in pools of pathetic self-absorption and petulant self-importance, as these otherwise safe and banal souls seem desperate for the ultimate experience like author Stephen Crane's fabled \\"Red Badge Of Courage\\". Why not just get somebody to take potshots at you? In this sense it seems more an expression of an immature inchoate longing for validation as a worthwhile adult than a native yearn for adventure. Of course, there are exceptions, and as far as I am concerned the author of the book may be one, given her own careful consideration of the risks and the care with which she approached the whole venture.The other predominant school of criticism seems to enthusiastically denigrate the way in which such foolhardy amateurs have deliberately endangered both themselves and their Expedition colleagues by venturing into realms they have no business climbing into. It isn't a coincidence that most of the people expressing these views seem to be both older and more experienced. Those of us who have been deliberately shot at by other human beings who meant us malice and harm rarely find a need to express our sense of adventure afterward. Life has already shown us that aspect of existence, and driving in traffic provides all of the elements of risk taking without any need to backpack into the rugged interior of Nepal. Still, as someone always fascinated by mountaineering and rock climbing, I hail those with the yearning and the willingness to experience their own innate curiosity by venturing up the slope and through the craggy precipices in search of whatever demons as propel them there.My real problem with the book is that like many other such well-organized contrived commercial pseudo-adventures, it allows the wealthy amateurs who can buy into the expedition to stand in the shadows of titans like Tenzing, Hilary, Mallory and Irving who sometimes struggled and even crawled toward the heights with their own hands and feet, often carrying their own provisions, quite unlike these pampered affluent \\"clients\\" who expect to be deferred to and helped by their \\"guides\\", and who seem to expect to be given the experience of reaching the pinnacle on the virtual backs of others because they have \\"paid for it\\". Such ideas and expectations not only vulgarize the quest for excellence into a craven management slogan but also give adventurers a bad name. In that sense, let the disaster on Everest give fair warning. When all else is said and done, man is still just an inconsequential visitor to the roof of the world, an intruder perilously perched on the quicksilver hope for good luck and good weather, and no one is safe if and when Mother Nature suddenly turns [ugly]. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Climbing High: A Woman's Account of Surviving the Everest Tragedy","review":"The book is poorly written with a lot of name dropping and gossipy insinuations. Into Thin Air, Climb, High Exposure are all better written and far more interesting. I think she figures if she refers to the &quot;mother goddess&quot; enough times she can pass the book off as feminist treatise. Lucky for Gammelgaard, she's a better climber than writer, or she'd be just be another fossil on the mountain. Don't waste your money."},{"Title":"Climbing High: A Woman's Account of Surviving the Everest Tragedy","review":"The author came across as a rather selfish and arrogant person, totally self involved. There were enough problems up there on Mt. Everest without Gammelgaard throwing temper tantrums because Scott Fischer wanted her to summit with oxygen. She frequently drew conclusions about other's thoughts and motivations without any basis for these judgements. The writing was boring, choppy, and unedited for grammar. Hopefully, Gammelgaard did get around to paying Mountain Madness the balance of what she owed them. She tried to convince us that she did in fact pay in full. Not true. Frankly, the woman has difficulty in relating the facts with truthfulness. I could never recommend a book this poorly written. She didn't really write about mountain climbing. She wrote more about love of self. Her own self, that is."},{"Title":"Climbing High: A Woman's Account of Surviving the Everest Tragedy","review":"Like many others who have found this book totally self serving, I am one who found Gammelgaard's words introverted to the point of insulting. She is obviously one who captured the summit with a trophy in mind. I also have found no evidence that Scott Fischer's expedition WAS an &quot;environmental expedition,&quot; as it has been called repeatedly. Standing this book next to Jon Krakauer's is like walking on your head, it's pointless. Lene Gammelgaard's main motive was to bag the top and become the &quot;celebrity&quot; she claimed to have become back home. Her writing, though a journal format, is childish and of amateur quality. One would hope a book about the Everest tragedy and the mountain itself, no matter who the author is, would offer a profile on the history of the region or something to make it interesting. Gammelgaard should have done some research to augment her own experience. Yet she simply punched out some weak profound sentences and came up flat. I applaud her for other life experiences and contributions to her homeland's society but as with other climbers in that fateful year, Gammelgaard has done more damage to the sport of climbing than she did good. Apparently she is working on a second book. I suggest she spare us or make it a children's book."},{"Title":"Climbing High: A Woman's Account of Surviving the Everest Tragedy","review":"...it's about being &quot;proud of being the first Danish woman to do so&quot; - this sentence is the whole content of the book. The most dramatic climbing season on the tallest mountain on the planet is nothing but a mere background to the great self esteem drama Gammelgaard is going thru (and sharing with us - in lots of details). Krakauer and Boukreev run circles around this lady, definitely NOT recommended"},{"Title":"Climbing High: A Woman's Account of Surviving the Everest Tragedy","review":"I seem to be the odd person out in that I liked this book. This is not a book that will cause controversy by laying blame on those who survived, or even more unacceptably on those who perished. This is a memoir by a woman who was qualified to be on the mountain. She raised sponsor money to make the attempt possible. She was not someone with more personal wealth than judgment that simply wrote a check for a thrill seeking adventure.Scott Fischer was an extraordinary mountaineer according to any book that I have read. He invited Lene Gammelgaard on the expedition, and also was interested in marketing his company in Europe via this woman's summit attempt. This woman was not a paid journalist; she was not the person who wanted to turn her climb into a media circus with a major American Network. If the expedition had not become a tragedy I doubt most non-climbers would even know her name. This was hardly the case with several others who were on the mountain at the same time. Lene summitted Everest, she survived the storm, she assisted others when they needed help, and she left the mountain with her body intact. One of the reasons for the last note is that she lacked the ego, or stated differently, had the good sense to talk to those who had climbed Everest, to inquire about what was most appropriate to bring, what their on the mountain experience had taught them. Far from being a sign of weakness it is an endorsement of her good judgment. Asking Anatoli Boukreev about the protection he uses for his hands on summit day is the kind of thinking that I would look for in a fellow climber. I would not want to be following those who were lugging satellite phones, computers and other nonsense to make daily appearances on national television.This is a book about her experience from well before she ever stepped on a plane to the Himalaya. It is a very personal book, and her style of writing together with her philosophies of life may not read like a thriller, however the facts of what happened in May of 1996 need no embellishment. To me these are factors that brought her to the top and back down safely. This woman is no thrill seeker, she is not deluded about what an attempt on Everest means, and she shared her experience, she did not write a book embellishing the horror of an event that requires nothing more than a statement of facts. She also refrained from taking apart the conduct of other climbers. She was not shy about expressing her opinion, however she was generally on the mark with her thoughts. And finally, far from taking the Sherpa guides for granted, she repeatedly spoke of them as critical to her success and her survival.For me, this was one of the better books I have read about that tragic May 1996 expedition."},{"Title":"Climbing High: A Woman's Account of Surviving the Everest Tragedy","review":"First of all Lene Gammelgaard is not a writer, that's evident within the first 10 pages. Had she left out the phrases &quot;Sagarmatha Environmental Expedition&quot; and &quot;Sagarmatha, Mother Goddess of the Earth&quot;, the only text left would have been a few pages of self hype and a dozen or so boring pictures pasted between hardcover.What she does manage to do though is pen a pretty convincing and damning indictment of her own involvement in one of the worst mountaineering disasters in history.Several passages in this book lead me to believe that Scott Fischer had bit off more than he could chew by signing up several expedition members of questionable ability. Once he had their money, he didn't or wouldn't say &quot;No&quot; to their plans.She was told &quot;No, she couldn't go.&quot; by the business manager. Was that because they hadn't received her payment? Or was it because they already had enough &quot;inexperienced&quot; climbers signed on?Once into the climb, she seems obsessed in proving that she was a strong climber. Constantly comparing her physical condition with the rest of the team members. Her obsession with going without oxygen wasn't nixed until late into the climb, which also raises questions about Scott Fischer's judgement in leading her to believe she would even be allowed to attempt such an obviously suicidal stunt.Does this &quot;seasoned&quot; mountain climber not own a watch or an altimeter? Not once did she seem to know what time it was nor how high she was. Several documented accounts of the climb have her as one of the last members of Fischer's team to summit on the 10th of May. She doesn't know what time she reached the top. Was it 2:30 or was it 1:30? try after 3:00! Why on earth did it take this, &quot;by her own account&quot;, superbly conditioned climbing machine this long to summit? She was using oxygen and had planned and prepared herself to go without. I wonder.Once getting on the summit, she unpacked sponsor logos and produced a paper with a headline heralding her success. In addition to the impromptu party she threw for herself while on top she also conned a team member into taking off his gloves and snapping a picture. Taking off your gloves at 29,000 feet can cost your fingers. What on earth was she thinking? She obviously wasn't.Read how many times she had to &quot;catch-up&quot; with groups that had left her behind and you begin to understand how terribly slow she moved. What we will never know for sure though is how many lives would have been saved had she been turned around at 1:00, summit or not.At the start of the book she praised herself for &quot;being picked by Scott because of her uncanny ability to make a team function together&quot;. Before the summit bid she announces that this is an &quot;individual&quot; thing, that she can't count on others for help and that they shouldn't count on her. Mountain climbing is just you and the mountain. Her butt would still be on the mountain if the rest of the team thought like she did.If you're looking for a book about mountain climbing adventure, look elsewhere. But if you are looking for more documentation and answers about the May 1996 tragedy on Mt. Everest, you will find several interesting things in this account. Unfortunately you have to put up with someone who is more than a little self absorbed, honking their horn about being the &quot;first Scandinavian woman&quot; to climb Mt. Everest.Lene Gammelgaard obviously doesn't know what responsibility is, and she takes none for the disaster she calls a climb."},{"Title":"Climbing High: A Woman's Account of Surviving the Everest Tragedy","review":"What should have been insightful, educated insight into one the higher accomplishments of a human, turned into a self absorbed effort at self affirmation and ego stroking. Don't waste a nickel on this one."},{"Title":"Climbing High: A Woman's Account of Surviving the Everest Tragedy","review":"After reading Into Thin Air, I have read everything I could get my hands on regarding the 96 Everest tragedy. I have turned into an &quot;Armchair Everest Junkie&quot;. Lene's perspective on her survival was of particular interest to me because I am such a chicken when it comes to taking risks. This book was more about who Lene liked and who she thought little of. There was very little credible information that shed light on what she went through. I found it distasteful that she took shots at those whom she accompanied and collectively staked their lives on the bid for the Everest summit. True, Anatoli was a fine mountaineer and human being but he was the only other person she respected. That pretty much sums up the book!"},{"Title":"Climbing High: A Woman's Account of Surviving the Everest Tragedy","review":"Early on in his classic \\"Into Thin Air\\", Jon Krakauer recounts how his team leader, Rob Hall, was stung when fellow New Zealander and Everest legend Sir Edmund Hillary denounced the business of \\"guided climbs\\" on the mountain. This book tends to reinforce Hillary's point of view. The author was a client on Scott Fischer's team, one of Hall's competitors, and, as dozens of others have observed, it is primarily an exercise in shallow ego gratification, and a poorly wriiten one at that. To be fair, to simply get up Everest, even with Sherpas and guides doing most of the support work, is no mean feat; nonetheless a non-climber like myself has to wonder whether these people are really entitled to claim Everest as a trophy. Her repeated blather about being the \\"first Scandinavian woman\\" on the summit seems banal, I mean, what's next, the first gay Mexican to make the top? And her constant use of phrases like \\"Sagamartha, Mother Goddess of the Earth\\" starts to sound smarmy and condescending, heck, according to Krakauer even the Sherpas mostly refer to it simply as \\"Everest\\".The point is, these guided climbs offer a great opportunity for self-absorbed overachievers to make a name for themselves while in the process diluting the achievements of true experts. After all, if (as of 1996) some 600+ successful ascents had been logged, laymen like myself who aren't a part of the climbing fraternity might easily wonder what's so special about the whole thing. Of course, these expeditions do inject lots of badly needed cash into the Sherpas' economy, nonetheless one is inclined to wonder if the \\"sport\\" of mountaineering wouldn't be better served, as Krakauer himself suggested in passing near the end of his book, by simply banning oxygen from Everest. If nothing else, it would keep the hacks and wannabes off the hill and restore the summit to its status as a place open only to the very best climbers."},{"Title":"Climbing High: A Woman's Account of Surviving the Everest Tragedy","review":"Like several others who have reviewed this book, I found it a total waste of time. I was able to read the entire book in one day and I kept thinking, &quot;it's got to get better,&quot; but it never did. There is no sense of what drives this woman, no personal history in which to &quot;get to know her&quot; and certainly nothing is added to the Everest story, either historically or in the context of the '96 tragedy. I found it shallow and filled with exclamation points that made no point. While I certainly understand and accept the intuitive mind and its differences from a more analytical perspective, this book did little in the way of informing me about the mountain or the author. Instead it seems trite and superficial and filled with pithy statements and insinuations which discredit her perspective. I am, however, thrilled that she made the summit and returned safely and that it fulfilled a personal quest she had. I only wish she hadn't written so poorly about it."},{"Title":"Climbing High: A Woman's Account of Surviving the Everest Tragedy","review":"The disjointed &quot;dispatch&quot; style put me off a little at first, but once you get used to it, this book hums right along. Although her writing is technically not up to par with others who've written about May 1996, Gammelgaard gave this reader a very real sense of how a climber might feel. I simply ignored the psychogibberish (she operates some sort of rehab clinic, so the feel-good inner-god hogwash is to be expected) and the endless references to &quot;Sagamartha, Mother Goddess of the Earth&quot; and enjoyed the book. Of course, I borrowed it from my library, so I might not be as kind if I shelled out real money for it. So pay those overdue fines, and give it a try."},{"Title":"Climbing High: A Woman's Account of Surviving the Everest Tragedy","review":"There's not much to this shallow account of the '96 Everest tragedy. The book features double spacing between paragraphs -- apparently to make it long enough to be considered a book. If you like reprints of the 3-page itinerary that Scott Fisher sent to the author, this book is for you! If you want great writing on these events, read Into Thin Air, which is far superior. The author does very little to add new insight into the tragedy, and in fact the moments that should have been gripping -- when her group was lost on the mountain -- amount to little more than &quot;we yelled at each other for hours to stay awake so we could live through the storm.&quot; This would have made a decent magazine article, but it doesn't amount to a good book."},{"Title":"Climbing High: A Woman's Account of Surviving the Everest Tragedy","review":"i agree with the comments above that this is a self-indulgent, really very marginal book. possibly the translation is not quite what it should be, but gammelgard writes as if she's part of an elite [and she certainly writes as if she considers herself elite] &quot;team&quot; on everest, gunning to run up the peak without oxygen, trying to keep up with legends of climbing like pete shoening and the deceased scott fischer, who was at the time one of the strongest american climbers climbing in the himalaya. gammelgard was a _client_. she was on a guided expedition. i found the arrogant tone of the book fairly sickening. for a much more in-depth look at the behind-the-scenes workings of fischer's expedition, &quot;the climb,&quot; by boukreev and dewalt, though poorly written, is a much better account, and comes across far more honest and humble. and that from a man who had climbed **numerous** 8000-meter peaks, all without oxygen, as a climber, not a client. krakauer's book is still the best and probably final word on everest in '96, and he has some interesting things to say about gammelgard as well...a client climbing everest without oxygen... give me a break."},{"Title":"Climbing High: A Woman's Account of Surviving the Everest Tragedy","review":"Ever since reading Jon Krakauer's 'Into Thin Air' I have been very interested in Mount Everest literature, especially books recounting the events of the 1996 disaster.Lene Gammelgaard was a member of Scott Fischer's Mountain Madness expedition and survived the storm that claimed the lives of Fischer and fellow expedition leader Rob Hall as well as clients Doug Hansen and Yasuko Namba. She was also the first out of the gate with a book recounting her experience.Unfortunately, it's a terrible book. It mostly reads like a series of diary entries. Its main flaw is how self-centered Gammelgaard is. Much of the book is Gammelgaard's internal dialogue concerning her preparations and it's just not compelling reading at all. She's rightly concerned as to whether or not she will make the summit. Who wouldn't be? But that doesn't mean I want to read about these doubts ad infinitum. Also, the book is littered with nonsensical New Age, vaguely Eastern-sounding philosophical gibberish. Sentences such as 'I am responsible for my own serenity.' can be found on just about every page. (I would like to give more examples, but on finishing the book I threw it away.) She frequently refers to and addresses Mount Everest as 'Mother Goddess of the Earth'. (Hint: it's a mountain not some kind of earth spirit.) You get the idea.The other main issue I found was one of pacing. The book is 210 pages long. She doesn't even get to the summit bid until page 160. So she devotes just 50 pages to recount the most critical events of the narrative! She probably should have taken a few more months and gone into some more detail. She barely talks about the people and events of Rob Hall's Adventure Consultants expedition even though the fates of these two groups is forever entwined.I suppose her editor and publisher were eager to be first to market but it comes as the expense of a compelling story. If you are interested in the 1996 Everest disaster read Krakauer's 'Into Thin Air' or Anatoli Boukreev's 'The Climb' but skip this substance-less account."},{"Title":"Climbing High: A Woman's Account of Surviving the Everest Tragedy","review":"I'm surprised @ the negative reviews here. No, you wouldn't count on this book as a sole journalistic exposition of the May 1996 Everest disaster. But after you're devoured \\"Into Thin Air\\" and \\"The Climb\\" Ms. Gamelgaard's book does, in fact, perfect the symmetry of Everest's three faces with a graceful and heartfelt book. It's infinitely more human than anything else I've read on Everest in general. Her reflections and observations provide a dimension missing in other narratives. The book feels feminine compared to the ice-and-steel books on the same expedition. Very highly recommended.You might also want to read \\"Mountain Madness\\" to better understand Scott Fischer (shared ridgeline to Lhotse to extend that metaphor from above)."},{"Title":"Climbing High: A Woman's Account of Surviving the Everest Tragedy","review":"I am a rabid Everest-phile, reading everything I can get my hands on and I've got all the books by the best and brightest to have ever climbed Everest.Lene's book wasn't the worst, certainly not the best. Definitely readable because I looked forward to reading it each night before I fell asleep.The problem with Lene is she is not comfortable in here own skin or life. She has had a laundry list of occupations: sailor, attorney, drug counselor, psychotherapist, journalist and on. I think summitting Everest was supposed to finally make her feel worthy or complete. Of what, I don't know. I don't think she found what validation she sought on Everest either and all she preached about for pages, like a mantra, was \\"must summit, must return safe\\" as if that was the secret to eternal happiness and self-acceptance: summitting Everest!Curiously, she only writes of her small enclave of friends on this ill-fated climb and there were tons of people in Scott Fisher's group and Rob Hall's. Possibly because NOT a lot of people LIKED her. She never mentions Jon Krakauer as if he did not exist on that trip. Maybe because he had a HUGE bestseller and she didn't.I also wonder about the relationship between she and Scott as they had a history of constant mail correspondence and running off to exotic mountains together. She does not delve deep into this.It was a readable book however, and I loved that there was the entire climb itinerary from Base Camp to the final standby at Camp 4. Her narrative was excellent when it came to describing being trapped by the unexpected storm on Everest and what the other climbers were going through.The photos, unfortunately black & white, were quite informative though.If you've read ALL the other books on Everest and are still hungering for more, this is NOT by far the worst of the series, just not the best."},{"Title":"Climbing High: A Woman's Account of Surviving the Everest Tragedy","review":"This book is pooly written - I dont know if this is the author's insistance or some kind of translation error from danish to english, but the style of writing really puts you off.I find it hard to believe that any american publisher's editors did not notice the bad translation, maybe this is just the style of the writing insisted by the author.The book is about the authors trip to everest summit. There is very little substance in the book. This is more a fit for a one page or two page article in a magazine than to be published as a hard bound.After you read Krauker's book, you are bowled over by the style, the research and the facts crammed into it. Even though Krauker may have titled it as a personal narrative, there is no disputing the fact that 'Into Thin air' provides all the information that you may want to know about the expedition, and is essentially a 'History' of the tragedy. This book on the other hand offers zilch.The only saving grace are a couple of photos - one showing the hillary step from the bottom, the other showing the areas of the camp and'the huddle' on South col.

I was sorely disappointed. Perhaps in Denmark people were interested in how she, a female Dane, attempted and summitted Mt. Everest. However, the novelty, for any climber and for most everyone else, of a woman climbing Everest on a guided expedition is nonexistent. After hundreds of ascents of Everest, it approaches absurdity to have the author repeatedly mention that she will be the first Danish woman to summit.Those who like to read self-help books may enjoy her spin on the &quot;inner game&quot; of preparing for Everest, but I didn't."},{"Title":"Climbing High: A Woman's Account of Surviving the Everest Tragedy","review":"An account of the 1996 disaster from a member of the Mountain Madness team could have added considerably to our understanding of what went wrong that dreadful day. This book does not. The focus, unfortunately, is entirely on Ms. Gaamalgard herself the rest of her team are tangential presences at best and she makes no attempt to give rounded portraits or an account of who did what and when. Of course she is not a journalist, unlike Krakauer, so perhaps her concentration on her own experience is understandable. That said experience comes off as vapid and singularly uninvolving may be the fault of Ms. Gaamalgard's writing style or her translator - or both. It never occured to me to think of this book as 'a woman's point of view', possibly because I don't think in gender catagories, and I would hate to think Ms. Gaamalgard's new age psychobabble was somehow representative of my sex.

He left behind a country with no democratic tradition, an economy in ruins, and corrupt ex-communists still in charge. Two years later the author met Radu, the head of a Romanian university, at a meeting in Washington DC. He invited her to come to his country as a teacher. She accepted his invitation that day and with good language skills but no knowledge of Romanian made her plans to live and teach in Timisoara. Within six weeks of her arrival, her sponsor Radu was ousted in a rigged election, leaving her to survive on her wits. This book tells of her survival and seven years of teaching, with only brief return visits to the US. Ostensibly she taught English but informally she also taught democracy and business ethics. She also learnt to love the Romanian people. In turn they adored her.This short book, one hundred pages of sparkling prose, is almost impossible to put down. It captures both the squalor of a post-Stalinist country but also the charm of its citizens, their curiosity about the West, their great performances of classical music, their food ranging from awful in the hotel to simple but delightful in private homes. Above all it is an account of a US citizen who acted as an unoffical ambassador for our country. Would that all our official ambassadors could meet her standards."},{"Title":"Parting the Curtain: An American Teacher in Postcommunist Romania","review":"For awhile, I will tend to ruminate on the stories Ms. Heyniger has brought back from Romania. She portrays a fertile land ravaged by industry. Mixed with her astute observations of political mismanagement are delightful vignettes of the people she grew to love.Thanks to the author showing the Romanians that Americans can be caring yet vulnerable; like them. The joy she expressed from her time in Romanian is surely a result of her helpful accomplishments with the people that she taught. The stories she offers show how enjoyable her lessons must have been for her students; which include me after reading &quot;Parting the Curtain&quot;.We should be warned by the Romanian experience that, when we have cut down all the trees to suck the last drop of oil from the earth, we will need to huddle together against the cold and eat our pets. Industry and agriculture must be carefully managed with an eye to the future. Can we think of other nations or regions within nations that are like Romania?"},{"Title":"The Land Is Bright","review":"The year is 1852 and we follow a wagon train as it wends its way across the country to the Oregon Territory. Along the way we experience Indian attacks, disease and much death, and some good things as well - romance and bravery. Binns tells the story well and with great feeling for his characters. He has a great feel for the trail as well: it's said that before writing this novel Binns drove a good distance across the Oregon Trail, seeing the sights he would later write about first hand. As a work of literature and not just a genre piece, this novel succeeds handsomely."},{"Title":"The Master Preacher: a Study of the Homiletics of Jesus","review":"This book is a rare find.

If it were easy to locate I might not have gone to this effort which involved weeks of typing and careful proofreading. But, here it is: [...] If you wish to read a chapter or two before considering such an investment, then this is the best way to do so.

When others hear people speak, they judge them by what you say and the words you use to say it. This free Kindle book was compiled by G. Greever and J. M.Bachelor. The book is written for common people, not scholars. The book does not contain a list of vocabulary words. It focuses instead on how to use language correctly and effectively. It discusses such things as the emotions of certain words: should one say sodium chloride or salt? The volume contains helpful exercises. The authors stress that improving vocabulary requirs a lot of effort: one must fight battles to subjugate the words. The authors begin their presentation with a discussion why it is necessary to improve one's speach and writings. It includes a discussion on the power of words to do such things as selling what you want to sell. The book teaches such things as how to compress what you are saying into the shortest most effective way to express what you want to say. It tells how to make an idea concrete and how to avoid figurative language that is not clear."},{"Title":"The Century vocabulary builder","review":"I can only say I love this little book!

(I never saw him, ... or the book again. But in his defense, he was in the Navy, and they move those guys around a lot.)I also used to have an original copy of Marshall's book, but I have lost that over the years, too.But the book is absolutely a treasure, I borrowed a friend's copy to do this review. (For accuracy's sake.)I am too young to have known the man. (I played my first chess tournament in 1966.) But I knew Mr. Marshall's wife (Carrie) quite well. For many, many years; she was the lady who sat at the foot of the stairs and greeted you as you walked into the Marshall chess club. I feel very badly - I wish someone had told me who she was the first time I visited there. The Marshall's are a HUGE part of the history of the game of chess, at least here in the U.S.What do you get when you buy this book? Quite simply one of the very best chess books ever written, at least in the area of a (chess) biography. It is very clear and very obvious that this book has been researched to a level I personally have never seen before.By comparison, I am interested in history and very fascinated with several figures in history, notably Abe Lincoln and Andrew Jackson. (Among others.) I have read virtually every book I could get my hands on about these two persons ... and in the process I have found literally hundreds of mistakes. (One authors' chronological record itself was ridiculous, he had Jackson - MANY TIMES!! - in two different places at the same time!)But in Soltis's book, I have yet to find a single error. This might be because Marshall himself left a tremendous amount of material behind. He wrote several books, kept journals, and filled literally hundreds of yellow legal pads with notes of his own. And the people who actually knew Frank Marshall told me he had a fabulous memory.The former secretary of the club personally told me that Soltis spent hundreds and hundreds of hours there, pouring over records, making notes, and making copies of the material that is available there.The result? A simply fabulous book that is virtually free of errors. I am NOT saying Andy made no mistakes, every human does. But Andy has worked VERY hard on producing a document/book that is about as error-free as any person could humanly try to do. Andy has gone well above and beyond the call of duty here.\\"What about the book,\\" you say? Well, it too is beautiful. A gorgeous hard-back book that is nearly 400 pages in length. 220 very deeply annotated games. Additionally, there are DOZENS of game fragments.Personally, I do NOT think you would buy this book if your only interest was to improve your game, there are simply too many other good books devoted to that subject. (Check out the books by Capa, Reinfeld, Watson and Yermolinsky.) No, you would buy this book for many reasons - maybe because you consider yourself a Marshall fan. Or you consider yourself a student chess history, and want to learn more. And maybe you think you might benefit from studying one of the greatest tactical players the USA ever produced.All the bases are covered here. A thorough index, photo's, match and tournament record ... quite simply there is not a topic or subject here that you can't think of that Soltis has not covered in great detail. (On page # 203 you can find Marshall's famous victory over Levitsky, Breslau; 1912.)The only topic that I could not find was the list of Marshall's best games; perhaps Soltis did not feel qualified to make that judgment. You have over 200 of Marshall's games here, so after playing through them all, you could do your own list. (My own choice would have to come from one of the games from his monumental win at Cambridge Springs, 1904.)If you are a fan of Soltis, as I am ... or want to learn more about chess history, then get this book. I will say no more."},{"Title":"Frank Marshall, United States Chess Champion: A Biography With 220 Games","review":"GM Andy Soltis certainly knows how to write fine books, and this is one of them. Even non-Americans should appreciate a book about this US Champion who was also one of the world's top 10 for almost 30 years.The book covers Marshall's life set in its historical context, and also lightly annotates many Marshall games, including some draws and losses. Marshall was famous for his combinational ability, but Soltis shows that he had confidence, with good reason, of being able to outplay many opponents in the endgame.Marshall's skill should not be underestimated although he lost matches decisively to Lasker and Capablanca. He won the enormously strong Cambridge Springs tournament of 1904 ahead of then world champ Lasker. At St Petersburg 1914, he was one of the five finalists, and Tsar Nicholas II awarded these players the original grandmaster title. In the mid 1920s, Marshall showed that he could cope with the new hypermoderns. Even in the 1930s, when his strength had lessened somewhat, he captained to USA team to victory four times at the Olympiads, and the USA teams have never risen to the same heights since."},{"Title":"Frank Marshall, United States Chess Champion: A Biography With 220 Games","review":"I think Frank Marshall fans will find this book invaluable,it features many of his best games and plus it gives a good biography as the book progresses, perhaps the games could use some more notes but what is there is good enough."},{"Title":"Models of Revelation","review":"Avery Dulles takes the untrained reader on a journey through the complex thought processes of a religious scholar, in an easy-to-follow, step-by-step manner.He sets up criteria and begins building five philosophies or models of revelation theology that are most commonly embraced by Christians today. These models serve as a great eye-opening tool in the final compare-and-contrast stage of his analysis.Perhaps more fascinating, Dulles expands his search to include specific historical periods, so that the reader gets a better understanding of how theological thought evolves and changes, as one generation of Christian believers builds on the knowledge or misconceptions of the past, and how meaningful dialogue with historians, scientists and other religious groups have enhanced our traditions and affirmed our convictions.This book represents a rare opportunity for one of the laity to peer into the mind of a great theologian. One can not help but be impressed."},{"Title":"Models of Revelation","review":"This classic work of a beloved Catholic theologian and cardinal boils down and categorizes the work of dozens of prominent theologians, both Catholic and Protestant, from the 19th and 20th centuries into five models. It is indispensably useful as a primer and for such reason is widely read by graduate-level theology students studying revelation.One strength of Dulles's book is that he does not merely summarize the positions. He critiques each position, trying to identify both its positive and negative points. This does not mean they are all equal, and his critique of the third and fifth models mentions how they are difficult to reconcile with traditional Christian beliefs. Dulles does not advocate a specific model, nor does he think that the models can simply be combined (since they arrive at different positions on specific questions). Nor does he think creating a sixth model is viable at the present. Instead, he wants to improve upon the models by critiquing them in light of the other models. A clear way forward is not presented. That would be a miraculous feat, to reconcile such diversity!The first (1) model (Revelation as Doctrine) could be called the conservative or traditional model, which is worked out by both Catholics and Protestants in the 19th century over against the theories of Rationalism. This model sees the Bible as a collection of factually true statements about God and humankind. In some ways it is made official Catholic dogma at the First Vatican Council, though not in a way that totally excludes the following four models. It is also the model generally used by Evangelical Protestants today.The second (2) model (Revelation as History) is also worked out in the 19th century in deliberate reaction to the first model. According to this model, the Bible itself is not revelation but merely witnesses to revelation. Revelation itself is the acts of God in history (e.g., the Exodus, the Incarnation). The famous scholar Oscar Cullmann (1902-1999) belongs to this school, as does Wolfhart Pannenberg (1928- ). The former popularized the German word Heilsgeschichte, which is usually translated \\"salvation history.\\" Jean Cardinal Danielou, the famous patrologist, created a Catholic version of this theory, which found its way into the Second Vatican Council's document on revelation, Dei Verbum.The third (3) model (Revelation as Inner Experience) is essentially the view of Liberal Protestantism, whose founder may be Friedrich Schleiermacher (1768-1834), though the model is worked out by later scholars. This model sought to establish a theory of revelation in which revelation was not dependent on the Bible, which was considered historically unreliable. Instead, revelation is coterminous with a personal religious experience of God, which can be mediated by the Bible (though it can also exist outside Christianity). One living author who falls here to some degree is John Hick (1922- ), who, however, can also be placed in the fifth model.The fourth (4) model (Revelation as Dialectical Presence) is what is sometimes called Neo-Orthodoxy, as developed after World War I specifically by Karl Barth (1886-1968), Emil Brunner (1889-1966), and Rudolf Bultmann (1884-1976). It is a reaction to Liberal Protestantism. According to these Protestant theologians, God is \\"absolute mystery\\" and cannot be objectified. The object of revelation is not God himself in his absolute essence but God as he turns toward his creatures. Revelation is nothing but the fact of Jesus Christ. As in the second model, the Bible itself is not revelation, but witnesses to revelation.The fifth (5) model (Revelation as New Awareness) was the most difficult one for me to wrap my head around. According to Dulles, in this model revelation is \\"the transcendent fulfillment of the inner drive of the human spirit toward fuller consciousness.\\" It is a sort of evolutionary view, in which humankind is moving toward \\"fuller consciousness,\\" and this is what revelation is. The very famous theologians Paul Tillich (1886-1965) and Karl Rahner, SJ (1904-1984), are to some degree associated with this school of thought.After going through the five models, he tackles specific questions (for example, the Bible, the Church, Christ, eschatology) and shows what answers each model arrives at. This is, again, very useful for the beginning theology student. Overall, this book is on the short-list of must-reads for students of the theology of revelation. No doubt it could be critiqued by theologians of each school of thought, but it is inevitable that a book of this nature will not please all, and many simplifications are necessary to fit so many theologians into only five models, which Dulles himself acknowledges. Something is sacrificed in the name of utility and simplicity, but it is an acceptable sacrifice for the beginner."},{"Title":"Models of Revelation","review":"...there's still much good information to be had. My theology professor had us write papers explaining why Dulles's portrait of the evanagelical model fell short, but I really don't think it was bad at all, considering the religious orientation of the author.Dulles does an admirable job of portraying the doctrine of revelation from several viewpoints, so this book should come in handy to anyone interested in the nature and thought of revelation."},{"Title":"Models of Revelation","review":"Avery Dulles defines \\"revelation\\" as \\"God's free action whereby he communicates saving truth to created minds, especially through Jesus Christ as accepted by the apostolic church and attested by the Bible and by the continuing community of believers.\\" In Models of Revelation, Dulles identifies five models of revelation: Revelation as Doctrine, Revelation as History, Revelation as Inner Experience, Revelation as Dialectical Presence, and Revelation as New Awareness. He explains that the propositional view of revelation to which he links Conservative Evangelicalism and the propositional view of Catholic neo-Scholasticism both fit within his model of Revelation as Doctrine. Dulles' view, however, does not paint a complete picture of the \\"Conservative Evangelical\\" view of revelation.Dulles traces his description of the Conservative Evangelical view of revelation to the views presented by B.B. Warfield, through the defenses of Gordon H. Clark, J.I. Packer, J.W. Montgomery, and Carl F.H. Henry, to the International Council on Biblical Inerrancy's \\"Chicago Statement on Biblical Inerrancy.\\" Dulles concludes that this view holds that God makes himself known through nature (natural or general revelation), but that salvific truth requires supernatural (special) revelation. Natural revelation makes God \\"available always and everywhere.\\" Special revelation provides for effective knowledge of salvific truth because God's tanscendence and the devastating effects of original sin prevent humans from attaining a sure and saving knowledge of God by natural revelation alone. God's revelation is deposited in the canonical scripture, so the Bible is the whole and final revelation of God, thereby allowing revelation without prophets, Jesus Christ, or apostles.Dulles finds that the \\"propositional model stands up well in terms of its faithfulness to tradition, its internal coherence, and its practical advantages, but less well when judged by other standards.\\" He also notes that it promotes unity through its doctrines, provides firm doctrinal standards, facilitates full commitment to biblical and ecclesiastical teaching. This model \\"safeguards the meaning and authority of revelation, which is seen as providing clear, firm answers to deep and persistent questions concerning God, humanity, and the universe, and thus as offering sure guidance through the confusions of life.\\"However, Dulles concludes that this model provides too narrow an approach, that it is authoritarian and extrinsicist. He criticizes its as implausible, inadequate to experience, and as valueless for dialogue. Dulles believes that this model requires submission to propositions in the Bible held to be revelation, regardless of whether they seem to apply to the believer, thereby ignoring the believer's own life and experience. Its apparent rigidity stemming from its acknowledgment of Holy Scripture as the complete deposit of revelation rejects \\"members of other groups as heretics or infidels.\\" Because he doubts the authority of every passage of Holy Scripture as God's word, Dulles questions this model's treatment of the Bile as peremptory authority. Nevertheless, Dulles does not imply \\"that the clear teachings of Scripture and the creeds are without grounds in revelation.\\"Dulles clearly identifies the elements of God's revelation in his descriptions of five models. What he views as the weaknesses of the Evangelical's conservative model, presumes his bias that Holy Scripture, without the Church through the pope, is incomplete. He discounts that the conservative model actually accounts for the role of history, experience, and faith because of his desire to \\"compartmentalize\\" God's revelation. Nevertheless, Dulles' analysis does lead to the conclusion that God's revelation is important to the believer because it conveys God's nature and purposes to the community of believers."},{"Title":"The Cream of the Jest","review":"I looked up this book in order to see the talisman that lies at the heart of the story: The Sigil of Scoteia. I turned to the shelves of the Boston Athenaeum and Behold!, there this mysterious treasure lay. The central character of the book, Felix Kennaston, a hapless author, who has a gift for extravagant turns of phrase and fantastic romantic imaginings, is turned into a huge literary success by accidental favorable publicity. He finds the Sigil and it opens new and wondrous vistas to him.Cabell's Kennaston is ordinary except that he is touched by the fantastic in his flights of imagination. Cabell uses him to point out curious things about our lives: How we are consumed by considerations of the past and future, even of life after death, while the only directly experienced reality is the present moment. How we think our lives would be better if they conformed to ideals set out in stories in books, fiction, literature.These imaginings both cut Kennaston off from immediate reality and give him a great fulfillment. Indeed, they are the basis for his crowing literary triumph, as the debunking narrator of Kennaston's tale shows the reader.This is an amusing and delightful book. I see that it is available over the Web (http://www.uwm.edu/~mrdunn/cream.frames/cream1.html), but you should have a copy on paper to really enjoy it. It was published early in the 20th Century and there are many copies floating around.A great book, and most amusing. I warn you: Do not stare to long or too intently at the Sigil."},{"Title":"The Cream of the Jest","review":"The pragmatic Richard Fentnor Harrowby, wealthy manufacturer of Harrowby's Creme Cleopatre and No. 7 Dental Delight, discussed the life and work of the author Felix Kennason who rose to fame with the publication of &quot;Men Who Loved Alison.&quot; Harrowby's evaluation of Kennason: &quot;At all events, I never quite liked Felix Kennason--not even after I came to understand that the man I knew in the flesh was a very ill-drawn likeness of Felix Kennason. After all, that is the whole sardonic point of his story--and, indeed, of every human story--that the person you or I find in the mirror is condemned eternally to misrepresent us in the eyes of our fellows. but even with comprehension, I never cordially liked the man; and so, it may well be that his story is set down not all in sympathy.&quot; The book begins in Storisende. Count Emmerick had planned a wedding feast for La Beale Ettarre, his youngest sister, engaged to marry Guiron des Rocques. Horvendile, a servant of Ettarre, also loved her, and attempted to sabotage the wedding. He failed, and had to leave Storisende. Before he departed, Ettarre took the Sigil of Scoteia which hung around her neck, broke it in half and gave him one of its halves to him and said, &quot;You will not always abide in your own country, Horvendile. Some day you will return to us at Storisende. The sign of the dark Goddess will prove your safe-conduct then if Guiron and I be yet alive.&quot; After he had completed writing his book, Kennason took a twilight walk in the garden of Alcluid, his estate. He spied a shining bit of metal along the pathway and picked it up and put it in his pocket. The metal was a half of a disk which was three inches in diameter with tiny characters inscribed upon its surface. That disk enabled Kennason, in his dreams, to be transformed into Horvendile and transported to many different times and places in which he met Ettarre, but every time he tried to touch her &quot;the universe seemed to fold about him, just as a hand closes.&quot; Kennason sought Harrowby's expertise in explaining the occult aspects of his dreams with ironic results."},{"Title":"Soul of Viktor Tronko","review":"I read this book several years ago.

Tronko was a Soviet, who may have been a defector, or maybe a ruse; in any case he told the Americans some pretty important information. If they believe it. The novel swarms with characters, all of them realistic and lifelike, all imaginative. Although the facts and people become confusing after awhile, the end is very satisfying and definately worth reading to. It's also amusing that Quammen wrote a novel wherein the main character is a middle-aged journalist who enjoys writing about nature (and through that about people) and has a fetish for Eugene Marais. The writing is very good, the story although confusing is interesting."},{"Title":"Soul of Viktor Tronko","review":"If you are looking for a more complex spy novel than Le Carre can write, you got to read this. It is excellent, but it needs smart and patient readers to keep up with tiny bits of information lost in a lot of disinformation. The hero is a journalist who tries to get to the truth by interviewing retired CIA agents. The agents talk because they are bitter and unsatisfied, so their reports are tainted. Therefore it is impossible to decide if Viktor Tronko is a Russian defector or a double agent. The journalist is attracted to the case by the tantalizing promise that there is or might be a link between Tronko and the Kennedy assassination, or between Tronko and a traitor within the CIA.The reading is made more light by the desire of the journalist to go back to his real love: natural history (as Quammen himself did). The real life naturalist Eugene Marais plays a role too, as his work was stolen by the poet Maurice Maeterlinck, another (real) case of lie and disinformation!"},{"Title":"Quantitative Analysis of Movement: Measuring and Modeling Population Redistribution in Animals and Plants","review":"I wrote my Master's thesis on the movement of grasshoppers and almost wore this book out!

Having been involved in the New Age movement in my younger years I know there is much that has been written about it that is simply wrong.This book happily surprised me. Dr. Martin treats the New Age movement is a fair and even manner and tells the truth.He begins with a quick overview of the New Age movement, then gives one entire chapter to the words of New Age teaches and proponents themselves, without any interpretation. Who better to state what they believe than New Agers themselves? The chapter following this gives the Biblical answers to these teachings and shows how they change and distort what Jesus has said.He continues on with Jim Jones and Sirhan Sirhan were influenced by the New Age movement. We know the disasters consequences of these people well, but how they got there is a story most people don't hear.After this Mr. Martin writes about how the New Age is making inroads in the public school system and society in general, and had an entire chapter devoted to reincarnation, what New Agers believe about it, and what the Bible says about it - all the passages dealing with it, not just selective ones that New Agers quote.There is a chapter on how to approach New Agers to witness to them without turning them off. He than had a chapter on identifying New Age groups and leaders including a veritable glossary of people, organizations, books, and magazines.He concludes with a glossary of many of the words New Agers use, and what they mean.

He wrote in the Preface, \\"This is a very difficult book to write ... because so many people, Christian and non-Christian alike, know so little about the evils of New Age thinking... This small volume is obviously not intended to replace a select number of good, in-depth studies of the New Age movement... but it is theology in newspaper language, a popular layman's overview and refutation of a militant and growing problem for Christians everywhere.\\"Here are some additional quotations from the book:\\"However, Krishnamurti declined the honor of Mrs. (Annie) Besant's anointing (as \\"World Teacher\\") due largely to the death of his brother and his subsequent disillusionment with the claims of Theosophy.\\" (Pg. 17)\\"Often New Age cultists ... persist in quoting scriptures to buttress their own position. Why quote for proof what you say is untrustworthy?\\" (Pg. 38)\\"Very few people are aware that Robert Kennedy's assassin, Sirhan, was deeply involved with New Age thinking through the writings of the Theosophical Society.\\" (Pg. 55)\\"C.S. Lovett, while advocating mediation, confirms that the visualization he refers to is the same as that used by cults...\\" (Pg. 77)\\"There is a danger that New Age thought could lead some to make God female, to totally abandon the biblical image of God. The Bible presents God with both feminine and masculine characteristics, but the male imagery is much stronger than the female. Losing sight of this truth would make Him less than He really is...\\" (Pg. 79)\\"Praise the zeal, dedication, and (wherever possible) the goals of the New Age movement, because its basic nature is both messianic and millennial. The New Age cult is seeking the right things, but with the wrong methods and with wrong reasons.\\" (Pg. 102)"},{"Title":"The New Age Cult","review":"So someone from the biggest CULT of all, Christianity, makes the usual errors about alternative spiritual paths he knows nothing about. Pure ignorance and bigotry!Evangelical Christianity had done far more damage than the New Age ever could, by sowing seeds of discord and division. Their fear-based dogma keeps them blinded to the Light that is in others.Their own book says GOD IS LOVE.Therefore, where Love is, God is.Where God is, Love is.That's what the New Age is really all about. It's that simple.But many Christians miss the boat. They are stuck in FEAR.Perfect love casts out fear, right?Didn't Jesus say to LOVE God and LOVE your neighbor?Why, then, do so many Christians stay stuck in FEAR?Why do they feel they must attack the spirituality of others? Why not just offer their own spirituality in LOVE to those who choose it, and respect the rights of others to follow the spiritual path of their choice?"},{"Title":"The New Age Cult","review":"Walter Martin (1928-1989) was the twentieth century's eminent scholar on cults. This research began in the 1960s, when Martin was investigating the roots of the New Age movement: Unity School of Christianity, Christian Science, Spiritism, Bahaiism, and Rosicrucianism. Today over sixty million people dabble in New Age practices.Walter Martin, the founder of the Christian Research Institute, is assisted by the staff of CRI. He describes New Age as a submerged iceberg during the 1960s, which surfaced full force in the 1980s. Throughout the book he highlights others' in-depth research for those seeking more detailed information. He exposes the New Age movement's direct contradictions to orthodox Christianity, including an quotations from Benjamin Creme.The author even demonstrates New Age links to Jim Jones, the mass suicide he initiated in 1978, and to the philosophy of Sirhan Sirhan, the assassin of Robert F. Kennedy. There is also a chapter on reincarnation, followed by the Christian response to New Age philosophy.Walter Martin achieves his goal, a concise overview of New Age, easily read by lay people; he suggests further reading for in-depth research. Martin died shortly after completing this book. A glossary of terms from Age of Aquarius to Yin, yang and yoga, proves valuable. If only for the extensive glossary, bibliography and list of New Age spokespersons and relevant organizations, this volume would be a valuable resource.A condensed version of this book appears as chapter 11, \\"The New Age Cults,\\" in Walter Martin's Kingdom of the Cults (Bethany House Publishers, 2002; ISBN: 0764289888)."},{"Title":"The New Age Cult","review":"Save your money, i'm not sure whats more disturbing the fact that a doctor wrote this garbage or that people will probably believe him."},{"Title":"The Urban School: A Factory for Failure","review":"Now featuring a new introduction by education policy expert Ray C. Rist , The Urban School: A Factory For Failure is a chilling study of how inner-city public schools help to reinforce class distinctions from a very early age. With an emphasis upon how kindergarten, first grade, and second grade force young children into social tier structures, and consequently are particularly harsh and handicapping to the poorest members of the population, The Urban School is a timely and much needed wake-up call to a educational policy and contemporary social problem that urgently needs to be addressed across the country and in every urban school district."},{"Title":"The Urban School: A Factory for Failure","review":"Though first published in 1972, this book is still a great read. It had long been known that ability grouping and family socioeconomic status were closely associated, working to the advantage of the relatively affluent and the disadvantage of the poor. The mechanismhs involved in generating this association, however, were not well understood. Rist's work taught us that socioeconomic advantage is often unselfconsciously taken as an indicator of high intelligence intelligence, and that low socioeconomic status is taken as evidence of dullness. As a result, classrooms organized nominally on the basis of ability are actually organized on the basis of socioeconomic status. Rist, in short, identified and explained one of the mechanisms whereby ability grouping works to the advantage of the affluent and further diminishes the prospects of the poor.Though based on field work done in the late 1960's, Rist's book is still quite pertinent. Education has become more organizationally complex, but so have the mechanisms that foster inheritance of socioeconomic status from one generation to another. For a striking example, look at the remarkably close association between SAT scores and family income reported in the Brookings Institution's 1998 volume Getting Ahead.Rist's book is an exemplary ethnography, and its title should not discourage rural educators: it applies to them, as well. The book's educational policy implications, if ever taken seriously, could profoundly improve schooling, making the U.S. a much more meritocratic nation."},{"Title":"Financial Risk Manager Handbook, Second Edition","review":"This book is billed as the \\"official reference book for GARP's FRM certification program\\" and \\"ideal for self instruction and in-house training\\".Unfortunately, it falls short on both scores. It is definitely not a book for someone with a basic level of knowledge. Nor does it really seem to be written for the intermediate risk manager/practitioner.Dr. Jorion undertook a rather ambitious and perhaps thankless task with this book. The subject is quite extensive. There is probably no one person with all the required in-depth knowledge to write the entire book. So there were bound to be areas of weakness. It also appears that he had scant assistance with the book, which placed an enormous burden on him.As well, the book lacks a consistent pedagogical focus. It is not pitched to the basic student or to the intermediate level practitioner but seems to wander between the two. And therefore is probably not an ideal text for either audience.If it is intended as a textbook for in-house training or preparation for the FRM exam, then it should be written at a much more basic level with careful ordering of the presentation of the material and fuller explanations rather than the text's at times elliptical and terse ones. For an example of a shortcoming in presentation, in the section on option pricing, the book discusses the Merton derivation (for income generating \\"underlyings\\") of the Black Scholes model and then presents a detailed example of the Black Scholes model. It would be more helpful to reverse the order and go from the simpler to the more complex.Other areas for improvement are the section on statistics, probability, etc. These are at the heart of modern risk management. Sometimes the descriptions seem too terse to convey the material. The tables on the \\"moments\\" could be improved by including the denominator to show the exact formula for their calculation.Notwithstanding the above, there is some very good material in the book - thematic comments on risk management and interactions between various risks and instruments. This \\"big picture\\" analysis is good. The discussion of \\"moments\\" is well organized though there is a shortcoming in the tables - the denominators are missing and so the student doesn't see the exact formula for each. However, as outlined above, without more detail and more structured presentation, the book's utility for the basic level student is diminished.One would expect to see more evidence of a strong editor's hand from a book published under Wiley Finance imprint. It is a little acknowledged fact that most authors rely on an editor to catch mistakes and to ensure that the book stays on message. The author's task is even more daunting when preparing such a technical book. And the editor's role then even more critical.There are some obvious errors in the book. For example, missing information in the sample question 11.4 on page 254. Poor spacing in the answer key to that question on page 260- where the square root of time and the 99% standard deviation factors are conflated. As well, the explanation of the solution could have been expanded to explain exactly what these factors represented and why they were used. This is very important in a basic training book. Also there are several extraneous words between two sentences on the top of page 291. These and others not mentioned here seem to be obvious catches.Since the subject matter is so extensive and since this is a GARP official publication, GARP should consider enlisting several authors, each of whom could address areas of his/her expertise. Dr. Jorion then could serve as the senior author - providing the logical architecture to link sections together and highlight critical dependencies and linkages. That would improve the book materially."},{"Title":"Financial Risk Manager Handbook, Second Edition","review":"The people who have written reviews primarily have gripes that they didn't pass.

It is a primer to help you delve into the material. This book will not substitute the large amount of qualitative reading and equation memorization that you'll need to do in order to pass.I give it a 4 mainly because the book does what it claims and because some of the more negative reviews are too far-fetched.

So a lot of people studying for the exam will continue to waste a lot of time with this book....Once upon a time, a guy called Phillipe J. wrote a book about Value at Risk at exactly the right moment and became famous. Since then, people like to ask him to hold presentations at conferences (his charts there have the same quality as the charts in the book, his presentation techniques are extremely disappointing), they like to publish his papers (well, probably comparable to the quality of the book), they like to ask him to be on the board for important exams like the FRM exam.

Agreed the book covers everything within the Body of Knowledge for FRM exam, but many important issues / theories are mentioned / covered in the Handbook because they are part of syllabus but sufficient justice is not done to them. One definately gets this strong feeling that continuity is missing in certain parts of the book and they seem to be just product of simple copy / paste action.I strongly recommend GARP, Wiley Finance to correct the errors and replace current book with an error free version.

The book is poorly prepared and organized. While it is organized in according with the exam. structure, it is still difficult for the reader to follow. Most concepts have insufficient explanation. While some notations have not been clearly explained, some topics are explained (or jumped) very fast without proper elaboration. Some examples are even not supported by adequate reading before the examples and the explanation can only be found in the answers. Thus, it has made a chapter in pieces and then becomes difficult for the reader to memorize.

The author frequently tells us that he is sure we must believe that the literature of this period is without value or interest. I found this notion bizarre -- that readers would read a book devoted to stuff they thought should properly be ignored. Who are these conscript readers?I hope that I am not being too fanciful to believe that any English speaker with an insatiable curiosity about this language & its literature will eventually come to wonder what interesting matter may lie between the age of Aelfric and the age of Chaucer. Such a person might eventually read through, say, the more interesting selections in Bennett and Smithers' \\"Early Middle English Verse and Prose.\\" If this person were to possess any sense at all, he or she would quickly realize that in Lawman, \\"Ancrene Wisse,\\" and \\"The Owl and the Nightingale,\\" we have nothing less than literary genius. Then and only then might someone develop a hankering to read some intelligent criticism of this literature -- thus my confusion at Cannon's posturing as the only person in the world who thinks the stuff is worth reading, which leads him into too many otiose declarations.The highlights of this book are indeed those chapters (numbers 2, 4, and 5) that treat of the literary works to which I have ascribed genius just above. Of these, one of the best, I thought, was the essay on Lawman's \\"Brut,\\" which emphasizes the theme of law in that poem, and how it seems to have an immanent presence in the British soil that endures through so many invasions and \\"changes of personnel.\\" Cannon makes an intriguing analogy between this and Boethian consolatio (which also offers us a minimal but noble constant to which we can look and cling when all else alters). The chapter on \\"Owl & Nightingale\\" stresses the surprising sympathy and even cooperation between the two birds that emerge from their supposed debate & convincingly points out that the two \\"shrill\\" singers have a good bit of fun developing a view of women quite at odds with the typical medieval misogyny. The chapter on \\"Ancrene Wisse,\\" also one of Cannon's best, richly and subtly evokes that book's conception of the self as a walled place in danger of penetration from hostile forces, and yet in its very need to keep itself \\"safe,\\" involved in a complex relationship with its allies and environment. Cannon muses on how appropriate this is to the environment in which the \\"AW\\" may have been created -- the precariously vulnerable, castle-dotted March of Wales.The rest of the book is interesting, but sometimes the theoretical superstructure is really gratuitous and uninteresting. Only the final chapter, on early romance (which Cannon vilifies as lacking the unique quiddity of the odder early MidE texts), is pretentious to the point of not being worth reading (ironically, it ends with the conclusion, \\"we are happy to define the literary as that which deflates metaphysical pretension\\" -- his own metaphysical pretensions could use some deflating!). I enjoy Hegel, Marx, and abstruse theorization as much as the next guy, and I did enjoy Cannon's boyish enthusiasm over such conceptions as that of literary works as made objects whose forms reflect and even possess the \\"knowledge\\" of the cultures in which they were produced. But much of it is unnecessary and irrelevant. For example, the excellent chapter on \\"Ancrene Wisse\\" would have been just as clever & complete without ANY recourse to (not to mention, constant harping upon) what Aristotle's \\"Physics\\" has to say about space. The point of the \\"O&N;\\" chapter, which I've praised above, does not IMHO depend as much as Cannon believes on medieval theories, \\"Cratylan\\" and other, on the ontology of words.But at the end of the day, Cannon is a good close reader of texts, and it's well worth passing through the rest of it (which has, as I've suggested, a certain infectious charm; as with so many infectiously charming people, it's kind of inevitable that it eventually turns grating). Those who hate theory, which I do not, could mine this book for some truly ridiculous confections of verbiage. But they would be missing the sensitive literary critic who just can't help being animated to the point of pomposity, and who, it seems, always retains his sense of jeu intact."},{"Title":"The Gospel According to Matthew: An Introduction and Commentary (Tyndale New Testament Commentaries)","review":"It is difficult to rate this fairly because you have to ask about the intended audience.

I was overjoyed to find this edition back in print again, with its wood-block prints and original type plates still intact. Don't miss this one."},{"Title":"The Crock of Gold","review":"James Stephens is one of the writers who produced the works that have come to be called the &quot;Celtic Revival&quot;. In the late Victorian era writers in Ireland, Scotland and Wales had their own rennaisance of the classical works of medieval celtic literature. In Ireland this revival took on an added dimension as it became associated through figures such as Yeates and Maude Gonne with the struggle for Irish Independence. Ultimately the rediscovery of classical celtic poetry and prose gave a language, a history and a nationalistic justification to the rebels.William Butler Yeates, John Millington Synge, Oliver St.John Gogarty, James Joyce and Samuel Beckett are all renowned worldwide for their contributions to international literature. Be it on stage or in prose, they brought a poetic flavour to their art, a free flowing and lilting verse that permeates all their work. This signature blank verse gives an ancient grandeur to the literature of the period, carrying echoes of the ancient celtic poets, and redolent of Chauser and Shakespeare.James Stephens is less well known than his compatriots, but no lesser in quality. If anything his is the purest voice of the Celtic Revival. He is easily on a par with writers such as John Milton and Edmunde Spencer, who wrote similarly high works of art.But the beauty of Stephens is that his subject is the folklore of daily Irish life. Happy and jolly tales of leperachauns and fairies, small events of great import, the philosophy of field and wood. It is at once grand and accessible. The tales have a childlike attraction and simplicity to them that is belied by the quality of the prose.Whether reading for a bit of fantasy, a good laugh, or to study literature, you will not regret reading these tales."},{"Title":"The Crock of Gold","review":"The book is appealing on many levels. It has fantasy,mystery, myth and abundant humor. Most of the tales aremythical in nature. Some are fabricated tall tales.The writing is excellent, with rich detail expressed interse language. A delight from cover to cover."},{"Title":"The Crock of Gold","review":"As other reviewers have said at length, The Crock of Gold is a fine read, no doubt. But it is at its best read aloud. If you can find the version read masterfully by (I think) Donal Donnelly, which was offered on cassette a few years ago, you are in for a treat. The language sings, and it is wonderful to hear the Gaelic names read aloud. Listening to this book is a rare pleasure."},{"Title":"The Crock of Gold","review":"If you revel in pagan dementia, and are in for a solid laugh, James Stephens's Crock of Gold will have you rolling. The words are poetry. The thoughts are strangely intellectual. The characters are truly from another dimension. A masterpiece like no other. Long live the Philosopher and his musings...&quot;So saying, he returned his eyes to his nose, and his mind to his maxim, and lapsed to a profound reflection wherein nothing sat perched on insubstantiality, and the Spirit of Artifice goggled at the puzzle.&quot;Try that one at home!"},{"Title":"The Crock of Gold","review":"The story contained in this book is excellent, but the book itself is junk. It appears that is was visually scanned from and older and more narrowly formatted print and then pasted into this print with little to no error checking. The worst result of this is that every word that was hyphenated across two lines in the original text appears broken and hyphenated even though it is now in the middle of a line (e.g. hyphen- ated). You will also see occasional misreads such as a number 1 in place of a lowercase \\"L\\".Find another printing."},{"Title":"The Crock of Gold","review":"I bought this book for my collection because it was advertised as containig \\"twelve full color prints by Thomas Mackenzie\\".Sadly, the Mackenzie prints are absent, they are, however, listed in the front of the book under \\"illustrations\\", complete with page numbers, just no wonderful Mackenzie prints.This is the \\"River City Press 1978 reprint\\""},{"Title":"The Crock of Gold","review":"The soft back edi- tion of this book is full of misedit- ed copy (full of sep- arated text (annoying isn't it?).

Lastly, whole portions of text are missing from this edition. My advice, spend the extra money and get a different edition."},{"Title":"The Crock of Gold","review":"I have older versions of the Crock of Gold. I bought this one as a gift for a friend. Reviewing the text, every page averaged about two incorrectly hyphenated words throughout the whole book. It seems the \\"publisher\\" just scanned a version of Crock of Gold using OCR, and then incorrectly reformatted the words into this new edition. The problem is that where the original version of the book used had hyphenated words where there was a line break, this version kept the same hyphenated words, but these words were not at a line break.Page 1 examples: ec- stacy, crea- tures, maledic- tions, No- body, prog- nosticate. 5 words on the very first page of the book are hyphenated even though there is not a line or page break! Note that not only are the words hyphenated, they have an extra space after the hyphen. This makes trying to read this book excruciating.Crock of Gold is an excellent book. Yet this version is worthless and should not be sold on Amazon. Do not waste your money buying this."},{"Title":"The Crock of Gold","review":"James Stephen's Crock of Gold is marvelous, but this instance, a maroon covered paperback with a multi-colored border, is marred by irresponsible use of Optical Character Recognition. Line-ending hyphenations in the original have been ignored, and now are preserved in mid-line, or worse, at line start."},{"Title":"The Crock of Gold","review":"I picked up The Crock of Gold to read on a whim, and little did I know what I was getting into. I've not read a novel this wonderful in years. I guarantee it's one I'm going to return to over and over, just to revel in its magic.The plot is loose and whimsical. I don't really know how to describe it. Many strange things happen. A philosopher sparks a crisis when he inadvertently gives away the position of the leprechauns' gold. A young woman is seduced away from home by the god Pan, and the Celtic gods must be sought out to save her. Leprechauns' frame a murder and call in the (non-magical) police. Several people fall in love. Yep, there are fairies and kidnappings and journeys and parables, and none of it is logical, but it all manages to make sense anyway.The main thing, though, is just that this is such a beautiful book. I read a lot, but nowhere, nowhere have I read prose this beautiful. There is something very edenic about the novel, some sense that Stephens is tapping into an original knowledge of beauty that we all share. The philosopher's journey from knowing about life toward knowing how to live is particularly meaningful. The ending, though abrupt, is startling.I can't recommend this book too highly."},{"Title":"The Crock of Gold","review":"Stephens' \\"Crock of Gold\\" is an interesting little amalgam of cosy Irish folktale,Celtic mythology, and the Hero's Quest. What makes it unusual is that, through the course of the book, three different heroes--male and female--undertake separate life-altering journeys. The characters all have interesting eccentricities, and their struggles present different morals of life. The ending, such as it is, is diffuse and you can decide for yourself just what sort of allegory the author intended. A pleasant little tale for bedtime reading."},{"Title":"Designing With Roses (The Joy of Gardening)","review":"This short (80 pages), very pictorial guidebook to rose growing manages to convey to the reader the rich, exciting history of rose growing and the vastness of the industry in present days.

Many of the accompanying pictures are gorgeous. Of course they are - they ARE roses, after all."},{"Title":"Bear Hug: A Tom Bethany Mystery","review":"Enjoyable read from fun author Jerome Doolittle.

You won't be sorry."},{"Title":"The Magic and the Sword: The Greek Myths Retold","review":"This is an excellent older mythology textbook, published for elementary-school children from 1956 to 1965, a time when classical mythology was still considered important to understanding western culture by public schools.The first two of the three sections of the book relate the more important, older Greek myths and stories about the gods and goddesses. The third section details the many adventures of Odysseus. At the end of each chapter are notes mentioning modern uses of words derived from mythological names.The stories are told in rich, descriptive prose that breathes life into ancient tales, is easy to understand, yet is enjoyable for adults to read aloud. The reading level is similar to that of d'Aulaires' Book of Greek Myths; most sixth-grade students should be able to read it.The pencil illustrations could be better, and do unfortunately serve to date the book, but they add to the enjoyment of the stories by children.I almost didn't buy this book, which I happened across at a thrift store. It was in such poor physical shape, well-worn, missing the corners of the covers, dirty and taped in multiple places, that I nearly passed up what has turned out to be a gem. \\"Don't judge a book....\\"I highly recommend The Magic and the Sword for exposing students to these timeless stories that every educated person should be familiar with."},{"Title":"The Magic and the Sword: The Greek Myths Retold","review":"This book is astounding!

They are almost all rather large and/or ambitious, but I have completed projects from earlier books by the same authors, so I know they turn out to be worth the effort. This book is an absolute must if you like cats (domestic or wild) and cross-stitch! I deduct half a point from the rating because the symbols for the three-quarter cross-stitches are not as clear as they are in, for instance 'Animals in Cross Stich', and another half a point for the colour charts which were much clearer when all the colours were numbered. Now the symbols, and especially the lack of symbols can make determining which colour goes where a little more difficult. Also, it is available only in hardback. Hardback may be more durable, but it makes using the book less practical. But overall a great buy!"},{"Title":"Cats of the World in Cross Stitch","review":"This beauty and cute book is the best for catlover!Stunning photos, easy to read colour charts, a lot of informations also regarding the cats...and wonder projects to stitch!I can't wait to stitch all this beauty pussycats!"},{"Title":"Cats of the World in Cross Stitch","review":"I have other books by Jayne Netley Mayhew and Nicki Wheeler and I like every one of them.

Three of the great classics of World War II in one volume!Tales of the South Pacific, by James Michener, was a Pulitzer prize winning novel by one of the greatest authors of the twentieth century. Renowned for his detailed research, and for his storytelling ability, Michener has been described with every superlative in the book. This story may be his finest, and served as the basis for the Broadway musical and the movie, &quot;South Pacific.&quot; The setting is a tropical paradise; windswept coral isles and the nurses, soldiers and sailors caught up by the war, and the inevitable romances that resulted.Mr. Roberts, by Thomas Heggen, is the story of a much-loved navy lieutenant juxtaposed against the rigid, incompetent captain of a navy cargo vessel, the &quot;Reluctant,&quot; whose duties take her from boredom to tedium and back again with little relief for the crew. The story is anything but boring, however, and the characters are unforgettable. In the movie version, Henry Fonda portrayed the herois Mr. Roberts movingly. The story mixes poignancy with satire, and is both hugely funny and profoundly tragic.Battle Cry, by Leon Uris (another giant of literature), depicts life in the United States Marine Corps as it was during the great Pacific War. The story takes you from boot training to the foxholes with the fighting Marine Corps, who probably suffered more than any other branch of service in the Pacific in the early to middle 'forties. Faith, hope, and desire are all epitomized in this story, often described as the greatest novel ever written about the Marines.Anyone interested in those days of Pacific conflict should have this book, unless they already have these three great stories in another form.Joseph H.

It's a replica of the 1939 book with the same title, featuring a color sketch by Kerr. Inside, it's off the mark with an introduction by Hilaire Belloc, and a contents page listing some forty pieces. This is very misleading however, as some of the \\"pieces\\" are less than a page, so there's a second contents list which breaks down as follows: Drones Club Stories; Mr. Mulliner Stories; Jeeves Stories; Lord Emsworth Stories (Blandings Castle); Ukridge Stories; The Oldest Member Stories (Golf Stories); Extracts from Novels; and Miscellaneous.There are two sorts of readers who will love this book: those absolutely new to Wodehouse; and those who have read all of him. The first will relish dipping into the various refreshments, as it were, and find this a helpful guide on where to go next; the second will delight in re-encountering the familiar passages and re-experiencing the stories. For these readers I rate the book a five.But there is another type of reader who will find the book infuriating, and for them it would be a four. That is the goup who have read some Wodehouse but not all. They would like to come upon new stories and so would enjoy this book. They would also enjoy re-encountering, like the seasoned reader, those they've already read.Should one follow the second contents page and stick to the stories, this book admirably serves both purposes. However, there are small snatches from various stories liberally sprinkled between the full-length yarns, some of which give the game and the plot away. Others merely make one want to read the book. The snatches from The Girl on the Boat made me want to track down that elusive novel, which I eventually found in a German paperback (English language) with the cover torn off. Such is the Wodehouse madness when it comes that this book may drive one Plum crazy.This book was wildly popular in the early 'forties when Wodehouse was thought to be at his peak. As it was he wrote decades longer, cranked out numerous novels and if anything is more widely read today. The comic sketches of Kerr which adorn this volume are reminiscent of Jazz Age cartoonist John Held, whose flappers and sheiks held reign throughout the 'twenties and 'thirties, and it would seem a natural pairing, Held's stylized art and Plum's whimsical writing. For whatever reason, it was not to be. That said, a warning may be in order. As the introduction notes, the Wodehouse Madness reached fevered pitch in 1939. It was thought to have since abated, but with this volume again in circulation, appears to be reaching epidemic proportions."},{"Title":"Revenge of the Son of the World's Tackiest Postcards","review":"REVENGE OF THE SON OF THE WORLD'S TACKIEST POSTCARDS is indeed tacky. I had no idea that the world was peppered with postcards such as these. In here you'll see hilarious cards from the 50's and 60's and find yourself asking, &quot;why would someone send a postcard about chopped Balkan horse hearts?&quot; Just be glad someone did, otherwise your everyday boring life would be deprived of such campy, pointless humor. This is a book you'll pick up periodically for years and laugh ferociously every time. I promise. A BONUS: The postcards are perforated and ready to send! Certainly a must!"},{"Title":"1984","review":"Wow! That's all I can say...Wow!I read this in high school in the mid 60s, and I completely forgot about it. I honestly didn't remember it. I'm not going to talk much about it. For one, it's been heavily reviewed already, and for another, you really have to read it not knowing anything about it.But one exception. There was something that I found incredibly interesting this time around. \\"The Book\\". \\"The Book\\" was a book that the main character reads from at some time during the story. What made Orwell write that? How much of the theme of that book was merely his own imagination of how it could get in the worse case scenario and how much was based on some real reason why he would project such an idea?If anyone knows of any literary study or analysis on the subject of the contents of \\"The Book\\" within 1984, I would be very interested to hear about it."},{"Title":"1984","review":"A story of what could be.

One that is proving all too real."},{"Title":"1984","review":"George Orwell wrote this classic in 1948. He set it 36 years into the future. He was a visionary with facts in hand. The dark world he portrayed came to pass much sooner than he had predicted. Big Brother became a catch-word for all of the invasive technology that now monitors our lives.

Having seen the world a bit and watched the advent of the information explosion and how it has affected the way governments interact with their citizens, I find that we need to think about the themes that this classic brings up. Read it again. You will like it."},{"Title":"1984","review":"George Orwell's landmark book 1984 is one of the most important books of the twentieth century. Orwell was deeply distressed at the totalitarian experiments of Soviet Russia and Nazi Germany. He thought that government surveillance and control of the press were trends that could make life an unliveable distopian nightmare.Orwell was a keen observer who saw trends developing in the future. He saw that as technology got more advanced, the repressive governments could gain greater controls of the populace. Orwell saw the rise of China as a reality in the future. He believed that the governments would foster a climate of perpetual war to provide a clear and present danger and a justification for empowering a military-industrial complex and giving justification for the strict controls of communication and the dissemination of information.Orwell shows that the egalitarian rhetoric of the corrupt regimes would never lead to better quailty of life for the peoples of the world. There would be perpetual shortages of consumer goods similar to those of Stalinist Russia. Orwell saw the secret police and show trials of the Soviet Union and the need for occasional purges as especially frightening trends.Orwell did not have a positive outlook about the future. His story of the travails of Winston Smith at the hands of \\"Big Brother\\" serves as a warning of what could be the result when people fail to be vigilant about protecting fundamental human rights. Orwell was a socialist with anarchist tendencies. However, his warnings can be valuable for people of any ideological persuasion. The book reminds people of the need to protect the right of open communication in the society. Orwell was a critic of the stifling censorship he witnessed in that era. 1984 is an essential book to read. It teaches some valuable lessons about the fact that freedom is fragile and people need to be watchdogs to protect basic civil liberties."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Still a most perceptive and amazing book. I first read this in about 1959 as part of ENGLISH 101 requirement. It moved me then and continues to worry me even more now with the advent of CCTV cameras and rising militancy everywhere."},{"Title":"1984","review":"\\"Freedom is the freedom to say that two plus two make four.\\"Under Big Brother's omniscient eyes, Winston Smith tried to ignite his only freedom, the freedom to believe in \\"obvious\\" truths, but by the novel's end, at the caf&eacute; Winston was unsure what two plus two would make, a sign that O'Brien had successfully reintegrated a \\"lost soul\\" and Winston had become like his friends and neighbors, unable to question and thus unable to revolt. What sends shivers down our spines is not the various tortures O'Brien performed, but after these tortures, Winston's total capitulation&#61630;mind, body, and soul&#61630;to Big Brother. When the mind kowtows to external authority and ceases to reflect and question, then the individual had successfully metamorphosed into a machine.Winston, by editing previous documents to conform to Oceana's present position, such as whether Eurasia is friend or foe, had helped the regime's guardians, who like O'Brien believed \\"who controls the past controls the future; who controls the present controls the past,\\" mold the citizens' minds. But Oceana, like other totalitarian regimes, also turned to the indispensable tool, fear, to chisel its citizens' minds and hearts to its agenda's shape and form. To stimulate fear and rouse its citizens to a common cause, it would when necessary create fathom enemies, either Eurasia or Eastasia, even though these totalitarian regimes also had similar ideologies, or rather, like Oceana, no ideologies.Under 1984's dystopian sky, Winston must bow, not only because of Big Brother's overwhelming power and presence, but also because of Winston's inability to form any ideologies. Even though he wanted to think freely, he lacked the training and thus the analytical mind to counter O'Brien's offenses. In the end, his mind followed the path of least resistance.Orwell's 1984 is a dark apocalypse of sub-human society where homo-sapiens had replaced machines to operate an efficient hierarchy, an apocalypse which any people would usher wherever and whenever they ceased to question \\"intuitively obvious truths.\\""},{"Title":"1984","review":"George Orwell's 1984 is unquestionably one of my favorite novels, if not my favorite (and not merely because the title is my birth year). Powerful and enlightening, it offers the reader a glimpse into a society in which the omnipotent State controls the populace through manipulation of language, alteration of the past, and other devices. With a population composed of brainwashed Party members and apathetic proles, the zeitgeist is characterized by contented and unthinking servitude to Big Brother. Yet Winston Smith (committing an odious, illicit act) begins to think negatively of the status quo, giving the basis of this thought-provoking novel. Admittedly, one section (but only one!) becomes a bit tedious, Goldstein's book. Keep reading! The immaculate third chapter soon follows, culminating in the most effectual ending that I have ever read. Its impact proves that Orwell successful captivated the reader throughout the novel. I wonder, considering that literature as chimerical as David Deutsch's Fabric of Reality gains placement as non-fiction, if 1984 has been incorrectly categorized. It would not surprise me if Pol Pot had used this novel as a guide book. Of course, elements are also apparent in modern American society, from the welfare state to political correctness to surveillance devices. The advice I give to the prospective reader is this: quit reading reviews (in a worst case scenario one might learn the ending) and read 1984!~pythia~"},{"Title":"1984","review":"Depressing stuff and quite emotional, considering that I have experienced some of this dismal world for 18 years (xUSSR).

Then in a blink of an eye Global Warming mutated into Climate Change. Again, everybody believes in it. They don't understand it, but they believe in it. They don't question it. They no longer have an ability/brain power to do it. They blindly believe/trust someone who allegedly knows more. Some who have retained the ability to question are the enemies. How many scientist who dared to voice their disbelieve in Global Warming were booed down by their colleagues and had to quit?It is but one example.That's life, isn't it?"},{"Title":"1984","review":"A lot of readers seem to miss the point of this novel (especially the people who gave it 1 star, that's just weak). It's not about Orwell guessing what the world would be like in 1984 or really even a poke at communism. Orwell presents an exaggerated and seemingly impossible not-so-distant future to the reader and supports it magnificently with parallelisms to religion and ideology. He addresses whether freedom of the mind is intrinsic to the human conscience and whether or not free thought is necessary for human happiness. It also questions what is real or true. Does 2+2=5? If you believe it and everyone else believes it, than why in the hell wouldn't it be so. The novel left me more afraid of the masses and the susceptibility of the human mind than the government. The people can take back control at the drop of a hat and they are the ones who allow it to get out of control in the first place."},{"Title":"1984","review":"It isn't happening exactly the way Orwell thought it would but close enough for \\"government work\\" as they say. The few differences are covered in \\"Brave New World\\" (I always tell my associates to take 1984 and Brave New World, toss them in a blender and then pour out the situation that exists today) as far as the covert aspects of a government controlled society (although the government didn't have to take over the media; the media is going along willingly without government control and the \\"feelies\\" (to keep people occupied doing ANYTHING other than contemplating the government)are being provided by I-pod, X-box and a host of other distractions provided to preclude the population from observing much of anything outside the immediate sphere of their own existence.I purchase copies of this book whenever I spot them in a used book store and then hand them out like candy to co-workers and friends - just to get them to start thinking about what's going on now. After reading the Federalist Papers, Letters from Jefferson and other \\"Founding Father's Documents\\" it apparent that where we are today is nothing akin to where they would have envisioned us to be - it was \\"Promote the general welfare\\" not \\"give out welfare\\", \\"pursuit of happiness\\" not \\"make sure everyone is happy\\". We are where we are today by ignoring what's going on and allowing a government similar to the one's that Orwell and Huxley predicted would develop. If you have yet to read this book then grab a copy and contemplate a further projection of the predictions; where is the control by the government over the \\"citizens\\" [subjects?] going to be in another ten years?"},{"Title":"1984","review":"This is the most depressing tale I have ever read. Though I know it to be fiction, I still can't take myself out of its ending. Although you KNOW for certain how the story will end, one could even imagine writing the plot exactly as it is only half way through the book, you could still not imagine the profoundness in which it was written and the mood it puts you in. It is also one of the most mentally exhausting reads. Taking you from logical absurdities to the haziness of dream worlds to metaphysical discussions.Ok, so why am I giving it 5 stars despite all this?Because in doing it the way it is, Orwell has succeeded in transferring to you his absolute HATRED of mental bondage, and of absolute unchecked human authority, and anything and everything that can lead to them. The rate at which the story is advanced towards the darkness and viciousness, the way he never for a moment leaves a prickle of hope in you heart or your mind about the final outcome of the protagonists or the world in which he lives, all reflect in no uncertain terms this hatred. Sometimes you think to yourself reading this \\"ok, I get it, why all this darkness\\"? Then, you realize what he was doing. He is shouting with the top of his lungs to all of us to NEVER EVER let things even approach the conditions of \\"Airstrip one\\".What I have found most amazing in the novel towards the end is his resolution of a question that kept lingering in the protagonist's mind throughout the story; the \\"why?\\", why would the \\"Party\\" or the people in it do that? I have seen few reviewers allude to it. His answer was as simple and unexpected to me as it was to Winston - the protagonist, yet was perfectly inline with the extreme world Orwell built. There is no \\"why\\", there is no logic to explain it. Power is an end, not a means. In the words of the party members: \\"GOD is power\\". There is no reason for such attrocities but a sheer animalistic lust for power. Again, he is in a way saying: \\"don't ever try to rationalize it to yourself or others\\".What sets \\"1984\\" apart from its famous sibling \\"Animal Farm\\", which by the way was also very depressing, is that it is not tailored to the history of the Communists. You could see, in a sense, the development of Orwell's thought while writing these two pieces. He started with the first to document one of the worst forms of collectivism that he witnessed, then - seeing at that time no sign of it being defeated or abated - took it to its extreme form. Such a form was sufficiently general to cover all types of mind slavery, to the extent that it can be applicable everywhere. I belive he might have even hinted at that in the part where he recounts the \\"history of the world\\" that he imagined from the his time to 1984. In this history, ALL of the globe, is ruled the same way albeit with different names and insignificant changes in ideology.It is impossible to read 1984 without drawing parallels between contemporary events and something that is taking place in the novel. Indeed, one might never find a place where this kind of world exists. Yet, there is always something to draw parallels upon. Here, in the States, when you here the words \\"spin masters\\", you can't help but think of the principle of \\"doublethink\\"; in which one can not only muster the ability to consciously think of something and its opposite at the same time, yet somehow be able to believe both of them. You hear the word \\"alternate reality\\" in which people hear, read, and see the facts yet still are able to fit them into their worldview. A view in which internment is justified, the poor are robbing the rich, dissent is treason, torture is patriotism, failures are successes, and everything you think is true is a lie fabricated by the an enemy called \\"the main stream media\\". Then, you can't help but think of the \\"Ministry of truth\\" and the \\"Ministry of love\\".Orwell is a champion of freedom at all levels, but most importantly in \\"1984\\", he is a champion of common sense.\\"Freedom is the ability to say that two plus two equals four\\".1984 is a must read for all."},{"Title":"1984","review":"George Orwell has not only written an engaging and entertaining, (though sometimes depressing, but in a necessary way) dystopic-future novel; he has also given the reader both political and human insights.Although you won't find a happy ending in Orwell's masterpiece, the reader will enjoy the suspense of the dangers of Winston's world. I could also sympathize with the romance between Winston and Julia, two lovers finding solace in each other while in deadly and dead surroundings. The prose is descriptive but also moves the reader along and lets the reader contemplate the book's political and human insights.Politically it is still very relevant. There are still toltalitarian governments and the situation that Winston suffers parallels not exactly, but is similair to the lives of many in third world countries with opressive dictators.It could even be used symbolically to satirize America. Sometimes the government tells the press and the public lies. It has happened before. Think of Watergate. And to be fair to both parties I'll include both Bill Clinton's lies and the lies about Vietnam.Humanely, it is a moving novel, showing man's inhumanity to man; the ability for a government to have such strength as to wipe out our signiture features: religion, love, freedom, and even language. (By this I mean Newspeak, a form of writing the government imposes into the newspapers.)This is a bizarre, moving, heart-breaking novel about a negative-Utopia.I highly reccomend this book to thinkers, non-thinkers, or anyone who likes to read."},{"Title":"1984","review":"George Orwell's &quot;1984,&quot; published in 1949, projects a parallel world 35 years into the future in which all nations have been combined into three major superpowers in an eternal state of unrest. London still exists, but it is now a part of Oceania, governed by an entity called the Party, headed by a sovereign figure known only as Big Brother. The Party's one goal is power -- power over everybody and everything in Oceania. Surveillance is administered constantly; devices called telescreens are placed in people's homes to monitor thoughts and actions and broadcast Party propaganda continuously, with no way for the resident to turn his off or change the channel. Free thinkers are not tolerated, and roving bands of &quot;Thought Police&quot; are sent to sniff out transgressors. The Party is developing an official language called Newspeak, whose goal is to simplify language by eliminating as many extraneous words as possible and reducing vocabulary to a small number of basic words, thus narrowing the scope of thought.But there's always a rebel. The protagonist is a man named Winston Smith who works at the Ministry of Truth as a sort of professional history revisionist. His job is to revise newspaper articles and documents in which Big Brother made predictions or statements that did not agree with the actual outcome of events; in other words, to maintain the public illusion that the Party is infallible and omniscient. Unhappy with his state of being, Winston would like to overthrow the Party but is powerless to do so. Teaming up with his love interest Julia, another Party worker, he colludes with a high-ranking Party official named O'Brien, who reveals himself as a secret member of a society called the Brotherhood who are planning to destroy the Party. O'Brien gives Winston a subversive book explaining the ideals and motivations of the Party: The upper classes (the highest Party members) need to retain their economic status, so it is important to control the minds and bodies of the lower classes, and wars are waged constantly only so that capital will be spent on the production of war machinery instead of being converted into wealth which could be distributed to the lower classes.Winston knows that if he is caught as a dissident, he's dead. The Thought Police are everywhere, and can he trust Julia, O'Brien, and the friendly old shopkeeper Mr. Charrington to be who they say they really are? Predictably, he is apprehended, but the Party's plans involve not killing but reprogramming him, which unfortunately for poor Winston could be a fate worse than death.&quot;1984&quot; is not strictly an anti-communist rant. (For that, see Arthur Koestler's &quot;Darkness at Noon.&quot;) Rather, it attacks the complacency of all people and nations who would let a small number of idealists have their way and take command over the rest of the population. Semantics aside, Communism and Fascism, as practiced by certain Twentieth Century world powers, are essentially the same thing: the individual loses all his importance for the benefit of the nation, which really means the ruling Party. If democracy requires eternal vigilance, &quot;1984&quot; illustrates the consequences of apathy."},{"Title":"1984","review":"This book vividly portrays the most extreme end of socialism's slippery slope. The book is terrifying to read because the eery science fiction-like society which Orwell describes is not so inconceivable. I lived in Russia a few years ago and was struck by the cold impersonal drabness of everything. In the blank, hollow, empty eyes of many of Russia's elderly I saw how tyranny had literally erased personality. The spark of humanity which puts light in the eyes had been doused, and all that was left was a shell of a human being who was no longer a person, but merely a function with no independent thought. George Orwell's 1984 has existed to a large degree in totalitarian regimes of the past, and its radical egalitarian roots exist in society today. They seem to be an integral part of human nature's dark side.Two things in this book were especially profound for me. First was Orwell's exposition of the social conflicts between the highs, the middles, and the lows, which Winston Smith read about in Goldstein's book. George Orwell understood totalitarianism well enough to see that equality is not socialism's end, but merely the propagandistic means for replacing the highs. Self-serving tyrants inevitably usurp socialism's ideals and use them to become the highs themselves, indulging themselves in privilege at the expense of the rest of society. After reading Goldstein's book, Winston understood the how, and O'Brien explained to him the why when he declared, chillingly, that power was an end in and of itself.The second thing which struck me as profound was Orwell's exposition of Newspeak, the official language of Oceania which robbed people of their ability to think by robbing them of their ability to express thoughts in words. Rudimentary examples of doublethink, crimethink, and the thought police can be seen in various political groups within our society today.This book is brilliant and prophetic, a must read for all those socialist utopians who have forgotten the dark realities of human nature."},{"Title":"1984","review":"1984 is unquestionably one of the greatest books in the history of English literature. A terrifying look at the dangers of totalitarian government, it is ingeniously written and scarily realistic. George Orwell is meticulously thorough in his depiction of a world that is bleak, hopeless, and horrifying--and perhaps not as distant as we think. The writing style is factual and almost impersonal, reflecting not only the government but the people themselves, who have been reduced to unthinking robots. Protagonist Winston Smith's resistance against Big Brother (the symbolic leader of the Party) and ultimate complete acceptance and execution demonstrate the debility and irresolution of the human mind and spirit. The authoritarian government itself is eerily familiar, complete with conspiracies, cover-ups, and double-dealing politicians. While the year 1984 is long past, the book is still a relevant and potent warning of what the future may bring if we let it. The concept of 1984 is brilliant, the writing is brilliant, and it is nearly impossible not to love this book. 1984 is a definite must-read for anyone. Enthusiastically recommended; 5 stars."},{"Title":"1984","review":"_Nineteen Eighty Four_, first published in 1949 by George Orwell (pen name of Eric Blair), is a horrifying dystopian novel of a world in which the individual human being has been completely degraded and deprived of his fundamental humanity that reflects the totalitarianisms of the day, particularly communism and Stalinism. George Orwell (1903 - 1950) was the pen name of the British author Eric Blair, who developed an early enmity towards those in power and their abuses of power. Orwell was a socialist but came to witness the horrors of the Soviet state and the betrayal of his ideals by Stalinists. As such, Orwell came to loathe totalitarianism in general and wrote novels showing the degrading effects such societies had on people. Throughout this book, one can witness the underlying hatred of Orwell and those imprisoned by the system for the totalitarian state and bureaucracy which completely controls their lives and existences. This book in particular shows that rage in the main character of Winston Smith, a mere pawn in a totalitarian society. Orwell's books are indeed prophetic and show us a world in which the very life-force has been sapped out of mankind by those in power. Orwell imagines a highly efficient totalitarian state, capable of enforcing political correctness at the highest levels, tampering with the memories of men, and maintaining a total disregard for the truth. Orwell shows how under such regimes the very notion of truth becomes suspect and the individual can no longer distinguish between fact and state propaganda. This particularly applies to the Soviet Union under Josef Stalin, which is the primary setting for Orwell's stories. However, Orwell's books are also applicable to the West of today, where the constant menace of totalitarian ideology exists._1984_ gives us a whole slew of new terminology to describe the situation as it exists in a totalitarian state in which political correctness is enforced. The book introduces such terms as thought police, thought crime (and thought criminal), doublethink, memory hole, Ingsoc, and Newspeak. Such terms reflect the complete disregard of the totalitarian state for the truth and the active promotion of propaganda within society. They have also largely entered into our culture as expressions to describe the enforcement of political correctness._1984_ focuses on the main character Winston Smith, a member of the Outer Party who lives in England and works for the Ministry of Truth. As it turns out, the Ministry of Truth ironically is responsible for spreading propaganda, and as all ministries mentioned by Orwell has a purpose exactly opposite to its stated purpose. The world of 1984 is a very bleak one indeed, run by a single party and its ruling leader \\"Big Brother\\", in which all individuals are subject to surveillance by the state should they commit a \\"thought crime\\". All expressions of individuality in 1984 have been wiped out and the human being is totally degraded living a pathetic existence of total subservience to the party. Sexuality has been suppressed as part of the \\"Anti-sex League\\" as well as religion. Truth itself is highly malleable and memory is constantly distorted, reflected in such ironical and oxymoronic sayings of the party as \\"War Is Peace\\", \\"Freedom Is Slavery\\", and \\"Ignorance Is Strength\\". Further, the nation of Oceania is constantly at war with either Eurasia or Eastasia, varying from day to day and reflected in the official propaganda of the state bureaucracy. All party members revere their leader \\"Big Brother\\" (perhaps reminiscent of Josef Stalin or other totalitarian dictators) and despise the rebellious \\"Goldstein\\" (perhaps reminiscent of the Soviet hatred for Leon Trotsky). Further, the party exists in a caste system in which the \\"proles\\" (the proletariat) live underneath the party members (who are divided into the Inner and Outer Party). Winston Smith works for the Ministry of Truth but begins to keep a diary (which is strictly forbidden to party members) in which he reflects his hatred for \\"Big Brother\\". His work involves developing propaganda for the party. At work he meets up with Julia, who he initially believes is a strict orthodox member of the party. However, eventually he comes to realize that Julia is in love with him and they have a secret encounter in the countryside. Eventually Julia expresses to Winston her complete loathing for the party, though she publicly maintains a persona of utter obeisance and orthodoxy and belongs to the \\"Anti-sex League\\". Together they find a new hiding place in a shop in a part of the city where the \\"proles\\" live and attempt to re-discover the past of England. Throughout this period, however, the two live in constant fear of the thought police, should they catch onto their affair. Eventually, Winston meets up with O'Brien at work, a man who he believes is a member of the Resistance, and is given a copy of Goldstein's book which explains the rise of the party and the need for perpetual war. Orwell quotes extensively from Goldstein's book which reflects much of the social thinking of the time, in particular the theory of managerial elites. However, Winston and Julia are captured by the party and it turns out that O'Brien is in fact a member of the party. While taken captive, both are tortured and made to recant their original beliefs about the party. In a particularly disgusting scene, Winston is taken to Room 101 where he must face his worst fear. There he ultimately betrays Julia (as she has already betrayed him) to save himself from being tortured by rats (the worst torture that he can imagine). Eventually, Winston is completely re-educated and made to love \\"Big Brother\\" while his relationship with Julia is forever changed after their mutual betrayals of each other. Thus, ends in the most horrifying of manners Orwell's classic novel. Orwell concludes with an appendix on \\"The Principles of Newspeak\\" which effectively shows how even the language itself can be put to the purposes of propaganda within a totalitarian state._1984_ remains a classic dystopia reflecting the darker side of human existence within the Twentieth Century as it played out in the totalitarian dictatorships of the age. Throughout this novel, the very notion of truth remains problematic, as the party re-defines history to reflect its own agenda and thus even memory itself becomes distorted. Orwell shows the sheer degradation that the human being undergoes within such a surveillance society, to the eventual point where a man can be tortured by the powers that be to such an extent that he will eventually even renounce his love and embrace the figure he hates the most. While the novel is made to reflect Soviet society and Stalinism in particular, it also reflects the modern world in general, in which large-scale and efficient bureaucratic structures rob man of his humanity. Orwell's novels prove particularly prescient warnings to mankind to avoid the dangers of totalitarianism. As such, they should be read by all thinking individuals who seek to understand the horrors that can be inflicted upon the human being through totalistic societies."},{"Title":"1984","review":"This is a book which will haunt you all your life.

The undertones of hopelessness, poverty, evil, and senselessness are ever present in this terrifying novel that I believe will outlive us all. One can only wonder why this novel was not put on the blacklist of Joseph McCarthy, who dubbed so many classics as &quot;Unamerican&quot;.

They were Big Brother. Through out the centuries, men have preached equality and hipocrosy. They were Big Brother. Through out the centuries, men have preached non-thought and conformity. They were Big Brother. Through out history, a long line of men have stood, begining with Plato, continuing with Stalin, and propagated today by every man, woman, and child who believes that 2+2=5, that A is not A.These men have stood for Big Brother, have stood for Ingsoc, have stood for evil, and have stood for 1984. George Orwell's masterpiece stood for all that which conflicted with those ideals: for love, for happiness, for individualism, for ego. On the surface, Orwell paints a picture more sickening, and more chilling to any person who believes that they are, that they are not a group, not a consortium, but exist in and for their own right.This is not a Utopia; this is what could happen, not what has happened. It is a testament to those who will not take the easy way out, will not conform. It is instead a tribute to those who rage against the dying of the light, for those who think, and those who know that 1984 can be stopped, by those who have stopped it through out the centuries: those who will not sanctify the punishment of virtue. The hero of this book is not Winston; it is the old prole' hanging out laundry, and making the song written by a machine a thing of beauty. In the end, the proletariat must rise; for they are not the lowest class, but the highest. The party members consider themselves higher because they have force, and therefor, by their reckoning, power. But they do not; they have nothing; everything is the Party's.

Winston Smith is a man struggling between the past and the future and lost in the present. The Thought Police along with Big Brother make the laws, rules, theories, past, present and future, and all that is. Life in 1984 is Big Brother. When Winston falls in love with a woman named Julia, a forbidden act, he becomes hopeful in his efforts to defy Big Brother. The force of it's power and strength is too strong and over powering, and Winston is crushed. Winston is a grain of sand on a beach owned by Big Brother. One grain, in the world of 1984, cannot rule the beach. The beach, by definition, is all the grains of sand. Without each grain, the beach would cease to exist.

I am reminded by the quote,\\"Power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely.\\" This speaks to the corruption that can result from a search for power, where personal power becomes powermongering over others. It also implies the power of belief over the mind and the struggle between the individual and the group consciousness. The ending is utterly tragic and the coldbloodedness of the Ministry of Love shocked me to the bone. I have read this book a few times and would strongly recommend it to anyone wishing to see the danger that may result in giving up one's freedom for security and the ability to think for oneself in return for comfort. Here, \\"ignorance is bliss.\\""},{"Title":"1984","review":"To me it is somewhat surprising how few people think this is a book about perception and how that perception can be circumvented and subverted by the use of semantics. This should be obvious since Orwell actually takes the trouble to stop the book in mid-stride and lecture the reader about things like \\"doublethink\\". Jane Austen's \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is also a book about perception, so much so that one of the Penguin Paperback editions has an entire introduction devoted to this idea. This is why Austen's book is still so timely and why \\"1984\\" is more timely than ever.The liberal left in America has had it's ability to reason literally overwhelmed in some instances by it's own political agenda. If Orwell could have I'm sure he would have coined the phrase, \\"political correctness\\". Political correctness blinds a person to any solution that does not fit in with their world view and so America has become a very troubled place indeed; in America, rape by one group can be the result of 'generational rage' and by another a predatory crime. Crime itself becomes politicized according to skin color. Words like 'colonialism', and 'imperialism' have had to be redefined by the Left in order to portray America in the light they wish. On the Left, it is taken for granted that all cultures are equal, separated only by opportunity and not by an inherent brilliance or lack of it; the benefits of multiculturalism, as a result, are taken for granted and not to be even questioned and America's immigration policy reflects this tenet.The political Left in America in the 21st century has taken on the delusional aspects of the Right in the 1960,s, seeing what it wishes to see and deriding all else with an airy, moral wave of the hand. Obsessed with race, the Left projects its own obsession with skin color onto millions of white Americans it doesn't even know.The Left in America projects it's own oppressive and smothering presence onto the country as a whole in the name of political freedom while absolving America's criminal oppressors of guilt; it is the 'system' that is guilty and the 'real' criminal. Criminals become heros, and lack of achievement celebrated in patronizing asides while success itself is deemed immoral without regard to the intent of the opposite side of that success. Thus failure attains morality in an Orwellian way that is most troubling. The left assigns morality wholesale in stereotypes that consign a banker to spiritual bankruptcy and a college student the opposite in a bigoted default system totally unaware of it's own racism and lack of perception of reality.The political Left in America is caught in the very perceptual trap that Orwell warned about; that trap is insidious and blinds one to it's very walls.Lack of achievement in America on the part of certain groups in relegated to a concept of a generational hangover while achievement is deemed a result of privilege; in the eyes of the Left, both groups are in fact exactly equal in terms of competence.In America, the Left would have you believe that everyone is exactly equal, the \\"dictatorship of the proletariat\\" as it were in not a class struggle but an evening out of class, based on the 'coulda, woulda, shoulda' view that there must be a reason why some groups achieve and others do not aside from their own endemic value system or lack of it. In this scenario success itself achieves a type of tainted corruption while lack of success is to be excused, examined, mitigated and measured in every possible way but what counts and that is as Orwellian as it gets.\\"Big Brother\\" isn't watching everyone, just those it deems watchable by skin color, success and and entirely de-contextualized cultural history every bit as subversive as Winston's job."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Once science fiction, now daily reality: constant war, newspeak, doublethink, surveillance by hidden cameras (and now satellites), TV sets humming 24/7 in many homes, political cover-ups, repression, restriction of language and the concomitant impoverishment of thought, manipulation on many levels.

I realize that the powers that be always have their own agenda, which invariably differs completely from the people's interests.

It has led down some frightening paths that more people should be going down, for truly we are living in Nineteen Eighty-Four this very minute.And as a bit of clarification, Orwell was not \\"predicting\\" this dystopia for 1984, as some have written here. He was not a soothsayer. With this book he artfully expounds on his experiences working in the real \\"Ministry of Truth\\" during World War II: the BBC's Propaganda department.

In the book, George Orwell may well have been warning of the dangers of the Soviet Union and totalitarianism. However, even as these facets of our world have faded, the nightmare of 1984 is still too feasible.The plot of a defective man and his internal struggle against an omnipotent government is familiar to most. The main character Winston Smith can not reconcile the lies that the government has fed to others. He often sees his comrades as being \\"paralyzed by their own stupidity\\". Winston's search for something more not only sanctions the ire of the government, but draws ostracism from his peers. In the end, we see that without the all controlling government, Winston whithers away into less than a man. This is the ultimate danger of a government that has grown too powerful.Perhaps no chapter in the book is more potent than Section IV of Chapter III. In this section, Winston reads from the manual of the brotherhood. In a passage that is all too real, the book derides the profitability of war, the class stucture/structure of government, and the failures of previous governments. We also learn the meaning of Big Brother's motto, \\"Who controls the past, controls the future; who controls the present, controls the past.\\"After being in publication for more than half of a century, 1984 is still a literary masterpiece and one of my absolute favorite books."},{"Title":"1984","review":"George Orwell (1903-1950) wrote 1984 in the late 1940s,and the novel was published in 1949. This book was a description of a negative utopia,and served as a warning to the West of not only future events but events that had already occured in Western Europe and the United States. In fact, the original title of 1984 was 1948, but Orwell's publishers thought a futuristic title would increase sales of the book. There are three basic warnings in this book. One is that the status of \\"perpetual war for perpetual peace\\" was a permanent feature. Secondly, Orwell was clear about the corrpution of language and thought that could be used to manipulate the masses (the proles as describved in the book). The third warning was the use of war to maintian unity and the illusion of full employment.The shifting of political alliances in 1984 has an all to familiar ring. Note that during the first had of the decade of the 1940s that the Soviets, Chinese, etc. were gallant allies. On the other had, the Japanese, Germans, and the Italians were the forces of evil beyond redemption. Yet, by 1948, or 1946, the scene dramatically changes. All of a sudden, the Soviets were the evil \\"Gremlins in the Kremlin.\\" The Chinese suddenly became wicked. The previously defined wicked Germans, Japanese, and Italians were now suddently \\"good guys.\\" One should also that those who clearly wrote about this in any honest context were badly smeared or condemned for being honest.Another part of 1984 which should be closely examined is the corrpution of language. The politically approved words such as democracy, world peace, etc., are part of the media's cowardly effort to avoid truth. Political hacks use these approval words in a flimsy attempt to pose as experts assigned to explain the changes of \\"allies\\" and power shifts. Orwell was always aware of the corruption of language and, in turn, the corruption of thought. The examples Orwell uses in 1984 should attract the attention of thoughtful men.Orwell was one of the few who saw the connection between war and economics. He was one of the first who saw war production as an economic engine to maintain something close to full employment. He lived through the Great Depression and realized that wars are started not so much to defeat the enemy as to maintain political unity and full employment on \\"the home front.\\" If a \\"war\\" can be prolonged, the better attempt to maintain war production and full employment. While living standards were not good, workers have the illusion that they are reasonable well off and are busy with important work.Orwell's 1984 should be required reading for any teenager. The political lessons derived from this book are important, and, as some have mentioned, one can learn good prose. Reading 1984 can help explain the shifting of alliances since the start of the Cold War and can help explain phony international tensions from the end of W.W. II to the present. One should reflect how many \\"enemies\\" and allies the Americans have had during this time as well as reflect on how enemies quickly become allies and vice versa. This reviewer would not recommend 1984 to anyone who is immune to reason."},{"Title":"1984","review":"In his book 1984, George Orwell predicts a bleak future for the world from his point of view. While written in 1949, this book is still pertinent today. Orwell describes a world in which people are conditioned to believe only what the government, known as Big Brother, wants them to.In this book, humans are denied many of the freedoms that people today fail to appreciate. Privacy is nonexistant, due to the installation of telescreens, like modern-day security cameras, in every room. Feelings and personal opinions are eradicated, and even one's own thoughts are not private, because the government can tell what you are thinking through even your slightest facial expressions. Questioning authority is an unheard of concept, and love toward another person taboo. Even the language is limited to a small range of words to eliminate the ability to think anything out of the pre-determined norm.Taking place in the city of London, 1984 revolves mainly around the character named Winston Smith, an Outer Party member in the three-class society. Smith lives in a shabby apartment and works at the Ministry of Truth, where he alters previously-written newspaper articles according to the government's liking. This ensures that the government can not be questioned, and they are always right. He is, in a sense, rewriting history.In the book, Smith considers himself an anomaly to the methodical and monotonous world in which he is living. He finds it hard to accept the ideals that Big Brother passes off as truth, and therefore considers himself an abnormality. He feels alone in his detestation of Big Brother's policies. Despite all this, Winston has to put up a facade for the outside world, so he is not percieved by the government as anything but normal.At the same time he is pretending to love and honor Big Brother and everything it stands for, Winston is secretly plotting its downfall. He thinks the only people who can do this are the proles, the lowest social class, because they make up the majority of the population. Knowing that he cannot defeat Big Brother single-handedly, Winston enlists the help of O'Brian, a member of the Inner Party, or the upper social class.Throughout the rest of the book, Winston enters the world of the Brotherhood, the organization against Big Brother. Will they succeed in their attempt to overthrow Big Brother? What will become of Winston and O'Brian? Will the rise of the individual ever transpire? You will have to read the book to find out.Personally, I thought 1984 was a, while somewhat depressing, thought-provoking glance at the possibility of a dictatorial society. It made me wonder if what we percieve as truths in the world are really truths, or if they are just what we are conditioned to accept as truths. 1984 is a timeless novel that makes you question everything from conformity to the government and the media. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who has ever questioned the standards that society revolves around today."},{"Title":"1984","review":"This is a wonderful book almost every moment is gripping.

In high school, between watching the JROTC guys (myself somewhat included) get brainwashed, the first season of the X-Files, and other books like Zamatin's IT and Huxley's Brave New World, I was a little skittish.

In my opinion, it is as classic as the Iliad, the Odyssey, and the Bible. It is nothing short of a masterpiece, written by a masterfull author. The hopeless and deeply depressing concepts and social conditions so eliquently described in this book are almost uncomprehensable in modern times. This book is a call to carefully monitor federalistic endeavors in the future for the betterment of humankind."},{"Title":"1984","review":"The prophecy, the nightmare, the year, the state of mind,the way of being, and yes, the classic novel itself are what 20th century intellectuals associate with George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four. Although this is how the book is perceived by most, the saga of character Winston Smith placed in an oppressive world ruled by the totalitarian perils of &quot;Big Brother,&quot; stands for more than just a year, or the political nightmare, Nineteen Eighty-Four signifies now. Nineteen Eighty-Four indicates the thoughts deep down inside one of us that denote our weakening of individuality and the wrath of group will that exploit this abatement. All of our trust in authority dissolves when the empty darkness of &quot;massmindness&quot; and &quot;doublethink&quot; swells by Orwell's amazing insight."},{"Title":"1984","review":"As the plot has already been summarized by all the other online-reviewers, I will put this simple and straight: I worship this book. Tell your grandchildren!"},{"Title":"1984","review":"I recently finished 1984, and I thought it was pretty cool. I was pulling for Winston and Julia all along, and I even had some doubts about O'Brien. I think Orwell's written a very political, social, economically minded book, that says some very important things about government control and oppression. Walter Cronkite's preface explains the book as a warning, and a successful one at that since our world has yet to fall into the depressing reality of Orwell's vision. I was disturbed, intrigued, and confused by the book, and it's prompted me to consider many different aspects of our present society, such as Newspeak and Doublespeak, governmental influences, and societal forces. Thanks Goeroge."},{"Title":"1984","review":"This is the best book that I have read. Orwell gets into the mind of the reader and makes him think about every thought he gets. I know that I will never think the same after having read this book. And to that guy from California, first of all learn how to spell and secondly, I didn't count the number of reviews posted but at least 90% rate this book as a ten or nine, and you are the only person that gave it a one."},{"Title":"1984","review":"I don't consider this book to be science-fiction. I consider this to be science-future.Leaving aside any criticism of current political parties, lets just say that 1984 is a warning about allowing the individual to be ruled by the state, about allowing the individual to fall into the collective.It can be a difficult book to read, because the concept itself is difficult in this day and age...the struggle to retain an individual mind. The book is about Winston Smith, living in a future world (1984 WAS the future in 1949 when the book was written) which is dominated by an all-present and all-powerful government which is partly based on Stalin's Russia, Hitler's Germany, and (gasp!) England and America. But the government which is symbolized by 'big brother' not only dominates the professional and personal world of Winston Smith, it also controls his thoughts, using constant brainwashing through media and imagery.Smith begins to assert his individualism, starts a love affair with a similar thinking woman and joins the resistance, which may only exist in his own mind. But Smith is doomed, there is no happy ending...only a warning to us all about trends in society. 1984 may have come and gone on the calendar, but IngSoc and Big Brother live on and continues to gain.This book has become the classic metaphor for the evils and failures of collectivist societies, and will haunt your ideas of political solutions to society's problems."},{"Title":"1984","review":"I truly believe this book was sent as a precautionary tale to future generations. If not, Orwell damn sure used a prohet's brain to pen this masterpeice. In a world that cares more about war, profit, and restricting civil liberties, we should be so bold as to read this and take notice. Our time as a free people is almost gone, and we will never, ever get it back.War is Peace. Freedom is Slavery."},{"Title":"1984","review":"I have decided to rewrite this review entirely, because it was not really a guide of the literary work, but rather an opinion on how totalitarism is taking over my country.If you are new to this singular book, in a way you are very fortunate. Its best to learn from the source itself the expressions such as: \\"big brother\\" and \\"Thought police\\".The book was written in 1948 and I onced heard that G.O. switched the last 2 digits to make the title for the book. Remember, WWII was ending but the totalitarian forces of the world were still operating and expanding (Stalinism and the communist revolution in China, etc).The narrative takes us to a somber future, England is part of an allied conglomarate always at war with other totalitarian conglomerates. We are told the story of a middle aged nobody (Winston) who has the courage to \\"rebell\\" in his mind and beging recording his thoughts and critisisims hiding it from the ever observing presence of the tv that controls all individuals. It is then that we learn that totalitarism is the suppression of the critical mind in favor of the collective mind that depends on the guidance of the \\"Great Leader\\", from where all truth emmanates. To explain the extent of the blindness of the masses, there is a scene occuring in the middle of a political rally as a speaker who is fiercely attacking one enemy suddenly receives the news that such enemy has now becomed an ally and that the former ally is now the enemy, and there, without loosing continuity in his speech, he decries a sabotage of thought and inmmediatly all masses start destroying all support banners they had, without questioning for a second the logic! .Our heroe here is has the rare chance to find a \\"liberation cell\\" that pretends to (what else?) finish with the status quo and let truth be known, the ideals are noble and Winston can even see the contradictions he has been living in all his life, yet he (sorry if this spoils it) pacts with the devil (the establishment) by accepting \\"all means necessary\\" to outs them.. and what amazes more, the devil is the creator of this recursive plot as a part of its research into the human mind and how to control it. It took me some time to really appreciatte the complexity of the reasoning behind the book.If you analyze the book from the perspective of the study of the control of the masses to justify a totalitarian state, then, I believe you will learn much. You can also insult me like other reviewers have, but please, take a look around, are we not seeing everywhere the same methods used on us?"},{"Title":"1984","review":"I cannot count the number of times I was asked, \\"What's so special about the year 1984?\\" while I was reading the book the title of which randomly forsees that particular year. That question scared me, because this novel is so important. Beyond that, I was floored that some people had not at least heard of \\"1984\\" (which was first published in 1949). That is not a criticism of those who are guilty of this, but rather an indication of my incredulity, because the impact had on our culture by Orwell's genius, manifested in \\"1984\\", cannot be overstated. As another reviewer here noted, it is indeed true that many people reference George Orwell's prescient masterpiece, oftentimes without realizing what it is that influenced their thought or even having actually read the book.\\"1984\\" animates the collective paranoia that stems from our well-founded wariness of contemporary society's ever-encroaching governmental systems, as well as the potential dangers introduced to them by the evolution of modern technology.Furthermore, it reminds those paying attention that we must guard our psyches and intellects against the mad intentions of those who forget, or disregard, the truth that to conform for conformity's sake alone is to surrender rights to humanity's defining gift.I would suggest that you don't pick \\"1984\\" as a casual beach-read. It is riveting, but heavy and thick with relevance to current events. Don't read it after having a few drinks either, especially when you come to the book-within-a-book portion."},{"Title":"1984","review":"First of all, a clarification is in order. George Orwell did not write this fortelling evil Republics or corrupt Democrats, as both parties would wish us to believe. It does not \\"apply\\" to today in the sense that events translate directly from the story to modern events. People too often make this mistake, and have turned this book from a chilling future into propoganda and lies. The messages, the themes, the lies-all of them can and do apply to our modern world. But Orwell wasn't saying \\"President Bush\\" or \\"John Kerry\\", or any other leader. He was saying \\"us\\"-this is where WE, the race of mankind, is headed. Read with that in mind.1984 is a misleading title, because it limits the book to that date. Rather, extend it to the future, as 1984 was when this was originally published. 1984 is a vision of a future where the government, Big Brother, rules everything. Literally. Individuals have no life save to aid Big Brother, truth is only what Big Brother says, regardless of history or facts. There is no past that cannot be changed, no event that cannot be made to disappear. This is not an uplifting book. This is not a book which will leave you thinking \\"We will rise above this\\", but instead, \\"We MUST rise above this\\", and that, I believe, was the author's intention. 1984 does not tell of one man's rise above his surroundings, but his falling into them. Too many people distort this for petty politics, and in doing so, fall into the pattern that 1984 warns us against. We twist words, create meanings, dice the novel into a form to fit our needs, but if you read 1984, that is not what this story is about. 1984 may well prove to be the strongest warning of a future that this world could so easily fall into, and its message must not be forgotten or lost. I beg you to ignore the popular trend of taking this book to support a political cause. It supports none but the cause of freedom and truth through telling of slavery and lies. The future that Orwell saw is nearer than we think, and it is only by understanding this story that it will diminish in threat. Read this book openly, without trying to pin parts of it to the modern world or to support your political party, but trying to apply the broad scope of this novel to our future. A powerful warning for all people to read and understand."},{"Title":"1984","review":"To those 37 people who rated this book with a One star, and to those 22 people who rated this book with two stars:Im the kindest and simplist words I can muster up, I am dreadfully sorry you did not approve of the book. Truely I am sorry.Orwellian's 1984 is simply a masterpiece that, while being frequently challanged for its content and it's ungraphic, unerotic sex scene, everyone should read. It tells of the protagonist, Winston, within his daily life in Oceania (the future London, England).Winston, is not unlike most people living in Oceania, he has a large television screen in his room which constantly spouts information spoon fed (and presumably processed) by the Ministry of Truth, which not only presents information, but creates the future, and changes the past to fit the glorification of their leader: Big Brother. The enormous screen is two-way, as much as you can see the man and/or woman in the broadcasting room, they can see Winston (or any other man or woman) in his daily life.Winston, is not unlike most Oceanians. He speaks English. But not the English of Shakespeare or Woolf, or of today's standards. His form of English has been chopped down to remove all possible loopholes, or Doublespeak. For instance, one may think of something as good, or ungood. Fast, or unfast. Big, or Unbig.Never: bad, slow, or small.Winston is not unlike most Oceanians, he has a job at the Ministry of Truth, (or Minitruth, just to remove loopholes once again), where he rewrites history. He receives information, such as the leader of England... I mean Oceania... being Winston Churchill... I mean Big Brother... and his sole succesful victory over the leader of the other two country-states.However, (to speed things up a bit) Winston falls in love. Love, is a forbidden thing in Oceania; people mate solely for bringing in more children. (These children are then whisked away for a sort of Secret Police/Gestapo-eske training so Big Brother can have another pair of eyes within each household. Oceania's next big attempt: to make the sexual impulse regulated)Winston and his lover soon meet for their sexual escepades away from the cameras, that are everywhere, and soon contact a small antique-shop owner who lives in the slums of Oceania for a room.The two rent the room, and unfortunately, the falling action of the story takes place there, where Winston and his lover are captured by the Thoughtpolice (The grown-up Gestapo) and are sent for brainwashing.To those who say the future would never become like this...In a local newspaper, the sewage pipeline owners were tossing around an idea of placing cameras in the septic pipes to see who, \\"Was pouring grease down their toilets.\\"Another Orwellian Innovation, while seemingly less \\"potent\\" is that of the Red Light Cameras. You do the logic.Big Brother is also invading Wal*Mart with his RF-ID chips that are used to \\"Track Inventory.\\"What happens if the Cashier coincidently \\"forgets\\" to take the chip off?Legislature has been considered that mandates a national ID card which can track where any citizen of the U.S. is at any time.Two other words: Patriot Act.However, I must say two, final things: First, I may sound like a shrill pessimist, however with the right mind, orchestrating the right, belligerant, and malignant agenda, a national catostrophy can fuel Orwellian invasions of privacy simply and unconditionally (see the reason above this paragraph.)And lastly, I take another reviewer, Mr. WiseToolz in which he reviews,\\"This book just didn't grab my attention. I simply couldn't \\"connect\\" with the characters (Winston, Julia, Syme, O'Brien and Big Brother). To me, they were all just a bunch of names and not \\"real\\" people. \\"Take away enough freedoms and instill enough mundanity, and people become, \\"just a bunch of names...\\".In closing, the book is an excellent piece of work that should be read with an open mind."},{"Title":"1984","review":"1984 is definitely one of those classics that should be required reading for everyone. Even if you're not interested in politics, this book gets under your skin to the very fears we have about the government controlling our lives. The message Orwell is conveying is indeed relevant to modern times with the war on terror, the Patriot Act, and media biases that are a part of the national conscience. The characters come alive through the vivid language and you grow to feel sympathetic to Winston and his psychological downspiral. This book is one that keeps you interested the whole time because of the suspense and wise foresight it contains. You will end the book feeling pensive and open to discuss what you agreed or disagreed with this novel. Bottom line: read the book!"},{"Title":"1984","review":"nineteen eighty-four was definitely a book with a storyline that fit my interests. Politics, psychology, love, sex, and unexpected twists of plot make it an interesting read. As one is reading, it's almost as if the reader is stuck in the same kind of darkness and ignorance that is imposed upon the characters. Will the next page be another mundane day in the live of Winston or will there be exciting happenings as the characters defy the absolute authority of the party? The reader must feel around in the dark so to speak, and the chronological jumps only make it more unpredictable.The predominating theme of the novel is the organization known as Ingsoc, or the english socialism movement-usually referred to as \\"the party.\\" The party rules over one of the three superstates-Oceania. Oceania is constantly at war with one of the other two superstates, which are Eastasia and Eurasia. This war becomes significant later in the book as a vital contributing factor to the success of the party's absolute rule. In Oceania there are three classes. The inner party (approx. 1% of the population) is at the topmost rung of society-afforded all the luxuries one could ask for to live comfortably. They also have the privilege of being allowed to turn off the hated telescreens, through which the \\"thought police\\" constantly watch the activities of every party member. The outer party (of which Winston Smith is a member-approx. 18% of the population) are the group of people who are the most psychologically controlled. Most are assigned jobs which involve the changing of historical records and falsifying the media. They are poorly provided for and closely controlled. Anyone smart or ambitious enough to be a danger to the power of the party is eliminated, and through psychological control, even their closest friends (or more appropriately \\"comrades,\\" as the party has abolished the concept of friendship) can be made to forget that the eliminated person ever existed. The party throughout the book is even hard at work creating a new language that will drastically narrow the ability of its speakers to think. All concepts which might be considered \\"thoughcrime\\" (i.e. ideas that might threaten the party) are destroyed by means of their removal from language-no words to describe them exist, and therefore the concepts cannot be grasped. The outer party is the cornerstone of Ingsoc. Third, there are the \\"proles,\\" or proletariats. They make up the other 81% of the population. The proles are more or less free to do as they please, considered to be harmless, and happy enough to live very simple lives in blissful ignorance.Winston Smith works for the Ministry of Truth, which ironically is in the business of fabricating intricate lies. Through the haze and stupor created by the psychological vice imposed upon him by the party, Winston occasionally has memories that the past was somehow better before the revolution that brought the party to power. Very early on in the book he has thoughts of escaping the watchful eyes of the thought police and living more freely. This eventually leads him to create a hiding place, and to fall in love with the secretly rebellious Julia. From here, Winston's adventure as a member of the secret \\"brotherhood\\" begins.For the most part, I had a wonderful time reading this book. I had a lot of trouble putting it down at times. The detailed descriptions, deep ideological explanations and very powerful overall moods that Orwell creates not only make the story realistic, but makes you feel as if you are part of the story-you can feel the misery and quiet outrage under the party's oppression. You can taste the freshness and novelty of the freedom when Winston and Julia hide in their apartment in the prole neighborhood. The ending is rather depressing and disappointing, but getting there is definitely a fun head trip. One final word of advice-don't pick this book up with the intention of only reading for a little while...it's quite impossible to do so."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Doesn't everybody have a list in their mind of the books they would like to read during their lifetime? '1984' has been on my list for many years and, with a long commute, I finally decided to get the audiobook.Although I would still say it is necessary reading for all people, especially at this juncture I think Americans should pick up this book. When I read the slogans of Big Brother, I felt sick:War is PeaceFreedom is SlaveryIgnorance is StrengthIn some ways, I feel like George Orwell from his 1948 perspective 'called it.' So many of the scenarios that he described are right on. He wrote this book after Stalin took power in Russia. Orwell had rejoiced at the Bolshevik Revolutions but when the reports of Stalin's brutality came out, he was upset.The first half of the book was great, but I have to warn you that the second half was extremely disturbing and depressing. I had a hard time listening (audiobook) to the last two cassettes. I did finish the book, but it was difficult.Even more than fifty years later, Orwell's words still have the power to affect the reader. '1984' is a valuable work that rings true."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Those last four words will make you CRINGE! Of course, they mean NOTHING to you if you haven't read the book. This is by far the most depressing book I've read. Stephen King's Stand can eat its heart out. A very frightening portrayal of life without privacy. Microphones in parks, surveillance mechanisms in all restaurants. Betrayal, love, hate, etc. I've read this book once, but I don't think I need to read it again, its effect was that powerful. A friend of mine also found this book depressing. Orwell does an outstanding narrative towards the end which contributes to the cringing part at the very end. I've read this book quite a while ago but its fascinating how much I remember it. This book shouldn't be ignored. Read it once, at once."},{"Title":"1984","review":"I have trouble believing you're even looking at this page if you're not planning on (or required to) read Orwell's shocking and gut-wrenching classic, but if for some reason you are, and you haven't read this, you should.Among the most disturbing novels I've read in my life, Orwell's' 1984 is a \\"prophetic, nightmarish vision\\" of the world which we might have found ourselves in had we not been vigilant in defending our personal rights. In this world, freedom of expression is a moot point, since freedom of thought has already been eliminated -- officials in a mysterious government organization known only as \\"The Party\\" have reduced the language of society to an abbreviated dialogue called Newspeak, which decimates the vocabulary of the people, and makes the communication, expression, or formation of many ideas impossible. Using tactics of artificial wars and group hate sessions to keep the public united, the Party has perfected this complete censorship of society to an art -- even the news is processed by the Party, allowing them to change the past, present, and future as needed with a few taps on the keyboard. Records are meaningless unless they come from Party hands, and Party members are free to revise records as needed.The nightmare that Orwell presents is a world in which there is no truth to be found, because there is no subjective view allowed to the individual.His vision is strengthened in impact by his particularly strong writing and descriptive style -- one particular scene focusing on mental torture (using rats!), and the use of fear as a persuasive mechanism, is among the most disturbing I have ever read, and will ever read. If I enjoyed this novel, it was only in the most morbid, shivering, appreciative sense, but I wouldn't have missed it for the world, all the same.This book, in my mind, far surpasses the supposedly comparable Brave New World."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Please don't think me arrogant, but I've always thought of myself as a rather capable reviewer of the modern novel. I've read just about every kind of book I can think of(Orwell to Hemingway-London to Stevenson-King to Koontz- and yes, even those trashy little pulp novels with stories of witches and heroes)and have enjoyed in some manner or another almost every one. But, fellow readers, if I was forced to choose a single book, just one to promote to those people eager to turn pages, it would be George Orwell's classic story of Oceania. &quot;1984&quot; From its first paragraphs to the final four words, this book grabs the reader's attention and just refuses to let go. Orwell's story deals with a man named Winston, an employee at Oceania's Ministry of Truth, who is responsible for the almost daily altering and destruction of historical documents and photographs in an effort to serve the political interests of a group known simply as &quot;the Party.&quot; With such activities as &quot;Hate Week&quot; and public slogans like &quot;War is Peace Freedom is Slavery Ignorance is Strength&quot; the forementioned party keeps to its philosophy of Totalitarianism with a firm and painful grip. And I won't forget to mention the leader of it all, a pseudo-religious figure named Big Brother who never fails to rid Oceania of its more troublesome citizens with the help of the infamous &quot;Thought Police,&quot; an elite and cruel gestapo-like police force charged with the task of making those citizens of Oceania brave or foolish enough to speak ill of &quot;the Party's&quot; policies or even look unsatisfied at home(their is human as well as mechanical surveillance everywhere)disappear in a discrete and timely manner. &quot;1984&quot; seems more like a hint, a prediction if you will, of a future disturbingly possible(it was written in 1949). The book moves at a quick pace and even the most casual reader would have little trouble with the language. Don't miss this one folks. It's definitely worth the time."},{"Title":"1984","review":"\\"Freedom is the freedom to say two plus two is four.\\"To say 1984 is an amazing and powerful novel is the understatement of the century. Never have I ever read a book so powerful and meaningful. 1984 is a book that transcends time because 1984 will always be pertinent. Orwell created a timeless tale about power, freedom, and social classes. No review I could ever write could do 1984 justice but I shall try.1984 is a dystopian novel complete with action, romance, and politics. I'll be honest here. Normally I don't read serious literature and I hate politics. Reading 1984 was me metaphorically \\"putting on my big boy pants\\" , it showed how my reading taste matured. Enough about me, this is a review not the Scott show!The plot moves at such a brisk pace and you'll be glued to your seat. Even if you hate politics like my teenage self you will love 1984. Orwell creates political situations that will allure even the most unwilling readers. There are few dull moments in 1984, the majority of whom take place in \\"the book\\".No 1984 review could ever be complete without mentioning Oceania. Oceania is the totalitarian society in which 1984 takes place and I know where I'm not going on vacation. Oceania makes Panem look like a walk in the park and it is far more horrible than I expected. No sane person could go live there without going insane because it's a living hell. Orwell really created the perfect hell-hole for his masterpiece and it's mindblowing.I really loved how Orwell created his own language \\"Newspeak\\" for 1984. Newspeak added an interesting feel to the novel because it further the novel's themes and motifs. I really wonder if aficionados of 1984 speak Newspeak like trekkies speak Klingon and LOTR fans speak Elvish. Orwell definitely spent a lot of time coming up with Newspeak and I do appreciate his efforts.1984 is a haunting novel that once you read it, it will stay with you forever. I won't ever be able to forget the horrifying Part III because how powerful and moving it was. 1984 is a novel that will make you question yourself and society. The best kind of books make you think even after you finish and such is the case with Orwell's masterpiece. The 3rd person narration instead of hindering the pacing, it enhances it by adding more emotional depth to the book.1984 is a novel that will give you new perspectives on people, society, and law. Is Ignorance really bliss? Is lying okay if it's for the greater good? Is the needs of the many more important than the needs of the few? I can tell why 1984 is considered classic literature and I hope it continues to be read for it's important messages. Even if 1984 doesn't seem like your thing, I'd still recommend giving it a shot. 1984 has given me a reason to pick up Animal Farm and I hope I enjoy it as much as I enjoyed 1984."},{"Title":"1984","review":"I purchased the e-version of this book to be read on my Kindle. There were numerous spelling errors where two words had been combined into one. The further intothe book theworse it got. Two to three errorsper page. I believe a spell checkwould have pickedthese allup."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Too much has been said about this novel to even try to be original in a review. I will underline that this is one of the most important books I have ever read. It taught me the value of freedom, its pricelessness in fact.The book is written very well, fluent prose and gripping plot, but that is not its main value. The value is its moral about democracy, which we may take for granted now but is to be nourished all the time. The book, of course, was written in the late forties, at the height of Stalinism, so it is obvious it refers to that scenario, at the peak of the Cold War. But too many people seem to forget the value of democracy today, in the information age.One could argue that Orwell was wrong about the state controlling people through technology, in fact internet has provided all of us with tremendous power of horizontal communication that governments have a hard time controlling. But the game is an ongoing one... not yet over! I think this book should be taught in schools."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Winston Smith, the main character in \\"1984,\\" says that \\"the best books are the ones that tell you what you already know.\\" I had this very sensation as I read George Orwell's classic novel. Orwell speaks with a prophetic tone from the year 1949, with many of his comments on totalitarianism proving true during the Cold War and popping up under new guises in recent years.\\"1984\\" tells the story of Winston Smith, a man employed by Big Brother. His job is to correct and effectively erase bits of history that don't line up with Big Brother, the Thought Police, and \\"doublespeak.\\" Through this regime, the masses are controlled on all fronts, emotionally, intellectually, physically, even spiritually and sexually. Orwell takes us into this colorless world a step at a time, leading up to the horrifying realities of what happens to those who oppose Big Brother. Along the way, he lets Winston find love with Julia, but even they recognize that their love cannot be pure. He lets the two of them expand their revolutionary wings. And he lets them face the consequences.Orwell doesn't tell a tight, fast-paced story, at least not by modern standards. He is more interested in communicating ideas. But he does allow us to care for his characters. He gives us just enough time to connect with them, even though they themselves are already disconnected on many levels. They join the Brotherhood, a resistance movement, and in doing so get their hands on a book detailing the realities of Big Brother. Although \\"1984\\" is a rambling, sometimes loosely cobbled story, it is a fascinating manifesto on the dangers of governmental control and the age-old struggle of the High, the Middle, and the Low. It's amazing of accurate some of Orwell's observations still prove to be, but as Big Brother's slogan goes: Who controls the past controls the future; who controls the present controls the past.\\" And: \\"The heresy of heresies was common sense.\\" Or how about this? \\"Stupidity was as important as intelligence, and as difficult to attain.\\"Personally, I am more frightened by the less totalitarian, more consumerism-driven ideas of Huxley's \\"Brave New World,\\" but \\"1984\\" is a classic for good reason, and it casts its shadow over many stories to come, including \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" and \\"Minority Report.\\""},{"Title":"1984","review":"I read this book in high school and thought it was okay. I decided to read it again as an adult and see what I thought of it (something about going back and reading the classics). Turns out that I liked it more as an adult but found the story to fall short. At the end you can't tell if the main character was tortured, turned or just dreaming. I felt like the first half was really slow, the middle was FANTASTIC and the last bit was just over before I could get my mind around what had happened. I really wish that it could have ended differently. Still worth reading through.The story is about the year 1984 and the hell in which people live in. Countries are always at war, but whom they are fighting keeps changing. Things that Big Brother doesn't like are just erased. Whole histories, whole stories, are whipped as if they never were. People live in hunger and fear of Big Brother."},{"Title":"1984","review":"George Orwell's \\"1984\\" is depressing. Very depressing. It is also a breathtakingly awesome work, and just as spellbinding some 60 years after it was first published. Despite the heavy subject matter, it's suprisingly easy to read. It is one of the truly essential classics of modern literature.Winston Smith, Orwell's protagonist, was probably the first \\"conspiracy theorist.\\" He knows Big Brother and the system are wrong, but is powerless to fight alone. When he breaks the taboo against writing, and states in his forbidden journal, \\"I know who, I know how, but I don't know why,\\" he is speaking for generations of whistleblowers and conspiracy theorists to come.So many common expressions were derived from \\"1984\\": Big Brother, the Thought Police, newspeak, doublethink, pidgeon holed, thought crime, among others. To those on the extremes of both the left and right wings of the political spectrum, Orwell's bleak and miserable forecast of the future was all too accurate. Doublethink, for instance, is an essential feature of modern establishment thinking. Reagan's deadly missile is named the \\"Peace Keeper.\\" Born again fundamentalists simultaneously hold that all non-born againers (including Jews) are doomed to Hell, but blindly support everything Israel does. Most polls suggest a large majority of people disbelieve the official version of the JFK assassination, but the same numbers are also against a new investigation. Maddening examples of doublethink are everywhere.If Orwell was alive today, he'd undoubtedly be on the outer fringes of political thought, alongside the \\"nut jobs\\" and \\"tin foilers\\" that the mainstream media and politicians love to disparage. He would probably be astounded at the continuing popularity of his nightmarish novel. He'd be even more baffled at how readers have consistently enjoyed it, recognized it for the brilliant work it is, and yet have appeared not to notice how similar to Oceania our present day society is."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Orwell was prescient. \\"1984\\" might not have happened totally by 1984, but it crept up on us over time. And it's still happening."},{"Title":"1984","review":"It is truly amazing to look at the fantastic writing minds of our grandparents' time. Post-WWII fever hung over the population and many were clueless, or even fearful for not knowing what lie before them. And, unlike many, George Orwell was a man who was not afraid to show what he interpreted as a possible future for not only our country, but the entire world.In his novel, 1984, Orwell crafted a post-apocalyptic world in which the planet's powers had been divided into three portions; Oceania, which consisted of the Americas, Eurasia, comprised continental Europe and northern Asia, and Eastasia, which, as its title implies, covered most of the eastern Asian continent.The story follows the life of a middle aged man named Winston Smith, another Drone of Eurasia's Main power, The conspicuous Party, whose god-like leader and people-worshiped Big Brother, control everyday life.Except for the homes the proles, who are sort of like peasants, every room is garmented with a Telescreen, a sort of T.V. which can never be turned off or muted. Unfortunately, it can also see and hear everything going on in the room.Most standard crime has been wiped out due to massive military force, and so the party, in its never ending search for power, falls upon people with psychic powers to detect felonous thoughts in people. These psychics are known as the thought police, and constantly track down and \\"delete\\" people who are convicted of crimethink (a word from Eurasia's new national language, called Newspeak).Our \\"hero\\", Winston's job is to help the party erase any evidence of their saying or doing anything wrong, to control their people's minds andopinions of the party. Ultimately, they are \\"Censoring the past\\". One day the country could be at war with Eastasia, the next, Eurasia, and the entire populace would accept that they had always been at war with Eurasia, and any thoughts otherwise was crimethink.Winston, unhappy with this life and detesting the party, secretly purchases a pen and diary, the use of both have been outlawed for some time. This is simply the beginning in a long string of rebellion, love, and unanswered questions that keep this book in your mind whenever you are not reading it.This is one of the most fantastic sci-fi novel experiences I have ever had, and while particular sections of the book can drag on for far too long, the character depth and plot more than makes up for it. Anyone who wishes to deny this book as a classic great has not the brains to understand it, and therefore cannot accurately judge its prowess."},{"Title":"1984","review":"This is one of the few books I think everyone should read at one point or another of their life.

The detailed symbolism of the antique paper weight crashing onto floor as policemen bombarded in to arrest Winston and Julia.

Winston, Julia, O'Brien they're all great characters that sprung from Orwell's mind. The mind that was almost prophetic in its predictions of the future.

This book, although a work of fiction, didn't seem that far fetched, given the current state of affairs. 1984 is a well written book that I barely managed to put down after I began reading it. I highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"1984","review":"This book was excellant and scary as hell when your reading it and realize that a lot of things that are in it are happening in our country today. Most people, myself included, who hear about this classic don't realize that there's a tragic love story wrapped inside of the haunting world of Orwell's 1984 that helps drive home the authors anti-utopian message. Also, the realism of the book seems almost three-dimensional casting a crystal clear picture of the nightmarish world of 1984 where Big Brother is always watching you- not just what you say or do but, what your thinking. Scarier than anything Stephen King ever wrote- and more realistic."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Every happy little socialist should read this book! Orwell takes socialism of his day to the extreme, but today his veiw is not too far away. What's the differance between Hillary Clinton and Big Brother? The mustache.---This book is an amazing picture of mankind and a warning to all the people who want to steal the freedom from the individual(socialist)."},{"Title":"1984","review":"1984 is not merely a warning against the possible less-than-ideal communist world. It is rather a combination of denigrations against most of the common held social, political, and religious beliefs. Socialism, fascism, communism, Christianity, Zenism, and many other beliefs beyond the tether of my knowledge. All these harsh criticisms are made clear in the chapter about THE BOOK and part 3 of the whole novel. The denounciation against Christianity, for example, can be clearly seen in the later section of the book, when Winston is being tortured in Miniluv by O'Brien. The purging of the old self through repentance and a renewal of the mind and emotions, which are the ways to get in God's kingdom, are also the cores of the lessons given by O'Brien to get Winston to become a part of the Party. O'Brien also mentioned that one can not change by himself, by can with the help of the Party, or in Christianity, Jesus. These clear remarks relating to Christianity, as well as to other beliefs, are implicit throughout the novel. At the end, a conclusion is made, only democracy works. But this is not why I didn't give it a five star, the reason is that descriptions of Oceania are too awkward and peculiar. First above all, proles are still humans, sooner or later they are going to revolve against a totalitarian government. The wave of human development will break all the hinderance and thrush on; it is never possible to stop history at a moment. Also the theories of doublethink would never be practiced, how is it possible for one to be self-contradictory to a degree the he or she can both believe and not believe simultaneously? It is mentally incapable for humans. If it is possible, then doublethink can easily turn against the Party and against itself. These pedantic political ideas are fun to play with, but can never practically practiced."},{"Title":"1984","review":"When it was written in 1948, Before the Cold War, Communism was a popular idea in England.

This book is a testament to mankind's willingness to forget the past."},{"Title":"1984","review":"I thought it was going to be a cheesy nostradomus-type thing, but it turned out to be a book about the rebellious nature of the human mind, as well as a testament to the number of those who do not understand those things going on around them (the proles). I've read it four times, and it never loses its impact."},{"Title":"1984","review":"When I first read 1984 I thought most of the stuff in it was absurd; the thought police, the cameras in each and every street corner and house. But as I read on, I found out that Orwell was using these as instruments to convey a much deeper message about what would become of society, and this message itself about a world that is thought controlled with no tolerance for deviation was much more important than what I considered their more absurd concepts such as the thought police. I really would suggest most people to read this book; the main protaganists Winston and Julia lead a rebellion against an unjust society that I am sure you all will find in your hearts very compelling."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Enter a world where there is no past. Where the past is the present. Follow Winston as he thinks THOUGHT- CRIME, works on fake documents, and plots to shut down the system. Big Brother's eyes follow Winston Everywhere he goes.

She has no need for family history, her own or mine. She fears creativity until recently. My mother, a misanthrope who grew up under communist China's educational system, even after residing in the States for more than twenty-five years, cannot seem to snap out of her past \\"education\\" by the communists. In my memory, she seems to hold little joy in her life. What a novel 1984 is; it sheds light on my questions: \\"Who is my mother?\\" and \\"What is my mother?\\" In a sense, \\"Chapter One\\" of the Book rings a personal truth to my upbringing, so many things that my mother said to me about the world, during my childhood, puzzled me. Whatever psychological lessons my mother went through during her \\"education,\\" I doubt she'd ever share it with me. Nonetheless, I would not be surprised if she received training in doubletalk, doublethink and the indoctrination \\"freedom is slavery.\\" It was very easy, almost too easy, for me to project myself into the novel, because it felt so personal and real.So it was easy for me to imagine myself living in a Totalitarian society, but it would be too much of a nightmare, for I already have a slight taste of it in my childhood. Unknowingly, in the past few years, I have worked in my small ways to strengthen my knowledge and belief in a democratic society, may it be researching history, studying the structure of mainstream media, or becoming more aware and decoding the means of deception and misinformation, which is so pertinent to understand the actions of current Bush administration.Even though the main character, Winston Smith, in 1984 eventually learned to love the Big Brother after forty years, I am still optimistic about meeting my responsibility as a US citizen, participating in quasi-democracy and reading once more 1984 as a novel, not a history book. But, if it ever becomes truly historical in content, by then, 1984 would have been either re-written or George Orwell vaporized out of existence."},{"Title":"1984","review":"This book really gets you thinking. People should not call this book a fear of communism, it is based in fear of fascism. Orwell also wrote Animal Farm which was more a critique of communism. Anyway, the book is about a guy named Winston Smith who is in 1984. There are only 3 world super powers who are continuously at war with each other. The government rules the people and controls their minds by creating extreme hatred and fear. Any thoughts differing from the party is a crime and even facial expressions that are too suspicious could mean you disappear. I think everyone knows the basis of the book but the story line was not all what I thought it would be. There was a love-story. The love-story struck me as somewhat reminiscent of classic romanticism - a perfect private love which its test is to survive the outside world and in this case Big Brother. You'll have to see how the love-story turns out. A sign of a good book for me is one that is still bothering me days later and this one will probably bother me for years to come. The book doesn't have too much action but rather is written for each piece and idea presented to be thought-provoking. I highly recommend reading this book."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Orwell's 1984 seems to grow increasingly relevant with every passing year.1984 tells the story of Winston Smith, who's job is \\"correcting\\" historical documents and removing words from the dictionary.

Big Brother, the figurehead of the Party, is revered and loved, and any thought otherwise is punishable by death.Whatever trace of humanity that lies in Winston causes him to seek answers, question his reality, and pursue a forbidden realtionship with a woman named Julia, all which lead to a frightful and thought provoking end.This book should be a staple in every person's library. Orwell's satire has withstood the test of time, and has inspired a countless number of books and films. A classic in every sense."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Simply put, 1984 is a masterpiece of satire. It's philosophical, well-written, layered and its message resonates long after reading it. The plot you probably know already but just in case, the modern day world has descended into a totalitarian state, ruled by a near-deified leader named Big Brother. The citizens of this nation live in complete submission to this dictatorship, where even an errant thought can mean torture and death.The issues explored in this text range from love and companionship to more far-reaching questions such as the true needs and desires of humanity. What do we crave more: equality, justice and the pursuit of happiness or just unbridled power and security? The world of 1984 is unveiled through Winston Smith in his attempt to uncover not just the hows of his existence, but the whys. Allusions to Stalin and the U.S.S.R. abound, some more subtle than others. There is enough material present to keep one pondering the ultimate meaning of this book long after you put it down. It is truly one of the ultimate literary accomplishments of the 20th Century.Sadly, perhaps the most widespread contribution of 1984 comes in the form of cliched, sophomoric analogies to the in-power political party of America. I'll say this: civilization comes with advantages and disadvantages. It's a matter of degree, and political correctness is the closest we have to thought crime. If all you can take from this book is ammunition to rip Bush, you've missed one great debate on human desire and the nature of reality."},{"Title":"1984","review":"This book is great- but it's not like today- thank god- and maybe because it was read, accepted and things were altered around that kind of future- I have to say to grasp such inventive thought for the 1940's this book is worth the marvel of that alone- it deserves the term classic- I have to mention the book Utopian Reality- now that's a story where I would want at least half of it to come true- Reading 1984 and seeing how it must have been far fetched for it's time- it has given me some faith that maybe Utopian Reality is onto something- Read this and Utopian Reality- if you haven't read it yet.-It'll leave you amazed--"},{"Title":"1984","review":"Orwell's 1984 is one of the true masterpieces of the 20th century.

Let this new and horrifying reality encompass and draw in your imagination. This is no ordinary story. There are no heroes, no friends, or family. Only power, enemies, and fading hope exist. War is a continuous part of life. It never ends and never changes. The past can, even, be changed or erased. They call it a perfect world. \\"It's never been this good,\\" they say. No one objects. No one ever rebels, or at least, those that do are never heard of again. They just disappear. They are wiped out of existence and forgotten. Don't dare think of rebellion, for eyes and ears are always watching and listening. They are waiting for you to make a mistake and give yourself away. The smallest blink of an eye or twitch of a muscle could make you a suspect of a thought crime. Yet, there are rumors of a group of rebels that still fight back. Is it only false hope, or do they really exist? There is no way of knowing. No one can be certain of anything here. Just do and believe what you are told. It is the only way to stay alive.This depiction of the future is revealed in George Orwell's shocking novel, 1984. The book is about an ordinary man named Winston Smith who is lost in the twisted world in which he lives. Nothing is extraordinary about him. He follows the rules and never questions his instructions. Yet, something inside him begins to stir. Deep within the hollows of his mind, it awakes. It haunts his every move, thought, and dream. The yearnings become too much for him, and he can no longer ignore them. Determination, soon, overcomes fear, and he decides to pursue the insane desires. However, one cannot forget that there are always sacrifices to be made in return for decisions. The question is whether or not you are willing to make them. This is what Winston must face. Will he discover what is calling him, or will he turn away in fear? Will he return to the conformity, hatred, and lies of the world? Well, that is for you to discover.Orwell's amazing novel is thought-provoking and terrifying. This book is definitely worth your time. From the very first word to the very last words of the book, your imagination is captured and inspired. Powerful imagery and symbols give unmistakable meaning to the story.

I started it with slight optimism based on what I heard it was about. I also was anticipating a less than pleasing novel, since we previously read Lord of the Flies and Catcher in the Rye, both of which I was very displeased. My doubts soon disappeared, as I became mesmerized with George Orwell's novel. It was so wonderfully written that I could barely take my eyes off of it (much to the annoyance of several of my teachers).

It tells of a totalitarian society, where Big Brother is constantly watching every single move Party members make through a device called a telescreen, and it is a crime to even THINK a thought that is anti-party. The party controls everything. If a person were to so much as LOOK discontented with a party decision, they would be tortured until they loved big brother.Which brings us to Winston, the main character in the book. He is quite obviously discontented with the party. He takes many risks, such as getting involved in a love affair, writing a diary where he recorded &quot;Down with big brother&quot;, and getting involved with an underground brotherhood. However, he does this in such a blatant way, that he is almost setting himself up to be caught. He yearns to be killed for his political heresy. Which makes the ending all the more ironic.This book is truly one of the most interesting reads. Orwell's novel is very rightly called a classic. This timeless masterpiece will always serve as a warning to the dangers of a totalitarian state, and if not that, just to the upholding of the importance of free thought and speech."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Now I know why is has become a classic.

It is a clear depiction of how our politician's overzealous control is beginning to run our lives."},{"Title":"1984","review":"\\"Freedom is the freedom to say that 2+2=4.\\" Winston Smith in Gorge Orwell's 1984 is forced to accept anything the Party of Oceana tells him, not only must he accept it but he also must believe it. If they say that 2+2=5 then he must believe it even knowing it is not true, this action of forced acceptance is called doublethink- the idea that you can hold two seemingly apposing concepts and accept both as true.Winston does not truly believe The Party and begins to work against it under the radar even while knowing he is bound to fail. As the story progresses he befriends a young woman named Julia and together they attempt to do the party harm through their own mini rebellion.Winston and Julia are believable though not lovable. I don't think Orwell wanted them to be lovable so he could emphasize how The Party sucked the humanness and lovability out of its subjects.The story was incredibly well written. It was simple to understand, even though Winston and Julia's situation was far from simple.This would be a good book for anyone from fourteen up. This was a great book that deserves it many awards.*This review is written by my son- 14 years old"},{"Title":"1984","review":"George Orwell's \\"1984\\" is the greatest political novel of the Twentieth Century. Period.No other political novel in the last one hundred years has come close to having the impact and insights of this novel. The book introduced terms into the language that are still current usage, primarily the term \\"Big Brother\\" and the phrase \\"Big Brother is watching you.\\"Orwell's description of the deliberate corruption of language by the Inner Party in his nightmare world, the concept that the shrinkage of language could be deliberately used to narrow the range of human thought, is reflected in today's stunted and idiotic American political discourse.The use of language by an all-powerful government to hide the truth and create a false reality in the world of 1984 resonates today in the use of terms designed not to illuminate, but obscure. Atomic bombs are \\"special weapons,\\" civilians killed in air strikes are \\"collateral damage,\\" and illegal invasions of other nations are \\"preventive interventions.\\"But it is not just the insights Orwell had on the misuse of language, the abuse of surveillance technology (technology available today which he would have been scarcely able to imagine), and the power games of the great Twentieth Century superpowers (e.g., the \\"China card\\" played by the United States as between the Soviets and the Chinese), it is the sheer personalized terror of the dystopian world he created which gives his book power.As a personal note, I first read this novel when I was seventeen years old, a senior in high school, and I was shaken to my core by Orwell's frightenting vision. I have reread the book every three years, because I can always find another insight in it that applies to the current world.There are other great political novels of the Twentieth Century, for example, I would rank Arthur Koestler's \\"Darkness at Noon\\" as very close to (and in some ways similiar to) Orwell's great work. But no other political novel of the Twentieth Century has come anywhere near the insight, the impact, and the influence of the novel which Orwell first titled \\"The Last Man in Europe.\\""},{"Title":"1984","review":"In a society that has eliminated many imbalances, surplus goods, and even class struggle, there are bound to be deviates; Winston Smith is one of those. He starts out, due to his inability to doublethink, with thoughtcrime. This is in a society that believes a thought is as real as the deed. Eventually he graduates through a series of misdemeanors to illicit sex and even plans to overthrow the very government that took him in as an orphan.If he gets caught, he will be sent to the \\"Ministry of Love\\" where they have a record of 100% cures for this sort of insanity. They will even forgive his past indiscretions.Be sure to watch the three different movies made from this book:1984 (1954) Peter Cushing is Winston Smith1984 (1956) Edmond O'Brien is Winston SmithNineteen Eighty-Four (1984) John Hurt is Winston Smith"},{"Title":"1984","review":"If you haven't read this superb novel you should, if you already have, you should read it again. There is much prescience in this book and in many ways it's more poignant today, than it was when it's first edition was immediately censored upon publication in 1949. Orwell writes with nourishing intensity rarely ever seen in other writers and his sentences are pregnant with meaning and depth. Orwell creates a believable dystopian world with pervasive micro video cameras and giant flat screen tv's that reminds us of the post 9-11 world we live in today, where there is little privacy and extensive spying on the citizenry by the government."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Along withAnimal Farm, 1984 is probably George Orwell's best known work (although his essays deserve a wide readership and in my view represent some of his best writing) and, both being satires of totalitarianism, said much about the state of the world and intellectual climate of the 1940's. If the testimony of readers subject to totalitarian regimes (in particular Eastern European communist regimes) is any guide, 1984 does a superlative job of illustrating the mental atmosphere of daily life in such a state. Perhaps a far greater insight, however, is Orwell's description of an Inner Party that is obsessed by enforcing orthodoxy in not only word and deed, but thought - to the extent that the individuals' ability for critical, independent thought (even if never openly expressed) is extinguished. Not only is this the tendency of most modern-day despotism (whether theological, ideological or an even less sophisticated ethnic/racial nationalism), but the tendency to declare unpalatable opinions 'thoughtcrime' is one that even those of us with more benign worldviews must be on guard against.In itself, the story of '1984' isn't particularly remarkable, but the oppressive atmosphere it creates together with the warning it provides for modern day readers who may occasionally fail to recognise just how important freedom of thought really is makes it absolutely invaluable in understanding the history and politics of the last hundred years. Recommended in the strongest possible terms."},{"Title":"1984","review":"1984 is a haunting political satire about Big Brother's relentless assault on privacy, individuality and freedom.One can only hope 1984 is more brilliant story than cautionary tale because parallels seem so easily drawn with our warrantless searches, ubiquitous cameras, invasive software, workplace surveillance and legislation that erodes the rights of citizens in the name of fighting terrorism.Yet it is the relationship that develops between Winston, a cautious but hopeful thinking man, and Julia, a young seemingly committed Party member, that adds incredible humanity to otherwise empty, cheerless lives in Oceania. Theirs is a relationship that surprisingly springs amid bleakness and desolation, flowers against all odds, and ultimately wilts under betrayal.Readers will discover that Orwell's objectives are both thoroughly and terrifyingly achieved with a perfectly dystopian ending."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Overall, the book was pretty good. It got a little slow when the main character was reading the rebel's book (went on and on about Big Brother's \\"why\\"). Either way, it is worth reading once."},{"Title":"1984","review":"This book was prophetic in many ways. The ideas of Big Brother and War is Peace described what society was and was developing into. The bleakness of the story adds to its futuristic vision. I recommend this book to those who analyze society and governments."},{"Title":"1984","review":"I recomend this book to anybody. A warning that must not be ignored"},{"Title":"1984","review":"This book is one of the markers of it's time. It is amazingly horrifying in it's portrayl of our future. There is so much to be learned and feared from this book that it can give you nightmares. This is one of the best books I have ever read and chewed on in discussion. The ideas and theories - the concept of &quot;Big Brother&quot; definitely gives me the feeling that this is what a Nazi rule would have been like."},{"Title":"1984","review":"George Orwell's graphic depiction of how he views the future is pulled tightly into the bindings of 1984. He is prebiased due to a short affiliation with Communism and the aftermath throws him into a world of pessimism. 1984 allows you to look into the mind of a pessimist. Many feel the book is also a large mockery of revolution. This book is great to anyone interested in Communism, or just a good book. Also good books by Orwell are Homage to Catalonia, Animal Farm, and the Road to Wigan Pier."},{"Title":"1984","review":"1984 by George Orwell is a captivating book about what could happen if a government was given too much power. What makes the story all the more interesting is the fact that it is not impossible for such a government to grow in a society that would let it. The story of Winston Smith is just the background for a chilling description of a dictatorship gone too far. The relationship between Winston and Julia tries to show that human nature does not allow a person to love someone else more than themselves. The book overall shows that all the faults we have now can someday turn us into the society in 1984."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Among the vast titles in the dystopia genre, 1984 stands out as one of the most exceptional. In an amazing combination of followable story line and wonderfully hideous prediction of the future (well, technically, the past), George Orwell created an important commentary on the state of human nature now, and what it has the ability to become. Right from the beginning, one dives into the London of Winston Smith, and follows his daily drudgery. Through his experiences and thoughts, the reader is sucked into the individual's fight for individuality in the face of the most extreme facist oppression. Throught systems of constant war, thought control, and the censorship and redefinitions of history, the illusive Big Brother is able to control what people hear, see, and think. The world created in 1984 can chill your soul, but the struggle of Winston Smith will reaffirm your belief in humanity."},{"Title":"1984","review":"I loved this book, and couldn't put it down. It should be required reading if it is not already. What I find so intriguing is how did Orwell have such vision?

I slept late and awoke yelling about the Thought Police being after me until i adjusted. I knew that it would always be one of my favorites of all time after that morning. 1984 is far more relevant now than ever before because of globalization and admitted lies from the government, and i'm not talking about our president. What i am saying is, if our government will deny us information and tell us about cover-ups and mistakes 40, 50 years after the fact , then who knows what's truth or lies now? Maybe our founding fathers should have made a &quot;Freedom of Knowledge&quot; amendment instead of the right to be a gun-toting maniac.

There are no sacred cows - love, family, solitude, language, fratenity - none are immune to Big Brother's control over the population of Oceania. In the gut wrenching end you are left with one sweat memory, that two people were able to steal a few moments of happiness from their enslavors; and one vague hope, that if the government won't tolerate the grummblings of one middle class nobody, maybe it is because one person can make a differance."},{"Title":"1984","review":"I recently took up the hobby of reading &quot;classics&quot; instead of teenage dramas or mysterys. 1984 was second on my list. But now I'm left wondering why is this book a classic? This book was descriptively crude with its love affair and prostitute, redundant with its thoughts and routine, and overall dull. I admit that this book did have a good message and was thoroughly enforced from the beginning to end. However, thats all that happened.It was just thoughts of a sad man with perverse and suspicouis thoughts. The main character constantly dwelled on how horrible everything was and eventually how he was going to fight against it. But never did, unless you count having an affair and writing in a journal or buying an old paperweight.At times the story would pick up, and just as quickly as it picked up it drastically fell back into the continuous complaints of Winston.1984 is well written. I guess, there were quantities of complex words tied in with a new language created within the book (Newsspeak). Keep your dictionary handy.The chararcters also lacks personality. They were so 2 deminsional.Overall it was impossibly hard to follow, and paragraphs could be skipped and you wouldnt miss a thing.Not to mention that tragic ending. No steps were made toward anything! It stops about were it left off except Winston loves BB and loves his torturor.This book was an overrated classic and a big fat FLUB!"},{"Title":"1984","review":"While cultural pundits try to convince you that some literature is better than other literature, the truth is that all art is relative to individial tastes. Thus, it doesn't make any sense to think that a novel like this one is really any better than say, Michael Crichton or Stephen King. Aesthetic standards can't be grounded.Thus, don't listen to anyone who tries to distinguish between &quot;serious&quot; works of literature like this one and allegedly &quot;lesser&quot; novels. The distinction is entirely illusory, because no novels are &quot;better&quot; than any others, and the concept of a &quot;great novel&quot; is an intellectual hoax.

Then about a hundred pages later, they get caught by the Thought Police, thrown into &quot;prison,&quot; and are brain washed. That's pretty much what happens.I just finished printing out my summer book report for this book. If in honors English they gave you a choice between this book and a book about a snail slithering across pavement, I would pick the latter. I think it's absolutely disgusting that just about every book that we had to read in freshman English had sex in it. The one book that didn't have sex in it was To Kill a Mockingbird, but then that had accused rape in it (that was actually the one book I liked).

ANYTHING ELSE!"},{"Title":"1984","review":"1984 is a fictional novel by George Orwell. The book is a story of Orwell's prediction of the world in the future (1984). In this story, we are taken to a society that is governed by an oppressive force known as &quot;The Party,&quot; and an intangable ruler known only as &quot;Big Brother.&quot; The main character, Winston Smith, spends his time throughout the novel trying to overthrow The Party and Big Brother, while running from the &quot;Thought Police,&quot; a justice department that monitors the thoughts of citizens of Oceana, the predicted future state of London, England. Winston fails in his attempts. He is captured, set up by people whom he believed to be on his side, and is later brainwashed into loving and following Big Brother.Great attitude George. I truly believe that Orwell's sole purpose for writing this novel was to encourage anarchy, and to convince his readers to be subordinate to authority. Though society and government are not perfect, they are not as evil and as oppressive as Orwell made them out to be. He creates a negative Utopia in hopes to make people hate their leaders and to disagree with any form of government. It is because of people like Orwell that our nation, as well as other nations, are so dramatically torn by the opinions of citizens towards their leaders, and their leader's decisions. Also, at the end of this novel, Orwell leaves readers with a sense of hopelessness, by allowing his main character to be manipulated, tortured, and brainwashed into following what Orwell inderectly refers to as government. Let's try to be a little more optomistic, and work on a happier ending, shall we?"},{"Title":"1984","review":"1984 over all is a very boring book.

I give this book 1*."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Others may have loved and raved this book but for me, I just could not wait to finish it. I am surprised I even finished it because some books I'll just stop reading it and move on to another book.

Winston Smith is one of many who works for the Ministry of Truth and is constantly watched by the televised omnipotent Big Brother. Winston's job is to distort or doctor the truths and facts that may contradict the Party.Discontent with his monitored life, he begins to secretly write in a journal which encourages him to think with critical analyses that would be viewed heretical by the Party. In addition, he meets Julia which they initiate sexual escapades, also in secret.Predictably, Winston and Julia are captured by the Party. Winston goes through torture to which the Party oversees in order to condition him back to Party's mission and beliefs.The plot is fairly simplistic but with redundant lines. \\"Oceania has always been war with Eastasia.\\" \\"Freedom is slavery.\\" \\"Big Brother is watching you.\\" In other words, it was nothing but a lot of nonsensical fillers.Overall, I would not recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"1984","review":"In 1948, on the island of Jura in Scotland, a middle-aged and gravely tubercular man pen-named George Orwell (real name Eric Arthur Blair), began writing his sixth novel. Orwell, an extremely influential journalist and author who was known for his adroit ability to craft with the English language, his strong opinions on political issues such as totalitarianism, and his satirical novella Animal Farm (1945), sent the final copy of his sixth and final novel to his publisher on 4 December 1948. On 8 June 1949, the novel hit the shelves of bookstores, bearing the name Nineteen Eighty-Four. Seven months after his book was released, on 28 January 1950, Orwell passed away because of complications with tuberculosis. Over 60 years later, people still enjoy this grim, enigmatic tale of a futuristic society gone horribly wrong. The edition I am reviewing is a 328- page reprint by Signet Classics, complete with the story, an appendix with the principles of Newspeak, and an afterword by Erich Fromm.In the futuristic super-state Oceania, which consists mainly of the Americas, the Atlantic islands, Australia, and the southern portion of Africa, the story takes place in what used to be called Britain, but is now known as \\"Airstrip One\\". One could infer from the title that the story takes place in the year 1984 (although the government's falsification of history has created some uncertainty regarding what year the story really takes place in). Oceania itself is governed by a three-tiered totalitarian party, separated into an Inner Party, an Outer Party, and a large proletariat population, all of which are led by a mysterious dictator named Big Brother. Winston Smith, a member of the Outer Party who works in one of the ministries of the Party, takes the main role in this story. Because he possesses a mind unlike many of those within the Party, a mind full of resistance and hate towards the Party, Winston regularly does things that would be considered a crime in Oceanic society, a society in which the truth is censored, the actions of people are closely monitored, the thoughts of people are controlled and altered, and peoples' individuality has been removed.At the opening of this story, we find that Winston works in the Ministry of Truth, a large governing ministry which is responsible for rewriting historical documents and media and changing facts to fit Party doctrine and make it seem like the Party is absolute and never wrong, in essence turning most news media, and even some books and some forms of art, into propagandist media (and also turning the name of the ministry into a lie). Normal Party members are oblivious to falsification because their minds have been trained to simultaneously accept two contradicting beliefs as correct (this is referred to in the story as doublethink). However, Winston is different. He begins to see through the party, their abuse of power, their lies, and their hate, and because of this, he seeks psychological freedom.Winston seems to recall a time in his life when things were much better. However, he doesn't quite remember when that time was, or what it was really like. This mere feeling causes Winston to ponder whether or not there was a time before his where life was much better; a time without perpetual war, political unrest, or harsh living conditions. Because of this, he seeks a way to bring down Big Brother and the Party. He finds hope in rumors of an underground organization known as the Brotherhood, created for the purpose of overthrowing the party. He also finds hope in the proles, theorizing that with the size of their population, if they realized that their life could be much, much better (though how can you do that when this is how you have lived since the day you were born?), they might band together and overthrow the party.He also finds hope in a fellow employee, Julia, who Winston at first believes is an agent of the Thought Police. However, an encounter at work changes his mind when she reveals to him that she loves him. They begin an affair, rendezvousing in remote locations to make love; not just because of love, but also for rebellion against the Party. They then make a home in an antique shop in a proletarian quarter of Airstrip One. Another fellow employee of Winston's, O'Brien, displays discontent for the party as well, and upon Winston and Julia meeting with him in his flat, he reveals that the Brotherhood really does exist, and he allows Winston and Julia to be a part of it, so long as they understand that the change they desire will not happen in their lifetime.Winston had finally found paradise in a collectivist hell. Not only that, but he had also become part of the force that was going to bring down the Party! He knew he had people on his side! Although this seemed very, very promising, this proved to be nothing but a lie. Winston receives a book from O'Brien regarding oligarchical collectivism that was written by Emmanuel Goldstein, a co-founder of the Party who ended up betraying it and, because of this, becoming the primary object of hate in Oceania. Shortly after this, Winston and Julia are betrayed by the owner of the antique store they lived in, who turns out to be an agent of the Thought Police. Shortly after this, they are both taken away to the Ministry of Love.During his captivity in the Ministry of Love, Winston is beaten, abused, neglected and periodically interrogated by members of the Inner Party (his treatment being indicative of yet another misnomer of a ministry that specializes in interrogation through torture). O'Brien, who revealed himself to be a member of the Inner Party, interrogates Winston several times, and at one point reveals to him that the Party wants more than just confessions from people who are considered \\"thoughtcriminals\\". The Party needs to be certain of every citizen's love for Big Brother and the Party because they simply want every citizen to believe in Big Brother and the Party. They don't want to exterminate those who do not believe. Rather, they want to go to the fullest extent to force them to believe. With this as their motive, what will happen to Winston? Will he continue to resist the Party? Will he end up just like every other brainwashed, orthodox citizen of Oceania? The conclusion of this story reveals all of this and more. What O'Brien revealed to Winston shows that in a totalitarian regime the top priority of the party is to control everything they can possibly control. Even your own mind. This book clearly illustrates for the reader the dangers of totalitarianism and how this political system dramatically affects the quality of life for the citizens held within it.Late teens to adults of any age who have strong opinions on political issues or enjoy dystopic fiction or social science fiction will enjoy this book. However, people who are sensitive to sexual content or violence might not like certain aspects of this story, because there are points where topics like this are either hinted at, or sometimes even elaborated upon. Also, a recommended prerequisite to this book is to possess a rather advanced vocabulary, that is to say that if your reading level isn't quite at the college level, then you may have some difficulty getting through this book. I enjoyed this book. I actually enjoyed it a lot. The ending, however, I did not exactly enjoy because this book did not end the way I wanted it to or the way I thought it would. However, by no means does the ending negate the book's appeal; the book is sure to be a great choice for anyone who enjoys complex characters, an enigmatic storyline, and outstanding, elegant usage of the English language."},{"Title":"1984","review":"1984 by George Orwell is a dystopian novel about the totalitarian regime of the Party, it's the story of Winston Smith and his intellectual rebellion of the Party, and consequent captivity, torture, and re-education. The Party and Big Brother totally control the people by psychological manipulation to dictate thoughts and actions.Imagine a world where you are being constantly watched and you don't know it, and a common enemy is used as the object of fear and hatred for the party- a means of controlling the population of course. Imagine a world where the party wishes to have all human desire disappear, sex is a grotesque act committed only for two reasons; reproduction and duty to the Party. To desire anything was a thoughtcrime, you should only want Big Brother's love and acceptance, as O'Brien says,\\"There will be no loyalty, except loyalty to the Party.\\"You believe everything the Party says, it is always correct. They have lost the ability of independent thought, and memories are lost and never were. A new language is created \\"Newspeak,\\" essentially the destruction of words. So thoughtcrime against the Party is impossible because there are no words that can correctly express emotions.So, \\"freedom is the freedom to say that two plus two make four\\" and this freedom is never granted. Two plus Two is anything the Party wants it to be, and \\"war is peace\\" because war is used as a tool to control the people.The novel takes the reader to a world that is so scary and vivid and almost possibly like ours.' It's a masterpiece and Orwell will take you to a world that will shake you because it is almost like our own, but thankfully and hopefully will never get as bad. Orwell tells you how important freedom really is, and that you might not even notice that you don't have it, and that two plus tw0 should always equal four or somethings not right."},{"Title":"1984","review":"I got this for my husband for Christmas.

This could easily all happen to us!"},{"Title":"1984","review":"Bottom-Line: I implore all freedom loving people to read \\"1984\\"; it is depressing, but then again so is life in general for the most part.First published in 1950, \\"1984\\" is a chilling, depressing, and yes, heartbreaking look into the future existence of mankind. It is a world that is at once dark, bleak, joyless, loveless and utterly without hope. Human's are as humans have always been, divided into three classes, only in George Orwell's there is no hope of movement between the three; they are static, fixed, inexorably and utterly.Religion has been banished (not an altogether bad idea), but so too has intellectual, personal, and political freedoms; mankind has been reduced to a soulless conglomeration of empty husks who do as their told, and believe whatever they are told by Big Brother, the party. Human intellectual, social, and cultural progress in any real sense has ceased for good or ill. Music, science, art, literature, is no longer the province of self, the Party owns it all.In the world of \\"1984\\", the world has only three nations, Oceania (North America, South America, Great Britain, and Southern Africa); Eurasia (Russian, Europe and Northern Africa); and Eastasia (China, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, India, etc). These nations are perpetually at war with one another, but, the aim is the neither gain, nor lose ground to the other; the aim is be at war so that the masses never expect too much, nor have reason the question the supremacy of the Party.The Party controls all and is embodied in the persona of Big Brother, who is literally always watching or listening, via telescreens and microphones in people apartments, places of work & play. The Thought Police are never far from view. Privacy is a thing of the past, personal pleasure and leisure are frown upon, sex is a dirty joyless affair tolerated only for procreation (now doesn't that sound familiar), and the Party has three over-riding slogans the masses are controlled with; War is Peace, Freedom is Slavery, and Ignorance is Strength. The Party has four principle ministries it uses to maintain control of the people; The Ministry of Truth, The Ministry of Love, The Ministry of Plenty, and The Ministry of Peace all of which are represented by four white monolithic building built in the heart of London where this tale unfolds.Most of the book centers on the life, and brief love of Winston Smith, an outer Party member, who live a life of quite misery. He hates the Party and wants to rebel, but he knows Big Brother is watching, and listening, so he is forced to rebel only in his mind. But little by little, step-by-step, Winston finds way to rebel, buying a diary in which he records his thoughts, and eventually he has a forbidden love affair with a fellow party member. This leads to other flirtations and a search for the illusive Brotherhood avowed enemies of the Party.Personal Thoughts\\"1984\\" is an intricately woven tale of a world gone completely mad by today's standards, a world where none of use could conceive of living in, and yet there are shades of \\"1984\\" type behavior by our government darkening Republic's freedom loving horizon. After reading just a few pages of 1984, you will come away with a frightening realization; the loose of our freedoms, both intellectual and personal will not happen over night, but it will come about gradually; there will be subtle changes in the landscape, a dimming of the constitutional light that warm all of us. Already, we are at perpetual war with an enemy who can not be found, but who pops up every once in a while to taunt us, to assure us that the danger is real, just as Goldstein does in the world of \\"1984\\".Our government, is engaged in doublespeak, bending the lies until they become the truth everyone (well at least half of the American electorate) will accept without question. This is evidenced by the fact that almost half of the America public believed (or still believe) Saddam Hussain had a hand to play in 9/11 even after the 9/11 Commission and other reports stated categorically that he did not. But Bush ties him to it right after the event, using doublespeak to mold the America mind. Already for far too many Americans Ignorance is Strength; witness the last Presidential election, the continued debate over Gay rights, school prayer, and abortion.Politicians now seem to speak in nothing but platitudes (doublespeak) that are released like confetti at a Party Convention until the truth is swept away like so much recycling only to be reborn as a sound bite tomorrow. One Party insists that it has the lock on family values, but fails to support the family in any meaningful way, but it doesn't seem to matter to those that support the Party. And yet they, along with the rest of us are being hurt by the slow strangulation of the America family. Disheartening to say the least. And shades of Newspeak are already inserting themselves into the political lexicon; the Estate Tax becomes the Death Tax, a woman's right to choose, becomes right to life, and the fundamental rights of Gays becomes a Defense of Marriage.George Orwell was amazingly insightful way back in 1950 to have written a book so relevant some 55 year later. The end of the book gives a rather lengthy explain of Newspeak, and the Afterword compares Orwell's work with other seminal novels that touch on the same theme: Aldos Huxley's Brave New World (next on my reading list), and Russian Zamyatin's We; it is fascinating and intellectually stimulating reading.I implore all freedom loving people to read \\"1984\\"; it is depressing, but then again so is life in general for the most part. Not living Winston's life should in the very least give one a renewed appreciation for our own."},{"Title":"1984","review":"This is another must-read dystopia. I don't recommend it for children, however. It is quite frightening for anyone with an imagination. Avoid the Ministry of Love whatever you do! This book warns against the manipulation of people through twisting meaning truth=deception; love=destruction. Evil remains evil no matter what it is called, but evil is most dangerous when re-named."},{"Title":"1984","review":"It's a classic for a reason. Too bad nobody really ever learns from this book or we'd not be electing the leeches we do."},{"Title":"1984","review":"1984 is a dystopia novel written by George Orwell, pseudonym of Englishman Eric Blair, that opens up with the narrative ruminations of a man named Winston Smith. Winston Smith is just another face. Not particularly good looking or smart, Smith is meant to portray an average dissatisfied Englishman (or Oceanian according to the book) in Britain circa 1984. Circa 1984, because Smith is not certain of the date (probably right within a year or two) and, though it is never clearly stated, it is inferred that this is also the work of the nefarious \\"Party\\" which contrives to bring all under the power of its thumb.Early on Blair endeavors to paint a picture of doom-and-gloom and a not a little despair. a world where \\"hope\\" seems to be all but stamped out. Though overtly about communism, there can be inferences drawn to politics in general with such things as \\"doublespeak\\", which is the ability to believe two opposing things about the same subject (or even word) at the exact same time. For example, \\"duckspeak\\" (to quack like a duck), when applied to an opponent, is a derisive insult. However, the exact same word, when applied to an ally, is also a compliment.Blair does an excellent job of painting a picture of a future so bleak, while still being possible, as to send a shiver down the spine of any freethinking intellectual. Definitely a must-read."},{"Title":"1984","review":"1984 was written by George Orwell and takes place in a dystopia in England. This book was written close to Orwell's death and most people say it's one of his best he ever written.This book takes the view of a low level party worker named Wiston who doesn't like the view of the party. But he can't do anything about it because of the suppression of speach and thought and if you said or think about anything that is against the party or \\"Big Brother\\" the thought police comes in and brings you to the Ministry of Love (a prison like compound).Winston has a dairy ,which was bought illegally, that has all his thought crimes. As the story progresses Winston job was to \\"change history\\" by rewriting it and finds some things that don't add up. He desides to look into this more and finds out he was right. He then goes looking for the \\"Brotherhood\\" ,a revolutionary organization, and finds out that one of high up party members are a part of the \\"Brotherhood\\".Now that's all I will tell you about the story but I will tell that this is a clasic. This will make everyone think about there government diiferently. It's one of the books that everyone needs to read because it forces you to expand your views on everything. But there is one downside to this book, it doesn't make sense unless you know your hostory and governmental systems.I give this book a 4 out of 5."},{"Title":"1984","review":"thats all there is to it a must read for anyone with a beating heart."},{"Title":"1984","review":"George Orwell (Eric Arthur Blair) was born in 1903 in India, a part of the British Empire. His father worked in the Indian Civil Service. His family was part of the British middle class and could send Eric Blair for education at Eton, a famous public school in England. After Eton, Eric joined the Indian Imperial Police and he served five years in Burma. He resigned in 1927 as he disliked the political system which treated other races as inferior. He also wanted to concentrate on being a writer.Eric Blair decided to move away from the relatively privileged and pleasant life of the middle class and join the working class. He, therefore, changed his name to George Orwell. He then went to live with the poor in London and Paris, whom he considered to be victims of injustice. He wrote the book \\"Down and Out in Paris and London' in an attempt to educate the wealthy class about the life which poor people lived.In \\"1984\\", George Orwell continues on his theme of exposing the lie about the life under dictatorship and draws attention to it. He was able to detect fraud and dishonesty in the world of politics. He wanted to expose the lies and contradictions in politics. He exposes the sense of injustice, an exposition of the way a political system can suppress individual thought and emotion and how man can behave in inhuman ways towards other people.The author writes about a basic lie (in his opinion0 in which an imaginary England of 1984 was based on. The Party (a one party state) emphasised that there was no such thing as objective truth but that everything could be changed. The Party could, for instance, change the past at a moment's notice.Winston Smith is a member of the Party, which constitutes a small percentage of the population. He works at the Ministry of Truth and his job is in the Records Department of the Ministry. His job is to manipulate records at the whims of the Party. In writing \\"1984\\", George Orwell aims at exposing the inhuman nature of political oppression.Orwell published \\"1984\\" in 1949, a year before he died. He was very ill during the time he was writing and this partly explains why the book is so gloomy. The book is recommended reading for those who want to understand the nature of political oppression and manipulation and those that wish to understand the evil nature of dictatorship."},{"Title":"1984","review":"When George Orwell penned his novel in 1948, he created a gritting and grim dystopian future like none ever before. With the fall of Fascism and the rise of Communism, the world seemed bent on becoming a slave to totalitarian rule.In the world of 1984, three superstates exist: Eurasia, Eastasia, and Oceania, who wage an endless war against one another for dominance over man, and supremacy over the world. The story is set in the city of Airstrip One, a place once known as London in ages past. A place where \\"war is peace, freedom is slavery, and ignorance is strength\\". A place where love for another is a crime, where family is an extension of the Gestapo-like Thought Police, and where thought and individuality can mean one's death.The story focuses around Winston Smith, an Outer Party member for Big Brother, the dominant and omniscient regime of Oceania. He works at the Ministry of Truth, a place where history is altered and fabricated to suit the needs of the Party; and where people can simply be erased from existence. Winston appears to be like the rest of the brainwashed citizens; pledging his love to the Party, hating those considered enemies, and accepting the propaganda imposed on the rest of the masses. Yet hidden inside himself, he longs to discover the truth of the past, and a way to break the iron grip of the Party. Orwell's vivid tale pulls the reader in, as Winston engages in a forbidden love affair, joins a resistance movement, and ultimately confronts his enemies in the chilling conclusion.Though the year may have passed us by, the ideas have manifested themselves throughout time, and will echo in the centuries to come."},{"Title":"1984","review":"1984 is certainly a good book which fully explores this fascinating society. Winston's struggle was interesting, but it was the way this society was constructed that truly made this book great. I would encourage everyone to read it. The book starts off very slow, a little too slow for my taste, which is why I gave it four stars instead of five. Once it gets going, though, the book is truly engrossing. I was unable to put it down until the end."},{"Title":"1984","review":"\\"1984\\" by George Orwell is the kind of book that you only re-read because you didn't understand it the first time. While the concepts of the book are extremely intriguing, it lacks the kind of a plot line that would make it great. The lack of suspense and frequent drawn-out episodes make this book dry and very dense. The only things that got me through were the complex and extremely well thought out concepts which I couldn't stop thinking about. \\"1984\\" will cause you to rethink all that you know about the world you live in and make you pray that nothing like it will ever come to exist.With the single act of opening a blak diary, Winston Smith becomes an enemy of the Party, the totalitarian government led by a figure named Big Brother. \\"1984\\" follows Winston's fight against the oppressive government of the Party, including his search for an underground organization known as the Brotherhood and a secret love affair with another Party member. But in this world ruled by telescreens, doublethink, and the Thought Police, to oppose the Party is practically suicide. How can he know who to trust when falsification is the norm and the truth doesn't exist. Can he really expect to win against a government that has the power to rewrite the past and control human thought.I would recommend this book to people with a lot of patience. Anybody else will become frustrated before the first chapter ends on page 92. I would also recommend this book to anybody who has read \\"The DiVinci Code\\" or any of Dan Brown's other books. While not nearly as fast paced as \\"Angels and Demons\\", you will ensnared by the conceptual side of this book the same way I was. Overall, it's a good read for anybody that can handle complexity and density."},{"Title":"1984","review":"1984 deserves more than the usual, casual dismissal that, since communism is all but dead, we needn't worry about such things as totalitarianism spreading; democracy without end, amen. This is not true. Orwell may have written this at the beginning of the Cold War when we knew just how nasty life was in Russia, and looked to the USSR and Communism as its model. However, this could just as easily apply today.There are underlying themes in this book that apply to today's democracy-dominated world, unthreatened by the monolith of 1940's communism or fascism, just as they did in 1949, when this book was written.First, in the book they mention that people have the tendency to justify handing over power to a smaller, more efficient caste of people during an emergency. That's when it all starts to unravel. Give the government an inch and they will take a mile.When the press is not heterogenous and the government can influence it, you begin to have official lies. This happens in many countries that have \\"official state media\\" (think, the Middle East). Second, he mentions that when atrocities were committed by Oceania, they were considered noble but, committed by the enemy, were atrocities to be avenged. Be careful when you fight your enemy that you do not become just like him. It is when there is little difference between your tactics and that of whom you fight that you lose yourself and your identity as a human being.I could go on and on of countless examples, but these are just a few. You don't think a democracy could unravel? Think again. Read 1984."},{"Title":"1984","review":"The book is very original and good. If you like a book that plays with your mind and questions the realities of the present and what will happen in the future, then this book will be great."},{"Title":"1984","review":"In this book George Orwell depicts a world in which a collective consciousness is imposed and controlled by a superbeing called the Party, which by excerting control over every individual's mind obtains control over what it calls 'truth'. Every person is one with the Party, which is personified by the infallible and omnipotent (but nonexistent) Big Brother. Through the individual story of Winston Smith, who initially attempts to rebel against the Party and is later tortured and molded to accept the 'truth' Orwell shows how a heartless totalitarian state might emerge and remain in power permanently by stripping people of all of what we tend to call 'human nature'.The book has the clear purpose of warning the reader of the dangerous path our society is following. Throughout the course of the twentieth century, and even in the present day, we can see signs of the kind of mind control described in this book, as well as several instances of blatant declarations of omnipotence. It is up to us (humans) to keep the gruesome world described by Orwell from ever coming into existence."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Even if you've read this book in the past, it's time to re-read it. More relevance now than ever. One of 'the' great books."},{"Title":"1984","review":"1984 is about one man, Winston Smith, in a society that is really a physical and mental prison. When Winston believes he's found his own private space, however, he begins to do things - he begins to enjoy his freedom, extremely restricted though it is. Is there a happy ending? Does Winston continue to enjoy the fruits of his own privacy? Does he help topple the one party dictatorship? Read it and find out!I was very impressed with this book. I was impressed for two reasons: firstly it's beautifully written, despite its complexity; secondly, it has a sort of timeless relevance to our lives.The way Orwell expresses and captures sound, movement, thought and detail is really amazing: you read it and it's all vividly recreated in your mind - it can be scary. I think this may be because we are dealing with the darker side of human nature - POWER, its use and particularly its misuse.Secondly, and as many have commented on, this book has an important message. I don't want to give too much away to would be readers. For me, 1984 essentially raises questions about governance, privacy, control and power. These are issues we all, as citizens of our respective countries, should be greatly concerned about. Certainly, the society (if it can be called that) depicted in 1984 is one largely removed from modern democratic societies - it has greater direct resemblance with totalitarian regimes such as North Korea, or Stalin's time. But every time our governments enact new laws to increase there powers and reduce ours we need to think carefully and be cynical. In the age of the \\"war on terror\\" this book has great currency. I'll let you make the connections."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Maybe 1984 has come and gone, but its message is just as real as it was then. How much freedom are we willing to give up to feel safe? How much can we afford to believe the currant government? How much are they lying to us for thier own benifit? When did disagreeing with the governement become unamerican?1984 is a dreery story about what happens when there is no freedom. And I mean none. Real love is forbidden. Real thought is forbidden. All the matters is the love for the Party. And what the Party wants you to think.As the story goes on the major character does fall in love and sets out to destroy the party. I'm not going to give away the ending but I will tell you that its not a happy one.There was really only one way the story could have ended.I just hope things in real life don't end like that. But the older I get, the more I realize how close we are to 1984."},{"Title":"1984","review":"I can recommend 3 books to read before the election. Bob Woodwards Plan of Attack, Richard Clarke's Against All Enemies and Orwells 1984. Orwell's vision has finally come true. The parallels between his book and the Bush administration are frightening. War is Peace , have we heard that from The Bushies, Rumsfeld's Doublespeak, Please people read this book before the election and compare the book to the adminstration policies and then make the choice you think is right."},{"Title":"1984","review":"When I first started reading this book I knew it was going to be depressing. I knew Orwell was writing it to warn the world of the dangers of a totalitarian society, and he wanted to make it as horrible and realistic as possible. And the things that happened in the book were horrible, very horrible, but they weren't all realistic.I thought it was a good book up until where Julia and Winston were arrested. I think that's where Orwell stopped being realistic and he started letting his own cynical feelings get in the way of his writing. Orwell had a very sad life, and he was a depressed, bitter, and cynical man. It is good that we were warned about what the world could become, but realistically no government could ever control you to the extent that that government controlled Winston and Julia. When O'brien was torturing Winston he could read Winston's every thought. He knew Winston's every fear every doubt, and every feeling. He even knew what terrified Winston most in the world. He knew everything. He took something so precious from Winston. Someting that most of us take for granted. He took Winston's private innermost thoughts and changed them to fit the Party's ideals. I hated the ending to that book. That was the worst imaginable ending possible. If he would have lost everyting and been killed, but at least have died knowing that the Party was wrong I would have been happy. I think Julia was right. They can't get inside you.Another thing I found unrealistic was when O'brien spoke of how the party wanted only pure unadulterated power. Human nature has not changed in all the time humans have been on this earth. We are still selfish people that tend to want to go our own way, and do our own thing. It's unrealistic that whoever started the Party would desire only that people in the inner Party have only total power. The inner Party's only desire was to keep the Party alive and strong. Somewhere along the way someone would be selfish, and mess things up. I see Orwell's point on how a government can become so dangerously dominating and oppressing, but Orwell carried that idea too far. He carried it to the utmost extreme."},{"Title":"1984","review":"I had never read 1984 and was very excited to do so only to regret purchasing this edition. In the forward (by thomas pynchon) the entire ending is revealed in great detail. I knew what to expect through the entire book and I really wish that I could get my money back. Dont buy the centennial edition, or at least dont read the forward if you want a nice surprising read."},{"Title":"1984","review":"The Man doesn't want you to read &quot;1984&quot; 'cause He can't let you know His intentions. It's all about control, man. Look at September 11, which was, like many of the missile attacks in &quot;1984,&quot; staged by the US government to justify war. The Department of Homeland Security (Orwellian in its name) and the War on Terror (in classic Oceanic fashion, everything &quot;bad&quot; has &quot;terror&quot; and everything &quot;good&quot; has &quot;freedom&quot; in its name-- all language and understanding has been reduced to simplicity) were initiated afterwards, amidst much doublespeak and Orwellian rheteric from the mouths of the Bush Administration. The neverending war against Eurasia/Eastasia used to justify domestic surveillance and limitation on civil liberties in &quot;1984&quot; are mirrored in the present day by the ongoing &quot;War on Terror&quot; and its consequencial PATRIOT act that has curtailed civil liberties. Anyone who says this book is &quot;dated&quot; or &quot;outdated&quot; is either ignorant, blind to the condition of this great nation or working for THE MAN!!"},{"Title":"1984","review":"I really enjoyed the story, however, the Akasha printing is horrible. Throughout the entire book there are extra spaces between words and sometimes dashes where there shouldn't be any. For example, I just picked up the book to a random page and the following sentence reads: \\"But at this moment there was a din of shouting and a zoom of heavy vehicles from some- where to the left.\\" After \\"some\\" there is a dash and space before \\"where\\", but the word does not occur at the end of a line or at the margin. Also, each paragraph is separated by an extra space. Overall, this printing is way too distracting for a comfortable read and I was compelled to purchase a different version. I recommend the 60th Anniversary Edition by Plume which is a far superior professional presentation. My girlfried tried to suffer the Akasha version after me, but ultimately had to set it aside because of the distractions (she also enjoyed and finished with the Plume print). The Akasha version currenly shows out of stock and hopefully Amazon keeps it that way. Stay away if it comes back."},{"Title":"1984","review":"I bought this book because of the great story and the front cover.

Not happy."},{"Title":"1984","review":"I read this book during Bush's 2nd term and I have to say, the parallels were unnerving. I like the romantic liason that occurs so clandestinely and unexpectedly. This was pretty scary stuff. The political pontificating was suffocating at times, but then, it was quite a bit of genius in itself. You have to wonder how this guy could come up with this 'stuff' (word substituted). Yes, we have our own levels of censorship even in the land of the \\"free.\\""},{"Title":"1984","review":"I cannot express how unhappy I was with this book. Orwell sets forth a brilliant and chilling portrayal of what could happen if governement went horribly wrong. You hate it, you sympathize with the main character, you root for him to come through it all...and in the end, he just rolls over and submits. No heroic death, nothing. Winston becomes the thing he hates, and thus ends the book. Nothing is accomplished, and the book ends up feeling like a waste. I must agree with a previous reviewer in saying \\"this book made me feel less human for having read it\\". Any book that can make me feel dirty on a fundamental level deserves at least 3 stars for sheer writing power alone.For a more uplifting, yet equally gritty dystopian novel about the human spirit in a fantasy setting, try Terry Goodkind's \\"Faith of the Fallen\\". While the series may not have much merit as a whole, this book seems to me like a mirror image of 1984...it portrays the same world, delivers the same warning, except it doesn't make you want to commit suicide."},{"Title":"1984","review":"What exactly is the truth? It's whatever I tell you it is. This attitude exemplifies the overall tone of 1984. Its actual English definition is any systematic, widespread dissemination or promotion of particular ideas, doctrines, practices, etc. to further one's own cause or to damage an opposing one. However, the Newspeak word, doublethink, would suffice in 1984.In 1984, classism and government conspiracies are taken to the extreme.The proles, and inferior class, are treated as animals, incapable of intelligent thought. For this reason, Party rules do not apply and everything goes.Party members, anyone above the prole working class, are subject to a government invasion of every inch of their lives. They have been brainwashed by Party ideology since day one.Orwell's \\"negative utopia\\" is striking, yet I find the novel to be drab and depressing. Rarely am I inspired to read on; all I have to look forward to is another vaporization. The last chapter was literally torturous, yet I kept reading so as to put Winston, the protagonist, out of his misery.It is also a bit of a stretch to say that deleting words from a language would render its speakers unable to express emotions or intelligent thought. New words would be invented as they have for thousands of years."},{"Title":"1984","review":"The book 1984 by George Orwell, was a great book if you are into Sci Fi/adventure novels. The only part of the book I did not like was the ending. Winston sells out. Through the whole book he has you believe he secretly wants to disobey and rebell against this opressive leadership, but then at the end instead of taking the cruel death with pain and honor he sells out. He takes the easy road. It almost makes it seam like the whole book was for nothing. He ended right where he started off. Other than the sell out ending, the book kept my attention and gets a rating of 4 out of 6 on the Rob scale."},{"Title":"1984","review":"What can I say \\"IT ORWELL\\" the master, funny how right he was and how Obama and Harper are exactly what he warned us about.

Not mad at Orwell, or Winston (the main charterer), more mad at the way it went. Don't worry no spoilers here but as a first time read for this nearly 35 year old guy I can say that I'm glad I waited to read it as I think having done so at a lesser age wouldn't have proved as beneficial an understanding as it did just now.This is a 4+ star book (we'll just round it down to 4 for measures sake) in my opinion simply for the fact that it was able to move me and keep my attention even while not reading it. Recommended"},{"Title":"1984","review":"I tend to like books with more action than the way this book was written. I also feel like I had a hard time grasping the full meaning intended by the author. Having said that, take my impression and opinion with a grain of salt.This book was more of an expression of feeling, than a good story. The idea of the government watching everybody all the time is fascinating to me albeit ridiculous. He seemed to express hoplessness toward mans future, and extreme cynicism about the reasons for war. He was clearly a socialist. I wonder what George Orwell would have said about the way England, or Israel deal with terrorists in 2010?OK I'm off my soapbox now... I would recommend this book to anybody who is interested in conspiracies, just for the fact that it is a classic."},{"Title":"1984","review":"The book is a little bit more yellow and worn than I would like. This was not metion."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Orwell was a genius at forseeing future trends. He was also ingeneious at crafting the protrait of totalitarian control while using material from the media and political journals as his paint medium. His ability to take \\"spin\\" to its final conclusion with the term \\"Newspeak\\" is truly prophetic. The book is a warning cry for western civilization as it progresses to larger systems of government, and away from individual responsibility.On a somewhat negative side, are the main character, Winston's, interactions with and perceptions of some females in his society. While musing on the obviously \\"politically-correct\\" feminist female of the day, the author, through Winston, steps away from most readers by expressing contempt through Winston's desire to \\"ravage the woman and strangle her at the moment of climax.\\" There are other graphic and sometimes repulsive descriptions of sexual escapades of the main character."},{"Title":"1984","review":"I found the O'Brien character in 1984 to be unrealistic. The idea of someone intelligent enough to run a sophisticated surveillance state acting against economic progress and enjoying ruling over people in the most brutal and barbaric way is not realistic. Compare this to Koestler's Darkness at Noon, in my opinion a far superior novel, where the state is run by violent but stupid brutes who would not be intelligent enough to run a sort of 1984 dystopia.However, this is still a great novel in that it accurately predicted the inevitable surveillance of everyone's lives that has been a reality, and is increasingly becoming more and more prevalent, with the surface justification being anti-terrorism. Winston, an isolated individual, can do nothing against the powerful bureaucracy and his attempt to oppose the state just leads to him being crushed. The imagery is the strongest part of the novel, with, for example the \\"10 minutes of hatred\\" and the \\"Ministry of Truth\\" propagated lies. It has become a part of our language, and both sides on the political spectrum lionize Orwell to demonstrate that the other side is immoral even while engaging in Orwellian language themselves in the same breath.However, Orwell, a miserable pessimist, like so many science fiction writers could see no solutions, and so 1984 has become a symbol of a future that must be opposed. He did not think of any possible solutions but only illustrated a future in which individuals were crushed by an omnipotent bureaucracy which only enjoyed crushing people.Orwell makes the bureaucracy one-dimensional, and as Dr. Dolan from the online newspaper the Exile points out, his choice of the name \\"O'Brien\\" demonstrates his particular form of British racism. Authors do not pick names randomly and Orwell was implying something without actually wanting to provide any details, because 1984 is on the whole a rant, but a very good rant that conjures up powerful imagery. If Orwell had created a more realistic portrayal of the future, even a more realistic dystopia, it may not have been as powerful in its effect on the reader.Since someone inevitably will make use of surveillance technology, either through the government, or if the government's powers were severely repressed, as libertarians believe is necessary to ensure progress and freedom, then through powerful corporations who bend the law and use their profits to surveil and manipulate the populace, and evade government attempts to stop them. Inevitably the power of surveillance will lie in someone's hands; it's just a matter of who. Thus the vast majority of individuals who simply view surveillance with superstitious hostility have not really thought about the issue much, and may simply have a desire to believe their lives are being controlled in the same way that many people, from environmentalists to religious zealots, pray for the end of the world.When this surveillance state uses its powers for its own selfish reasons and for the sheer thrill of power or when its tactics are unnecessarily brutal and disruptive, it must be opposed with every means necessary. However, if it allows legitimate free debate but only acts to disrupt organizations and movements that are nihilistically destructive, and people who seek to impose a 1984 dystopia upon us, then it may be a source of good. However, it is proper that our natural reaction is to be skeptical, and blunders the CIA and FBI continuously make demonstrate that we cannot blindly accept that they are a progressive force.The fact that they allow their blunders to be revealed illustrates the unnecessary barbarity of some of their methods. The check on their power indeed comes from whistleblowers like Mike Levine, author of the bestselling expose of the CIA's involvement in the drug war (their interests were not in stopping people from using drugs) who point out their failures to discerning and curious individuals. If they go too far their will be a reaction against them and their power will be reduced, and individual agents purged.Thus it is important that those who wield the powers of surveillance realize that the most important reason why they possess these powers is to prevent less scrupulous individuals from using these powers to malign and destroy decent individuals. In 1984, the reporting of events was changed to represent the interest of Big Brother. Readers naturally and correctly find this concept scary, and the CIA and FBI have, at times, used such tactics themselves to uneccessarily destroy the lives of dissenting individuals when the tactics of debate should have been used rather than brute suppression if the whistleblower really did not have a full understanding of the larger and correct motivations behind their tactics.If, like Lenin, they see the cautious use of force as a weakness rather than a symbol of superiority, then it does not matter what political party, ideology, or interests they serve; they have gone too far and must be routed out and attacked, not just by intellectuals like Chomsky made inconsequential by his incessant and one-sided rants, but by intelligent and brave individuals, whether liberal, conservative, or apolitical. Certainly there are times when force or using coercive tactics may be necessary, but the less such tactics are used the better. Non-interference, laying back and letting events take their course until just the right moment rather than sticking their finger in every pie, is the best option.Perhaps the key element is how they deal with exceptional individuals - scientists, literary figures, charismatic but intelligent politicians. If they only attempt to manipulate these individuals for their own end, controlling their every action, they may greatly reduce the good the individual could have produced.It is right that we, non-members of the Surveillance Party, skeptically try to deduce the influence spooks have on our lives and political events. It is also natural that the spooks try to keep their actions secret; that's who they are. When they use barbaric and destructive tactics it should be pointed out at every opportunity."},{"Title":"1984","review":"George Orwell published a book entitled 1984. The novel made a huge impact and made a statement about humanity. He wrote the book in 1949, envisioning the future of man. He believed that there would be dictatorship by the government by 1984.The novel's main character is Winston Smith. He doubts the system or the government, in which is Big Brother that's controls Oceania, one of the three super states. Winston is older than most citizens of the super state. He slightly remembers life before Big Brother. Big Brother would prefer people not to know the past. Though his memories are indistinct, he thinks that life must have been better before Big Brother's leadership. As Winston's rebellion progresses, he meets Julia, who is also against Big Brother. Winston and Julia become lovers and confess their rebelliousness to O'Brien, who is believed to be a member of a rebel group called Brotherhood. Then comes the story's climax. The reader will be introduced to what's behind 1984. George Orwell brings suspense in the story when he shows us what is really behind Big Brother. Big Brother uses mental manipulation to influence its citizens. This book reminds us of political tragedies, how the government can control everything. George Orwell reminds us of what went wrong, what can go wrong, and what will go wrong when the government becomes all-powerful. I believe that this book opened my mind to politics. 1984 is one of the best books written. Orwell writes about reality and bases its contents to the real world."},{"Title":"1984","review":"I LOVE THIS BOOK. If you haven't read it, you are totally missing out. Enough said."},{"Title":"1984","review":"This book is unrelentingly, amazingly depressing. It's absolutely graphically realistic in it's descriptions, and the story - I'm gonna give it away here - does not end happily. I read this in high school and have never forgotten it; it frightened me then and it still frightens me. The word is bleak.You should still read it. You should not only read books that give you happiness, or catharsis, or what you want; those are candy for your mind and will not tell you harsh truths. You should also read books that give you gifts you don't want, gifts that make you uncomfortable or upset or frightened. Books that point out things you'd much rather you could ignore and hope they'd go away. That's why this is a classic; not because of stupendous writing or anything else (I've seen better writing).I still hate this book. And I still gave it 4 stars."},{"Title":"1984","review":"1984 by George Orwell was brilliant, disturbing, excellently written, depressing and most of all eerily predicting of the future. I enjoyed reading it very much. Orwell's writing is phenomenal. The way he describes things is incredible and beautiful. I admired his bold statement against socialism. His book was extremely persuasive and should be read by all that have not yet read it. It is a classic, yet it holds all the contemporary aspects of a newer book. No part of this novel was unsatisfying for me. There were no parts of the novel that did not keep me waiting for what would happen next. This could quite possibly be my favorite book that I have read yet."},{"Title":"1984","review":"I don't think I will ever get over the fact that this book is so accurate about the future.

How ironic someone would have know this was going to happen so many years ahead of time.Excellent reading and I don't normally read fiction."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Imagine, for a second, that tomorrow a large Atomic War starts, and the world is divided into three states. You are under the command of a leader called \\"Big Brother\\". Constantly on government surveillance, you try to escape Big Brother's listening and viewing devices, but, of course, you can't. Nobody can really escape.In the year 1984, bombs invade the city of London. On the Malabar Front a war starts, in another state of the world, called Eastasia. The Ministry of Truth, a government organization, broadcasts to the population via a network of telescreens. These devices, which intrude on all aspects of people's lives, are also capable of monitoring their every word and action. They form part of an immense surveillance system used by the Ministry of Love -another government organization- and its dreaded agents called Thought Police, to serve their singular goal: the elimination of \\"thought crime\\". Winston Smith is a Party worker; Part of the social party known as the Outer Party, the pity of the intrusive government. Winston works in the Records Department of the Ministry of Truth - the government organization in charge of modifying historical news for consistency. When Winston finds proof that the Party is lying, he starts off on a journey of self-questioning. In doing so, he becomes a thought-criminal. Winston begins to notice that a young Party member, Julia, is watching him. She wears the special sash of the ultra-zealous Anti Sex League and Winston fears that she is an informant. However, to his surprise, she reveals herself as a subversive, and they begin a dangerous relationship. This inspires Winston to explore deeper the difference between propaganda and reality. Ultimately, it leads him to O'Brien - a member of the Inner Party who sets Winston on the beginning of an amazing discovery.The book 1984 is a perfect read for anyone that is willing to see the world in a whole new aspect. Not written to a specific group of people, this book can be perceived from any point of view, and from any part of a modern-day- society. One reason people should read this book is because it sees the government from a whole new perspective. The book, 1984 was published in 1949. It predicts the way that a slightly communist government, would function in the future. What I find completely surprising, is that many of the futuristic devices in the book 1948 have become true to this day. When you put a good amount of thought into it, it all becomes reality. Today the government watches our every move through computer, phone, and ever video surveillance. It's scary to think that even now, as you read this, someone could be watching you. Also, the government still hides secrets through propaganda press. Another reason why this book should be read, is because it has a large array of quotes, such as: \\"War is peace, Freedom is Slavery, Ignorance is Strength\\" (Orwell, 1949, p.27). It provides the reader with a complete set of wisdom and knowledge through its quotation and lessons. The last reason that I will share, why someone should read this book, is because it keeps your interest. Even though the book isn't exactly a fast read, it's completely addicting the entire way through. Keeping your hands off of it is an almost impossible task to accomplish. It contains the ability to keep the attention of a monkey, and yet can relate to someone with the intelligence of Einstein.In conclusion everyone, and I mean everyone, should read this book. With its perspective of government conspiracy, relation to modern day life, knowledgeable quotes, ability to contain attention, and its intelligent relation; I am positive it will keep you, and anyone else, on the edge of their seat.-Jonathan Lightcap"},{"Title":"1984","review":"This is the classic and the mould of the dystopian narrative. Clearly written to explore the plausibility of what would happen if the technocratic regime of the socialist state was allowed to take its course, it stretches beyond this very palpable social critique. The final part is the most disturbing and harrowing as one can almost feel Winston's physical and psychological torment in a world that forbids love and legitimates peace through fear.I am amazed that this was written so long ago since these drives in social order seem so shockingly prevalent and the spectre of war as a lever to condition responses from the masses is clearly a vehicle even in the US. It does slowdown in the middle with the very transparent political commentary wrought by Goldstein's manual. Yet the impact of what abuse and harnessing of technical, psychological, social, and political power punches hard at the end."},{"Title":"1984","review":"I did not personally choose to read 1984 and at first had I no interest whatsoever, however that quickly changed when I got past the peculiar lingo of \\"newspeak\\" (annoyed me that I had to keep jumping to the back of the book for the meanings). Orwell intrigued me with his descriptive writing and caused me to hang on his every word as Wilson Smith, the main character, went about his life in a supposed Utopia. The fact that Big Brother, an unknown and possibly inexistent force, has so much control over this world. At first I was skeptic as to how on point Orwell would be predicting what may occur in the future but he was somewhat dead on. The entire movement of \\"The Party\\" seemed like modern day communism - everyone was referred to as comrade and no one had any say and couldn't even think negatively about anything that may have seemed wrong in society, for the thought police would get you. No one was treated better nor worse except if you were a traitor, then you were VAPORIZED!!!! As funny as it may sound, If Orwell had used actual countries, I would of thought it was factual, rather than some prophetic vision.One of my favorite scenes in 1984 was when Julia, Wilson's lover, came back from a proletarian quarter of the town wearing make-up and speaking of wearing a womans frock. I reminded me of a scene out of Pleasantville. She was only person with rouge cheeks and deeply reddened lips and make-up dabbed here and there, she stood out like a sore thumb.The importance of castes and war, erasing the past and replacing it with falsified information, hiding from the authorities, and only feeling safe when the lights are out; Orwell makes you wonder if theses rules still apply in modern time.I suggest more people read this or any other by George Orwell, I plan on reading Animal Farm next."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Brilliant literature!I recommend all books by this author.I also love the fact that the publisher, 1stWorld Library has made the text slightly larger which is a blessing for my thirty-something eyes. Great job. I have dozens of books by this publisher.The Second DeclarationEvery Day A Miracle Happens"},{"Title":"1984","review":"I bought it and read it. Orwell does create a pretty horrifying world but I felt he spent a bit too much time on the exposition. I did stay hooked though because I wanted to know why would this government do this to its people and I think I got a bit of an anticlimactic but realistic answer."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Discomfiting, penetrating, imaginative, and very grey, this book deserves its fame not for elegance of prose (it is only adequately written) nor for an interesting plot (not much happens, at least as novels usually go), but for its indelible, devastating portrait of human degradation and its far-fetched-yet-just-around-the-corner description of the hows and whys of totalitarian power. A dramatic, illuminating read."},{"Title":"1984","review":"This should me a must read for everyone. It will make you think twice about things that go on in our government and those around the world."},{"Title":"1984","review":"The grim darkness in which this book is written vividly paints the first picture that pops into my mind anytime I think of a totalitarian state, increasing government control or oppressing individualism and individual freedoms (and most any dystopia for that matter). It's not like Huxley's \`Brave New World', which is designed as a utopia and actually has some innocuous circumstances, or Zamyatin's \`We', which is also designed as a utopia and at least holds a clean appearance for its citizens, it's an extreme extrapolation of even North Korea. There is absolutely nothing appealing or redeeming about the 1984 society or life, which makes the main character's life all the more fascinating.The reach and relevance of this book to today are profound in that there are frequent references to it and its ideas in other books, movies, the media and even idle coffee shop conversations as it is the foundation of terms/concepts such as Orwellian, Big Brother, thoughtcrime/ Thought Police, War is Peace, doublethink, newspeak, etc. That combined with it being a good, well-written, thought provoking book make for a compelling reason to read it."},{"Title":"1984","review":"This classic utopian novel depicts a mad, fascist world, where truth is controlled by the government, and independent thought is illegal. Compassion for others is punishable by death; the only love allowed is for \\"Big Brother\\" who is always watching you through telescreens that permeate everywhere. The world is divided up into three superpowers, East Asia, Eurasia, and Oceania, which consists of the Americas and the former British Empire including London where this novel is set. The world is in a constant state of war. All social and technological progress has halted. All humanistic values like peace and love are crushed. The fascist government has complete control over every aspect of people's lives, including their thoughts.The people are in a perpetual state of poverty. The proles are the ignorant, listless lower class. The Outer party is the middle class, where our protagonist, Winston, resides; they do most of the so-called professional work for the Inner Party, though still live in abject misery. They work grueling hours in tiny cubicles, delivering misinformation to an ignorant public. (Sound familiar?) Sex is not to be enjoyed by party members; it is only for procreation. (Does this sound familiar?) Any violation is constituted a sexcrime. The English language is being stripped of words, butchered, and consolidated; OldSpeak is being translated into NewSpeak, a simplistic language consisting of compound words like DoubleSpeak. The people are incited into anger against their opponent in war and Goldstein, the leader of an imaginary opposition. It is a fascist world that crushes what is left of humanity.Winston, likely named by the author after Winston Churchill, is a middle-aged man working in the Outer Party. He begins to rebel against the fascist state by writing a journal in secrecy, committing thoughtcrimes, and entering to an illicit affair with the young Julia. He is betrayed by O'Brien, an Inner Party member, who seduces him with the truth. Winston and Julia are caught in bed and sent to the Ministry of Love, where they are tortured and brainwashed. In the end, they betray each other, and Winston confesses his love for Big Brother.This is a haunting, depressing novel, but a very important read. The political allegories can be applied to society today; it is intended as a warning to us. This novel is engrossing, thought-provoking, intelligent, and very-well written.

It's 1984. Most people have seen enough references that they understand the word \\"Orwellian\\", \\"Thought police\\", \\"New speak\\", or \\"Big Brother\\" even if they've never read this.Nevertheless, reading it gives a much clearer view of these concepts.1984 is on a short list of books that have probably prevented the very totalitarian societies they predict. It fills the reverse function of the books fictional \\"Newspeak\\" -- it adds to our vocabulary and therefore to our ability to think and defend ourselves against oppression.I read this while I was also studying cults and mind control, and Orwell captures these concepts very well in this fictional dystopian world."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Even though this book has been out for a number of years, it is more appropriate today than the day it was written.

Don't get me wrong though, I enjoy getting my thoughts provoked, just not usually at slower paces with passive characters.

I was mesmerized, betrayed, bewitched, and baffled by how real it felt especially since the world today is witnessing similar kind of revolution in the shape of the Arab Spring.

The whole reason we live in a democracy is so that we the people don't have to worry about things like this. &quot;Brave New World&quot; played up the science fiction aspect of it's &quot;futuristic&quot; setting ,and I thought that book worked much better. Orwell's lecturing on politics was ok one time around (&quot;Animal Farm&quot;), but this book gets so bogged down in a million issues that just don't matter (&quot;double-speak?&quot; Who cares how people choose to talk-- we should be able to talk to each other however we want) and gets lost. If you want to read Orwell when he actual has something to say, try &quot;The Road to Wigan Pier,&quot; which acutally is enlightening, not this preachy homily of something that never happened. It's 2000. 1984 was a bad movie with Michael J. Fox."},{"Title":"1984","review":"This is a good example of the fact that pessimistic and shocking books often receive rave criticism while dynamically optimistic books are dubbed &quot;unrealistic&quot;... NO further comment."},{"Title":"1984","review":"&quot;1984&quot; is hailed as the greatest novel of all time. I disagree. Had this been written at a different time, it would have been hailed differently. The fact remains, however, that this was the Cold War and everyone hated Communism. Thus anything that was against it, no matter how false or trivial, was inflated beyond belief. This wasn't limited to 1984; it was present in the case of Solzhenitsyn. Solzhenitsyn wrote a well-written anti-Soviet novel, therefore Solzhenitsyn was hailed as a hero of democracy, even though his subsequent books were mediocre. I do not believe that 1984 is a travesty because it lacks action. I believe that this book is a travesty because it is false.People say that this novel had an exquisitely crafted plot which readers such as myself are too daft to comprehend. They may be right. However, Orwell did not craft this exquisite plot. It was gleaned from Zamyatin's _We_, for starters. Secondly, this was the topic of the day. _Everyone_ was writing about how bad and evil communism was. _Everyone_ was taking pain to diffuse the utopian philosophies of the previous century. The societies of 1984 and Brave New World are very similar. 1984 and Animal Farm are the same book with the names changed. As I stated originally, the characters of the two novels are identical. Napoleon is Big Brother, or perhaps O'Brien, Boxer is Winston, Snowball is Goldstein, Squealer is Mr. Charrington, etc. Orwell plagiarized himself, Zamyatin, and countless other authors who wrote about the exact same thing.Orwell was not meaning to denegrate the theory of communism, becuase he was not familiar with the theory of communism. He was meaning to denegrate Russia and socialism and show them exactly the way the West portrayed them. It makes no difference that he was at some point a member of the Communist Party. If you read Richard Wright's _Black Boy_, you will see several Americans who were in the American Communist Party, yet didn't know the ideals they claimed to represent. They were in it for the fun. Ditto George Orwell.People say that Orwell had to understand a theory that was developed in his own country. I say: pfft. Firstly, many middle-class Americans today believe that excerpts from the Declaration of Independence are Communist propaganda meant to subvert American minds in the Cold War. (You know, the parts that say &quot;all men are created equal&quot;?) Secondly, communism was not developed in England and Karl Marx did not have sole rights to it. The ideas behind it were conceived in the epoch of Enlightenment by French philosophers.I do not say Orwell is retaliating against anything. That implies he had something against it. I believe he was simply playing upon the mood of the day to please the public. Say what they want to hear and add some sex in there to make it interesting and it will sell. People view him as God's prophet; I view him as a boring, unoriginal one-hit wonder who wanted to make a buck rehashing much-talked-of, much-written-of themes."},{"Title":"1984","review":"While embarking on this &quot;classic,&quot; don't expect to find yourself absorbed in a magnificant tale. 1984 is a redundant novel with unnecessary tangents and pages of contradicting philosophy. ...and must we really keep reading in full detail the horror and disgust of Winston's vericose veins?!"},{"Title":"1984","review":"Orwell is one of the most overrated novelists of this century. He's nothing more nor less than a second-rate hack who profiteered by preying on the worst fears of modern man. Today, his book is the modern bible of the paranoid disgruntled white male and other conspiracy nutcases. Yet another fairy tale, albeit a grown-up one, warns us to LOOK OUT for that proverbial boogy man--Big Brother, in this case, being the latest in a long line of aliases he goes under. Perhaps Orwell's &quot;Newspeak&quot; should include these additions: &quot;Propaganda is Truth&quot;; &quot;Truth is Absolute&quot;; &quot;Freedom springs from Fear&quot;; &quot;Extremism is Virtue.&quot; This book has never made anyone stop to think, but, instead, to fear and hate one more faceless abstraction. Contemporary paranoia gets a much more powerful portrayal in the works of Thomas Pynchon, such as &quot;The Crying of Lot 49.&quot; At least IT has the virtue of being well written."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Cannot say that I enjoyed reading this book, because I did not approve of a lot of the things the author included. However, I did find some of the main points interesting to create a story. But definitely not the type of good book to read, nor would I recommend it."},{"Title":"1984","review":"I read this book about 15 years ago in high school, and did not enjoy it. I thought I'd give it another try now, to see if I'd view it in a different and wiser perspective. Given the rapidly expanding government of today along with the weak economic situation, I thought I would be able to draw some parallels from this book in relation to the modern world.Having finished it, I feel thoroughly disappointed. While I grasp the ideas the author attempts to convey to the reader, I feel it is done in the poorest context ever. The story is so utterly mundane and boring that I found my mind drifting from the story to more interesting things - like my fingernails and shoe laces. The characters are so disconnected and the relationship between them and the reader so weak, that even at the end of the book I could not get myself to care about Winston (main character) enough to give a crap about whether he lived or died. The ideas and their implications in the book are deep but are presented so poorly that I would compare it to the reading of a dictionary, or a ceiling fan warranty manual, only less interesting. It did not take long for me to remember why I hated reading this in school.For the life of me I cannot understand why this book is so highly regarded in the world of literature. Yes, it has ideas that could cause one to have complex thoughts on many levels, but I found that the actual reading of this book was so awfully boring that it totally negated anything positive that could be derived from this novel. The main character is subjected to a great deal of torture at the end of the book... and so is the reader - as I found that the only thing more painful than the torture was reading about it. George Orwell is no wordsmith and his style of writing stinks and flows like verbal diarrhea. It even leaves a bad aftertaste, as diarrhea should, preventing one from revisiting the ideas in the book due to the runny, turd-like substance that Orwell considers to be the storyline.The ideas in this book have seen many embodiments since its publication. From \\"Demolition Man\\" to a certain episode of \\"The Outer Limits\\", all of them FAR more interesting than Orwells' own writing, even if the ideology of the message being somewhat diluted when compared to the original. The moral of the story is hard to care about when the story itself sucks. I have to wonder, what kind of sad people chose this book to be mandatory reading in our public schools? What was going thru their minds? \\"I'm am so miserable and everyone should be too, so I will make them suffer by reading this!\\"I remember dissecting the meaning of the novel in school, for over a week. Any book that takes that long to understand is unclear and poorly written. I don't mind a convoluted message as long as the story is good, and in this case it is NOT. I can sum up the entire story in a few pages, but Orwell stretches it out to the point of nausea. I have read many other books from the 50's era and none were this boring. I actually have the \\"New Edition\\", and while I'm not sure what they changed, I feel like it should be advertised on the cover \\"Now less interesting!!!\\" the way cereal boxes advertise \\"Now 50% more!!!\\". I highly recommend this book if you have a melatonin deficiency and have trouble sleeping."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Orwell is not my favorite author, obviously. 1984 may have been the crux of his career, but for me it is the worst book ever. It is most obviously an attempt at satire of communism. The thing here is, does the author or any of his readers know what communism is?There are so many parallels between 1984 and Animal Farm, his other acclaimed book. Big Brother is Napoleon, of course. (parody of Stalin) Snowball is Goldstein (parody of Trotsky). The windmill is the Flying Fortress, what keeps being rebuilt over and over. There is little original about this novel.How do the numerous sexually abundant scenes in this book help its role as a satire? All that happens is Winston has sex with Julia. There is a constant war with a country, and the hint is that Oceania is THE only country in the world. Does this hint that communism creates a warlike society?Communism in its true form is a state no government has yet achieved. It occurs when the level fo technology becomes so great that machines do all the dirty work (i.e. growing crops, making clothes) and humanity can devote itself to higher, sophisticated pursuits, like drama or science. It is originally a state of peace, not war. There is no money in a society. There is no government, because everyone can do what they want to do. So bleak compared to Orwell's paranoia. Communism is too often regarded as the &quot;bad thing.&quot; Nobody really understands it. Did Orwell? The fact that he was once a member of the Communist Party makes no difference. As Richard Wright pointed out, Americans in that party hardly understood it either."},{"Title":"1984","review":"This book's reputation as a classic reveals less about the book than it does about the shallowness and mediocrity of many book critics.

So much has been written about it since its publication that the question has to be: what on earth can be said about it that hasn't already been said or written?This is a horror novel - pure and simple. Smith's predicament is awful and utterly believable, all thanks to Orwell's bleak, desperate prose and brutally insightful imagination. It could also be described as prophetic, I think.The novel opens with the totalitarian government already in place, the masses already beaten into submission - but how did it all start? No government could shift from Democracy (however false), to this novel's style of complete control and brainwashing overnight. I would love to know Orwell's thoughts about how the transition was made - and how long it took...Would Orwell take a look at the style of government we have now, and see the beginnings of dangerous state interference at work? The way Tony Blair and Gordon Brown have created a government based on deception and manipulating the public may sound alarm bells in Orwell's mind - if only he were here to have his say.People have pride in their national identity - their nation's history, as well. So that needs to be eroded first. How would Big brother do that in the novel? Maybe it started with opening the country's borders to anyone that fancied it, so that the national identity that binds people together could start to dissolve - all in the name of \\"diversity\\". Maybe early Big Brother insisted on smearing anyone who argued against this as \\"racist\\". Sound familiar?But Big Brother wouldn't stop there, would it? It would need to quicken theEradication of National Identity by binding as many nations together by whatever means it could; a single currency, a common foreign policy between nations, perhaps? Maybe that's how Orwell would have written it if 1984 contained Big Brother's back story. That would just be the start, wouldn't it?Perhaps Big Brother would construct the largest DNA database in the world, and try and force the people to carry ID cards containing DNA samples? Maybe it would want to bug the cars on its streets so that the police would automatically know who had broken the speed limit, and where the driver was when they did it? Sound familiar?It's impossible to know how Orwell would have handled Big Brother's back story, and also ridiculous to say that such a society and government could never exist. Ask a Romanian.In a few years you could ask a Brit"},{"Title":"1984","review":"This novel was undoubtedly a classic when it was written in the late forties because it was so futuristic, with its telescreens and three worldpowers. Orwell, a critic of fascism and communism, goes in the perspective of Winston Smith, a man who is against \\"Big Brother\\"- the figurehead of The Party. For the first one hundred pages, he gives readers an interesting description and plot development of the terrifying future. After that, the story becomes stained with the smelly stain of an unnecessary romance and it all goes downhill from there. It becomes sadly repetitive and frankly, boring. Orwell reveals a previously unknown side- a sexy, sultry side- as he goes in depth about the human sexual instincts, which becomes disgusting after awhile. The ending is of no surprise. The back cover of the book hints at reading the last four words, and no one can possibly stop from reading them. Though I won't spoil it, it isn't really necessary whether or not you read them because you know deep down what's ahead in this \\"modern classic.\\" I suggest you save yourself a few torturous days and read \\"Animal Farm\\"."},{"Title":"1984","review":"My name is Kevin Olson I am a senior at walla walla high school and I recently read the book 1984, I really enjoy most science fiction books, but in 1984 I had complaints about the fact that I felt like i was outside looking down on the characters instead ofbeing along side of them during the different ordeals through out the story. the mood generally seemed hopeless in both the beginning and the ending. I think that it was like a movie with a very bad ending. so if you want to watch a movie thats based on this book, but has a better ending then go ahead and watch the movie equilibrium."},{"Title":"1984","review":"The message the author was trying to get to the readers was good, and Orwell did a pretty good job writing it, but the plot ruined the book.

The caution of not ever letting a Totalitarianist government come to power was the over arching theme of the book.

This isn't a book I would recomend to anyone who wants a casual book to read but if you want a book that will make you think a little than this is a good book to choose."},{"Title":"1984","review":"This is one of my favorite books of all time. The reasons are even obscure to me but I suppose it is probably because I read it as a student at a critical time of my own development. It questions so much and most of all takes us to the meaning of very fundamental issues in life. I always want to think of it as a bad prediction which never came true but the truth is quite the opposite and that is something which I don't like and don't want to be true. Somehow I need to know that the true meaning of Utopia is based on love.

This novel will make you look at today's changes and wonder how much of it is truly science fiction.

You can't deny its influence and certainly not the dire predictions of the future. A bit premature perhaps (but the main character isn't sure if it really IS 1984, he just thinks it is as his &#34;best guess&#34;.At the time of the writing you can forgive George's guess at the telescreen technology, but perhaps under appreciating the need for social norms self-imposed on contrarian thinking in modern society."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Love the book, very appropriate for the time we live in. It arrived in the condition described."},{"Title":"1984","review":"It may be said that great books comment on their times, and on the human experience, but masterpieces actually shape history. We may look at George Orwell's 1984 in two ways: first, his description of the terror of totalitarianism, which his generation witnessed firsthand in the form of Nazi Germany and Stalinist Russia. Orwell does a masterful job of presenting such a world in its day-to-day reality, the unspoken weight of oppression found in police states, the everpresent fear that becomes natural after a while, the ease with which that fear eventually makes you just go along with it all.But history has also shown us that totalitarianism eventually burns itself out, that it cannot be sustained in the long run. This is scant reassurance for its millions of victims, true, but maybe a bit of hope for the rest of us. The second point about 1984, and the thing that makes it a masterpiece, is the way that it has shaped our culture today, not through its description of totalitarianism itself but the way it describes the very real methods used by governments and ideologies to control us. Terms like \\"doublethink\\" are now a part of our daily discourse, describing not the subjects of totalitarian states like North Korea but the modern, wealthy democracies that claim to be free. And this is the most chilling message of Orwell's novel: you don't need to be in a totalitarian regime to be controlled by clever propaganda. You don't need to have the police cameras in your home. You only need the fear of them, or the belief that war is peace or that torture is justice or that history is a thing that the powerful are entitled to rewrite for their own ends. Because self-censorship is every bit as complete as the regular kind, and is actually preferred by those who would control us, since it's far cheaper and easier than putting an actual gun to your head."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Well written and still holds up today. Read in high school, thought of it more as work. I didn't truly appreciate the dark story line and dystopia feel. Re-read recently, I took my time and truly enjoyed it. Great science fiction literature."},{"Title":"1984","review":"A classic piece of literature that remains as current as when it was first published. Definitely worth reading and rereading."},{"Title":"1984","review":"An amazing story that I wanted to read for a while now. Finally I bought it and I am glad I did. It raises questions and it paints a nightmarish picture of goverment control. While this stuff never happened verbatim, many goverment attempted and still attempt to control spoken and written word much more than it is reasonable. People still disappear (vaporize) without anybody knowing if they are alive or not (courtesy of local or far-away governments including so called \\"democracies.\\")Anyway, the book is very interesting read. Saying more may spoil it for a future reader. I am not sure how the whole Julia situation fit into the story other that adding scarier depths."},{"Title":"1984","review":"More than half century is gone since George Orwell depicted with 1984\\" a frightening picture of a totalitarian regime of oppression of all human individuality and freedom and absolute control.

Orwell knew about the fragility and sensibility of all man made power structures which have those above and those below. He knew that the so called free West could quickly slide into Totalitarianism. In Germany that happened very quickly. It is a deception tp assume that it would be different somewhere else. It was visible that a high culture could not withstand. And today? Sceptics discover also in our society the beginning of limitations of freedoms and of the misuse of information, even when this happens subtly.

Because of the relativism of today which regards as only truth that there is no binding truth it is ignored that exactly the Christians combine the notion of truth tightly to the notion of individual freedom, whereas this is not the case in Islam, because Islam has a political claim of power exertion.It is true that Orwell makes clear that the reversal of the values goes together with the reversal of the words. \\"War and peace\\" is exchangeable with \\"just war\\". Sand this process is starting in the small, with verbal persecution and it is ending in the worst case with Holocaust. At first you are eliminated in words and then with all consequences.

Either by its prophetic themes or by the influential vocabulary itself this book has penetrated post-modern humanity. Beyond recommending it I would say it is part of a secular literature which represents human thought in the 20th century to present day.This is also the swan song literary gem of a great writer at his peak. He died shortly after finishing as he neglected his health in the fury of writing, feeling that, after some lesser literature, he was finally on to something. And so he was.This book has a unique style of prose, self-invented perhaps and represents a deep look, a chilling picture of our world. I have read that it may be considered part of a small collection of contemporary dystopian classics from the mid 20-th century. To me this one stands out alone."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Everyone's heard of 1984, and yet I hadn't read it yet. In fact I really had no intention of reading it until a friend bought me a copy and told me to read it. So here I am today, not quite a fan, but impressed none the less.Right from the beginning I enjoyed how Orwell wrote. Not necessarily the actual story, just how he writing flowed from one sentence to the next. It was very concise and clear, fluidly moving from page to page. You can immediately draw parallels to the ideas in 1984 to many countries throughout the world, which is amazing considering it was originally published in 1949. This made the beginning third of the book at least bearable. The concept was definitely mind opening to start with, but then Orwell didn't go into enough explanation and instead kept repeating the same sequence of events over and over again. Big Brother watching, telescreen this, telescreen that. This person won't make it, that one won't. Change the history, rewrite events so on and so on. We understood the world they lived in without actually knowing the why and the how.It wasn't until we get to The Book that 1984 begins to bloom and sprout into a lovely flower, or if Big Brother had a say it would be a weed. As excerpts from The Book are read we finally get to see the how and the why, to understand how our world became what it was. The constant struggle, if not physically than the mental head games, between the 3 all powerful superstate in Oceania, Eurasia and Eastaisa. It all clicked in to place and shake your head at the clarity of it. But after that it didn't quite follow through with the ending as torture and psychological head games are used to bludgeon a party member in to accepting Big Brother's way fo thinking, or ingsoc.Certainly on the depressive side this book is, but the ideas that it expresses are well worth the read. Orwell conveys the message so clearly that you can't help but shake your head as you count off the countries that seem like they are today, 61 years later, falling into the governmental control over its citizens that is represented in 1984. Although not the best book, 1984's ideas are important. A tentative recommend so long as one knows why type of book they are getting in to.4 stars."},{"Title":"1984","review":"The starting point and first dot is Orwell's 1984 how language is used to control large populations.

Most experts think that Orwell was writing about totalitarian government. He was, but that was not all he was writing about. Big Brother and Oceania were trying to get control of a particular land, and its people, and resources. Where was this land? If you read the book, I bet you do not remember. You read the answer, it was at the end of the book. When you read it, your bio-computer (Brain) had a Brain Crash. Because what Orwell reveals in the end is so well connected to modern times and what is actually happening, today it is too scary to contemplate for most Americans.Yes and today we have the Patriot Act, and Neighbors who become part of the \\"disappeared\\".

But I guess as long as we have a president who says he believes in Jesus, Americans will continue to have no problem with the largest, most expansive, and most intrusive federal government in this nation's history."},{"Title":"1984","review":"\\"1984\\" is one of the most well-known novels of the 20th century, perhaps ever. It is also one of the most misunderstood.Many readers assume that the novel is anti-Communist and anti-socialist. Nothing could be further from the truth. In fact, Orwell was a socialist himself. During the Spanish Civil War, he fought for a revolutionary party called POUM, \\"the Workers Party for Marxist Unification\\". Sounds pretty socialist to me. Orwell was anti-Stalinist, but believed Stalinism to be a perversion of true socialism.So is his novel an attack on Stalinism, then? Both yes and no. \\"1984\\" was written in 1948 and published in 1949. During this time, many intellectuals believed that Stalinism and capitalism would eventually merge, creating a new system, combining the worst aspects of both. This feared system of the future was often called \\"bureaucratic collectivism\\". Rizzi, Schachtman and Burnham believed it could happen. Trotsky vacillated on the issue. Orwell must have believed in the grim possibility of \\"bureaucratic collectivism\\" himself. That is what his novel is really all about.\\"1984\\" is set in a futuristic society called Oceania. On the surface, Oceania is Stalinist. But on a closer look, it actually looks like a strange mixture of the Soviet Union and the British Empire. On the one hand, Oceania has a unproductive planned economy. On the other hand, it fights for colonial supremacy in Africa and Asia. Indeed, its main bases of power are the Anglo-Saxon nations.The ideology of Oceania is called \\"English Socialism\\", an obvious combination of the British and the Soviet. Oceania is run by a party, divided into the Inner Party and the Outer Party. The underclass is called proles. This is both a reference to the hierarchic Stalinist party in the USSR, and to the traditional British class structure: upper class (Inner Party), middle class (Outer Party) and working class (the proles). Interestingly, the proles are kept in line by mass-produced pornography. This, of course, is another veiled reference to the West. No such thing existed in Stalin's Soviet Union.Even Big Brother himself may be a composite character. Principally, he is a symbol for Stalin, and apparently even looks like Stalin. (And his constant opponent, Goldstein, is a symbol for Trotsky. The mysterious \\"book\\" is presumably Trotsky's \\"The Revolution Betrayed\\".) However, some people believe that the inspiration for Orwell's slogan \\"Big Brother is Watching\\" comes from a 1930s advertising campaign in the US, where a certain corporate owner declared \\"Let me be your Big Brother\\" amidst an enormous portrait of himself!\\"1984\\" is undoubtedly a very influential novel. Many terms from the book have become household words, like \\"Newspeak\\", \\"Thoughtcrime\\" and \\"Memory Hole\\". The same is true of the slogan \\"Big Brother is Watching You\\" or even the term \\"Orwellian\\", derived from the very name of the author. Indeed, if you haven't read this novel, you could be considered culturally illiterate.It's a pity that such a popular novel has been so misunderstood. But perhaps that is the fate of all popular novels?"},{"Title":"1984","review":"Having grown up in the former Soviet Union, as soon as I started reading the book, I could tell immediately where Orwell drew his inspiration, as well as most details of peoples' existence. Reading the book was like re-visiting my childhood, as well as refreshing my mother's and grandmother's stories of the soviet life in the 1950's, all the brainwashings, terrible living conditions, propaganda, people disappearing in the middle of the night, etc. Basically, Orwell took soviet reality of that era, and then took it a few notches up, and then twisted it some. Art imitates life, so to speak. I'm not sure why everyone credits Orwell's imagination, then. Either way, the book is extremely boring, the plot is almost non-existent, nothing is really going on, the [unlikely] love affair took half-the book to unfold, and it wasn't even worth it."},{"Title":"1984","review":"The scene in the upper room above the junk shop where Winston and Julia lie on a threadbare blanket-as a man and woman must have done before, free to be together, to feel and to love. Then the arrest, the voice commanding them to not move, brainwashed into unquestioning obedience, they stand at attention, naked, waiting for the mind police to come take them away. Never a thought to run, to resist, to escape somehow. Abject despairing surrender before the absolute power and authority of the State/Big Brother.I never quite got over that scene. The supine, complacent citizens of Oceania were even less prepared to rebell than Winston. Now I have recently read Jerry Furland's &quot;Transfer-the end of the beginning&quot; and I see a new Oceania, infinitely more subtle, and with fewer doubts as to it's potential. I would like to see a movie done of &quot;Transfer&quot;. Maybe some independent film company will see the same promise. Like 1984, it is a novel about the future-no less terrifying than Orwell's long loved classic, it needs mass market exposure too."},{"Title":"1984","review":"George Orwell's futuristic world is amazing look at society gone haywire.Also an interesting look at where lots of the language we use today comes from."},{"Title":"1984","review":"I purchased this book to give as gifts.

As was stated in a previous review I have read on this version (the 99 cent kindle version) there are several errors. While it is slightly annoying that the version does tend to combine words, aka leave out some spaces between words, it is definitely readable. Since this book was a mere 99 cents I have no problem in forgetting these errors. It is a great book riddled with thought provoking passages and is a must read for anyone. I would consider it one of the better deals I have gotten in my life; fully worth the dollar I spent on it. Although I believe that the errors could be corrected (easily) by amazon, I wouldn't ruminate on that fallacy for a moment. This book is definitely a buy. I would be willing to spend at least 10 dollars on it, errors or not."},{"Title":"1984","review":"1984 takes place in a country named Oceania, a negative utopia. In this country, miniscule amounts of freedom are given to citizens and the government encourages conformity and submission. Winston Smith, the main character, edits documents which may contradict thoughts and beliefs of the current government. In addition, he writes articles for a newspaper called The Times, written entirely in Newspeak. Newspeak is the official language of Oceania and was invented to limit the individuality of humans by stripping language of variety. This limited language is one of the many ways in which the government manipulates its citizens into being thoughtless human beings. After living a structured and dull life for as long as he could remember, Winston reassesses his life and decides to put a stop to the immense amount of control and power that the government has. The decision that he made would alter his life forever and force him to revaluate his life.This book deals with key topics about humanity and the desire for power. Orwell seemingly predicts the effects of communism and the ugly truth about politics, war, and society. The nature of this society makes readers think about the value of individuality, education, passion, and much more. The Thought Police constitutes another form of control over citizens. Humans are required not to think unacceptable thoughts, dream of anything corrupt, appear abnormal, or behave in a chaotic way. Although the society declares that no rules have been defined, the punishments for disobeying orders are so severe that people stay away from doing anything suspicious or something which would draw attention towards oneself. The plot portrays a message about the purpose of life and the positives of differences and inequality. The stupendous writing and impeccable vocabulary makes this read exiting and intriguing. From the first page, you'll be rooting for the successful overthrow of the government and will remain hopeful that Winston can make a positive change to this society - compelling read!"},{"Title":"1984","review":"When I first read this novel, the first four words were just amazing! 1984 is a book that has to be read, it is just simply amazing! Pure and simple. Some of the things in this book is just frighting! George Orwell did a great job creating a story that is just VERY REALISTIC! Sure it does start off slow, George Orwell does into a lot of detail in the book about how things COULD OF BEEN if Communism did take over the world. No one has the right to privacy, the people in this book are always being watched by the Party, and it is just outright amazing.The story evolves around Winston, he works for the Ministry of Truth, deep inside he hates the Party, but he does not reveal it because of the Thought Police! So he goes to work everyday eating the nasty food the Party gives the people, he then thinks that he is being watched by the Thought Police, which turns out to be a girl who is MUCH MORE YOUNGER than he is! He is 39, and the girl is in her mid-twenties. Her name is Julie, he wanted to kill her because he thought she was spying on him, sound real huh?1984 is a HARD novel to read, and going through the novel is HARD, but it is worth reading. The novel brings hatred toward one's government, and how one of could of lived if Communism did spread throughout the world. Very scary, but yet very interesting because George knows how to write a very good book.Read it, and you wont be disappointed!"},{"Title":"1984","review":"It is not a book for entertainment for sure. You just want to forget about the whole thing once you finish reading it. There is something in human in the book, something that turns your stomach, almost like \\"devil\\" and you want to get away from it. May be Orwell did this on purpose, to make you feel what one feels under that sort of an oppressive government.Some of his predictions in the book are \\"eerie\\" to say the least. Some people might want to specify this government or other for the subject of the book, but I think at different degrees, one can find dark forces that want to control and oppress others for their interest everywhere and every country even in the West.It is not a long book, which is a plus. You can finish it while the whole story is still in your mind.PS: In War and Peace Tolstoy writes about Pierre's Masonic initiation ceremony. In there Pierre is asked what he is afraid of, the most. Now, \\"1984\\" gives a possible answer why this question had to be asked in the first place."},{"Title":"1984","review":"I was one of the many people who had to read 1984 as a high school student. However a few weeks ago, I decided to read it again. And I was amazed about how much I enjoyed it when I didn't have to worry about writing an essay on it. George Orwell did a fantastic job creating a world where there is no love, no warmth or anything that resembles humanity. Winston Smith, the main character, feels trapped in Oceania, a dire place where words are cut from the language to limit the thoughts of citizens, cameras and microphones are everywhere to monitor your actions, and where children will call their parents traitors and turn them in to authorities. Winston manages to find joy in trinkets he buys from a prole's shop and from a woman he falls in love with. And he finds hope in the form of O'Brien, the one man who he thinks understands him. However, in Oceania nothing good lasts for long.The thought that Orwell put into the plot, characters, and the setting is considerable. He explains different facets of Oceanic history and society (especially through &quot;Goldstein's book&quot;,) and even includes an appendix explaining &quot;newspeak,&quot; the language of Oceania (which I recommend reading after the first few chapters). The scary thing about the book is that many elements of the Inner Party and Ingsoc are real and are relevant today. Read this book to see one view of how life can be like if we forget ourselves and put our futures completely in the hands of others."},{"Title":"1984","review":"There are few books that I reference as much as this one. Almost every aspect of the homogenization of culture and individualism is realized in this book. You can not discuss world politics without reading this book. Just read the darn book!"},{"Title":"1984","review":"Nineteen Eighty-Four is not and never has been just a year. Nor is the world portrayed by George Orwell in Nineteen Eighty-Four a place or even merely a set of political or social circumstances. Rather, Nineteen Eighty-Four is a state of mind, a way of being, an atmosphere in which the dark side of our nature lives and turns all around it darker still. It is a time or place which we create when we turn away from the light that is within us, within each individual self, to the empty darkness of group will and psychology; of \\"massmindedness\\". Thus do we create for ourselves to live in the world of Nineteen Eighty-Four.Orwell's \\"fiction\\" of a world in which, but for a lingering echo, individuality had all but passed into extinction, could have been set in any time or place where \\"massmindedness\\" is paramount and where the individual exists merely to serve the group. Throughout history, most religions have preached, most governments have practiced and most societies have been organized around such \\"massmindedness\\". It is only the calendar which might confuse and comfort us, which might convince us that Nineteen Eighty-Four was merely a gruesome story about a time and place that never was nor could ever be. But nothing is further from the truth. And the simple truth is that Nineteen Eighty-Four is NOW.In Nineteen Eighty-Four, there are no heroes, except as an idea, an ideal may be said to be a hero. All of its characters are exceedingly human, and this is what makes Nineteen Eighty-Four both timely and timeless, both powerful and profoundly pathetic. Nineteen Eighty-Four is often upsetting, sometimes disheartening, but, when its main lesson is learned, never depressing. It is fundamentally a story of hope, of a truth which can be discovered (although too late for all concerned); a truth which can be seen by us and taken as not only our ideal, but as the practical guide by which, to a greater or lesser extent, we can avoid the very pitfalls which consumed Winston and Julia and O'Brien and Big Brother, and liberate ourselves from the tyrany and ultimate destructiveness of the group and its massminded stranglehold on our minds, our hearts and our souls.Nineteen Eighty-Four is a simple story of faith wrongly placed. Winston Smith, its main character, searches to escape the suffocating and oppressive world manipulated by and for a ruling group, The Party. He believes that he is seeking a political, a social solution with which he can combat, can destroy the evil of group-think and the \\"massmindedness\\" in which he lives. Instead, he finds the most exquisitely human, individual \\"weapon\\" with which to pursue his salvation: love. But, as we humans are too often prone to do, Winston overlooks what is simple and obvious, what is at hand, and, even as do those he disdains, he puts his faith in another group, The Brotherhood. (It is not for Winston to realize that his answer lies in the idea and practice of \\"brotherhood\\", rather than in the imaginary purity of \\"The Brotherhood\\".) In the end, Winston is betrayed not by his enemies, but, in a real sense, by himself, by his failure to see the worth in the object of his own worship; the individual and the emotional life with which he or she can find their own peace and presence, even in a world gone apparently mad.Winston, with his male oriented solution, seeks one group to combat another group, while Julia, a woman, brings the possibility of true salvation to him (and them) in the idea and practice of individual love. Julia knows the truth, and what is worthwhile, but Winston (the very name of the great male war leader of Orwell's recent past) plunges on ahead, seeking a \\"political\\", \\"social\\" solution (not unlike the many male \\"leaders\\" of all time past). This may be a small (or maybe the greatest) point of the book.It is an instructive book; there is a good deal of What Every Young Person Ought to Know - not in 1984, but 1949. Mr Orwell's analysis of the lust for power is one of the less satisfactory contributions to our enlightenment, and he also leaves us in doubt as to how much he means by poor Smith's \\"faith\\" in the people (or \\"proles\\"). Smith is rather let down by the 1984 Common Man, and yet there is some insinuation that common humanity remains to be extinguished."},{"Title":"1984","review":"I just read this book for the firdt time (May 2003). Although it was written in the 1950's, one should not underestimate its relevance. This is a powerful work that shows what could have happened in Western Europe if WWIII actually happened. You become Winston (the main character) and you can identify with his life, which consists of a horribly boring job at the \\"Ministry of Truth\\" and who is, along with every other human being on Earth, is constantly watched by the Thought Police, which also bans all resistance tools. You become aware of the struggle that is Winston's (main character) desire to get away (with Julia) from the all-oppresssive Total Government Control of all aspects of human life. I would suggest this book as required reading for everyone... Big Brother is Watching You... The imagery and horror say it all."},{"Title":"1984","review":"George Orwell's 1984 shows us what he believed the future would be like if mankind did not change and socialism increased. This dark tale tells of a world where Big Brother is constantly watching you, and any act that could come even close to disobeying the Party, meant you were eliminated--which meant, not only were you never heard from again, but you were actually being erased from all records and memories, so that you never even existed.The Party has absolute control over all types of media and print, and in effect, the lives of everyone. Their slogan is &quot;Who controls the past, controls the future: who controls the present controls the past.&quot; Anything historically that shows that the Party is wrong, is changed in every history book and record and eventually the minds of the people and thus, never happened.This book is in three main sections. It was a bit slow at first, but I forced my way through it. Further through, the book dramatically picks up in excitement. By the time I got to the third part, I could barely put the book down.I am rating this book 5-stars because it has become a modern classic that captivates the reader's attention, not only in the story, but also on the philisophical level above it."},{"Title":"1984","review":"1984 is a novel about a futuristic society in London where every one and every thing is totally controlled by the government. An entity known as \\"Big Brother\\" embodies the state and commands absoloute obedience and religious devotion from the populace; he is considered to be all-powerful and all-knowing. This represents the worst possible outcome for future, technocratic, materialistic and relativistic society: whatever benefits the masses and keeps the ruling Party in power is acceptable and there must be no deviation from the Party line. Population control is maintained through rationing, propaganda, mind-control, executions of POWS, unpleasant sensory distractions, total repression of sexuality and familial bonds, 24-7 work loads, pointless wars against forign enemies, destroying words so people cannot express themselves and erasing any knowledge people have of the past before the Party's \\"Revoloution.\\"No privacy for individuals is allowed. TV \\"telescreen\\" cameras are everywhere, watching everyone around the clock. Their motive is not to deter crime in the general sense but to deter \\"thought crime,\\" cases where individuals seem to be manifesting symptoms of political dissent or nervousness about their existance. This is especially scary, given that 1984 was published in 1949 after the fall of Nazi Germany and the ascendancy of the Soviet Union over Eastern Europe. Today telvision cameras are everywhere watching people's movements, and some new ones can even identify facial features and match them to a name and personal history on a computer database. 1984's \\"telescreens\\" are double trouble--not only can they monitor citizens but they constantly barrage them with government propaganda. Today everyone who has electricity can now voluntarily turn on their TV and inject their minds full of whatever the government and the corperate media conglomerates want you to hear. If someone watching you through your TV screen bothers you, think about what it would be like if you were never allowed to turn your MTV or the FACTOR with Bill O'Reilly off!The government also uses torture on specific \\"thought-criminals\\" in order to destroy their resistance to Party dogmatics. The objective is to cause so much physical, mental and emotional stress that the subject is unable to reason for themselves and accepts whatever the Party says is true. In the novel this is justified by the notion that \\"Perception is reality.\\" Whatever a human brain thinks is true is true. The stars are not flaming balls of hydrogen fusion millions of light years away, no, we can stretch out our hands and touch them if we want. We are not bound by the law of gravity--we can float into the air if we want to. Even 2+2=5 if we so desire. The only problem is making everyone think exactly the same as everyone else. According to this there is no truth except what the person in charge says is truth and whatever they can do to make you believe it, then it is true. This is happening all around our world today--the rule of relativism. If there are no concepts of right and wrong, then Anarchy and/or Totalitarianism take over and the world is ruled by Might Makes Right. It nearly happened in the 1940's, and could happen (and is happening) again. The American people may not be controlled by the use of brute force and sexual repression now, but they are directed by government and media propaganda in the same way as described in Orwell's 1884."},{"Title":"1984","review":"My city, Bloomington, Indiana, chose \\"1984\\" to read this year for its One City One Book event this spring.

We selected \\"1984.\\" As part of the National Library Week celebration last week the Indiana University librarians sponsored a discussion \\"1984\\" at our Lilly Library, which houses our rare books and special collections, including some Orwell material. The discussion was led by an emeritus English professor; he introduced the discussion with three themes/questions he found to be interesting. The discussion took off from his excellent introduction. I urge other communities to select this book to read and discuss. It is a darkly compelling novel that lends itself to many approaches and interpretations. Thus, it is a fabulous book to read and discuss with others. In fact, as I read, I couldn't wait to hear what other people thought about the book. It's a love story and a thriller. It's a political treatise and a rumination on totalitarianism. As other reviewers have said, against the backdrop of the war with Iraq, it is timely. But it is also timeless.

Along side his forbidden love Julia Winston works toward his goal of destroying Big Brother. He doesn't realize no one can end the reign of Big Brother. A terrifying gaze into the life of citizens in a totalitarian communist government, 1984 deserves all the hype and praise it gets. In the words of Winston Smith, &quot;DOWN WITH BIG BROTHER!&quot;"},{"Title":"1984","review":"While George Orwell felt that the time of totalitarian rule and the state as unanswerable monolith would be the latter twentieth century, the twenty-first century actually represents a better time for a slightly different version of the timeline he would suggest.The technological capability of monitoring almost every single household within a given area is here now, although most people voluntarily share themselves with the world via WebCam. It is not a far-fetched idea, in terms of cost or engineering, to monitor the civilian population of an entire country for illegal behavior. For a small fee, you can purchase your credit history and address from online companies who have no reason to have such information, and nothing bars them from sharing it with anyone who pays that fee.Regardless of advances in fiber-optic communications, _1984_ is first and foremost a story about government that acts solely to perpetuate its own dominance, and this century offers as many opportunities for that as past centuries. Given enough pretext by a state of war or economic collapse, the individual has no real chance against an organized enemy with the power to oversee every aspect of his life. If print journalism and its less scrupulous cousin in television fails to call for an accounting of government actions outside the vision of the individual, then the government can move with impunity against the individual.Is this paranoia? The modern and well-educated American society that won the Second World War allowed a alcoholic senator named Joseph McCarthy to destroy private lives with unsupported accusations, ending only with his accusation of Secretary of State and former Chief of Staff of the Army George Marshall, entirely too respected for the accusation to pass unanswered. It would not happen in this current political climate, but I suggest that it takes a lot less than you might believe to push government prerogative closer to totalitarian authority.With all that said about its cautionary value, _1984_ is one of the most clearly written novels in the English language, and a model for anyone who wants to write with economy and power. It and its companion piece by Huxley, _Brave New World_, should be read by everyone interested in protecting themselves against the worst that social organization and technological progress can offer."},{"Title":"1984","review":"I adore George Orwell's works! He is a master of the satire, and can convey humanity's greatest fears in his masterful storytelling. 1984 was no exception. it could be called a &quot;what if&quot; book, to show the state of the world had such and such occurred, a world where freedom is lost and hope, and love, and all that is left is power, for power's sake. In this desperate setting, Winston falls in love with Julia, both of them members of the party which occupies itself with total control. surrounded by posters, telescreens, all reminding that Big Brother is wathing, the two hold onto their love. When they are captured, however, Winston is victim to terrible tortures, ending in his renouncing his love, having been forever altered in mind and body, a pure minion of the party without emotion for the remainder of his life."},{"Title":"1984","review":"The author has come very close to predicting the future, but we still have a long way to go.A very interesting story built around the future.

'He who controls the past, controls the present' is Orwell's brilliant insight. And, as such, his thesis is applicable to an astonishlingly wide variety of modern situations.How do ... religious leaders get their followers to blindly accept everything they say? Simple application of doublethink, though policing and control of information. How do modern conglomerates get away with collecting and selling your personal information? Tell you that its all for your own protection, that's how.1984 is a brilliant, timeless book.

Dark and absorbing, it's a simply beautiful piece and a definite must-read."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Yes, this book is, indeed, prophetical, but I beleive Orwell was also trying to show us that we are already blinded by our society and government. He chose to have Winston have the same way of thinking that your average, modern American Joe Blow would have, and then show you at the end how the rest of society thinks.Look deep within yourself and you will see that you are caught up in the materialistic madness. Orwell isn't a pessimist; he is a realist.Beautifully poetic, classical, and polital read. If you have not read this book, then buy it. Now. It is ABSOLUTELY, ABSOLUTELY a must read."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Wow. I couldnt, and still cant, believe how amazing this book was. It is truly a masterpiece. Of course, what i think is a masterpiece might not end up being one for you.I realized during my read of this book that i felt really attached to it because of my own personal experiences...my own university background (political studies). To me, this book is a searing critique of the modern human condition...of modern society. When i read through these pages i found an author that was describing what was going on around us: people living in an unthinking comfort, people almost consciously avoiding the obvious truth about society...people failing to open up their eyes.It really focuses your attention on how society can just turn its cheek to homelessness, poverty, consumer culture, capitalism. We are all taking part in the process of doublethink.I took all of this away from the book...you might not. It might even mean something different to you. This review is for myself, for others that see what i see, and for those who are willing to see what i see. Otherwise, you will have to read the book through your own lenses and decide for yourself whether this is a classic. But for like-minded people, you will understand how powerful this book is from page one.The only reason why it did not get 5 stars is because of the ending. I really felt it wasnt the right way to end this book. It just didnt seem to flow with the rest of the pages. I am a little disappointed that Orwell decided to finish this amazing novel with such a drawn-out, tired ending."},{"Title":"1984","review":"It's nearly impossible to overstate the importance of this book. In all the discussion about its influence on modern thought, however, the fact that it's a fantastically good read is often overlooked. Orwell's characters are crisply drawn and the world they inhabit startlingly real.Certainly it's one of the most important novels of the 20th century; just don't forget that it's also one of the best."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Although slow at the start one cannot help, but be swept up in the events that transpire in Orwell's 1984; most especially because of the potentiality of them to arise in any societal faction. The story line and its climax are not necessarily what draws the reader in, but instead the possible reality of the situation portrayed. Moreover, although one tends to lean more towards the \\"this could never happen\\" scenario what's disturbing is how easily a mass of people can be lead like a more inferior animal such as a sheep. Disturbing events in history, most poignantly the Holocaust, only support the docile nature of the human being as a whole. This novel was more thought provoking than literally captivating. It's the questions that are posed at the conclusion of the novel that make it a must read even more than the words between the cover."},{"Title":"1984","review":"there is a reason that this novel is still considered cutting-edge."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Despite the extremity with which orwell depicts this totalitarian state, this story speaks at a much smaller level as well. in a day and age where brainwashing among civilized countries is ignored despite its presence, this is an important novel. Studies have shown how humans, like chimps, end up gaining a following when in a dominant position in society. only 1984 shows how humans take it to the extreme. Of course this novel does use exaggeration to stress its point. And it does so quite effectively, I might add. The end is fantastic, a climax that is the culmination of Smith's life."},{"Title":"1984","review":"&quot;War is PeaceFreedom is SlaveryIgnorance is Strength&quot;George Orwell dives into the Depths of communist society, and sees through the eyes of Winston Smith, an aging man and a member of &quot;The Party&quot; of the country of Oceania. A series of events leads Winston to the love of his life, Julia, and they both plan to join a resistance against the Party. But Winston finds out that you can't trust anyone in a communist society.Orwell did an excellent job of placing the reader in the center of the lies that is the communist government. His writing style is captivating and everything about the book is realistic and believable, everything from the brainwashing of children to the technology that was available. The book is filled with interesting twists and turns in the plot that keep the reader engrossed in an excellently told story. I found it very difficult to put this book down once I picked it up. I almost found myself awaiting the moment that I could read it again, which was a surprise. I had heard that this book was a boring political commentary, but it was far from that.Orwell slips in views on the human spirit, testing it's limits, and eventually stating that everyone has a breaking point. The dark ending to this haunting image of the future cast from his imagination back in 1949, still holds true to what people can observe in mankind today.One can can be thoroughly entertained while being enlightened at the same time. All in all 1984 is a book worth reading.

Not quite as good as A Brave New World in my eyes, but close. The plot basically centers around two people's personal rebellion agains the now infamous &quot;Big Brother&quot;.

Of course, it is wonderful, and seems more relevant with each passing year.

The fact that he was able to see or know how things could be 30 years later and with so much detail and complexity is awesome. And I mean with extraoridary detail! Concepts of \\"Newspeak\\" and \\"Doublethink\\" are phenominal. You get into the main character and you start to cheer for him. You too want him to crack the system. The book may possibly get a bit slow or a touch wordy towards the end however I think it's necessary. 1984 can be a brain buster if you free you mind and let yourself understand and follow all that takes place. Your brain will definately get a good workout trying to understand \\"Newspeak\\" and the structure of \\"Big Brother\\". It is fun! I highly recommend this book. It stands as a warning to us all. Freedom is perhaps the greatest concept we know, it would be devistating if we forgot it!Big Brother claims, \\"Freedom is Slavery\\" or \\"Slavery is Freedom\\", \\"War is Peace\\" and \\"Strenth is Power\\".

I dunno, it just didn't appeal to me all that much. I understand the point of the novel, the fear of governments taking over unjustly, but man, what's with the details!

Henson, 16 June 1949)This is not Orwell's best book. I've read it three times, and never failed to be underwhelmed. Try _Down and Out in Paris and London_, _Homage to Catalonia_ or _A Collection of Essays_ for insightful writing, and stay away from the satires (the other being _Animal Farm_)."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Get it straight, people: Orwell was writing about the time he lived in. Not the way the world would or might become, but the way it really was. It exagerrates in the extreme, of course, making _1984_ a kind of bleak satire.It's a shame this is Orwell's most famous book, though, because in many ways it's his worst, with _Animal Farm_ being about as bad. _1984_ is one of the more overrated books of the century. I've read some of his other books (_Down and Out in Paris and London_, _Burmese Days_, _Homage to Catalonia_, etc.), along with many of his essays, and they were all superior to _1984_. Perhaps because _1984_ requires less intelligence to see its point...Having read his less extreme fiction and non-fiction, I have come to respect Orwell deeply as a man who was honest, straightforward, very sensible, and altogether admirable. In many ways he was a remarkable man; but none of those praiseworthy qualities shows through in _1984_, where we only see dark cynicism about not only communism but also bourgeios democracy.If you're looking for balanced, intelligent writing from Orwell, stay away from _1984_ for a while."},{"Title":"1984","review":"orwell does good job with the setting, characterization, and images throughout the novel, but fails to elaborate on the plot. This is what took away from the story. Everything else was top notch! Great book!"},{"Title":"1984","review":"George Orwell's 1984 is really brilliant. It warns about how life can be when a totalitarian power is exerted over people. Orwell wrote this book when totalitarism was identified with comunism, fascism and national-socialism. But today we know that an apparently democratic government can use mass media, TV, doublethinking and ignorance to gain and increase its power. 1984 is not a prophecy but a warning about the evilness of power and its consequences over individuals and society."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Orwell's &quot;1984&quot; is a classic piece of 20th century literature, no doubt. While I can see many things of which he speaks of in today's society (doublespeak, Big Brother, etc.), this book was not written as prophecy, as some might suggest. It should serve as a warning, nothing more.Instead, I'll say that I read it as required reading in a high-school literature class and found Orwell's &quot;Animal Farm&quot; to be a less heavy-handed approach to storytelling. I enjoyed &quot;1984&quot; only slightly more than the later film based upon the novel &lt;yawn&gt;."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Does freedom bring happiness? Or does happiness come from control? These are the central themes of the great novel 1984, by George Orwell. In this novel, the reader follows Winston, through the futuristic world controlled by a group of people known as The Party. Winston works as a writer for the Ministry of Truth, where his job is to alter historical documents in favor of the Party, a common task that no one thinks poorly of. However, Winston feels that he's being lied to. The reader follows him as he strikes out to find out what freedom and happiness really is, and whether the Party is just.Orwell provides us with a shocking look at what the future may become. Even today, the United States government is taking steps towards becoming a \\"Big Brother.\\" With laws such as the Patriot Act, and No Child Left Behind, the government is slowly taking control of our freedoms. Perhaps, this novel's greatness is that it strikes close to home. Via remarkable characters that one can easily relate to, Orwell provides the reader a clear view of this futuristic world, both its marvels and flaws and provides a sense of realism into the piece. The reader wants to know why this form of living has come about and whether or not it is the right thing. Can people be happy free on their own? Must people be told how to live to attain this freedom? One must read to find out. Perhaps there is reason after all behind one of the Party's slogans: Freedom is Slavery."},{"Title":"1984","review":"If you have read Fahrenheit 451, then you would see the similarities between the two for the fact that they do this: THEY MAKE A POINT TO WHAT THEY'RE TRYING TO SAY. And that's why 1984 is an excellent book. It's haunting, and the totalitarian world conveyed in this novel is truly convincing from beginning to end. This is not the greatest novel you will ever read, as some people have said to me, but it's truly one of the most IMPORTANT books to read. I am not going to get into the plot (i quite frankly don't appreciate it when people give away too much of the plot, let alone telling it), all i can truly say about this book is that yes, it might scare you, and yes, it's a book that is seriosu, but it's real, and it gets straight to the point that the author was trying to make. Books like these are meant to be read, and meant to be important, and should be analyzed based on the subject matter (in this case TOTALITARIANISM/DYSTOPIA), not for the fact that the main character did this and that this other character did that. 1984 should be read in all classrooms. It would truly teach the youth of our nation of how far government can literally control the human psyche, and can literally, if possibly, manipulate and desiminate the human mind and the mind's conception of being a human being."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Winston Smith is an average working class single male living in a futuristic metropolitan area. He lives in a place called Oceania. It is a place where government rules over all. Winston works for the government but is a lower rank. The cultural society that the government has built is structured and made up of various parts. The inner party is the highest, which contains their deity like ruler, big brother. Big brother supposedly has his eye on everything. The party is also anti-love and pro-abstinence. Can an average man who works for the governing party ever break free and do his own will. You find out as the story unfolds.Winston starts rebelling by committing such a seemingly small crime as, writing in a diary. He knows that one day the thought crime police will catch him. Yes, they do have a police force that imprisons people based on what they are thinking or saying. In this city each home is equipped with a t.v. looking screen that is the tool that the party observes and watches all the citizens every move in the so called privacy of their houses. The party has one slogan that is most famous \\"War is peace, Freedom is Slavery, Ignorance is strength\\". The party uses all its resources to be constantly getting rid of history. For example, there is a department of the party where all they do is burn old newspapers or other paraphernalia that are written in English. They abolish words that are unnecessary to them. A new language has even been made, its called newspeak. They rewrite history according to what big brother commands. In this society they have even trained kids to turn in their parents to the police if they commit a crime. There is no hiding from the law in this tri-state.Oceania is constantly at war with one of the other tri-states. War is very prominent in this culture. The party thrives on the way that people react to the news of being a war. It makes them easier to control.One day, Winston notices a female in the room. He daydreams about being with her. Winston starts to have feelings for her. This is also an illegal action. To love and to make love are both against the law. He looks for her hoping that he will see her at lunch. She sits by him one day and they must talk very secretly because there is a screen in the room that monitors them and they are not allowed to talk. He finds that she likes him as well. Her name is Julia. They conspire about some way to be together and not get caught. Can they be together and not be caught by their government? Are all these wars legitimate or are they a device of the inner party? Read the story to ease your suspense.This book fairly moderate moving in that it really never stops with nothing going on. It is definitely an intellectuals novel. It is a hair raising book. It is one of those books that you like to relate to your present world. This book is still just as much alive as it was fifty years age. Orwell's 1984 will have you so in much suspense to know what will happen with Julia and him and the party that you may not be able to put this book down. I highly recommend this novel. It is one of the greats that will get you thinking more than usual."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Ok how many students actually enjoy reading books are assigned in English class? Usually I don't find the books that I'm required to read for school interesting, but this year there was one exception. As I read this book on my back deck I really began to take a look at society and wonder where we were headed. Nobody really knows what the future holds, but maybe the ideas from George Orwell's 1984 aren't to far from reality.The book introduces the reader to the main character, Winston Smith, and the dismal, totalitarian world in which he lives. While attempting to discover the truth Winston is constantly under the terror-filled scrutiny of the telescreens, thought police, and the omnipotent ruler, Big Brother. Winston encounters many different people, including Julia who secretly rejects society as well. Winston and Julia develop a very intimate relationship as they try to reveal the flaws and evils in the totalitarian system. Is there really a constant war going on between Eurasia and Eastasia? Why does the government claim that the economy is better than ever when Winston doesn't have decent shoes to eat or real food? And what actually happens to the people who mysteriously disappear, their named eradicated from all records in one night?All these questions kept me wrapped up in the book. I was always wondering what would happen next. I would definitely recommend this book. Orwell does an excellent. job of developing the character so you relate to and cheer on Winston and Julia and hate the rest of the totalitarian society. This novel made me realize that I would go crazy in a world that lacked individuality and privacy, and I wondered if the future would become anything like the world of 1984."},{"Title":"1984","review":"1.Looking at so many things in nature one tends to find a Gaussian distribution curve. The majority of people stand in the center and a much smaller number are the outliers. There is nothing good or bad about either form of existence! It's just the way it is. The point is that the outliers usually have an intrinsic urge to be bidirectional thinkers whereas the middle is usually unidirectional for a large number of issues. However one must remember that such generalizations are okay for a bird's eye view and for crude statistics only but may not do justice to any given individual! The key question is regarding the fence sitters who really deserve to see from both the point of view of the outliers as well as conventional wisdom so that they can make up their mind as to how they wish to live their lives as also so very clearly portrayed in \\"Brave New World\\".2.Should politics have any thing to do with this?

I rarely read a book more than once. I read this three times. It is hard to imagine a better book - inspiring and depressing at the same time! The satire is overwhelming.

This book will be read a thousand years from now."},{"Title":"1984","review":"This book is chilling and eye opening. It's one of the best books I have ever read. I highly suggest it."},{"Title":"1984","review":"1984 is very unique. The whole story is about a man named Winston Smith, who starts to have questions in his mind about the totalitarian government that he has always known and lived with. As is typical of Orwell novels, 1984 is about one man who is all alone in the world, who tries to break away from conformity.The world that Orwell has created in this novel, called Oceania, is so very different from our own, that it is almost impossible to imagine. The Party is in power, and they can \\"vaporize\\" anyone who they even suspect of \\"thoughtcrime\\" (thinking things contrary to the Party's beliefs). The main figure of the government of Oceania is Big Brother. The term \\"Big Brother is watching you\\" comes from posters that the Party put up all over in the book.This novel makes you realize just how precious the freedoms we have are. I would recomend this book to anyone interested in politcal fiction. But a word of caution, this book is not very cheerful or uplifting, so this is not a book to read if your not in the mood for something depressing."},{"Title":"1984","review":"I'm amazed at the technical predictions in this book. I do think fortunately we will not produce a future society so blah and uncreative. As far as big brother, well it may happen but I'm pretty certain it wont be like this or so intrusive to our regular lives. Just look at normal everyday people in your life and you'll know we will never be like the eerie people in this book. I don't think most of the story in the book Utopian Reality will happen either, but its scientific predictions were really incredible as well. I did thoroughly enjoy the different perspective of 1984. I guess I also read dis-utopian kind of books because it makes me live my life with a smile, knowing I would never allow myself nor my children to become so bleak and cause I know many other people share the same feelings."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Not many authors have written a novel as excellent as 1984 that affected the political world as well. George Orwell set a new standard for sci-fi writing with this book, in which he writes his vision of the future if Communism had continued to rise. 1984 was not only written as a captivating novel, but as a warning. When George Orwell wrote the book in 1949, World War II had just ended and Communism was beginning to dig its roots into Europe. Orwell, having seen the effects of Communism first-hand, decided that he needed to show what the future could be if the world was not careful. The political message lies in the portrayal of life in the future in an advanced Communist society. Surrounding the message is a captivating novel that intrigues all readers even after the Communist era has passed. Orwell describes a society that lived in poverty. The citizens knew of nothing except austerity because no information could enter the country without government approval. An average citizen, Winston Smith, began to understand how corrupt the government had become. Knowing too much was a crime; Winston was in danger of being arrested for thought-crime. How could Winston possibly fight a governmental system on which he himself depended? Once a warning, 1984 has now become a reminder of what can happen in a society in which the government has too much control."},{"Title":"1984","review":"1984 is undoubtedly one of the most devestating books ever written in English. When Orwell writes Big Brother into power he gives him absolute reign over the population. Now, citizens must not only mouth approval of the status quo, but also truly approve in heart and mind. The novel not only faces the realities of governmental imposition on the economy, media, and personal lives of its citizens, addressing such real-life and very current issues as censorship, control of the press, and sexual freedom, but it also speaks of the oppression of the conscious, rational mind over the creative vision of the artist. The subjugation of the masses serves as a large scale representation of the battle between the artist and society, and ultimately, the artist and himself. Winston spends much of the book working to uncover the truth. He seeks to separate the actual truth (if such does exist) from the invented while he sits at his job churning out pages of manufactured history. In his home he sits, bent and fearful, just outside of Big Brother's gaze writing his thoughts at the end of the day, trying to hold on to some hint of the world as he percieves it. Even his romance with Julia is an attempt to claim some hold on the world as he lies in bed with her and asks whether it is possible that anyone else has ever felt as he does. While Winston is the artist, Juliea is the muse. She represents the artist longing to complete himself, the male and the female joining in fruitful creation. She acts as his audience and his artistic peer. I cannot recommend this book enough, as a classic, as a terrifying view of government gone wrong, and ultimately as the struggle of an artist to find a free exchange of thoughts and ideas between himself and the world and his conscious and unconsious mind."},{"Title":"1984","review":"I lived almost whole my life in the system like this.In Czechoslovakia it was not the worst,but there was no light at the end of the tunnel.And it could hepped to all of us with a little help from our Big Brother on the East.We are lucky,but this book have to be in every school.We were so close to the hell...now we are free again.Thank you Mr.Orwell"},{"Title":"1984","review":"In order to fully appreciate this novel, the ideal mindset has to be the circa, 1949, when the book was published. When compared to the present day, one would have to ask themselves, what kind of world do we really live in.

Definitively ahead of his time in a frightening way."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Whether you enjoy science fiction or not, Orwell's 1984 is a must read. Orwell writes like Monet paints, in that his description of 1984 is opaque yet colorful, mysterious, and beautiful.Throughout 1984, the reader follows Winston Smith, who lives in Airstrip One. The world is subdivided into three major super powers. Winston lives in Oceana, which is run by Big Brother. Three ministries govern Oceana: The Ministry of Truth, Ministry of Love, and Ministry of Peace. Winston works for the Ministry of Truth, and it is there he meets Julia.Much like Orwell's description of the scenes themselves, he creates a world in which the reader feels they are looking at Oceana through a sheet. Orwell never describes Oceana or 1984 in too much detail; though, in his descriptions of Winston's relationships to the world he lives in, Julia, and Big Brother, he writes with enough description that Orwell's vision of the future becomes more apparent with each page.The most striking scene is when a poet is thrown into prison because he refused to take out the word, \\"God\\" from a poem he transcribed because no other word fit. No matter a person's spiritual background, the critical person should find it uncanny that in 1949 Orwell imagined a world in which the name \`God' would become illegal.Though, we do not live in a world in which three empirical superpowers govern us, the critical person should wonder if we are closer to Orwell's 1984 than we realize. Or, perhaps, ideologically, we are there and realize it; though, we have become so accustomed to living in Orwell's 1984 that we willingly give up our rights and personal identity in the name of government sanctioned security and equality."},{"Title":"1984","review":"What amazes me more than anything about this book is the author's ability, when he wrote the book back in the 1940s, to predict and describe the Obama administration.So if you want to learn how the Democratic Party has fallen from the \\"Ask not what your country can do for you; ask what you can do for your country\\" days of J.F.K to the present Obama administration which preaches to just sit on your fat bu*t, let others work, and then take their stuff--then read this book.

I'm glad I did. Orwell warns about totalitarian control of the masses through revisionist history, perversion of the meaning of words, and relativism. While the urgency of his warning may have diminished with the fall of totalitarian communism, it's still relevant today in ways Orwell might not have anticipated. When I hear phrases like \\"abortion 'clinic'\\" (one goes to a \\"clinic\\" when one is sick) or see the illogic behind radical Islam in action, I see that Big Brother's means of mind control and subjugation is not necessarily dead."},{"Title":"1984","review":"This book is entertaining, but hardly prophetic. The world is not like 1984 or even close to 1984. Anybody who thinks so needs to learn more about the world or 1984.The problem with this dystopic vision is that Orwell really doesn't understand technology or the way that it affects the world."},{"Title":"1984","review":"This particular piece of literature, entitled 1984 and written by Goerge Orwell, was 1980 boring. Being a seventeen year old teenager, with a mind of my own, made it extremely difficult to stay focused on something so morbid and [weak] as this so-called \\"classic.\\" I can sum up my thoughts of this book using few words...Reading this book was like HELL! And for those of you who are more visual, it was like trying to keep a white T-shirt clean while eating spaghetti. This book just didn't grab my attention. I simply couldn't \\"connect\\" with the characters (Winston, Julia, Syme, O'Brien and Big Brother). To me, they were all just a bunch of names and not \\"real\\" people. Many sections in the book allowed me to connect the book and the real world toegether like abortion and how the government is slowly becoming more apart of everyone's daily life.BOTTOM LINE: From this collection of 245 pages, nothing tickled my fancy. The thought that a 40 foot tall pine tree was but down to print this accumulation of modern day gibberish is sad indeed!"},{"Title":"1984","review":"It was a very good description of life during anti-social time"},{"Title":"1984","review":"i give this book one star i had to read it for class and i know it's suposed to be a &quot;classic&quot; but god itis awful. first of all its NOTHING like the future is probly going to turn out. second of all every one says the aurthor george orwell is so trippy and wierd but i think he's just trying to cover up for the fact that HE CAN'T WRITE. please george do us all a faver and stop writing books."},{"Title":"1984","review":"1984 is the worst book I have ever read. I would advise anyone who is thinking about reading this book to reconcider! George Orwell is not a bad writer, however, this book he does not do evry well on, as some of his others. Prehaps he was getting old and lost his touch. Animal Farm was okay, but 1984 was horrible. It took him forever, it seemed like, to get into the accual book. If someone were to take out all of the useless part of 1984, it would be half as long. Why would he wirte so much about nothing? I havent ever meet someone who could wirte such a boring book about the goverment. I have meet many people who have loved this book, but i dispised it. I am not at all intrested in the goverment. This may be part of the reason that I didnt like it. I would advise you not to read this book."},{"Title":"1984","review":"I was reading many of the reviews on this book ( I usually start with the lowest ratings as they often have something to say other than \\"I just loved it\\" then move to the fours stars and down ) and was amazed not by the number of poor responseses ( there are long sretches of boredom associated with this book ) but with the reasoning. Anyone who thinks this an unrealistic depiction of the possible future ( or of the present ) is living in a cute little fantasy world. Sure we don't have two way T.V. monitors in our living room ordering us to do knee bends, but at least in the book those monitoring devices weren't always monitored. The odds where, given human limits when the book was written, that the observers were observing others. Now the computer can record everything. This does change things a little. In orwells world if you were naughty you might be seen so they can stop you, now if you are suspected of having been naughty your phone records, bank transactions, hardrive, medical records, etc, can be pulled up in a day. The level of propaganda is just as bad as Orwell predicted ( notice that while a (very) few media outlets have commented on the reasons that the U.S. is a world pariah the only thing the governmnt has to say is that the bad guys are evil and hate us. I guess it is just the nature of bad guys to hate as opposed to reaacting to real greivences) and the attempt to limit free speech have become absurd ( I think some guy in the news awhile back got in trouble for using the world \\"niggerdly\\" because, with no entomological connection, it 'sounded kinda like' a disfavored word ( remember to buy your lady trinkets instead of jewelry this year)). And if you don't think our prisons are as bad as depicted in the book read any of the reports put out by any of the non-US NGO's that look in to such things. Consider all the recent restirction on civil liberties in response to the terrorist attact. The Justice department \\"needs\\" these new powers to protect us from the immediate threat but they had a hissy fit over a five year sunset cluase. Why? If the threat still existed the bill could be renewed, if it was passed it would have to be overturned. Hardly seems like they were acting in good faith.So, read 1984, read the \\"patriot act,\\" ignore what the conspiracy nuts say, ignore what the government says, and see what the staus of your rights, freedom, and privacy are now. ( you will also find that you can be hauled in to prison with no real reason or recourse so you better not complain too loudly if you don't like what you find)"},{"Title":"1984","review":"I think I first read &quot;1984&quot; when I was about 10, twenty-odd years ago. I still have my old copy of it, a now highly tatty and heavily-taped-up Penguin edition. I remember wondering if it would come true in four years time and being a bit worried about it.The thing about &quot;1984&quot; is that it's such a weird bouillabaisse of critical analysis, dystopian fantasy and Orwell's own personal obsessions. All of these things bounce off each other in the most tangled and confusing ways. There's no doubt that many of the features of the book, such as the Two Minutes Hate, have proved to be chillingly funny prophecies, when you compare them to contemporary media phenomena such as the preposterous reversal of Saddam Hussein's public image in the West when he made the big mistake of invading a friendly country (from stern Friend of Democracy to swarthy Satan in a matter of weeks, thanks to a lot of hard work by the American press). Newspeak, also, has a certain currency, when we think of such phrases as &quot;friendly fire&quot; and &quot;precision bombing&quot;.But it has to be said that, if you're looking for a clear and rational book about What, as Marvin Gaye would have said, is Goin' On, then you have to conclude that Orwell's genius for fantasy overrode his intelligence. This book is suffused with Orwell's own personal attitudes to a degree not often recognised. The utter inability of Winston Smith to find any real hope in the proles has been belied by the persistence into the 21st century of popular dissent. I'm talking about things like the WTO riots and the use made of the internet (a technology developed chiefly by the Pentagon, remember) as a tool for political critique and activist organisation. I'm even talking about the Romanian revolution, in which one of the most downtrodden peoples in Europe rose up and deposed - by which I mean, arrested and shot - one of the worst dictators of the century.Orwell's fatalistic sense of the _totality_ of evil is what's bad about the book, if you're looking for clear answers and good thoughts, but on the other hand, if you read the book not as a dire warning but as a satire, it's what's _good_ about it. The pompous lectures of O'Brien read more like the ramblings of a Sade character than as an authentic account of what it is to want power at the turn of these centuries. The evidence is that most of the really powerful and dangerous people in the world are not like O'Brien, in that they aren't in it for the dubious pleasure of &quot;stamping on the human face forever&quot;. They're in it for money, sex and the thrill of feeling important. This makes them vulnerable. This means they can be stopped.The other thing that we tend to notice about &quot;1984&quot; is the pervasive nostalgia of the book. Orwell was not just born in to the middle-class; one some pretty deep level, and despite his truly heroic efforts to change, he was marked by its values and attitudes to the end of his life, and while this gave him great strength, it also narrowed and sharpened his imagination. The points of value in this book are the old notebook, the half-forgotten nursery rhymes, the piece of coral in the ancient paperweight. Nothing new is good. Things fall apart as soon as bought (the Victory cigarette).This narrowness of imagination can seem to spoil the book, but _only_ as long as we expect it to be some sort of honest effort to imagine life in the future. I sometimes wonder if Orwell meant people to take &quot;1984&quot; as seriously as they do. I think it's a brilliant, very blackly comic fantasy, something Swift might have written if he'd lived to see the concentration camps (and don't forget that Orwell wrote eloquently and wittily about Swift; check out the essays and war broadcasts).I'm still glad I read it 20 years ago, and I still read it today. As a book about the importance of a life without dirt, bad cigarettes, horrible food and awful TV, it can't be beat. As a ground plan for Media Studies, it's superb. As a prophecy? Hmmm. No. It's a satire. Take it as gospel and you'll be crushed under its wheels; take it as a dark joke, and you can gain strength from it."},{"Title":"1984","review":"This book used to be required reading. It's the scariest book I ever read and it's becoming scarier as time goes on. Orwell was a true prophet of where we are headed; his timing was just off. While the book has London as its setting, the story could take place anywhere in the world. Despite the American Founders' best plans, America is heading in the direction of Orwell's 1984 world, tiny tiny bit at a time.The book is well written and reads fast. If you love America, you owe it to yourself to read this book. If you haven't read it and don't intend to, you are probably sticking your head in the sand, hoping things will be OK anyway."},{"Title":"1984","review":"1984 is, quite simply, one of my favorite books. I first read it when selecting a book for a high school English class project, and have re-read it every few years ever since. George Orwell's 1949 novel never fails to move me, scare me, worry me, or draw me in. This reading, I listened to it on audiobook for the first time, an experience I highly recommend.As most know, 1984 is a dystopian novel - the English language dystopian novel to many (one of these days, I've got to read Russian author Yevgeny Zamyatin's We, which preceded 1984). Set in the oppressive future of 1984 in London, the major city of Airstrip One (formerly England), the novel chronicles the efforts of everyman Winston Smith to defy the omnipotent ruling Party of Oceania, the principles of Ingsoc (English Socialism), and - most especially - the ever-present, omniscient gaze of Big Brother, the symbol and embodiment of the system itself.Smith begins to rebel in various ways, in particular with his lover Julia. Merely loving anyone but Big Brother is itself a crime. Winston and Julia carry on their relationship, both out of feelings for each other and to break the rules they despise. Eventually, of course, they are arrested by the Thought Police, since - after all - Big Brother Is Watching. Taken to the Ministry of Love for re-education, Winston learns what the Party is really after.Many of the elements of the novel have become concerns for modern times, especially with technological innovations that have made Orwell's science fiction science reality. Surveillance, censorship, perpetual war, manufactured patriotism, control of the language, exploitation of the middle classes. Orwell drew much of his inspiration from the Soviet Union, but it's easy to find examples of all these concerns in the front page of your local newspaper on a daily basis.As much as the technology is terrifying, the truly disturbing part of 1984 is in the mind of our hero, Winston. His struggle to remain himself while being both figuratively and literally, mentally and physically, beaten down by the apparatus of the party is gut-wrenching, as is the final result of the struggle. The last line of the book is one of - perhaps the most - powerful I've ever read.As I stated above, this was the first time I've listened to 1984 as an audiobook. I listened to Blackstone Audio's 2007 production, narrated by Simon Prebble. Prebble is a favorite of mine, and he's at his best here. There's a certain gravity to Prebble's voice that invests his work with a power that, while enjoyable in other books, is vital here to reflect the spirit of the novel. Winston's struggles, hopes, sufferings, all are brought to vivid, grim life by Prebble's strong narration. I highly recommend Prebble's reading to anyone looking to listen to 1984. The production runs approximately 11.5 hours.1984 is a classic. I cannot recommend Orwell's masterpiece enough. Though 1984 has come and gone, Orwell's powerful warning remains timeless."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Working my way through NPR's list of the \\"Top 100 Science Fiction, Fantasy Books,\\" I eventually came to George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four, widely recognized as one of the best books of the last century. Although I was not a huge fan ofAnimal Farmas far as reading for entertainment, I was able to recognize the importance of the book when viewing the message, and the genius behind Orwell's story, an idea which had never been approached before. Nineteen Eighty-Four contains the same structure, although presented as dystopian fiction rather than satire.Reading the book 60 years after it was published, it is hard to fathom that Orwell could have such a prescient view on society, even well after the titular year on which his story is based. Ideas and themes surrounding an oligarchy that takes control of society through fear and compliance might sound alien to today's readers, until really examined against the political structure of several current dictatorships. Although Nineteen Eighty-Four didn't keep me on the edge of my seat like today's traditional \\"science fiction\\" novel, the concept of it and the time it was written will resonate well after the final chapter. This is one of those rare novels that engages the reader in thought not only during the story but for years afterwards as well. Although I would not recommend it to anyone as an \\"airplane read,\\" it does deserve its place atop the list of Science Fiction's Best and is required reading for any fan of dystopian fiction.Edit: Unfortunately Amazon's oligarchical reviewer guidelines and character limit prevent me from listing all 1984 reasons to read this book so I have revised my review to include the top two."},{"Title":"1984","review":"This is one of the most chilling books I have ever read because there is no escape and even Winston's dreams of the \\"Golden Country\\" are finally lost to him as Big Brother invades the last sanctuary--his mind and his soul."},{"Title":"1984","review":"I read this years ago in college and today it is more topical than ever.

Pynchon's voice has been, since \\"Gravity's Rainbow\\" almost the inheritance of 1984; as a dislocation of the predictiveness of the Orwellian text, it also has functioned as a panacea to this nightmare we live on, precisely because Pynchon's language doesn't allow for any concreteness.

Though it is realist in the context of the dictatorship it describes. Also note the theme of the liberating woman which has been used many times in literature notably in \\"We\\" by Zamiatine (a precursor to Orwell ).

Unlike most books written in 1949 about 1984, it is not about people traveling by jet-packs. It explores a world controlled by the government in every aspect. Nothing, including your thoughts are your own. A world where the only love is the love of the government, and individuality does not exist. Minds are brain-washed and war is never-ending.

Well, the word that best describes 1984 is: harrowing. Each sentences radiates a mood of despair: constant paranoia, unnecissary injustice, paradoxical regulations, torture, fear, etc. And of course, that mood Orwell creates will captivate you. You'll eat the pages; you'll cringe, you'll smirk at the ridiculousness of what you're reading, and you'll love it.Read this book not becuase of the political propaganda, or to understand the termanology that has become a part of our vocalbulary.

However, if you've read it and would like a piece of history to call your own, this is a worthy addition to your library.I first read 1984 when I was in the seventh grade. It earned me sneers and odd looks from my classmates, but I recognized it for what it is - a warning. This book helped shape my outlook on the world, and particularly on politics. It made me wary of false promises and doubletalk - &quot;newspeak&quot; - something that has unfortunately come true within my lifetime. War is peace, black is white, down is up.Last year I finally bought a hardcover edition of the standard edition to add to my library. This manuscript is no substitute for a standard edition, in terms of reading at leisure. It has all of the corrections, crossed-out paragraphs (and pages), and the majority of it is in Orwell's own hand (i.e. not typed).

As of last year you would have to pay me to read , but my first year of highschool seemed to be a real slap in the face. We read over14books this year. Most i would read only because i had to , but with 1984 something was differnt. I read 1984 with full intrest until the very last word. The basis of the story was all i needed , all the added details were just one of the many bonuses. These days people are so concerned with their reputations in society that no one will stand up for what they believe in . This was a refreshing read to break up all the social &quot;stuffy-ness&quot; and made me believe , if u stand up for what is right then you will get results."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Orwell's 1984 is a fascinating account of Winston Smith and his world. This world is ruled by a collective oligarchy with &quot;Big Brother&quot; in charge of everyone. And yes, Big Brother is watching over everyone through the use of telescreens, which can be found everywhere in Oceania, his country. Winston works for the Ministry of Truth, where he changes the past to correlate with the future. While working there, he meets a coworker named Julia who has similar beliefs. They meet several times for love which builds the story into the climax.The theme of this book relates to the effects of negative Utopia. It refers to the total opposite of Utopia, which is defined as &quot;an imaginary place considered to be perfect or ideal&quot;. Hardly anything is perfect or ideal for the characters in this book. Big Brother promotes this idea as it makes society as efficient as possible. The national slogan &quot;WAR IS PEACE, FREEDOM IS SLAVERY, IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH&quot; will certainly make any reader believe that Winston Smith is in a negative Utopian society. Orwell certainly makes a dramatic nightmare of what society may become.There are few characters that operate as individuals in this collective society. There is a deep relationship between Winston and Julia, as they become rather involved, and consequences later result.This book was quite different than anything else I have ever read. I have never thought how much a government could control a society, but this book shows how easily a totalitarian government can take over. It makes me wonder if our government today is spying, as there is certainly the technology to do it. I wouldn't want to have telescreens dangling from every wall watching me no matter where I go! George Orwell has created a masterpiece and an excellent example of science fiction. Through reading this novel, I realized how many famous things about the proles and Big Brother have resulted from the context of this novel.This mesmerizing novel tells how Big Brother takes over Winston and all the other residents of Oceania through telescreens, Newspeak, the Party, and hate. Big Brother and his Party are controlling all aspects of life that are sometimes taken for granted. They control people's destiny, your occupations, dress, social status, meals, residence, family, and their minds. Thank goodness the year 2001 in America (or anywhere in the world for that matter) is not like the year 1984 in Oceania."},{"Title":"1984","review":"I was so lost when I first started reading this book. Orwell uses all these made-up words to describe ordinary things, and I couldn't remember them half the time. The very beginning was weird, and I didn't really understand what was happening. If we hadn't talked about it in my english class, I would still probably have no clue what it was about. There's a lot of symbolism that's really easy to miss, so it'd probably be better to not attack this one on your own. Wait until your class reads it, or your book club, or even just a few friends. Just don't try to figure everything out by yourself. If you do understand the book when you're done, you'll see that it was actually pretty interesting, and neat that Orwell, when he wrote it in 1948, actually had such advanced thoughts. Some parts are a little violent, and I don't really think there would be a point for anyone who's not in high school or older to read this book."},{"Title":"1984","review":"1984 was truly ausome book. I read Orwell's Animal Farm in middle school and thoroughly enjoyed that book. I had also started reading 1984 in middle school, but never got into the story. I started reading 1984 a few weeks ago and after getting past the first 20 pages was immersed in the story. 1984, written in the 1940's is about a future gone awry with no freedom of anything, and the political party in power having overwhelming control over all its citizens. The party is divided into 4 main factions the ministry of love, plenty, truth, and peace. It is interesting that they don't call it the ministry of the economy but the ministry of plenty. They are also speaking a new language called Newspeak which tries to simplify all words into their most basic meanings. This is to prevent the formation of new ideas and independent thinking. The thing that I liked most about the book was the believability of the world, it seemed plausible that the future of 1984 could have existed instead of the one we have today. Overall I would rate this book a 9.5 on a scale of 1-10, 10 being the highest. If you are looking to read a truly insightful book into the diabolical possibility of party systems this is a great book to read. If you have some time on your hands this is also a great book to read."},{"Title":"1984","review":"George Orwell was a dedicated communist, but not in the Stalinist sense. Here he takes not just Stalinism to task, but also all societies that manipulate their citizens. If you don't think that western capitalism does not observe and manipulate you, think again. It is doing exactly that, but not using the technologies that Orwell conjured up in the 1940's. Read Vance Packard 'The people shapers' for an analysis of the scientific use of market research for getting into our heads and manipulating and exploting our basic needs and desires. Why else do politicians all mostly run the same lines and have their spin doctors in control of their pronouncements."},{"Title":"1984","review":"A disquieting novel, lucid and magnificent about totalitarianism. Winston Smith, an employee of the Minister of Truth, rebels against the dehumanized and mechanized world of 1984. He, a free thinker, hates the Party and Big Brother, as does Julia. She contacts him and they start a clandestine affair, in a world where passion is forbidden and sex is viewed with repulsion. O'Brien, another character, tells them that there is a secret society named &quot;The Brotherhood&quot;, which fights against the Party. You will be chilled to know what happens next.More than a novel, this book is a clear and horrible warning about totalitarianism and man's overwhelming lust for power, as well as about the misleading uses of technology. A terrifying view of what a society without history, memory, pleasure, love and family may become. It is not pure fiction: in 1984, the Soviet empire was beginning to be deconstructed, but for many years the story portrayed by Orwell had been basically real. There is no guarantee that it won't happen again. New technologies can be a blessing, a tool for the spread of freedom and information (e.g. we can exchange opinions in sites like this one), but they can also be terrible threats to privacy. There is no need to become paranoid after reading this book, but we would do well to be conscious of what might happen in the future (partly, because it has happened in the past). More relevant than ever, this book should be read and talked about. It can only be comforting to know that it is selling very well these days. So read it and think about it: you'll find traces of Orwell's society in the country you live in, no matter which one."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Orwell's book, &quot;1984&quot; has been banned. It's actuallyone of the top 100 banned books of all time. Interesting, a book whose principal villian is Big Brother, a figment who controls society through an organization called the Thought Police, would be banned by none other than: government organizations here in the Land of the Free, Home of the Brave. Or is it, &quot;Land of the Chained, Home of the Coward,&quot; I never can tell.Anyway, before I praise the book, I must tell you which organization led the way in banning Orwell's classic: The John Birch Society...An organization of people so far right-wing that they make George W. Bush look like Joseph Stalin. And what side of the political spectrum is supposed to hold the belief in less government and individual autonomy? Oops.So, the real value in this book is this: Orwell is telling us to fight against organizations with these &quot;divine&quot; attributes: omnipotence, omniscience, and omni-benevolence. In English: all-powerful, all-knowing, and all-good. Why is Orwell saying, &quot;fight these things?&quot; Well, what were the government's ministeries called in this book? They were the Ministry of Love, whose business was hate (that's all-loving); the Ministry of Truth, whose business was lies (that's all-knowing), the Ministry of Peace, whose business was war (that's all powerful) I believe there was another one, but it is not important.The point here is the message from the book. Orwell wrote this book not only as a warning against totalitarian government, but also against totalitarian religion. He was a socialist and an atheist. When the government says it knows what's best because it's the government and the government is all-knowing, then we've got problems. When the Fundamentalist says that he knows what's best for you because he knows God's word, which is written by God, and God is all-knowing, so if anyone knows what's best it's God, and the Fundamentalist knows what God wants, etc. You can follow the circular reasoning.This book has no other value other than to warn. As an update, Orwell's nightmare may occur some day, hopefully never. But look at these hopefully coincidental highlights: UN troops are called &quot;peacekeepers;&quot; there are three major powers in the world: The US, the EC, and China; fundamentalism is seeing a resurgence world-wide, while liberal religions that allow room for people with another faith, or no faith, are dying; the US government is spending trillions of dollars on a &quot;War on Drugs,&quot; this war can never be won and is being used as an excuse to destroy basic freedoms (police can now almost act with impunity as long as the alleged crime is somehow related to drugs).I could go on, but I have written enough, and the parallels are obvious already. George Orwell must be spinning in his grave."},{"Title":"1984","review":"This book describes the internal human struggle at its fullest height.

Freedom of speech, thought, and everything and anything else that we hold dear was snatched away from the world. The Inner Party controls all and creates the stories of the past, present, and future. 2+2=5, and telescreens watch you at all times. This is what has happened on earth in George Orwell's hit, 1984. Although Orwell may not have predicted the future as it is now, it is still an exceptional book. Winston Smith's life is in constant jeopardy from the thought police and telescreens. The first mistake Winston makes is buying a journal. Then he writes in it, and the rest of the &quot;crimes&quot; come naturally. Eventually, the thought police catch him, and try to make him &quot;sane.&quot; My favorite passage is when Winston and his counselor are talking in the &quot;Ministry of Love,&quot; which is where thought criminals are taken when they are caught. His counselor says,&quot; Winston, you know, my mind is just like yours, but you're insane.&quot; They continue their talk. The story's atmosphere, as you could have guessed is overwhelming. The descriptive voice used so realistically however, moves you through Winston's mind, and where ever he goes. At times the book can be extremely slow, yet the last chapter picks up the pace, and excitement level. Bear with the book. As I just mentioned, the first two chapters of the book are not the most thrilling, but they have to be there, or the final chapter would not make sense. Mostly the book was enjoyable, and I kept saying to myself, &quot; Oh, this is what the world would be like if the Democratic Party ruled.&quot; It was exceedingly disturbing. I have to admit, the book was not my favorite, and would probably not even qualify to be on my list as on of my top five favorites. However, the description of the book filled me with emotion. Read 1984 sci-fi fan or not, I believe you'll enjoy the book. I did, despite its numerous flaws."},{"Title":"1984","review":"ISBN: 978-0-451-52493-5Let me start by saying that 1984 is my favorite book of all time. I want to be buried with this book...but this version leaves something to be desired.I recently purchased the Signet Classic paperback version, which is one of those taller (7 1/2\\" X 4 1/4\\") paperbacks that started appearing in recent years. I started reading it and noticed there was something subtly different about it. It turns out that my version has been altered. Words that originally had an English (British) spelling in the original, have now been Americanized. Just on the first page, coloured has been changed to colored; moustache to mustache and metre to meter.Now, to some people this may seem like a small thing. To me though, this is aggravating...possibly disturbing. Did the American publishers think that Americans aren't smart enough to read it with the English spelling of some words? The odd thing is that while they altered the British spelling, they left in words that are typically British like: flat (apartment) and lift (elevator)...and again these are just on the first page.To me this is akin to a British film that gets distributed in the US, then the US film distributor decides that they need to overdub a British actor's voice with an American's because they're worried your average Americans wouldn't understand the film.I have found out that there is a Penguin version offered that is the original un-dumbed down version. It's located here:Nineteen Eighty-Four (Penguin Modern Classics)"},{"Title":"1984","review":"Orwell's distopia about a secret government that monitors what you write, what you do, and even what you think was very believable. The first part sets up how the distopia functions and the consequences for defiance. I love Orwell's style. The way the character's talked was not pretentious and there were some big surprises too!The book drags on a little in the beginning when its going through the distopia, but it picks up after the defiance begins. The defiance comes in the form of a romance between the characters, who have to constantly look over their shoulders for Big Brother. The romance is very well done and even beautiful in its own way.At the end, you can tell the author is instilling his own views about a corrupt government. Yet, the way Orwell writes his ideas fit in the context of the book without shoving them in your face. I wont reveal anything else because I want your heart to jump like mine did when I read it!!The book was very compelling, captivating, disturbing, thought provoking, and enjoyable. I dont think its for everyone... its intense and even depressing, esp. at the end. I loved it though and I would definitely reccomend it to you. :)"},{"Title":"1984","review":"I had been meaning to read 1984 for a couple of years, considering its reputation and its oft-discussed relevance to our own society, and finally picked it up a few weeks ago. While I did enjoy it, I couldn't help but feel a little disappointed by it, and at no time did I ever view Orwell's work to be as earth-shattering in its foreshadowing and cross-generational timeliness as it is universally made out to be. Personally, the conclusion that this book was some sort of uncanny prediction or foresight into late-20th into 21st century American society - Big Brother as the American government, telescreens as television/biased news media, Thought Police as intrusive legislation and access, etc. - I think, is quite a stretch.As far as the book itself, it takes place in a gloomy, depressing world without freedom, where people are reduced to initials and serial numbers. I actually found the \\"chapters\\" of the book of the Brotherhood, with its description and reasoning of the perennial warfare, the prohibition of sex and pleasure, and the hierarchy of society to be the most interesting part of the book. The discussions between O'Brien and Winston later on, as well as Winston's affair with Julia, also revealed much of how Orwell viewed the governments of his time and their philosophies, human nature, and human emotion in general. From these sections alone, there is plenty of material and opposing viewpoints on the government and its role in society, people's place in society, and the role of emotion and memory that Orwell leaves for the reader to tangle with. Orwell certainly succeeded in portraying some of the political forces of his time and twisting them into a well-written, gloomy depiction of a terrible future.However, the fact of the matter is the ideas in this book can be successfully applied not only to governments far and wide, but just about any situation where one group is in power over another. 21st century America is one of tens of thousands - maybe into the millions - of scenarios that can be twisted and bent one way or the other in an effort to fit the roles put forth in 1984 and say with conviction that we're headed toward a world like Oceania. Basically, any situation where there is a body overseeing subjects, where this body has the means to monitor these subjects, as well as the means to control/discipline these subjects, qualifies as a situation that can be successfully compared to Oceania, 1984. Does that mean that every entry-level employee in a large company (it meets this criteria) is a real live Winston Smith? No.All in all, it's a dark and depressing world that Orwell writes about, but it's not nearly as frightening in a real-life way as some people want to make it out to be."},{"Title":"1984","review":"1984 just proves Orwell to be a wonderful writer.

I enjoyed reading it very much. Orwell's writing is phenomenal. The way he describes things is incredible and beautiful. I admired his bold statement against socialism. His book was extremely persuasive and should be read by all that have not yet read it. It is a classic, yet it holds all the contemporary aspects of a newer book. No part of this novel was unsatisfying for me. There were no parts of the novel that did not keep me waiting for what would happen next. This could quite possibly be my favorite book that I have read yet."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Possibly Orwell's greatest work, this was published in 1949 and served (and still serves) as a great warning for what might happen if we aren't careful enough.The year is 1984 and the setting is in London, which is part of Airstrip One, which is part of one of the three world superpowers, Oceania. Oceania was formed on the principles of Ingsoc (English Socialism) and is governed by a group of wealthy people and the imaginary &quot;Big Brother&quot; who is a figure designed by the Party for the people to look up to as their protector. Oceania, and London is particular, is not an ideal place to live at all. Only the Inner Party, which make up a small percent of the population, have enough food to eat and live in considerable luxury. The Outer Party, which are a group of people that hold many of the jobs that keep the Party going, are forced to live under the microscope of the Party and live in relative poverty. While they have it better off than the low class (Proles) they do not have the freedom that the Proles have, and they spend all their time either working or attending Party functions. It is not considered good for a Party member to be doing anything alone besides sleeping and things of that sort.Part 1 gives us the basics of the book. It describes Outer Party member Winston Smith, who is the main character of the book. In Part One, Smith finds himself and realizes how much he hates the Party.In Part 2, Winston meets another Outer Party member named Julia. Julia shares Winston's hatred of the Party and the two both consider themselves to be criminals and they know that they will eventually be destroyed by the Party. However, they agree to dodge the Party as long as possible. At the end of Part 2, Winston is captured by the Party.Part 3 is about the Party's efforts to change Winston by means of torture and make him a loyal servant. I won't go into deep detail because I don't want to ruin the book :)1984 is a great novel. Maybe harder to understand and more complex than Animal Farm, but you probably get a little more out of it. If you want a complex tale about what we could be headed for, read 1984. If you want something simpler, more lighthearted, and less time consuming read Animal Farm. Both books are great in their own right."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Orwell takes you into a world that is not unlike that of Communistic countries in our own time.

Told through the perspective of Winston Smith, a member of The Party, Orwell shows the struggles and consequences of a man daring to go against The System.It is a riveting tale injected with political and social philosophy. A timeless classic that will certainly be revisited by future generations and very likely passed off as &quot;incorrect predictions&quot; because the concepts Orwell covers are too frightful to entertain as reality. From Big Brother watching citizens through Telescreens to the past being rewritten from one moment to the next.I highly recommend this novel to not just science fiction fans but to all citizens of the present, as a reminder that freedom is only a reality as long as we do not take it for granted."},{"Title":"1984","review":"I suspect that most readers of these reviews have already read (&amp;/or reviewed) the book in question. I'm not going to precis 1984 for the remaining readers but simply state that the writing is understated and matter of fact but nevertheless compelling, many points are subtly made and perhaps one sentance in 10 could be used as an aphorism or commentary of 'modern life', whether it be organised sport, national events or geopolitics. Nothing else comes close to that hit-rate, except a dictionary of quotations.For the few who have not yet read the book, see what you're missing!(ps - it was lumped together with Animal Farm, Brave New World, Lord of the Flies and various JB Priestly plays as distopian visions in my long-gone schooldays - they're all worth reading too.)"},{"Title":"1984","review":"Anyone who is interested in the nature of power and manipulation of the masses should read this book.

The story is frightening, especially when you think about some of our current issues such as &quot;Homeland Security&quot;, and the new measures the government is taking to &quot;protect&quot; us.

Orwells crafty tale of a new all powerfull society and rebels trying to bring it down is an intense depiction of what life could be like.

I think this is one of the best books I have ever read. Very entertaining and well, good.

Great book."},{"Title":"1984","review":"If for some reason you got through high school without being forced to read this book, I highly recommend that you read it now. Besides being creative and extremely thought-provoking, 1984 paints a vivid picture of a hopeless future world... a world void of privacy, friendship, love, and family. In this world, where Big Brother is god, mindless conformity is the highest virtue. Winston, the main character, serves as a powerful narrator in revealing the true nature of this society that, in the late 1940's, did not seem all that distant. The two factors of Orwell's society that struck me most were: 1) the disintegration of the family unit, where children control and betray their parents and 2) the mass brainwash of citizens and the idea of \\"doublethink,\\" where history is repeatedly rewritten within citizen's own minds. Everyone should read this book, if only to appreciate the society that we do live in."},{"Title":"1984","review":"1984 is written in the style of the \\"negative utopia.\\" It is a dark vision of a future society in which personal freedom has been destroyed and in which a small group have established dictatorial control over the many. It was written mainly as a warning against authoritarianism and totalitarianism.....not just the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany, but also against the totalitarianism of the mind that is currently evolving in capitalist culture as well. Orwell was a socialist. This is only relevant to counter those who say that Orwell was criticizing socialism. He most certainly was not...socialists stand for personal freedom and economic democracy.This is a very well written book with a good plot. Orwell's vision was a clear one and a danger that has not entirely been eliminated today."},{"Title":"1984","review":"With the exception of \\"Animal Farm,\\" it would be hard to think of a work of satire in the English language that is as powerful as \\"1984\\" (actually \\"Nineteen Eighty Four\\"). Whereas the Whig-Tory squabbles that make up the background of \\"Gulliver's Travels,\\" are mostly forgotten now, the totalitarian essence of Airstrip One still haunts the imagination of the First World. No other major novel this century has produced so many memorable terms. Not simply fantasies of universal surveillance, but also \\"Newspeak,\\" \\"Doublethink,\\" \\"the Ministry of Truth,\\" \\"Sex Crime\\" \\"Thoughtcrime,\\" \\"Two Minute Hate,\\" \\"Memory Hole,\\" \\"Room 101,\\" \\"If you want a picture of the future, imagine a boot stamping on a human face--for ever.\\" Indeed, not since Dickens has there been such a novelist so much on the popular consciousness.Since there are already several hundred reviews in praise of this book, I will devote the rest of this review to providing some reservations. It is often said that Orwell is a master analyst of totalitarianism. Dead wrong, in my view. On the Nazi side of the Molotov-Ribbentrop symbiosis, Orwell has rather little to say. There is no systematic analysis of Nazism, no evaluation of Nazi terror, and, in retrospect most damning of all, no real appreciation of the singular importance of the Holocaust. A look at \\"Revenge is Sour\\", which opens up the fourth volume of Orwell's collected journalism, reveals his limitations dramatically. However just and liberal his opposition to revenge is, Orwell's account fails because he has never had any experience which could make him understand those feelings. It is like reading a denunciation of pornography from a cardinal who has been blind from birth.What is most powerful in Orwell's account is his satire on Communist dishonesty. (About Nazi irrationalism and fanaticism he has little to say.) Why Oceania commits the barbarisms it does is more open to question. Rather oddly, given his frequent skepticism about Progressive pieties, Orwell appears to believe that a growing economy would be in itself sufficient to provide the goods and services a just society needs. Since the three world states wish to prevent that, they encourage endless war which wastes any surplus, and which supports their own regimes by permanent war psychosis. The result is an endless stagnation, and a horrifying stability which could last forever.Now an economic slowdown was clearly a problem with the Soviet Union in the last decades of its life, but equally clearly it was not intended to be that way. More importantly, the worst Communist atrocities, Collectivization and the Great Leap Forward were attempts to radically change society. Soviet Stalinism was a society that went through every sort of radical change imaginable. It was not a society whose crimes were rooted in stasis.Other objections. England no longer exists, there is only \\"Airstrip One.\\" Orwell set his nightmare world in England to challenge his countrymen's complacency. But arguably he reinforced it by showing that it could only occur in an England which was already dead. It was perhaps this aspect that appealed to Czeslaw Milosz and other Polish exiles who viewed their own country as an innocent swamped and threatened by Russian aggression imposing a thoroughly UnPolish society. While this view had a great deal of truth to it, the fact that the former Communists have won two free presidential elections in a whole, suggests that it is not the whole truth. Viewing totalitarianism as a deracinated purging of authentic local traditions has obvious limits. Clearly the Axis countries were militantly nationalist, and it is clear that Communist regimes could not have survived in China, the Soviet Union, Yugoslavia, Cuba, Vietnam and North Korea without successfully appealing to some aspects of nationalism and national culture. All Communist countries appealed to local traditions (has there ever been any kind of regime that did not?), and Orwell should have taken this into account. Likewise romantic love is viewed as Winston's salvation, yet Claudia Koonz, Geoff Eley have pointed out how Nazism gained strength from its appeal to conventional ideas of family. And Richard Stites has pointed out that Stalin's policy cannot simply be viewed as anti-family.Another weakness of the book is its view of Stalinism as one based on intellectuals. While it could be said of Lenin's dictatorship that the government was dominated by intellectuals, one could not really apply that term to Beria, Zhadanov, or Molotov. Too much concentration on the sins of a Heidegger distracts one from the far greater crimes of the Wehrmacht and I.G. Farben. But the greatest weakness of the book is O'Brien. O'Brien's lust for power is so deranged as to be pyschotic. That he lives only for others to suffer tells us nothing about how torturers work. (It does not help the book that Orwell cannot tell the metaphysical difference between a statement such as \\"Germany and the Soviet Union signed a non-aggression pact in August 1939.\\" and \\"2+2=4\\". The first is a historical fact, the second is a tautology. It would be evil to try to torture people to deny the first, madness the second.) In his portrait Orwell reveals his inability to understand such a personality. Indeed, such a person could not really be human at all. Surely in the name of all that is humane and tolerated, he must be extirpated, like a demon. Arendt's concept of the banality of evil or Sartre's view of the anti-Semite have their limitations, but they tell us more than Orwell does, as does, from the inside as it were, Celine's own later novels."},{"Title":"1984","review":"I read this book in High School and once more since then.

However , because it is written so well, it takes on a somewhat timeless quality.This may be why so many people mistake the novel. Those foolish proles. tisk tisk tisk."},{"Title":"1984","review":"George Orwell's &quot;1984&quot;, the classic study of total behavioral control, also is a study of Marxist economics. In &quot;1984&quot; a perpetual state of war exists both to enslave productive populations and also to justify total behavioral control over society. Orwell structures his society using Karl Marx's Communist model: 'Proles' (proletariat), large 'Outer Party', and small 'Inner Party'. The Proles are a poor, marginally-educated workforce requiring minimal control -- they are happy with their ale. The Outer Party is the educated workforce that implements routine governmental functions. To enforce their submissive behavior they are spied upon by telescreens, by coworkers, and by family members. Outer Party members are poor but Victory Gin is inexpensive. Well-paid Inner Party members ensure total societal submission to authority using government policies, surveillance, propaganda, trickery and torture. The Inner Party's total behavioral control over others also intimidates potential Inner Party rebels into total submission.&quot;1984&quot; does not contain mobile computer terminals and computerized databases. It does contain 'telescreens': two-way video/audio devices that permit propaganda broadcasts and also allow video/audio surveillance. The telescreens *cannot* be turned off and blocking them is treasonable. Other societal control programs include 'Thought Police' patrols, alteration of all records, and a language simplification program designed both to hinder 'thoughtcrimes' and also to eliminate the critical questions that well-educated people ask.George Orwell did not anticipate computers, but he understood Karl Marx's strategem for controlling society using economics, surveillance, propaganda, and the educational system. &quot;1984&quot; reflects this understanding."},{"Title":"1984","review":"The world of 1984 is one that is completely stained with hate and ironies. Winston Smith, the novels main character, strugles throughout the book to try to discover who he is and how to overcome the power that the Party has over its self-molded society. The Party, which is a perfect example of a complete totalitarianim government, has shaped the world of 1984. The Party has so much control over every aspect of human life,that power including love, sex, and the family enviorment. &quot;The only recognized purpose of marriage was to beget childeren for the service of the Party. Sexual intercourse was to be looked on as a slightly disgusting minor operation, like having an enema.&quot;(57) The power that the Party has forces Winston Smith to rebel. He then falls in love with a young women, which is not only a crime, but is completely unheard of. The unlawful act is one that starts the roller-coaster ride that is this novel, and in trun, plays an important role in the theme. Orwell not only appeals to the readers emotions but also plays with ones mind. The themes of government, power, and isolation is what make this novel so fabulous. This novel could be best described as an ironic paradox in every sense of the words. 1984, by George Orwell is a futureistic novel that forces the reader to contemplate the world around them. The novel is so stratigically written that it can appeal to the modern reader. I would reccomend 1984 to anyone who enjoys a well written political satire."},{"Title":"1984","review":"I might not be capitalism's biggest fan but I have to say that this book was one of the scariest things I've read in my entire life. It gives a chilling view of what happens when Communism overtakes the world, leaving an illusory, tyrannical dictator known only as &quot;Big Brother&quot; as the leader. No one has ever seen him, yet nothing can escape the watchful eyes of his fanatical secret police. When one man tries to rebel against the iron grip of Big Brother, it ends in tragedy for him. This brutal attack on Communism would be enough to make Marx himself cringe if he knew the turn it would take."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Why are you sitting there? Get up and read this book. It may show you how human you really are..."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Mark Twain said a classic is a book that everyone talks about and no one reads. I hope that cannot be said about 1984. I was assigned this book back in high school, and with apologies to Mr. Johnson, I read the Cliffs Notes instead. But since I am unable to discard a book, especially a classic, I have spent the ensuing years having it stare me back in the face. While the totalitarian warnings are well known and the 1984 terminology is widely used, I just couldn't believe how gripping the whole thing is. The main character, Winston Smith is no abstraction. He's easy to identify with. Suddenly totalitarianism isn't some far off gulag or death camp, but the horrors of a man alone.The thoughts and details are slowly revealed in a way that you can really root for Winston. As he learns more about a world he scarcely remembers as ever being different, you hope that he is about to change everything. What does happen is a pretty good secret considering how much has already been written about this book. I've read other Orwell books since High School, but I'll admit that I was scared of 1984's classic nature. I shouldn't have been. Orwell was always easy to understand. His insistence on using straightforward language to convey complex issues makes the book easy to follow. Now, I regret that I will never have the pleasure of reading it again for the first time."},{"Title":"1984","review":"1984, there isn't anything too exciting about that title. Why would you buy a book called 1984? I'll tell you why. Because 1984 is a very unique and interesting book. It has a very different idea of how the author (George Orwell) thought the year 1984 was going to be like. Though we know how 1984 really was, it is still very interesting. This book follows a man named Winston and the horrible conditions he and the world are living in. Could the world turn into something this horrible? Telescreens everywhere, watching everything you do? Thought Police out to get you? It sure makes you wonder. It's almost... scary."},{"Title":"1984","review":"It is hard to believe that Orwell wrote this book so many years ago and 1984 has already come and passed over 18 years ago. This book brought up the idea of government control of how people live and think. It is relevant as much today as it was back then. This book is a must for anyone studying political science or socialogy. Remember, Big Brother is always watching you!"},{"Title":"1984","review":"\\"1984\\", by George Orwell, is a dark complicated warning to humanity to change its present course or suffer the consequences. Although potentially very enjoyable, this original \\"Big Brother\\" book presents an interesting enigma for the student and teacher. In high school, the science fiction genre can be difficult to \\"sell\\". This book lives in the realm of soft science fiction (as opposed to the hard gadget oriented world of Mr. Asimov), and deals with fairly complicated philosophical and political issues. These complications come with their own confusing terminology. Orwell, with his already expansive vocabulary, even creates a new language, \\"Newspeak\\", to help explain a new set of socialistic societal and philosophical concepts. The fictional nation of Oceania (England) is one under an extreme socialistic, power hungry, and mind-bending government. Once the basic concepts of the government and society are understood the book becomes an interesting struggle of one man against \\"Big Brother\\". Although entertaining enough to earn five stars, the complexity causes some parts of the book to go very slowly and the lack of happy ending is disappointing if not disturbing. If you liked this book, I recommend &quot;Brave New World&quot;, by Aldous Huxley, as a companion read. Unless you have a prodigy on your hands, due to the reading level and complexity of the book, I wouldn't recommend it to someone under 15 or a freshman in high school."},{"Title":"1984","review":"George Orewll's 1984 is truly captivating however extremely disturbing. It's a story about a cold heartless society and the eradication of, by our standards, the normal human.With it's first [edition] in 1949 it's written as an extremely pessimistic view of the future. The novel examines a socialist empire and the way they can control mankind, the future, and the past.The book revolves around a middle aged, middle class, although extremely intelligent man. Winston Smith works as part of the government changing the past. He is constantly watched and allowed no emotions other than hate and fear. The party controls every aspect of life.Winston can vaguely remember his childhood before Big Brother and the Party began controlling everything. He still maintains early 20th century morals and ideals of what life should be about. The book covers his rebellion against the party.1984 is well written for the most part, however there are some parts that you have to fight to get through. For example at one point Winston obtains an anti party book, Orwell then goes into long chapters that are excerpts from this \\"book.\\" These are long dry passages, that contain information that has already been reveled to the reader through indirect methods.Overall I think that this book is a good book to read. It will improve your appreciation of life today."},{"Title":"1984","review":"What simpleton compares &quot;1984&quot; to &quot;Brave New World?&quot;New World is a simple morality tale about a world forced into conspicuous consumption. Yawn. 1984 is the frightening tale of a future gone awry, and a brutal government well aware of its intention to maintain power at all cost.We follow Winston, an editor with an odd job, rewriting history. Wiston is forced to &quot;double think&quot; his way through a life he knows is contrived to forever remain stagnant.As Winston ponders the present, the war weary remains of Oceania's capital, London, he is forced to deal with memories of a very different past - and he fails to reconcile the two.Orwell's eye is a magic thing. A reporter at heart, his eye for detail in fiction and reportage is awesome. While reading 1984, one feels Orwell IS Winston, in his head and in his world. With any imagination it becomes easy to allow 1984 to become real, and Winston's desperation your own.Orwell side steps silly sci-fi detail (that dopey Huxley embraces too readily. What is it with all the helicopters in &quot;Brave New World,&quot; anyway?)and creates a desperate world that, though written 50 years ago, seems perfectly plausible now.This chilling masterpiece is a must read for anyone who ponders the delicate balance of power and politics. More so, this dark tome considers the loss of individuality in an increasing global society. At first blush, it is easy to dismiss 1984 as completely off the mark, but after some consideration, one is forced to concede that maybe nothing here is really improbably.A must read."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Sad, beautiful, nauseating, incredible, believable.

I've also been on a Utopia kick, reading books such as 'Brave New World,' 'Island,' and, of course, '1984'. In my opinion, it is a good story, but I am not very alarmed about Orwell's ominous predictions of the future. I mean...yes, the massive possibilities given us via the internet do seem to mirror those of the telescreen that always knows what Winston is doing, but I cannot forsee the decline of the human spirit. The book in itself begins interestingly enough, but by the middle, I was more interested in finding the switch to the reading light so I could drift off to sleep. There are about 20 pages that are very slow reading, but I was captivated by the last part (part 3). However, the ending left me with a very sour taste in my mouth, mainly because it is not the conclusion I would have picked; but that's kind of my point...I still have (&lt;---if I could use italics...ooo) my opinion, and Orwell has his.

He who controls the present controls the past.\\"My definition of a truly classic novel is one that is so talked about and referenced that you can know all about the book and it's message without having ever actually read it. 1984 is one of the most glaring examples of this, as terms such as \\"Big Brother\\" and \\"Doublespeak\\" are now mainstream concepts that no longer require explanation.The book itself gained its popularity, however, by successfully reaching a broad audience by exaggerating and reducing the complicated debate of the illusion of free will and freedom of thought in any kind of government structure that strives to control and manipulate the populace for its own benefit in an almost unbelievable science fiction setting. The extremes that are reached in 1984's may seem only possible in a work of fiction, yet there is a truth beneath the pulp novel trappings that most readers can not avoid recognizing.Note: For those who have already read this, I have a suggestion.

I loved the fatal relationship between Julia and Winston, mostly because it was unsentimental and virtually realistic. I don't think Orwell romanticizes anything, alluding perhaps to the bleak style of life led in the book. (The denouement between the two is stunning, yet tragic). The novel ends on a melancholic, similarly unhappy note, which epitomizes the main idea presented: there really are no happy endings, and sometimes there is no winner. Winston, our anti-hero, already dull at the beginning, goes full circle, culminating in a conclusion full of Orwellian grace and sadness. Perhaps the ending was the best part of all, as it leaves the reader feeling like the world of 1984 is, in fact, real and never-ending. Clearly, that was Orwell's point."},{"Title":"1984","review":"194 is a classic political novel.

It is a surveillance society in a nation always at war with an amorphous enemy. Fear is the Government's weapon of choice and the image of omniscience and omnipotence it projects upon its people is seemingly insurmountable. The society is deeply stratified and hierarchical with the privileged few at the core going out to the tentative citizens and the listless prolatariat (called proles) at the very bottom of the pile. The story surrounds a very common man and his struggle to be fully 'himself' in a society that frowns upon individualism and independent thought.The context of this book renders it somewhat prophetic of the past 8 or so years of the Western world. Orwell's insight is worthy of canonization because of how right he seems to be about the tools of societal control and influence. He includes the dubious 'tele-screens' eerily reminiscent of the broadcast media, numberless CC TV cameras employed by some cities and perhaps even the ubiquitous Internet and vulnerability it implies on our privacy. Then there is the growing power of Homeland Security laws.Orwell seems like he may be attacking autocrats and dictators but there may be another agenda. It is not Big Brother himself that is to be feared but the system which he represents. The Goverment is as faceless as their ceaseless enemy and Orwell depicts a society that slowly became what it was with time. Can he be saying that any society is prone to the evils of control?The fight of our hero is admirable and leaves us questioning the role of the individual in society. The ending you must read for yourself.

Probably not. Even Bush hasn't done it or advocated it, and if he doesn't it probably never will happen. But that's not what the people of North Korea believe. They think that they are going to be invaded. And this is what Chavez is pounding into his masses of poor people in Venezuela. Fear is a very good way to control people. Look at the USA after 9/11. We were shocked, and rightly so. We invaded Afghanistan, and rightly so. But then things got a little wacky and we were not sure if we were continuing in the right direction. If took several years before we could start to see things a little more objectively, but perhaps now we aren't really seeing things correctly either. Perhaps this is just the opposition's turn to confuse us.Orwell shows how masses can be controlled without even knowing it. He shows how 4 = 5, and how you can make people appreciate how little you do for them. Instead of complaining about the Press's mistakes, thank your luck stars that we have a free press.

After finally taking the opportunity to finish it, I wonder how I made it through high school and through a Political Science degree without having read Nineteen Eighty-Four.I chose to purchase this book on audio and loved the narration. I felt as if I could feel Winston's thoughts as he made a journey to question the life that he was living and question \\"the party.\\" This book reaffirmed my love for the freedoms that I enjoy in so many different ways - the freedom to love, to travel, to have a family and friends, to ask questions, to write and acknowledge my feelings, to READ! This world that Orwell created, and described in such realistic detail, was a nightmare and was in such contradiction to the democratic freedoms that I know.I think that what struck me the most was the love affair that Winston shared with Julia. That it was forbidden was horrible, but the lengths that they had to go to be together and to hide their relationship was astounding. Winston risked everything to trust Julia, and he did so with full force, with everything that he had.The optimist in me hoped for an overthrow of this world that was described in Nineteen Eighty-Four. I wanted the characters to experience the world that I live in, because the alternative that was presented was so unspeakable. This novel was amazing for its ability to make me appreciate what I have, to describe something so very opposite to what I know.I hope that everyone has an opportunity to read it and is able to appreciate their reality just a little more, because they have received a little glimpse of Orwell's alternative."},{"Title":"1984","review":"1984 was a good book to read. The interesting part of the book was the interworkings of the government with Big Brother and the five minute hate that they include themselves in. Also I liked the characters of Winston and Juila.

With Goldsteins book on his view of government, it gets to the point where you get bored. Also the characters of O'Brian and Big Brother get annoying. Sometimes I just wanted them to disappear.

The book had me hooked from the very beginning and never let go. It's so masterfully done and the creation of the Newspeak language just tells the tale of how much thought and effort went into this work. No short-cuts were taken in this time-honored tale.

It absolutely controls you until the last page."},{"Title":"1984","review":"George Orwell's 1984 is considered a prototypical dystopian novel by many literature critics. In 1984, Orwell captures the very feeling of helplessness of being trapped within a world where war is peace, freedom is slavery, and ignorance is strength. Winston Smith lives a worse life in this world than everyone around him. With Winston, Orwell shows that real torture is not being brainwashed, but knowing that you are brainwashed. Some may say that the world in 1984 is not realistic. Actually, this model dystopia is an example of a perfectly established communistic world. Every side of this book is possible, which allows us to wonder if George Orwell's intention of this book was something more than simply a classic word of dystopian literature. Perhaps, the year before he died, Orwell saw that a communistic world was not safely far off, and a warning should be shown to the public. The importance of this novel may have been the reason that Orwell isolated himself on an island in Jura, Scotland, when sensing his impending death of tuberculosis.To aid him in this warning, Orwell found all the imperfect things in the world, made them worse, and added them to the life of Winston Smith. But it seems like Orwell did not have a typical idea as to what the worst things in life are. Such things as famine and lack of clothing do play a part in 1984, but Orwell seems to emphasize that the real means of torture are more mental. One of the main subjects of 1984 is the Party being able to alter the past to fit their means. Because of this, Winston is tortured with having no proof of what may or may not have happened in the past. Only once does he actually find some proof, and even that is taken away from him. With these views as to what is truly an element of torture, Orwell captures the genre of dystopian literature.Overall, an excellent book, easily fit to be one of the model dystopian stories."},{"Title":"1984","review":"I bought this book for one of the boys for a class at school.

Upon reading it 20 years later, I was amazed! This was a very shocking book in that when it was written there was no way the author could have known what would have been invented or happening in our present time or in 1984. It reads like fiction, but we know it is reality. He sheds light on many events that are already in motion, even though government may not make it official to the public. This book is a warning of just how terrible life could be if we continue to be blinded by what we are told by the media; how truth is distorted by the deliverer and their masters and how humans will ultimately destroy themselves for the sake of power if allowed to do so. Of course history does repeat itself, I hope that will be proven incorrect."},{"Title":"1984","review":"George Orwell created an interesting but slightly disturbing look at life in his idea of a future world in 1984. He does a brilliant job using symbolism and he really shows some of the flawed points of government and people. His purpose with this novel was to inform people to be aware of what is going on and try not to lost their brains as they follow the crowd. Another important point that he tries to get across is how too much power can corrupt people.George Orwell, whose real name was Eric Blair, was born in 1903 in a British colony of India. He was most well known in his time for being a journalist, but today he is remembered for his novels. Animal farm is one of his most famous novels along with 1984.Orwell has many good points and does a wonderful job in passing on those lessons throughout much of the book. That is untill the ending where many of these lessons are then blurred in a confusing, creative, and chilling cliffhanger. While for me the ending was a little disappointing, I can see how many others would enjoy it. I personally prefer endings that are more resolved.I think that the book tells an intriguing story that will keep the reader on their toes the entire time. On top of that, the characters are wonderfully written and easy to relate to. I found that the goals were well represented. Overall, I think that this is a classic story that is full of excitment, terror, and love. I would recommend it to anyone I know who is looking for a good book."},{"Title":"1984","review":"1984By George OrwellSignet Classics. $9.99(Ages 14 and up)Reviewed by:High School FreshmanGeorge Orwell is a gifted writer who has written many novels, several of them involving government and politics. In this creative and haunting book, he attempts to reach out to his readers to show them what the world might be if the use of technology and invasion of government without proper boundaries can be disastrous to humankind and society.George Orwell, pseudonym of Eric Blair, wrote many novels in his lifetime. Many of Mr. Orwell's novels will be read from generation to generation. This was thanks to his great creativity in his writing. One good example of his imagination and creativity is when he wrote one of his most famous novels, which used symbolism to recognize the government, politicians, and effects of the Russian Revolution, is the short but clever book, Animal Farm. Mr. Orwell uses similar elements of government in 1984 to illustrate the evils of governments and what they can inflict on its people.Based on the great detail, originality, and the vivid depiction of Winston's struggle in 1984, I believe the Mr. Orwell has successfully portrayed a negative utopia. For example, in part three, chapter five, Winston, the main character, was placed into the torture chamber of Room 101. Here, he was tortured and beaten in order to clear his head of freedom and independence in order to replace it with the government ideas and propaganda. This chapter shows that there is fragile line between governmental control and supervision, and the dangers of mind control in an entire society.There are both weaknesses and strengths in this novel. One weakness is that George Orwell's explanation of societal views is complicated and difficult to understand without extensive knowledge of political ideologies. In order to fully comprehend what is going on and to understand the symbolism he is using, the reader must be knowledgeable in governmental studies. Although these factors seem to detract from the book, there is one important strength that really makes this book fantastic. This great strength is his use of symbolism and reference. There is more to the story than reader may initially think. I am sure if I reread this book ten or even twenty years from now, I will view this story in a different perspective."},{"Title":"1984","review":"1984, pictures a compelling sci-fi, thriller, and drama of a utopia in the life of a man named Winston. 1984 reflects on the repetitive pattern of human government. Though slow at first, 1984 easily picks up quickly by part two. In the novel, man tests his freedom against the government. The government engages fear to keep the probes (lower class citizens) loyal and obedient, but underneath of the skin lays a brotherhood that thrives to revolt over the corrupted government. Orwell obtains a talent in writing that creates a streaming movie in your head of a chaotic and depressing utopia which war is peace, freedom is slavery, and ignorance is strength. It truly brings out the fear and selfishness that we cannot see from our seat that lays in the potential of our political leader, men that may exist today, waiting to be pushed."},{"Title":"1984","review":"I'm a bit biased; I read this as a teenager and have always considered it my favorite book.

Also, as several other reviewers have mentioned, some of the ideas present in 1984 could be pulled out of today's headlines. Not only governments, but corporations also now have the ability to track activities, both on and offline, of virtually everyone who lives in the industrialized world. Websites like pipl.com and Spokeo show how easy it is to observe people's activities through social networks and public records. Marrying this technology to a desire to socially engineer the population could result in the type of dystopia that Orwell depicts in this prescient classic."},{"Title":"1984","review":"A communistic dictatorship rules over the people living in the country of Oceania. Newspeak is the official language of Oceania, people love Big Brother, the head of Oceania. What I have just described to you is what 1984's world looks like. 1984, is the book that explains what would happen to the world if democracy fell and communistic-dictatorship took over. This book was written by a man by the name of George Orwell, who was born in 1903. Soon after writing this book he succumbed to tuberculosis. Once finishing the typescript he sent it to his two friends, Secker and Warburg, who officially published it on the date of June 8th 1949. George Orwell sadly died only a few months after his book hit the shelves in January 1949.Within the pages of 1984 there is the \`Party' which mysteriously and ruthlessly rules over the people who live in the country of Oceania. The peasants are called the \`Proles'. The \`Proles' are essentially everyone who is not in the party, these are the common man and the people who live in much poverty while the Party is able to live with considerable of luxuries. This book gives the reader a feeling of desolation, sometimes while reading it I thought I was Winston the main character who was trying to take down the party, and who was sick of being told what to and what not to do. That is one of the books major strengths because the reader will feel as if it is him being prosecuted. Also the book makes you hate the party. This feeling makes the reader become even more sucked into the book, making him feel like the party is the worst thing possible. The only real weakness I could find with this book was that, sometimes, the book has a tendency to give a little excess information to the reader. These are often unnecessary facts that have no place in the book such as when it describes in a lot of detail how the tree is where Winston and his friend Julia meet; however this does not happen very often.The main goal of this book is to give the reader an idea of what life would be like if democracy ever fell in the modern world. This book accomplishes this goal with an amazing job. Everything is how the reader would think it would be, the citizens are being watched at every moment, there are \`thought-police', the majority of people are poor, is a are the minority of rich people. Also this book goes into so much detail, it makes me feel as if I were there...in 1984. The detail helps the reader become even more captivated in the dark secrets unlocked within the party and the severity of the crimes Winston commits against the party.When reading this book the reader will experience a connection with the book and its characters, the reader will become Winston. The reader will become a Prole. The reader will become Big Brother, the reader will love big brother. The reader will go through many changes while reading this book, and may experience many hardships. Which path they choose is up to them, whether to love big brother, or hate him. That decision is up to the reader, good luck.

I don't know what Mr. Orwell intended it to be but looking at my own country today I still think that my original interpretation was accurate.I felt the same way about Animal Farm.Richard Edward Noble - The Hobo Philosopher - Author of:\\"Hobo-ing America: A Workingman's Tour of the U.S.A..\\""},{"Title":"1984","review":"To call 1984 a work of science fiction is, while technically accurate, somewhat a disservice to the book. 1984 is a chillingly accurate glimpse into a future of hellish totalitarianism, and quite amazingly, with each passing generation it actually seems to become more and more relevant. It should be regarded not only as great literature, but also as an oracle of the very real storm clouds that are consistently looming just overhead. But perhaps most importantly, it should also serve as a much needed kick in the groin to anyone who is constantly blinded by the bright lights of patriotism, war, greed, fear, and all forms of propaganda.1984 is not science fiction. 1984 isn't fiction at all."},{"Title":"1984","review":"This classic story of Orwell's imagined future in 1984 written during the 1950s is a stark warning against totalitarian systems of government. In the story the government is headed by a shadowy figure titled Big Brother. This popular reference to \\"the man\\" or other monitoring organization originates in this story. The basic concept is that the ruling party monitors all aspects of a person's life through telescreens, microphones, and an elaborate spy system, among others. They create their own history and destroy all accounts which differ from their account of history.They also invent a language called Newspeak which could be a reference to using politically correct language. Newspeak is structured to comply solely with the political philosophies of the Party and is intended to make thought which occurs contrary to this philosophy impossible. If someone tries to make claims to the contrary or engage in discussions that oppose the party it is considered \\"crimethink\\" and the person is taken away to be \\"fixed.\\"If current events or philosophies change, a complex system of forgery and reworking is in place to rewrite history so that Big Brother always makes accurate predictions, the economy is always better than it was in the past and things appear to be great on paper. In reality, people barely subsist, disease and crime is common, and life in general is much worse compared to life prior to the Revolution which occurred in the 1950s-60s in conjunction with wide spreadnuclear war. Old copies of books and newspapers are burned to eliminate any hardcopy of actual history.There is no reality but that which the Party and Big Brother espouse. If you think outside or remember something different from the stated reality, you are considered delusional and in a minority of one. Those who persist in the belief that Big Brother is wrong, are arrested and systematically tortured and brainwashed to the point where they begin accepting the Big Brother philosophy and reality as truth.The main character works for the Party but has doubts as to the positive benefits of the Party and its philosophy. He feels repressed and seeks out ways to fight against this overwhelming power. The first part of the book walks through his growing realization of the continuous brainwashing and creation of reality which can change at the drop of a hat.The 2nd part adds very little to the overall plot and really could be skipped without much loss in value. It additionally contains a gratuitous amount of promiscuous behavior which serves little purpose other than an appeal to the prurient interest.The last part of the book describes in detail the arrest, torture, and brainwashing of the protagonist. He has many logical arguments and perspectives which would likely occur to the reader fighting against the philosophy of Big Brother. This helps to make believable his eventual conversion to belief that Big Brother is good and right regardless of the reader's perspective grounded in the reality of today's thought.1984 is quite thought provoking and serves as a good reminder that any political party or dictator with absolute power is dangerous and measures should be taken to avoid movement towards this type of system."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Ever wonder what it would be like to fear for your life after having bad thoughts about the war in Iraq or perhaps even the president himself? What about being watched and monitored while you exercise? Ever wonder where Big Brother came from? Then George Orwell's 1984 is for you! 1984 is a book about a government that controls every aspect of life. They control language, history and even your thoughts. While the book starts off slow, it quickly picks itself up and then some. It constantly kept me reading just so I could find out what happens next. This book is an experience I won't soon forget and believe everyone their mothers and even grandmothers should read! So pick it up and be amazed at the power Big Brother holds over the people and their every day lives. Read the classic that will never fold over and become outdated like so many others. One you can understand whether you are from 1984, 2007 or 2099."},{"Title":"1984","review":"\\"1984\\" is George Orwell's warning of the dangers of a totalitarian society. The main character in the novel, Winston Smith, is a low-ranking member of the ruling Party in the country of Oceania. Winston and his fellow citizens are monitored everywhere they go, even in their own homes. Party members spy on everyone using ever-present telescreens, and pictures of \\"Big Brother,\\" the Party's leader, are on display everywhere. The Party's main goal is to eliminate all forms of individual thought, which can lead to rebellion. In order to do that, the language of Newspeak is being integrated into society in hopes of eliminating 80% of all words and thus reducing the chances of a revolt. Sex is also another aspect of life considered taboo by the Party, and Winston eventually begins an affair with a woman named Julia with full knowledge of the fact that if they get caught, they could both be killed by the government. Winston ultimately finds himself fighting a dangerous battle with the Party, and it's a fight he cannot possibly hope to win.This novel is as powerful now as it was when it was written in the late 1940s. Orwell's commentary about the dangers of totalitarianism coupled with an analysis of the powers of psychological manipulation are truly frightening. I can't say that this book is enjoyable to read because the subject matter is very disturbing, but \\"1984\\" is a well-crafted and thought-provoking book that should be ready by everyone."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Orwell's \\"1984\\" is a novel that is truly frightening for those who cherish free expression and the power of individual thought. Dystopia literature owes it all to this classic of the genre. I managed to get through all my formal education without having read this text. However, picking it up now I am glad that I waited until I was a little older to read it.The first thing one must marvel at is the brilliant construction of the novel. Orwell as an artist is at the top of his form and the structure of the novel is wound so tightly that readers would be wise to annotate the text as there is an almost cyclical nature to many of the themes and ideas presented. Orwell weaves the same ideas throughout the text, and each time he revisits them he shows them through the lenses of a different ideology or character and thus emphasizes for the reader how precarious (and precious) are the mores and ideals of the individual mind.The idea of governments who yearn for power for power's sake is not so foreign to our early 21st century world, and although the text ends on a nihilistic note, the reader walks away from \\"1984\\" with the renewed impetus to revere and respect our individual thoughts, as these, and these alone, give us unique value. Read this text, not so you can fear \\"big brother\\", but rather so you can be reminded to respect yourself enough to think and form intellectual thoughts. It is Winston's loss of the self that should frighten the readers of \\"1984\\", not the dreary world that Orwell creates. We don't need totalitarian governments to become Winston Smiths. We can do it to ourselves if we are not careful!"},{"Title":"1984","review":"This book is an Orwell classic, all about how totalitarian governments were tricking the people, destroying freedom, and ruining the world. The main character is Winston Smith, a disgruntled middle class office worker who secretly harbors a hatred of The Party. The world in which Winston lives is divided into three super states: Oceana, Eurasia, and Eastasia. Winston lives in London, the capital of Oceana, which is ruled by a totalitarian regime known as The Party, and it's leader Big Brother. The Party does not allow any dissent against it and even thinking rebellious thoughts is a crime. They change history to their liking and falsify endless documents to be in their favor. Winston does not know what is true and what is lies. The Party is constantly watching Winston and he must be careful not to give himself away. He eventually starts a love affair with a woman named Julia, who also hates The Party and all that it stands for. They get in touch with an inner party member named O'Brien who claims to be part of a rebel organization known as the Brotherhood. He is actually a party spy and Winston and Julia are eventually arrested. Winston is interrogated and tortured to try and force him to accept the party ideals. Eventually he is subjected to his worst nightmare, having his face eaten by rats. He begs that they do it to Julia instead, breaking his most important promise not to betray her. His soul destroyed, Winston is released. He no longer loves Julia and has learned to love Big Brother and The Party. This book is a very bleak view of what George Orwell saw the world becoming in 1949. Although it is quite disturbing this book makes you think a lot and is very well written. I recommend this if you like other George Orwell books as well as depressing novels."},{"Title":"1984","review":"I think this is my favorite novel about a dystopia. So far, I have read \\"We\\", \\"A Handmaid's Tale\\", \\"Brave New World\\", \\"Anthem\\", and \\"A Clockwork Orange\\", and though I have thoroughly enjoyed quite a few of the novels that I've listed, 1984 is my absolute favorite. How is it different? The main character, Winston, if not entirely likable, is very relatable. What I like most about him is that he doesn't assume to be anything or know anything, but rather, he feels instinctively that something is wrong with how the world is set up. He is not especially intelligent (although he's not exactly stupid either) or strong-willed or moral or handsome. And as if to emphasize Winston's relatable mediocrity, Orwell gave him an exceedingly boring office job! In some novels about dystopias, the protagonist can be overly heroic (as in Anthem) or tragic (as in a Handmaid's Tale), and thus more admirable but also a lot less relatable.Another thing that is different . . . this book gives you different perspectives. Orwell's theme of government control over language is pretty common in this genre, but because he took his thesis a little farther than merely saying that government control is bad, the book is an interesting read. He even gets a little into metaphysics. As a reader, you also get the perspectives of different characters in the book, and thus, the perspectives of both the government and of rebels. Often, books in this genre can be very straight-foward, but 1984, with its many twists, is a very worthwhile read."},{"Title":"1984","review":"I read this book because I was growing weary of my own ignorance. One-too-many references to Big Brother amid the post-911 proliferation of video cameras, wire-tapping, and concern about government intrusions into private life pushed me to question my own cultural literacy (thanks to author E.D. Hirsch, Jr. here). My job also sent me to southern Sudan in 2007, during which a colleague noted that I would need to visit a rather remote \\"Orwellian province\\". It turns out that province is called Unity State. After reading 1984, I get his drift.It also occurred to me that the TV phenomenon Big Brother was likely produced by staffers who found themselves in their teens or early adulthood during 1984, while the audience to whom it caters may largely have been born well after that year. Given a generation who knows Big Brother not as the incarnation of thinly veiled government despotism but as the product of CBS Prime Time, there was reason to question more than my own cultural literacy. But what, or whom, we really need to discuss is Winston Smith.Best I can tell, Winston Smith is me. Modern man; modern society but faced with the reality that government had morphed into political, economic, sociological, technological, and intellectual fiat - its greatest coup perhaps being the subtle control of free thinking. By changing content of archival media, limiting contact with others, or simply eliminating those who dare _remember_, all that matters is current perception, regardless of logical inconsistency. And if this is achieved, then Smith's government (for lack of a better term) is, and always has been, right and just. For if you never learned (or never remember learning) that 2 + 2 = 4, then 2 + 2 = 5 seems quite plausible.The problem is that Smith dares to remember - dares to become conscious that another manner of thinking exists beyond the required and ubiquitous application of Doublethink, which he describes as follows: \\"To know and not to know, to be conscious of complete truthfulness while telling carefully constructed lies, to hold simultaneously two opinions which cancelled out, knowing them to be contradictory and believing in both of them, to use logic against logic, to repudiate morality while laying claim to it, to believe that democracy was impossible and that the Party was the guardian of democracy, to forget, whatever it was necessary to forget, then to draw it back into memory again at the moment when it was needed, and then promptly to forget it again, and above all, to apply the same process to the process itself - that was the ultimate subtlety: consciously to induce unconsciousness, and then, once again, to become unconscious of the act of hypnosis you had just performed.\\"As the book opens, Smith fails to \\"consciously induce unconsciousness\\", the mere act of which is considered a crime - Thoughtcrime, to be precise. The sort of awareness with which he is left can culminate in nothing other than action, and action which can culminate in nothing other than death. \\"He was already dead, he reflected. It seemed to him that it was only now, when he had begun to be able to formulate his thoughts, that he had taken the decisive step. The consequences of every act are included in the act itself. He wrote, 'Thoughtcrime does not entail death: Thoughtcrime IS death.' Now that he had recognized himself as a dead man it became important to stay alive as long as possible.\\"This book is compelling because of the pains Orwell has taken to conceptualize a world in which government has conquered thought life as the last bastion of liberty. Once memory and perception is controlled, what better way to direct the mindless fervor of the masses than to create focal personifications for polarizing emotions: one to love (Big Brother) and one to hate (Emmanuel Goldstein). As such, manipulated thought can become concentrated action with the purpose of maintaining the entire regime in perpetuity.It almost seems as if Orwell is trying to answer the question, \\"How bad could it (government) get?\\" to which it is tempting to reply, \\"How realistic is his answer?\\" Because so many of us, so many Winston Smiths, have seen smatterings of Orwell's answer in recent developments, there is good reason to be guarded and better reason to be proactive in the defense of intellectual freedom. Looking at the China, Burma, North Korea, and even western democracies of our day, it is easy to see hints of Doublethink and more overt evidence of a paralyzing fear of independent thought. But there is little reason to suspect that government can achieve a more frightening end: that of transforming the essence of humankind. Yet this is precisely where Orwell takes the reader. Smith's nemesis O'Brien notes, \\"The command of the totalitarians was 'Thou shalt.' Our command is 'Thou art.'\\" While this book is an excellent call to political and intellectual vigilance, the day government controls our essence as humans is the day government merits consideration as deity. Until then, I remain thankful for my ability to think otherwise."},{"Title":"1984","review":"I have read Animal Farm before this one, and enjoyed it greatly. I was not disappointed by this book, despite my expectations being high. He presents quite an intriguing idea of a 1984 deprived of basic freedoms and livestyle that was very perceivable in the depths of 1948.That being said, the Kindle edition needs to be checked for continuity errors and proofread for spelling, grammatical, and punctuational errors."},{"Title":"1984","review":"It really doesn't make much sense to review a classic.

The dismal world of the \\"future\\" presented here is beyond belief but also seems within reach. Although it may seem to be a warning against communism (some of the elements are found in A Darkness at Noon - a true critique of the pogroms of Stalin), it is in fact a warning against excess that can occur in any government system.The foreward by T. Pynchon provides some insights, especially about the last chapter on newspeak, but be warned that it does provide spoilers."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Although I'll acknowledge that Shakespeare, Milton and Blake have been regarded as masters of the beautiful English language far longer, Eric Blair (aka George Orwell) is the undisputed master of twisting words into weapons of destruction, despair, and control.Much has been written and noted about \\"1984,\\" and I can't add much more insight to it other than we had a cat named Winston.I first read this novel in Grade 8, before I really could understand what it was about. Its powerful imagery captured my imagination, however. I have read it about once a year hence, marvelling at Orwell's mastery of the language. He predicted human nature very accurately, considering where things were going near the time of his death. It's a very bleak book, and has gotten even more terrifying since the advent of the internet, 24 hour cable news, ubiquitous cameras and televisions, background checks, fanciful government terminology, massive fearmongering, routine inspections, suppression of emotion, and global paranoia.The most terrifying thing of all is not that \\"1984\\" came true. It's HOW SOON it came true after Orwell penned it."},{"Title":"1984","review":"The vision of the Party's rule, its inhumanity and utter ruthlessness and mendacity frighten us and we hope it will never come to pass here. But we have no clue how to prevent it, and just like the people in Orwell's fictional world, we are perpetually caught off guard when it comes to pass in our own lives. One day we wake up and realize we are living in a nightmare, and we have been for a long time. \\"It'll never happen here\\" and \\"We've taken every precaution\\" become \\"When did it happen\\" and \\"How did we get to this point?\\" This perennial sickness takes hold of a nation and we are at its mercy.Like any good novelist, Orwell tells a story and he makes it real. For that sheltered portion of humankind who have had the fortune of growing up without the threat of being arrested and tortured for daring to disagree with their inept leaders, the book provides a vicarious experience without which we are left vulnerable to a disease we know nothing about. But while the creation of a literary world can teach us many things, it cannot provide a way out. For that we need accurate knowledge.1984 is a fictionalized account of pathocracy, as defined inPolitical Ponerology, and the reason it scares us is because it is completely outside our normal frame of reference. We have the same reaction to news accounts of senseless violence. Parents murdered by their 14-year-old son because they asked him to do his chores, after which he played video games. An 18-year-old woman disappears and is later found dead, beaten to death and wrapped in plastic. A trucker and his son admit to torturing a 20-year-old man in their basement, suffocating him and wrapping wire around his neck. A young boy is kidnapped, tortured, executed, and his organs harvested by forces of occupation before his body is returned to his parents.The common theme, of course, is psychopathy. Psychopaths lack conscience and hunger for the darkness. They are sadistic in a way which, for us, is near impossible to fathom. The evil which they bring is not unintended, as when we realize only after the fact that our actions have caused another harm. Instead, their lives are spent feeding on the misery that they inflict on others. Whether the sexual sadism of serial rapist-torturer, or the subtle draining of a \\"toxic co-worker\\" who uses you, abuses you, and wears you down until you lose all grip on reality. We may even ask in desperation, \\"What are you doing this to me?\\" The psychopath simply smirks. And in a world ruled by psychopaths we ask, \\"Why are you doing this to us?\\"1984 frightens us because psychopathy frightens us. The key feature of a pathocracy is that psychopaths influence the economic, military, political, and cultural agenda of a nation. Like chameleons, they mask themselves in the features of their surroundings. Within those parameters they stage dramas, creating a new reality according to their desires. And this reality is one of deception, terror, ruthless expansion and complete heartlessness.In the corporate world a psychopath gets ahead by destroying the careers of those who stand in his way, exploiting the work of others, starting rumors, creating conflicts. He always benefits from these, of course. A competitor falls out of favor. The psychopath is credited with the work of another. The bosses take his word over another who sees that he is a snake. An \\"enemy\\" finds herself without a job, blamed for something she didn't do. All the while the psychopath stage-manages. The man behind the curtain.In politics, the pawns are the people, the chessboard is the world stage. Strategic countries are invaded because of the \\"threat\\" they pose. This threat is 0f course created by the psychopaths in charge using the vast resources of intelligence services. \\"Terrorist threats\\" are fabricated. Atrocities are committed and then pinned on imaginary \\"terrorist groups\\". Orwell had it right. Emmanuel Goldstein was a creation of the Party. The bombings blamed on him and his followers committed by the Party itself for the purpose of keeping the population afraid and compliant.Today, torture photos are \\"leaked\\" not to expose State brutality, but to show the people what happens to those who oppose the system. After all, you're either \\"with us\\" or you're \\"with the terrorists\\". That's some option. Dissent is conflated with terrorism. Terrorists are tortured and assassinated. The President of the United States even sanctions the assassination of U.S. citizens labeled \\"terrorists\\". \\"They are part of they enemy\\", after all. Some respond with shock that a country could willingly kill its own citizens, as if killing another country's citizens is any more human. Of course, the two options are equally atrocious, but to a psychopath, what's the difference? If you have a conscience, you are a threat. Your leaders hold you in as much disdain as any other \\"bleeding heart\\".So what can be done? The first step is awareness of the reality of what goes on behind the scenes of political power: the workings of intelligence agencies, counterterrorism, foreign policy groups, etc. This can only be understood by applying ponerology, which identifies the source of the problem, and the exact social and psychological processes which push along the global pathocratic agenda. Psychopaths have been running the show for a long time, and they've been doing so because we haven't known what to look for. Commies, terrorists, Nazis, anarchists... All red herrings.The true enemy hides in plain sight."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Let me say, I am 13 years old (everyone says i act like im 50) and this book was an unbeleivable of what society is coming to.

In this modern world it seems almost impossible to elude video-cameras, microphones and other elements of this sort. If the government wants to watch you they all ready have the means to due so. In our schools we are being taught only half truths to every major conflict with other world powers. For example go to Vietnam and they're musuems and history books have a whole other perspective on the vietnam war, but how are school children to know this other perspective. So in a way the U.S. is actually rewriting history. Also the press seems to rule our lives they tell us whats cool, whats not, how to act, and how to think. What is to stop them from crossing the line. We are given the false myth that they work for us; when in fact every thing you here is edited by certain people to portray certain messages to you. For example, everytime we see a third world country on TV all we see is poverty and starvation, what you dont see is the millions of people in that country that are doing fine , given you the false pretense that life here in America is sooooo much better.

What's that all about, this is 1984 we're talking about here! This book is THE scariest and most thought provoking tome around. From the first sentence of the book, &quot;The bells struck thirteen as Winston Smith, yada yada yada&quot; we're thrust into a completely different world, one so different and alien from our own, yet presented to the reader in such a painstaking, logical fashion as to raise questions about the state of our own modern society and the conventions of war and class structure. The society consists of two constantly warring nations: Atlantia and Oceana, embattled in a constant state of warfare which neither can afford to stop, their constant bickering and cosmetic bombings and attacks merely a mutually beneficial ploy to keep the masses in a constant state of shock, making them even more vulnerable to the intense psychological programming they undergo at the hands of the state. Big Brother, the party's exalted leader, is the unquestioned benefactor/leader of the people and is worshipped and feared. No one's lives are private. People are stripped of their individuality, kept placated and half drunk, and bombarded with government propaganda through the large, two-way telescreens in every party member's home. The sex drive is all but obliterated, through forced marriage and sex is only tolerated for procreational purposes. Even the language has been shortened, reduced in words by the govt. in an effort to shorten...look, I could go on and on here, I'm dying to just copy the whole book here so you can read it right now, but I've only got 1000 words. Look, it's Orwell's masterpiece, it's as relevant today as any book in the world, a scary reminder of the power govt. and the herd mentality of the average person, two variables that could result in the kind of scary, postapocalyptic world he invisioned, even though we have sucessfully made it well beyond 1984 on our calenders, Orwell's chillingly believable nightmare still rings out as a warning cry to the human race, made all too scary by the fact that many of the books conventions, for instance, the govt's ability to observe everyone by camera, 24 hours a day, seven days a week, are a realistic possibility now, with the advent of cheap videocamera technology. The story exists on another level in the love story told of Winston, the everyman antagonist and Julia, a pretty young woman who holds a strange hold on him and introduces him to love for the first time in his life. Their coupling is the supreme act against Big brother and the party, yet they continue to meet in secret and profess their love for one another. Love itself is a crime, and the couple on not only scared that the so-called &quot;thought police&quot; might catch them, but KNOW the inevitablility of the consequences regarding their act before it even takes place, with the first knowing glance of their eyes, the deed is done, convention be damed, they commit their Lovecrime and are, for a time, the only truly free people in all of Oceana.

In Winston Smith we have the representative of all of us - he isn't a genius, and he isn't a saint; and he doesn't want ot be a genius or a saint, he just wants to lead his life in the way he, and the rest of human society, was meant to do; in relative freedom in his actions and his thoughts. And the story of his personal struggle, his betrayal, his ultimate defeat is so timeless, so true that it, more than anything else in the book (although the whole novel is brilliant, eg. the political ideas expressed in it are so carefully thought out that we can truly believe in the potential for a party like, well, the Party), marks &quot;1984&quot; out as one of the most moving and human stories around."},{"Title":"1984","review":"a personification of the human spirit. after reading of the living death portrayed by the author, i realized that the man sentenced to life enprisonment has liberties unbound. to conceive the perils of this novel, is to enjoy life."},{"Title":"1984","review":"This is one of the greatest literary works of all times. This book tells of man's dreams, hopes, ambitions, and, most importantly of all, his true self. To those that believe a better world is bound to come, you are fools. This book says the true ending. I cannot figure out but two epitaphs for man: nuclear war or 1984. But why, you might ponder? Because this book depicts the most cruel, vicious, and realistic side of man: the side where communism and fascism are tied together so that the forces of darkness march through the earth (taken from &quot;The Last Crusade&quot;). This masterpiece is the bible of man. All that is in this book is plausible and much of it has happened although these real-life happenings where sugary compared to this book's omen. Goebbels's and Hitler's propaganda machine is depicted in this book, as is Stalin's, Hitler's and America's secret police. And in the book's 5 main slogans lies the truth of man.

Orwell's image of life in the future shows through in our true life. Big Brother is our government. A government that constantly watches us and moniters us.

DOWN WITH BIG BROTHER!"},{"Title":"1984","review":"People always talk about books that they can't put down and 1984 is defenitly one of those books. You really feel scared for Winston throughout the entire story. It made me cringe all the times where he was sneaking around.

The story follows Winston, as he tries to discover the truth of the world he lives in.What he learns is startling. The three countries of the world are constantly at war. Always switching alliances and fighting over the same territories. There is no truth in the past. Every person is taught the method of \\"doublethink\\". The method of doublethink is this, you are told something is true and has always been that way. Your mind accepts what it is told and rejects the memory of the truthful past.Every second, of everyone's life is carefully watched and scrutinized for those who commit \\"thought crime\\". Where you are discontent or you have rebellious feelings. Once you commit thought crime, you are made to disappear.In conclusion, I feel you should read this book, 1984.

Go read it."},{"Title":"1984","review":"George Orwell is right. He has always been right and will always be right. This novel, 1984, shows a scary, terror-filled world where everyone is a potential enemy. Before 9/11 this stood as an important piece of British 20th Century fiction; now it is a must read for all because it is hard to know where the fiction ends and the \\"true\\" narrative begins."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Orwell wrote one of the great classics of the 20th century. The book is centered in a dystopian society. While it is a mockery of any totalitarian system (mainly the Stalinist-era Soviet Union?), it also predicted some of the horrors of capitalist countries. Not only does Orwell write some serious political philosophy in his work (e.g. how the lower class will always reamin in the same situation regardless of the current regime), he also shows a different side of human nature that is at once dark, calculating and mistrusting. But there is some hope in the book. There are few writers who can compare to Orwell, both in his writing style as well as his insightful content. This book is a true classic in every sense of the word."},{"Title":"1984","review":"It is easy to see why Orwell envisioned the world he did in 1948; the year he wrote the immortal \\"1984.\\" The world was already in fact, engulfed in a period of total warfare. (Many historians now consider WWI & WWII to be a single event - a first and second act, if you will, of the most deadly struggle in the history of the earth, with a cooling down period or intermission, in between...).Even WWII never actually resulted in any kind of resolution or conclusion, but rather, settled into an uneasy \\"truce\\" involving a new confrontation that rose out of the ashes of post-war Europe and Asia, between Soviet Russia, China, and their communist allies, and the United States, and (what remained) of western powers - namely, France & Britain.The events of Korea were looming large and the cold war was about to get very hot, played out on the stage of the Korean Penninsula. Framed as a \\"UN intervention\\" supporting South Korea against invasion from the North, the Korean war was less than a year away when \\"1984\\" was first published: an event that was nothing short of a direct military confrontation between the United States and China and the Soviet Union which nearly became WWIII.Moreover, a substantial percentage of the world's population was already under the direct control (China & USSR), or at the very least, the yoke (North Korea, Mongolia, Eastern Europe, etc.,) of oppressive, bloody supreme dictatorships led by cult-of-personality leaders in Mao and Stalin.Meanwhile, American Democracy faced its greatest crisis since the Civil War, during the Korean conflict. General MacArther - a figure beloved by the American people of an almost \\"God-like\\" status challenged President Truman by publicly advocating the use of nukes against China and escalating Korea into an all-out war with the Communists.In the ensuing showdown the American people and press sided with MacArthur, villainizing Truman. As we all know, MacArthur, dismissed by Truman, stepped down and peacefully abdicated his position. In retrospect, the wisdom of Truman's policy was obvious, but fortunatley for all the world, the maligned president, Truman - despite the frightening times - kept his sanity, stuck to his guns, and made the politically unpopular decision of keeping Korea an isolated conflict and standing up to MacArthur...If not for Truman (and MacArthur's decision to obey the Commander and Chief), it is frightening to imagaine just how close the world Orwell predicted could've come to fruition.Orwell's analysis and predictions of the fate of human nature, society, and politics contained in 1984 are absolutely piercing and frightening. This book should be required reading (where it isn't already) in U.S. high schools and universities (or for that matter, the world's educational institutions). Orwell teaches us, in shocking, disturbing prose, that the freedoms and liberties that we all take for so much granted everyday, are much more precarious than we presume. Indeed, at times, their fate hangs in the balance. The price of protecting freedom and liberty depends on nothing less than the eternal vigilance of an informed, invested, and educated populace.1984, in my opinion, stands as the most important novel written in the 20th Century."},{"Title":"1984","review":"1984 by George Orwell was a fascinating, sad, and powerful read. It really provoked the reader to think, realize, and become aware of certain realities present in our world today. This book was written in 1949 and was Orwell's prediction, or fantasy, of what the world would be like in 1984. Although the story was a bit far-fetched and extreme, eye-opening parallels to some situations that our modern day world has faced can be seen. Oceania was always at war and constantly switched enemies and allies. It didn't matter who they were at war with so long as they were the dominating power in the world. I thought this correlation with Orwell's prediction was very true of the way our country runs. The book followed Winston as he tried to defy the government's complete control over the public. Little did he know that the power of Big Brother ran far deeper than he could have imagined. As citizens of the United States of America, I think it is important for us to read this book. We need to be aware of how easily people can be manipulated by a great power. This book presents that matter in an intricately woven story that really invokes a connection between the reader and the characters. The reader begins with great hope that Winston will be able to resist Big Brother's control but as the story progresses and hope diminishes, the reader begins to get a sense of reality and really wakes up to realize that once a large force is in motion, it can be unstoppable. 1984 by George Orwell is a must read."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Somehow I missed reading this in school, but always heard good things about it, so when I saw it lying around, I decided I should read it. I thought that the concepts in the book would be pretty interesting, but I didn't expect as much from the plot and characters.The world created by Orwell is very disturbing. The way the past is changed is especially frightening, along with the idea that thoughts can be changed by limiting the vocabulary needed to express them. I also thought the character of Winston Smith was very well written along with the plot as he becomes a thought criminal.The only thing I didn't like about the book was that it seemed like the Party would have an impossible job trying to keep up with the sheer volume of things that would constantly need to be changed in order to maintain whatever \\"reality\\" is current. Also, I couldn't see why anyone would really want to be a member of the Outer Party as opposed to one of the proles, who seemed to have a little more freedom. Finally, I never really understood the \\"why\\" of the Party, even when it was explained in the story, it didn't seem very appealing to me, at least not enough that everyone would be able to be brainwashed into maintaining it. However, I suppose if crimestop and doublethink and other concepts described in the book actually worked, then no one may have thought about these things enough to care.Overall, this is an excellent book that really makes you think about some pretty scary things. I definitely think this is a book worth reading."},{"Title":"1984","review":"It's absolutely amazing how a book that's truly innovative and insightful can remain completely relevant for such a long period of time.After items like the Patriot Act and the war in Iraq, you can't help but ask yourself questions about the government's responsibility in regards to your safety vs. your personal freedom.I can't possibly recommend this book highly enough. It's an incredibly important work that will change the way you look at the world.\\"The war is not meant to be won or lost. The war is meant to be continuous.\\""},{"Title":"1984","review":"I very much enjoyed 1984, by George Orwell. Orwell had a terrifying vision of the world we were gradually becoming in 1949. Though 1984 is long gone, his concerns can still be applicable today.Winston Smith is a lone character in a corrupt socialist society where you have no \\"friends\\", only \\"comrades\\". Smith knows there's something wrong, that he hates where he is. However, he feels he's all who understands. No one opposes the \\"Inner Party\\" without meeting certain death.There are rumors, rumors of a society called the \\"Brotherhood\\", a group that resists the Inner Party. After he comes across Julia, a woman that has the same discomforts as Smith, he then comes across the Brotherhood.Orwell does an outstanding job of addressing the faults of society and the path the government seems to be headed down. This is a timeless novel that will be enjoyed by generations to come."},{"Title":"1984","review":"1984 is a truly amazing book- probably the best I've ever read. Orwell keeps the reader interested from the very beginning by describing a world that is so different from our own, yet ironically it's a world we can all relate to. There is so much interesting detail on each page, you can ponder and debate every section of the book seemingly forever. From Winston's illegal diary in the corner of his room where he is hiding from the telescreen, to his torturous questioning in Miniluv where he is being brainwashed into thinking that two plus two is five, this is a superb book. Doubleplusgood."},{"Title":"1984","review":"As Orwell's 1984 is conventionally viewed as a &quot;political&quot; novel, it's value lies more in the deeper psychological meaning the book conveys, as Erich Fromm eloquently expounds in his afterword. More in this respect can the book be viewed as meaningful across both time and nation. It definitely is not just a novel for the disgruntled paranoids in our time and country as the political point of view might have it. As Fromm basically explains, the book is fundamentally an expression of the &quot;deepest alienation in the minds of organizational man&quot;. In light of that, you might say that Dilbert lovers would appreciate the book."},{"Title":"1984","review":"this book simply changed my view of things in life. it sucked me in after a few pages, and the reason i really like it is that he writes one of the most engaging plots, yet he still has relevant views. i love his ideas, and how he carries it all to the extreme. i am now reading &quot;Brave new world&quot; which, although has a different idea of the future is really similar. I first read I984 when i was 11, and since then have read it countless times. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who thinks they can handle a good read."},{"Title":"1984","review":"1984 would have to be one of the most intelligent, insightful novel I've ever read. It has a lot of major themes that we face today and because Orwell wrote this in the 40's, make makes it even more haunting. I would highly recommend this book to absolutely anyone. It is fantastic novel."},{"Title":"1984","review":"This book was a fightening read. It seems so preposterous, and yet it's all true and all possible. We have to wonder when, not if it will happen. As soon as you put the book down your own future becomes insecure. Not for the weak of mind or heart! It's not just literature, it's history."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Reading all the reviews has been fascinating! A great and deep book is somewhat like a Rorschach inkblot, allowing the reader to place their own personality and ideas atop it.1984 is part of the world's literary culture, something that is of value beyond the quality of the story and the writing. It's a satire, not a prophecy or prediction or a sci-fi novel. &quot;Satire has, as its prime purpose, not to comment or wound so much as to reform. It seeks to mock, or invert, or exaggerate with the intention, that by doing, idiocies may be corrected.&quot; (Stephen Murray-Smith) The fact that dictatorships, of a wide range of colors, are currently in something of a decline suggests that Orwell's efforts at reform are slowly working.There are many deep parts of the book. Orwell explores the psychological role of language and control of thought by language, something which seems to be an on-going experiment in the USA today. Despair, hopelessness, human frailty, human resilience, love, betrayal; Orwell deals with so many themes in this rich work.Yes, it is deeply disturbing, as good satire should be. Yes, we can see the parallels in our own societies and lives. That is as it should be. 1984 is not an action book, as action and excitement are anathema to control. Satire can be very hard and not very funny, and can take us time and a sense of history and society to grasp properly.It is good that the book is read in schools. You may not fully understand it at the time. Return to it over the years. It is a warning to our cultures and societies about possibilities, but you must understand something of societies and cultures to understand the book and its warnings fully. Let it be a guide to you, not a prescription."},{"Title":"1984","review":"THIS BOOKS WHICH WAS WRITTEN IN 1956 SHOWS HOW THE AUTHOR IMAGINED THE WORLD IN 1984. The story takes place in a strange world where you have to leave your TV on all the time.where you have to use the double mind to forget that the country is at war against one country one day and an other country another day.This world is a vision of what could be the world in 1984. Of course, we are quite far removed from that, but with webcams everywhere we can think we are not quite so far as it seems from this.That is why this book is so interesting because it is both near and far from us."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Orwell's classic book on thought control, mind control, body control and just about any kind of control you could think of, is a powerful book that many people hold in regards to as being prophetic. Time has passed and other realizations occur, however, this book still stands as a monument, not only in fiction, but in our understanding and use of technology as either entertainment or mass media awareness, ergo; programming. With Erich Fromm writing an afterword, which he cites many examples that displays different types of utopias/thought controlled societies, discussing the psychological aspects of a society that is shaped in such a way, reminiscing from his own book Escape From Freedom. A classic book in every way, and may best be appreciated with Huxley's Brave New World (confer Neil Postman's 'Amusing Ourselves To Death'). Highly reccomended in any study of literature."},{"Title":"1984","review":"I first read &quot;1984&quot; in Russian samizdat back in the USSR, and thought that the importance of this book will not survive the collapse of communism.

He introduced such words into our vocabulary as 'newspeak' and 'thoughtcrime' which have forever changed the way we look at government. No one who hasn't read 1984 can truly call themselves politically literate."},{"Title":"1984","review":"In a utopian society there is no pain. There is no disease, and there is no jealousy of any sort. What would happen if there would be no thought allowed too? Would not this eliminate pain, worries, and jealosy? Would it be chaos, or would it create the ultimate utopian society? In the city of Oceania, one man would dare to question the paradisiacal utopian society which was created. Winston Smith was alive during the glorious revolution, when Big Brother and the Brotherhood commandeered control. From then on, there were three basic rules: war is peace, freedom is slavery, and ignorance is strength. Big Brother was supreme. If you uttered a word against him, you would be vaporized, and erased from society. Who controls the present controls the present controls the past. Those who control the future controls the present. Winston needs to find a way to end the reign of Big Brother, and time is running out. The Thought Police are coming for him, and by the time he finds how to vanquish them, it may be too late."},{"Title":"1984","review":"1984 was for me the most interesting book I've read in 2000. Though the book is written in a time in which the political spectrum in the world was totally different, this book still has a high warning rate for everybody who is thinking that freedom, or better said, being free, is something that is well assured nowadays. The treath of being dominated by 'things', and not , is with the continuing rise of the technological influence in modern society still a great treath. Besides, we already have a Big Brother. The TV-program with the same name, which started in my home country, is now conquering the world. As if this program doesn't demonstrate the fact that we are about to loose our knowledge for making ethical decisions. 1984 is still a warning for everybody, and therefore highly recommendable."},{"Title":"1984","review":"George Orwell's horrific representation of Oceania, a world power and dominating force throughout the story, is a frighteningly realistic presentation of how governments work. Orwell displays the common theme of disinformation (called &quot;doublethink&quot;)used by government powers. Although 1984 has come and passed, the idea that governments can gain totalitarian control through complacent, uniterested citizens is not far from present conditions. 1984 is an excellent read, filled with wondrous insight for everyone."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Nineteen Eighty FourThe book nineteen eighty-four is a novel of fiction written by George Orwell in 1948. Orwell's book is set in the year 1984 and is an account given by the main character Winston smith. In the book we find the world is broken into three different governments (Oceania,Eastasia,and Euraisa), and that Smith is a citizen of Oceania. Oceania is ruled by a tyrannical form of government known as the Party, which is controlled by a dictator referred to as Big Brother. The Party is broken-up into several branches called ministry's, and Smith is employed at the Ministry of Truth, which falsifies any records that would hurt the reputation of the Party. So the society in which Smith is accompanied essentially believes everything they are told, what to do, say, believe, and so on. Smith however gains a conception that this is not right an that freedom is better than tyranny. This however is constituted as one of the most serious crimes in Oceania; it is referred to as thought crime. In this society people are punished for not believing what the government tells them even if what they proclaim is absolutely ridicules. For instance, that 2+2=5, and if there is no evidence either supporting or conflicting that, what they have said must be true. At the end of the book Smith is tortured for committing thought crime and eventually released virtually unable to think for himself. I believe, if there is anything we can take from Orwell's novel,it is that freedom is precious, and should not be taken lightly or for granted, and that we as Americans should never forget the price that our fore fathers paid to receive it."},{"Title":"1984","review":"This is one of those books that you here so much about before you have a chance to read it. It makes you seem to think that you know what to expect from cover to cover. You are flat out wrong. Yes, with an overbearing government and a subversive hero this work had me riveted and unable to put it down until I had read it twice. The book can also be likened to a modern day example of Machiacelli's &quot;Prince&quot; and had definite anarcho/commune supporting undertones. One of the members of the Inner Party takes the time to explain in detail how a political group can stay in power. The surreptitious &quot;Book&quot; explains all there is to know about class struggle and how to eliminate it. Fantastic as both a political and as a literary work."},{"Title":"1984","review":"To some up this book, it is a novel written about the future (1984) written in 1949. It is based on a fictional new world order that arose from the history of the world and especially world war I &amp; II. It is a deep look into what could happen if government gains too much control of our everyday lives. The suprising thing is that you can draw parrallels with many of the features of our modern lives. If youve heard the terms &quot;big brother&quot; and &quot;thought police&quot;, this is where they came from. I recommend this one it'll make you think twice about our lives of emails, cameras, political correctness...etc."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Set in the imaginary totalitarian state of Oceania, whose population is controlled in word, deed and thought of the Party, the menacing but unseen Big Brother, the Thought Police and all - pervading propaganda.

Animal Farm and 1984 are two of the best books I have ever read in my life."},{"Title":"1984","review":"A lot of schools assign this book to kids for their English classes. I wanted to point out that in a lot of ways, a person of that age can get more out of this book than someone of a more advanced age... High school is one of the times in life when conformity, and the perceived importance of fitting in, can be at their most intense, and their most frightening, as social forces. This book takes those ideas, those forces, and magnifies them by a thousand times. Think about how scary it would be if you literally had no libraries. And not only your town would have no libraries, but the WHOLE WORLD had all its records re-written every few years, so the adult version of the popular kids (&quot;The Party&quot; in this book) could tell everyone what to think, who to hate, who to like... I think this is a really terrific book to think over. In a funny way, a reader of that age might even want to compare it to Stephen King's &quot;Carrie&quot; -- in Stephen King's book, a lot of the background to the story is all about conformity, and how the good kids hate it, and some of the bad kids seem to use it as a sort of funnel for hatred, to funnel all that bad energy toward a few kids, to hurt them. I think in this book, Winston Smith could be seen as a parallel to Carrie (the character Carrie, not the book), only, unlike Carrie, he ends up breaking down in the end. This is not a fun, happy story, but I think a lot of kids would really respect themselves a lot more if they make themselves actually think about the story."},{"Title":"1984","review":"It is a classic for a reason.

This masterpiece novel works on so many levels, that I guess every reader would find something else in it. For me it deals with the basic and most important issues in life, society, government, wars, religion, education, brain-wash, the place of the individual, the hardship of being alone (physically and mentally), the concept of holding two contradictious thoughts at the same time, the position of the individual in history, the nothingness of being human, love, family, loyalty and betrayal, the instinct of any animal in nature to survive, and so much, much more. I read the book at least 5 times already, and find myself doing it every year or two.I'd also recommend everyone to watch the excellent movie adaption made in the year in question, starring John Hurt and Richard Burton, which I think is one of the best book adaptions made for cinema. While it can't contain all the levels and issues presented in the original book, it adds images and voices and makes the reading of the book extremely realistic."},{"Title":"1984","review":"a wonderful novel, makes you feel more secure and also more independent in this world.one of my favorite novels. definitely in my top ten of books I have read, I never get sick of it.a must have for any library.-winston"},{"Title":"1984","review":"The protagonist Winston Smith works as a minor member of the ruling Party in London, under the leadership of ubiquitous Big Brother, who has never been seen except on telescreens and posters which are hanging everywhere.

In it we find bland descriptions choreographed with a rhythmic, powerful force of language and an internalized graphic depiction of a mind on the brink of rebellion.It is false to claim that this is a 'probable future', as many of the issues and threats of the time of the prophecy have come and gone and been resolved by the evolution of society. But the meaning is lasting, regardless of your meaning of oppression.There tends to come a time in life when everyone feels oppressed, trapped by the state of the world and angered over their perceived restrictions. In the case of this novel the specifics of the dictatorship are agonizingly detailed, the interest maintained by Orewell's natural story-telling abilities and spectacular wit. But the meaning is meant to go deeper, filtering away the extremist exaggeration of the satirist and searching for clues in the muck of human nature.These issues are timeless and therefore the threat of 1984 will never likely go away. There will always be either a real or perceived oppressor and there will always be a basic human instinct to rebell. Nowhere is this principle more lucidly articulated than in 1984."},{"Title":"1984","review":"As an American, I enjoy freedoms that are alien to the majority of the world. If this had any effect on my life, it made me appreciate where and how I live my life. The book itself was very well written and entertaining. The beginning of the book was depressing to the point where I didn't want to read it, but as I progressed, I started to enjoy it. It was very difficult to emphasize with Winston because I cannot imagine the world he lives in. As I reflect on the book as a whole, I realize that it was more than worth my time to read. Every person who reads this book gets something different out of it, but I can guarentee if you read with interest you will get something out of it."},{"Title":"1984","review":"I think that George Orwell's 1984 is one of the most interesting works of literature I have ever read. Orwell uses this interesting story to warn people about the dangers of a socialist government, and the extremes that it could go to if it went in that direction. In this extreme example of totalitarianism, the government can watch your every move, control the past, and even restrict what you think. He uses superb insight, and makes it really interesting by going deep into the psyche of the main chatacter, Winston Smith. I greatly enjoyed my reading experience with this novel. I would definately reccomend this book to anyone who wants a novel that will make them think, and who is not afraid to question their opinions about the truth. If you are looking for a quick read that wont make you look to deep, dont try this one. This is one of those books where you have to take rests and comprehend what youre reading, especially at the end. The beginning of the book was a little slow, and a bit repetitive, but towards the end it really picks up and gets very interesting. Once I got into the last 50 pages, I absolutley could not put it down. The last part of the book was packed full of suspense and action, even if the end was a little depressing. The story, about a man and the woman he loves who are trying to rebel against their oppressive government, gives you glimmers of hope throughout the novel. Sometimes you truly believe that they can overcome the oppression of a government that doesn't let them feel normal human emotions or think for themselves. However, in the end I was left with a slight feeling of despair and lonliness. Even so, I am very glad that I read this book. No other book I have ever read has made me think more about what our perception of truth really is, or a government's ability to take away mans right to think and act like an individual person. This book brings up so many interesting issues, and it makes you ask yourself questions that you usually wouldn't think about. If something happens a certain way, but there's no records of it, and noone remembers it that way, did it really happen like that? Can a government take away a persons right, or ability to think for themselves? Is it possible to change history by changing the documents? Read this book and decide for yourself!"},{"Title":"1984","review":"THe Party dominate all aspects of life and Big Brother is everywhere with cameras and microphones.

The afterword on this edition is quite interesting too."},{"Title":"1984","review":"As an avid reader, time and time again I'm asked what my favorite book is. I remember I had to read 1984 for a school assignment, and if I had known the first thing about it BEFORE being assigned the reading, I would have read it anyway.Time and time again I answer these folks that 1984 is one of my all-time favorite novels, as it offers some frighteningly real and chillingly recognizable flaws found in society, that, if not ammended, will result in utter destruction.Orwell's foretelling of that negative utopia is brilliantly portrayed. Even if you're not an avid reader - or don't consider yourself to be - read this book anyway - it's not difficult reading.And with the countless allusions encountered in daily life, you'll be a better person for it."},{"Title":"1984","review":"George Orwell's 1984 was a wonderful book. His style of writing was so unique and believeable. Orwell creates an elaborate future (which is now our past) which is perfectly plausable. It is an utterly frightening representation of what could be; a government which controls the people under them even in their personal lives. They are intimidated into submission. A beautifully phrased portrait of horrifying circumstances. While I could not put it down. It absolutely intrigued me. Already it has become one of my favorites. I could even relate parts of it to my life.I'd reccommend this book to anyone who is thinking about - both young and old. It is a wonderful piece of literature. I know that I'll be reading it again. For the full message of this work is something that deserves to be read twice.Five stars."},{"Title":"1984","review":"I sat down to read George Orwell's novel on a Tuesday night while my family had dinner in the next room. For the following few hours, their dinner conversation was interrupted with my bursts of anger and frustration. \\"How can you call the destruction of words beautiful?!\\" I cried. Orwell writes so convincingly that it frightens the reader into thinking, \\"What if Oceania really existed in that form? How could I break free from the oppression, the mindlessness, the fear and anger that surrounds all aspects of life?\\" It creates a level of paranoia, especially since there is no happy ending. The main character, Winston, is never freed from the bondage of being brainwashed and held captive in his own mind. For if we are not free to think, we are not free at all. However, I think Orwell succeeds best in terrifying us to the point that we are sure to count our blessings and be sure not to take for granted the beauty of words, thoughts, and freedom."},{"Title":"1984","review":"George Orwell has another hit. Animal Farm was only a glimpse at his intellectual genius. This story takes you on a carefully regulated emotional rollercoster. You will go from intense shock to indignation for the characters involved. This small glimpse into what Orwell considered to be our inevitable future has left me with a strong sense of denial. Everything from the telescreen that watches your every move to the mere thought of a &quot;thought Police&quot; force gave me the shivers. There are several interesting implications for example the use of a term called &quot;doublethink&quot; which implies that people can hold two contradictory thoughts in their heads at the same time and beleive them both to be true. overall this book was an amazing peice of work, there was never a time that i put it down unless i had to. i would definitely recommend this to any person who wants to take their mind for a ride."},{"Title":"1984","review":"George Orwell is a master of the English language, his superb style of writing and the intensity of the story is sustained throughout.The novel covers a timeless issue. Orwell attempts to shock us with the extremities that exist in a totalitarian society whose ultimate purpose is to obtain power. Perhaps these issues, as mentioned in the afterthought, are relevant in areas apart from totalitarianism. Perhaps capitalism is also a class distinction where money is representative of power.These and other issues are covered, proving Orwell's brilliant writing genius."},{"Title":"1984","review":"George Orwell had my attention from the first to last page of his novel 1984. 1984 is a fascinating and mind-inducing novel. The story of Winston Smith's struggle through life in Oceania is extremely captivating and thought provoking. Orwell's sharp, detailed descriptions paint an image of an unforgettably unique society. His story is a detailed description of a man living in the worst case scenario communistic society. Orwell's ideas and images are extremely brilliant. His extreme communist society brainwashes their citizens to become emotionless, violent, and thoughtless. I was mesmerized by the way the society dehumanized its citizens. People had no freedom what so ever. The concept of people having the inability to think, loves, and express themselves is engaging. I found 1984 to be an extremely thrilling novel, I recommend it to anyone interested in a classic and contemplative piece of literature."},{"Title":"1984","review":"I really enjoyed 1984 by George Orwell. I thought Orwell really captured what a dictatorship can do to a country. Big Brother was obviously a \\"parody\\" of some infamous dictators of the world (Stalin, Hitler). It was also very interesting to see how Winston acted. He was not a pure outsider, who is only trying to help his fellow countrymen. He is actually a true rebel. His actions, his dreams, his thoughts of sex and his readings of books are all signs of the rebellious actions of an outsider of the government. But, in contrast to Orwell's great portrayal of the rebellious Winston, is his lack of depth when it comes to Julia. She seems to be only into the rebellious act of sex, and that is about it for her. She is otherwise pretty subservient to men. And, I loved the ending simply because tragedy, or just an unhappy ending, is always an interesting way to end a story. I thought the way Orwell had Winston captured, tortured, and then having him turn into a supporter of Big Brother, all through the double cross from O'Brien made it a brilliant way to end the book."},{"Title":"1984","review":"I thought the book 1984 was great. It really made me think about weather or not I was pro Big Brother or con Big Brother. At the end of the book I decided to diagree with Big Brother. It is too powerful and controling.

A radical political party, simply called the Party, had taken control of life in Oceania. Its citizens had no choice but to mindlessly follow the reign of terror. Winston and his lover, Julia, banded together to secretly revolt against the Party's authority. Orwell's 1984 is a disturbing warning, forcing people to examine the freedoms they take for granted. This book is a haunting shadow of what may have been. Although the novel was lengthy, it is interesting, thought-provoking, and worth the time.

However, the huge essay from &quot;The Book&quot; would have served better outside of the story, as a companion book.

Although, I didn't like the end, I must say it was a lot better than many books in this &quot;future gone wrong&quot; genre."},{"Title":"1984","review":"One of the most unbelieveable books I've ever read! This shows what will happen if we keep allowing our dependence on government to grow and keep electing DEMONcRATS."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Overall, a very interesting story..However, I found some parts super-cheesy - some parts of the book, some phrases written by the author seemed to be written with the intent of making some super-deep, human, philosophical point. For my taste, the author too clearly delivers these points...doesn't leave enough of the wrenching analysis and thought formation to the reader. Some points are so blatantly delivered I couldn't help but cringe, look away from the text, and say &quot;ohh man...&quot;.Not nearly as elegant as Huxley in Brave New World."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Like with Brave New World, 1984 is and inside look to the Progressive Collectivist mindset. Again, all the concepts are there: collectivism, propaganda, control, government as God. Big Brother has arrived."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Orwell's most well-known novel may have changed the English language, but that doesn't save it from being a somewhat overrated work of fiction.First, the positives: Orwell is an excellent writer as such - the prose is perfectly fine, transparent, and readable. His critique of Soviet language-terrorism (the &quot;newspeak&quot; of the novel) is dead-on. There are moments of great tension, and the atmosphere of terror is effectively maintained throughout.However, the prose can also be pretty bland, and Orwell can't resist the urge to get overly didactic to make some of his points (take, for example, the interrogation, which sometimes reads more like a propoganda pamphlet than a novel). His characters are dull at best - and as his ironies get more sadistic, they lose all interest. He's so desperate to make his point that it becomes overkill.But in the end, the major failing is that Orwell denies the novel any humanity, or any sense of human warmth. In a novel that is supposed to serve as a warning about the cold regimentation of society, we need an author who's not guilty of the same cold, formulaic approach as the society as he criticizes - otherwise the whole point is undermined. If mental, emotional, and physical freedom are really the powerful (and playful) forces Orwell claims they are, then we as readers need to feel this - but Orwell is incapable of cracking a smile. As D.H. Lawrence said of Melville: &quot;One wearies of the grand serieux. There's something false about it... Oh dear, when the solemn ass brays! brays! brays!&quot;It's not simply a matter of form following fuction (bland prose for a bland society): I'd highly recommend reading Zamyatin's novel &quot;We&quot;, which - let's face it - Orwell practically ripped off. The key difference is that Zamyatin allows those things like humor, love, and playfulness to sneak in through the cracks... before they're crushed by the totalitarian state around them. While Orwell delivers a &quot;message,&quot; Zamyatin delivers a novel. You'll be surprised how much more effective, moving, infuriating, and clever Zamyatin's approach is, why Orwell borrowed so much from it, and why 1984 pales in comparison.So: read it for entertainment, if you enjoy dystopian literature. Its influence has been enormous, and there are things to enjoy. But feel free to laugh at Orwell's pretentions: it's your right."},{"Title":"1984","review":"George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four creates a nightmarish regime of totalitarian terror in which the protagonist, Winston Smith, lives an uncomfortable and fearful existence under the watchful eye of a seemingly benevolent despot known as 'Big Brother' and his infamously brutal 'Thought Police'. The novel conveys its themes and ideas by providing an insight into the life and mind of Smith, a secret rebel working in the propaganda department of Big Brother's omnipotent 'Party' - a tyrannical political organisation that also encompasses the middle and upper classes of the entire society. It is a story in the genre of classic science fiction novels that delineate the plight of individuals who seek freedom from the oppression of futuristic authoritarian dystopias; most notably Aldous Huxley's &quot;Brave New World&quot;, Ray Bradbury's &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot;, and Anthony Burgess's &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot;. Like the authors of these other famous books George Orwell was influenced by the physical and ideological struggles that characterised the two World Wars of the 20th Century; inspiring his rational philosophies and views on the political concepts of nationalism, socialism, communism and fascism. As a result the totalitarian terror and intense ideological debate invoked by the text does not make for light reading, but the novel is an acknowledged literary masterpiece that is recommended to all mature readers."},{"Title":"1984","review":"I've had to do alot of reading this year for my AP English class, and this is one of the best books I've read so far.

I would recommend this book to anyone and everyone, especially if you like to read about what man's future could be."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Anybody who sees 1984 as simply an attack on Bolshevism and Fascism is missing the point, for Orwell was attempting to show his readers what totalitarianism would look like in Britain and/or the United States if forces and trends already in motion in the late 40s and early 50s were to go unchecked.... Folks, Old George was quite the prophet, because the Inner Party (with virtually all of the wealth and political power in the nation) , The Outer Party (with their 401k, Toyota Camrys, and houses in the suburbs), and the Proles (doing the underpaid grunt-work, their minds numbed to reality by sports and popular culture) all exist today in America.

The story is told from Winston&#8217;s perspective as he falls in love with Julia, which is forbidden as all devotion must be reserved to the Party. He also has an unusually warm relationship with an Inner Party member by the name of O&#8217;Brien who turns out to be Winston&#8217;s ultimate antagonist as he represents the Party in his every action. The reason that this book is such a timely piece of literature for today is that the world around us is going through dramatic changes in its structure. None of us could know where this cycle will lead, but Orwell provides us with a nightmare of where the tide of history and government could come to rest and how an average man may live and feel under such conditions.While this does not naturally appear as a love story, it does actually take an important look at a dark side of love and devotion. The Party demands more than absolute obedience; it demands the love of every subject. Even to the degree that no other love interest can be maintained. It is a very religious theme, similar to what you might hear during a Sunday morning sermon or straight from the Bible, &#8220;Anyone who loves his father or mother more than Me [Jesus] is not worthy of Me&#8221; (Matthew 10:37, New International Version). Winston&#8217;s love for Julia is ultimately the reason that Winston is tortured mercilessly and his love for her is what is used to finally break his will at the climax of his incarceration in the Ministry of Love.Winston also maintains a curious relationship with the stories antagonist, O&#8217;Brien, throughout the story. Early in the story, the two of them share a glance which indicates to Winston that they have similar interests regarding the overthrow of the current system. As it turns out, O&#8217;Brien has been working throughout the book to entrap him and presumably anyone else who might be caught up in ideas of overthrow. He is ultimately Winston&#8217;s interrogator, torturer and re-educator. However, even as he is being horribly tortured, Winston continues to hold a very high regard for O&#8217;Brien as he notes, &#8220;The peculiar reverence for O&#8217;Brien, which nothing seemed able to destroy, flooded Winston&#8217;s hear again&#8221; (Orwell, 1949, p. 225). Winston would go on to betray Julia, but would never lose his admiration for O&#8217;Brien.Orwell&#8217;s story takes the idea of &#8220;big government&#8221; to its most extreme conclusion. The story is particularly timely in a day when our own nation has clearly voted in recent months for a larger, more intrusive federal government. America has shifted over the years from larger to smaller, less regulated government and back again throughout our history. However, it is interesting that Orwell gives an idea of how one party was able to stop the pendulum from swinging by ensuring that average people were stopped from obtaining wealth. Orwell (1949) uses the following passage to describe the process used to obtain total control of the society: &#8220;It was possible, no doubt, to imagine a society in which wealth in the sense of personal possessions and luxuries, should be evenly distributed, while power remained in the hands of a small privileged caste&#8230;In the long run, a hierarchal society was only possible on a basis of poverty and ignorance&#8221; (p. 156).In the end, Winston is a beaten man who has failed to stand up to the power of Big Brother in any way. His character represents the limitations of the individual against an all powerful government. His mind is coerced and his love confused. The Party has done with him as it has with all others and will continue to do. And the story concludes with no hope for a positive resolution. This is a story which should be read by everyone to ensure an understanding of the evil capable of a powerful government.REFERENCE:Orwell, G.

In fact, it'd be much less of a leap than it would have been in 1949, when this book was published. Read this book. When you're done, ask yourself, \\"is the world around me getting less like 1984, or more so?\\" Then ask yourself, \\"what are the chances that that pattern will change?\\" Keep an eye on the world around you, lest one day it keep an eye on you..."},{"Title":"1984","review":"If you want a book that you can relate to life today this is a great selection.

It would be helpful to understand some of the different political movements that are brought up in the book and their foundations. Try to examine capitalism, socialism, facism, and communism.

It is a story about negative utopia, where the people behind Big Brother believe they have created the perfect world, where there are no freedoms. Heck, one of their three slogans is &quot;Freedom is Slavery.&quot; the others are &quot;War is Peace&quot; and &quot;Ignorance is Strength.&quot; The lead character is Winston Smith, who has been one such human who has lived both in this new &quot;perfect&quot; world and in the world of the past, where everyone lived in peace, where they were not watched 24 hours in a day, where their THOUGHTS were still a private issue. He thinks he can remember back where life was lived how anyone wanted to live it, but no one around him believes him. How can this be? There is no past. Ironically, Smith even works in the Ministery of Truth, where he is among the many who receive newspaper clippings and other data which he must rewrite to make it look like Big Brother is controlling the people perfectly. If there is a shortage of crops? Winston merely writes in that the years previous crop yield was less than the current years, so the yield is no longer a shortage, but a surplus. Rearranging the past trickles down to the roots of Big Brother, where with a simple eraser, people easily believe that Big Brother life is much better and offers even more freedoms than the life people had been living in the past. It is up to Winston Smith to change this view, find some evidence that life before Big Brother was more peaceful. A truly must read for lovers of any genre, eaily one of my all time favorites. It took over a couple pages for me to realize that I was hooked. Not only does orwell offer us a look into his version of the future, but in turn offers us an incredible ending, with a shocking last four words."},{"Title":"1984","review":"&quot;1984&quot; is more or less what awaits us at some point in the future, I believe. In this prophetic novel, George Orwell shows us a future world under strict totalitarian rule, without freedom or democracy, where nothing is allowed and any offense is severely punished, where everyone is under surveillance, and there is no privacy, no freedom, only mandatory obedience to state police control and government authority.David Rehakauthor of &quot;A Young Girl's Crimes&quot;"},{"Title":"1984","review":"One of my favorite books of all time, George Orwell's masterpiece is well worth the money.

Finally wehave the articulation of pure hell where a human beingis likened to a cockroach . . . watched, forever, watched."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Even though George Orwell was a socialist he chronicled totalitarian socialism in this book and he like most socialists did not realize that is exactly where all socialism ends up and is where we are all headed.He coined things like big brother is watching you, newspeak, thoughtcrime and doublethink...and thoroughly goes over what a socialist society does to language to limit thought, and the ability to discuss any idea in order to stop treats to its self or even simple changes much less a full revolution.Have you noticed all the cameras the government (Big brother) is putting up all over the last 10 to 15 years?"},{"Title":"1984","review":"While 1984 is now considered a cautionary tale about totalitarianism, it should be remembered that Orwell was an ardent socialist. Perhaps the most important (and least discussed) element of the story of 1984 is the doublethink of its author: Orwell's ability to condemn an outcome, while advocating its cause. Even as Orwell portrayed the corruption of socialist government in Animal Farm and the cruelty of totalitarian government in 1984, he insisted that these are perversions of socialism, rather than the inevitable fruit of socialism.This is the same foolish idea as Marx had; that human nature is malleable and can be forced to adapt to a socialist zeitgeist. Sadly, many people suffer the same delusion today; believing that government has the right to mold human nature rather than the responsibility to yield to human nature and respect our natural rights. Socialists do not like that human nature opposes slavery (i.e. socialism) and insist that with enough socialist indoctrination and through the force of socialist government, human nature can be remade to love subjugation.When we look to the troubling conclusion, it appears to be a break from the tradition of a successful resolution for the hero of the novel. Just as Brave New World ended with the State purging its misfits from its midst, 1984 ends with the arrest and reeducation of its misfit. Could it be that this was a successful conclusion in the mind of a socialist? Could it be that socialists are so wedded to their ideology that they have lost the ability to sympathize with human rights to liberty and freedom of conscience and would rather sympathize with the State? What if the ending reveals that the hero of a socialist novel was never meant to be the individual; is the hero in fact the State?"},{"Title":"1984","review":"Classic book, should be read by everyone, a cultural keystone of the 20th century."},{"Title":"1984","review":"It was sad reading this book because more and more of Orwell's fiction is becoming reality with each passing day (with people gladly surrendering their freedom for feelings of \\"security\\" since September 11, 2001).By reading all the reviews, a prospective reader will know who Winston Smith is, what he does for a living, what got him into \\"trouble\\" with the Party, etc. But what one can't grasp from these reviews is seeing what Winston goes through in his \\"re-education,\\" that is his brainwashing in order to toe the Party line again.I never suspected old Mr. Charrington as a member of the Thought Police (who set Winston up from the door) and his \\"comrade\\" O'Brien was a real piece of work. While in the Ministry of Love, when O'Brien told Winston that his mind was like his only Winston was insane, I thought, \\"How delusional we are.\\" But, then again, \\"What can you do...against the lunatic who is more intelligent than yourself, who gives your arguments a fair hearing and then simply persists in his lunacy.\\" (page 234)So many of the things that Orwell wrote in 1949 have turned into fact. The far right religious and political folks have used \\"1984\\" as their blueprint for absolute and total hatred (whether intentional or not). One of the requirements of being in the Party is that a member was prohibited from learning foreign languages or having any contact with a foreigner at any time (other than to see them rolled by as prisoners). Maybe that's because \\"If he were allowed contact with foreigners he would discover that they are creatures similiar to himself and that most of what he has been told about them is lies.\\" (page 174)This should be required reading for everyone and a blueprint on how to reject an absolute dictatorship bent on complete mind control and historical alterations."},{"Title":"1984","review":"So I guess after Suzanne Colins wrote The Hunger Games a bunch of other people decided to write reality show books because they wanted to make lots of money too. And this is one of them. Big Brother is a show where a bunch of hot people live in a house together and hook up all the time. Like \\"jersey shore,\\" only they are trapped in the house and no beach. But in the book which I guess got taken from Big Brother show, its like a countrywide reality show and everyone is trapped in the country which instead of Jersey Shore is called Oceania so I guess its set in Australia or something? But the idea doesn't change. Everybody wants to stay in teh country and not get taken to a little room called 101. In the mean time people talk really wierd because its the future even though the book is 1984 which was like 30 years ago. Way before I was born. So why do they make us read it in school? Like none of it actualy happened even though I don't remember the 80's.What I didn't get about the book is why people don't just say whatever Big Brother wants them too so they can stay out of room 101. Like you have to say that two and two are five, and red and blue make orange, but you have to actually believe it which is really confusing. Even though his girlfriend Julia says they should just make stuff up like the government wants, winston who is the main character tries to start a rebelion. he just ends up getting attacked by giant rats or something.

However, then, as now, I think many people miss the point. Orwell wrote 1984 as a commentary on the contemporary issues of his time. The only way he felt he could do this was to project it into the future, hence the date \\"1984\\". The political oppression, the control of our minds, the hopelessness of the masses, and their eventual capitulation to \\"BIG BROTHER\\" were in existence then, and are in existence now. Who can doubt it, when you listen to the political \\"DOUBLESPEAK\\" that we get from our \\"BIG BROTHER\\" today? As you go about your day today, and especially this PAYDAY, reflect on the doublespeak concept \\"LESS IS MORE\\". Perhaps that will enable you to get through another week, or month, or maybe more. And, if you start to feel that you are being singled out for suffering, and how unique you and your situation ARE, think of another Orwellian concept, paraphrasing a little from his work \\"ANIMAL FARM\\"; all of us are UNIQUE, but some are MORE unique than OTHERS!MICHAEL"},{"Title":"1984","review":"I know that some of you might be high school readers looking to give a book report and scouring the reviews trying to find some nuggets on which to base your report. A lot of these reviews do look like book reports don't they? This book is hard to appreciate in high school. It has many layers and really stretches the reader (which is why they want you to read it in high school - to stretch). Anyway, I will add my two cents to the 1000+ reviews already here.This book paints a dark picture of the future (even though 1984 is past us, it still paints our future) as we go torward more government control and intervention. The book forces us to ask serious questions - how far are we willing to go? What role does freedom play? What does freedom mean? Orwell's masterpiece - though Animal Farm is also a good one."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Orwell is gifted at making us believe this futuristic society.

However, the betrayal of ideology, mass murder and abuses by Stalin in the name of socialism prompted Orwell to write _1984_: a brilliant satire and a classic of 20th century literature.In the future, there is the one state, ruled by &quot;Big Brother&quot;, an allegedly benevolent ruler who is rather sinister. Obedience is demanded, subjects are not even allowed the freedom of thought. All labor and effort is geared towards the &quot;greater good&quot;, in a totally egalitarian society that is as stifling as it is sterile.Written as a criticism of Stalinism and the Soviet system, its biting criticism is testament to the extremes of ideology. While it is an easier read than the earlier Soviet work by Eugene Zamiatin's _We_, I feel _We_ is the better book. Nonetheless, 1984 is worthy of a reading."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Many readers have trouble digesting books that are commonly accepted as classics. Books written many years ago often times fail to resonate with the modern reader. 1984, a book more than 50 years old, is a true classic that anyone can enjoy.Unlike many accepted classics, this is not regal, dry, stuffy, nor thick. 1984 is mostly a light read, with some exception towards the end when Winston starts repeating from 'the book' to Julia. Other than that, words generally flow down the pages, and you quickly find yourself engrossed by the story, such that it becomes hard to put down...and hard to stomach at the same time.Orwell creates a world that is both absurdly terrifying yet strangely familiar. Strangely familiar because of what we see happening right now in our present day history. Orwell proclaimed that he did not think 1984 would happen, but that it could happen. If he were still alive today, he would be no less convinced that it could happen.Today, reality does not give us leadership which is this draconian. 1984 presents a possible reality; a reality that is an extreme case of government gone bad. While I don't see this as our eventual fate, I enjoy the eye-opening approach Orwell takes in creating this story to make his point.The result of his foreboding is eye-opening and fear-inducing. Those familiar with Animal Farm will recognize his ability to paint a very nefarious, yet realistic, scenario in which leaders of any societal order strive to exclude. Those not familiar with Orwell are in for a treat and should read Animal Farm in addition to this.This review is being written in early 2003. At the moment, US politicians are attempting to create legislation which will enable federal agents to track every electronic move that people make. In light of that, this book is a required read. Disregarding that, this book is still a required read.While I do not think this book represents a potential reality, it does highlight the danger of losing one's freedom to think independently. And in that vein, Orwell forces you to ask questions about the core of humanity and just how far things could possibly go.In perusing some of the 821 reviews of this book, I don't think it's fair to say that this is the best book ever written, or even one of the top 10 for that matter. It is a good book, and one that I highly recommend. But I cannot in good faith call it one of the best ever.The only issue I might have is that Orwell does assume that the average person is so mentally broke that he could allow this to ever happen. I don't know if this was his aim, or if it's to proclaim this *would* happen if the upper echelon got their way. Then again, in the day and age of media-fed TV junkies, perhaps he was more right than he could possibly have known.A very good book and certainly worth the read."},{"Title":"1984","review":"I was so upset to learn that this is no longer required reading in advanced English in high school. I ordered it for my son, because no one can be considered well read without this in one's history."},{"Title":"1984","review":"To me, Big Brother has to be the scariest fictional villain I have ever encountered. His &quot;picture&quot; is everywhere you look and it appears as though he is always watching you. Everyone believes in him but you don't know if he is an actual entity or just an omnipotent idea. This is the trouble the Winston Smith faces in &quot;1984,&quot; a chilling novel by Orson Wells.Those who believe in Big Brother do so religiously while those who don't are stuck in poverty on the fringe of society. Winston believes there is a way to topple Big Brother and the answer lies in the non-beliving masses. The problem is that they have no idea what their situation. Winston must find a way to organize these people while avoiding detection from the Thought Police.Mind control is rampant, people disappear, and &quot;history&quot; can be changed with one slip of paper in &quot;1984.&quot; The scariest part of this novel is that, in the information age we live in, there is the possibility that someone is always watching you. This novel is a must read for a society that hopes to avoid the level of big government that could lead to the situation contained within."},{"Title":"1984","review":"I was blown away by this book, couldn't put it down. The similarities with today are a bit scary. It's a great horror without the horror, if you know what I mean."},{"Title":"1984","review":"George Orwell was the pen name of Eric Arthur Blair. He first gained fame for publishing 1984. He was born in 1903 in Bengal, India and died in 1950. He was poor until his 30's. He was frightened by communism and his books reflected that particularly in Animal Farm.The author's goal in this book, 1984, was quite simple. He wanted to frighten people about a totalitarian, technologically backwards society where truth is changed to what is the present people say. What they say is are lies. The telescreens that are mounted everywhere destroy privacy everywhere but in the slums when they are like cameras. There is no such thing as love. If discovered, the secret would condition it out. There is a constant fake war as an excuse to make goods and then destroy them. There are 3 types of people, the proles, the outer party, and the inner party with all the wealth, goods, mansions, and servants.The author without a doubt achieves his goal. It is akin to detonating a brick of C-4 to swat a fly. He definitely frightens the reader into a coma. The reader's own children turning them in for thoughtcrime. Could anyone imagine that? No Bill of Rights? Room 101 where all the reader's worst fears come out and haunt the reader? If there was a secret police, how would people live? By looking over their shoulders, and holding low pitched conversations, thats how. Once the reader died, there would be no trace of the reader. No mention on the newspaper. It would just be changed the next day. The reader couldn't say anything subversive, because the readers' co-workers would turn them in. The worst of all is that speech would all be polarized. Everything that you said would have negative or positive connotations.The book has its strengths, when it describes the antiques shop and how there was relics like china. The description of Newspeak and the different ministries abbreviations are also strengths. The abbreviations are just a way of getting the mind to conform to new values. It was all about perception.The weakness is when the baser instincts leak through into actions. One example is when Winston wanted to rape Julia because he thought she was part of the secret police. Another is the very graphic screen, when Winston is getting interrogated and sells out his love for Julia just to get the pain to stop. It is a little too strong in my opinion."},{"Title":"1984","review":"George Orwell's book 1984 was a tremendous, very enticing book. It shows a government under which no one can trust anyone. Everyone has to watch what is said to everyone because there is always a chance that the other person they are talking to is a spy.It starts off with Winston questioning what is going on in the government. He is wanting to revolt against them. He realizes that all the people are changing the history everyday to go with what the government says.He isn't careful of what he does and he gets caught. That goes back to always watching what the characters say around other people because if they aren't careful, they will get caught. That leads to George Orwell's purpose of this novel.George Orwell was a very good writer. He had a reoccurring theme in this book and in Animal Farm, which was communism. In 1984, he showed his vision of how the world would be if communism took over. There would be no freedom, and one supreme ruler, or in the book, Big Brother.Orwell accomplished his goal in this book. He was warning people against the negative aspects of communism. It may have been a little dramatic, but still there is not much freedom in communist countries. He showed that the government would have a hand in everything, even what people said in private.This book has many strengths and a couple weaknesses in it. The first strength is that it is written very well. It is put together so that everything fits together perfectly. Another strength is that it is a very enticing book. Once the reader picks the book up he or she can't stop reading it until it's done. The one weakness it has is the ending. It somewhat just cuts the reader off at the ending. It basically says Winston gave up on loving Julia and he accepted the party. So, Orwell is saying that Winston gave up and accepted communism. Overall though, it was an excellent book."},{"Title":"1984","review":"\\"It's a beautiful thing the destruction of words\\" This appelation coming out of the mouth of a character Syme seems strange for any author to intone, tantamount to writer's heresy. In a way, this whole book was about heresy, 'thoughtcrime' towards the regime which ruled Airstrip One. This book will be able to teach a lot about politics in the modern day. The only place where it really strays is at Orwell's atheistic uterances. Otherwise a great read."},{"Title":"1984","review":"\\"1984\\"--or \\"Nineteen Eighty-Four\\" in the Oldspeak--is one of those books prophecizing doom that has remained relevant enough to generate a famous Macintosh commercial, a \\"Simpsons\\" parody, and a reality television series named for it among other things. What allows \\"1984\\" to remain in our consciousness and not a relic of the post-World War II, Cold War, Atomic Age era is that like the book of Revelations, \\"1984\\"'s dire predictions can be adapted for each new generation.\\"1984\\"'s epic battle of good versus evil doesn't take place on any plain of Armageddon, but rather within the mind of one man: Winston Smith. Winston is a 39-year-old man who works for the Party at the Ministry of Truth, which has an ironic name because Winston's job is actually to doctor reality so that the Party always appears infallible. Winston sees that while the Party, under the leadership of Big Brother, claims surpluses of everything, no one can buy simple items like razor blades or shoelaces. As he becomes disillusioned by the Party's rule, he and a young woman named Julia begin a torrid secret affair. Then he is contacted by a man high up in the Party named O'Brien who works for a resistance group known as the Brotherhood. But before he can help the Brotherhood, Winston is betrayed, arrested, and taken to the dungeons of the Ministry of Love, where he endures physical and psychological torment that threatens to break him and strip him of all humanity.As it is written, Big Brother and his Party would seem to represent the fascist or Communist movements of the 1940s. Taken literally it would be easy to dismiss the book as an archaic remnant of Cold War hysteria. But the beauty of \\"1984\\" is that because it focuses on the internal struggle for Winston Smith's soul, it can transcend all that. For the warning in \\"1984\\" isn't about communism or fascism, but the threat of letting anyone crush the human spirit through overbearing dogma.Much like faithful Christians of every generation have painted everyone from the Pope to Hitler as the Antichrist, every generation looks for its Big Brother. From communists to corporations to churches, individual readers can read \\"1984\\" and make their own interpretations of who or what Big Brother and the Party represent. But no matter how each of us sees it, the general warning should be clear: the human spirit is our most precious possession and must be retained at all costs.That is all."},{"Title":"1984","review":"This is a great book, as is Animal Farm. It's horrifying,enaging,and sad at the same time. I also love the language. Nineteen Eighty-Four is probably one of my favorite books ever."},{"Title":"1984","review":"In this negative-utopia, the world is a place of despair, brainwashing, and lies. For 39 year-old Winston Smith, he is one of the only persons to realize it.While the world is at an everlasting war, \\"Big Brother\\", the leader of Oceania, is in a way, omnipotent. He controls the past, as everything he says is true. He controls you, as you are forever watched and observed. His lies are accepted as truths as there is never any proof, because all is either altered or destroyed. Everyone knows that the present is better than the past, simply because there is nothing they can compare it to. The world is lost of individual thinkers.Winston knows that \\"The Party as they are called, and Big Brother, are wrong and that they are manipulating everything, but only his memory can prove it. As Winston attempts to find ways of defeating The Party, his hopes rise and fall, with the meeting of Julia, his secret love, and O'Brien, his political rescue hopeful. His defiance against Big Brother rises to a turning climax of confusion and surprise.George Orwell creates an stunning image and almost a warning of a tainted future bound to destroy our meaning of living. The book written in 1949, was based on the World War and what frightening alternative may have happened.While the author is truly talented and creates an astonishing picture, the book seems to rush too much into details in some instances and be slightly vague in others. After reading the book one is felt that some questions are let unanswered, even though all the answers are there. Yet again, I mention the vagueness of some parts. Instead of giving an excerpt of what Winston is reading, Orwell gives almost the entire book, and while this is incredibly creative and shows immense talent, it also leaves the reader bored and tired, although, it does play a bit of an important event.Overall, it is clear to see why this book has become a classic over the years and is frequently read or referenced. It provokes the mind to wander and raises an incredible amount of questions about our society today, and the future of Oceania. It creates a vision of horror and keeps us alert of the way we are heading now."},{"Title":"1984","review":"This book is one of the most unique and thought-provoking books I have ever read. This book is so unique because, at times, it can be interpreted, espeically in today's society, as both a fiction book and a non-fiction book. While the characters and happenings throughout the book are fictitious, the parts of the book Orwell dedicated to his social commentary/critiques are entirely real and relevant to you as a reader.As stated by many reviewers, the most amazing thing about this book is that it was written almost sixty years ago and has only gotten more appropriate as time has gone on. It took me longer than expected to read the book because there were times when I put the book down and thought about the accuracy and depth with which Orwell disucess society's structure and how clear he presents himself on the page... all done in 1949! A supurb novel, social commentary, and read. Do not pass this up."},{"Title":"1984","review":"There is a reason why 1984 by George Orwell is a classic. One of the reason is that this book is entertaining. This you can find in many classics. Another reason is that the reader feels for the characters. This can be found in many cheap paperbacks that you find in supermarkets at the end of aisles, so that isn't it either. This book makes you think about what you are not used to thinking about. This is better, but still does not make this book a classic.This book also is very easy for the reader to enter the world of INGSOC and Big Brother (be careful, he could be watching you). This could be the reason. However it is the combination of all 5 of these elements that make this story a classic.1984 revolves around your average-Joe, Winston Smith. Winston works for the Department of Truth (falsifies the past to make it the truth). He is satified with his way of life that involves thought-police (an FBI of sorts that makes sure you don't think any bad thoughts about INGSOC, the ruling party), double-speak (a language that is used to keep people from thinking bad thoughts), the Ministry of Love (prison/torture chambers), Ministry of Peace (War Department), Party slogans (War is Peace, Freedom is Slavery, Ignorance is Strength), and, of course, the Junior Anti-Sex League (so the government can control human reproduction).Winston finds himself inlove with Julia. Julia pretends to be a die-hard party member, however she actually plans to overthrow the party. Winston finds himself friends with a person that could cost him his life.The story of 1984 is really a great page turner. In fact, I HAD to finish it as soon as possible because I was worried about what could happen to the characters. The suspense is second to none.I found myself making connections between our world and Winston's world. That is what makes this book easy to relate to.I would suggest this book to everyone over the age of 13 or 14 because this book is a true masterpiece.

You may hate Winston Smith for going against himself in the end and being forced to call defeat a \\"victory\\" but blissful ignorance and non-cooperation and no motivation of putting checks and balances on the elites, whether we're talking business giants or our ever-corrupt politicians especially the neocons will only make it easier for the government and their henchmen elite to take away what previous generation Americans had long fought for and that's the BIG WARNING this book sounds the BIG ALARM on !

Orwell wasn't talking about communism. That's what Animal Farm is for. Orwell wrote 1984 to attack capitalistic fascism for fascism is ALWAYS the final stage of capitalism. If the book were about communism, as many have suggested, then why in our post Cold War world that has seen the unforseeable demise of Soviet power do we still have to read it? If the major premise of his book is that communism is dangerous, then why read this book since our experience contradictorily indicates communism was only a danger to the Soviets! If you don't see that 1984 is about America/England, i.e. Oceania! and our socalled western capitalistic democracy of untold Nirvanas then you've taken the ultimate soma holiday. A patriot criticizes his own government and in a democracy the people are vigilant over THEIR government first and foremost. Orwell was writing about home, England, that's why the action is centered in London, Airstrip One where industrialism and capitalism first took flight. The ultimate realization of this text, indeed any text, is the ability to apply it to our own experiences not the remoteness of some communist Cuba filtered through the Ministry of Truth, or Nazi Germany \\"corrected\\" to the point that it no longer exists.

Although the advances in electronic music make this material sound dated now, it's still a highlight of Van Halen's career. Songs like \\"Jump\\" contain a pop element that gave 1984 mainstream appeal, and David Lee Roth turned the frontman role into an art form on songs such as \\"Panama,\\" \\"Hot for Teacher,\\" \\"Drop Dead Legs,\\" and \\"I'll Wait.\\" To a large extent, it was 1984 that set the standard for '80s pop metal, and David Lee Roth who set the standard (or takes the blame, depending on your point of view) for the aggressively good-time attitude most pop-metal bands took for their own. --Genevieve Williams"},{"Title":"1984","review":"1984 is a frightening novel by George Orwell, His novel (based upon tolitarian governments of the Soviet Union and Spain) tells the story of a citizen living in Oceania. The government is fighting a never ending war against Eurasia (a.k.a. East Asia). The society is repressed and very poor. They are constantly making war machines and mutitions for the ever growing army. One citizen (Winston) slowly learns about the shame his life is and tries to break free from the government's control (Big Brother). Winston's job is a that of a writer. He gets to make the news and other human interest stories. Life is mundane and dry for Winston until he meets the woman of his dreams. Can Winston survive the brutal regime of Big Brother? Is their really a war? Is this novel worth buying? Check out 1984.Sadly this novel is becoming true, Many parellels can be found, Oceania's public enemy number one is a figure named Goldstein (Osama Bin Laden). No one knows if he's alive or even real. The war against Eurasia a.k.a East Asia (Terrorism). Is this war even necessary or worth it? The ever increasing threat of an unseen enemy. Revision and dumbing down of historical events. Enemies of Oceania (United States) shipping enemies of the state to the ministry of love (Gitmo). Children being taught to snitch on their own parents (war on drugs) people ratting out others for not loving or speaking out against Big Brother and \\"thought police\\" (the Patriot Act).Remember, Big Brother is watching you!"},{"Title":"1984","review":"This book was so deep in meaning .Everything ,from every action was so meaningful.And the end was crazy how the Big Brother caught him and basically messed with his mind.They tortured him mentally and the end when he was only set free because big brother knew that he had took away his dignity .Smith was set free only to face the cold world with no dignity .Through out this book they teach that\\" war is peace\\",\\"freedom is slavery\\",and \\"ingnorance is strength\\"which is totally the oppsite of my beliefs."},{"Title":"1984","review":"I have read this book 3 or 4 times and still find it relative to our society today.

I would recommend EVERYONE READ THIS BOOK."},{"Title":"1984","review":"1984 is one of the most important books ever written. Many people in the world think that Orwell was a hypocrite of everything, but in truth he was a genius who saw the numerous corruptions that go on every day and was able to predict what they would end up as.In the book he highlights many important factors of the human mind and shows why the one aspect of greed is the most dominant in all humans. Don't listen to what other people say about communism or how it's just another simple criticism of Stalinist society. The story takes place in Britain, not Russia! Orwell challenges the ability of humans to be good-natured and not become completely absorbed with power.1984 highlights how the government can keep you blind to things that are going on all around you and can make you believe something that can't be proven without a doubt. You don't know for sure that the Civil War happened the way people say it happened, when it happened, why it happened, how it happened and where it happened, because you weren't there. Orwell shows this in the book very well."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Pros: This book seemed to be a science-fiction book about the future, but in truth, it was a sci-fi symbolism of totalitarianism in Orwell's time. Yet, this book is so timely today! It reminded me of the way Bush and friends control our thoughts with smart words; GOOD Americans believe in the war and TRAITORS believe in other causes. We should always keep our own opinion and forget the always-swaying popular opinion. And that was just ONE of the many things I learned from this great book! I highly suggest this book.Cons: It was a bit repetitive and it's a very heavy read."},{"Title":"1984","review":"One is easily gripped by the horror and turmoil of 1984. George Orwell's novel about a totalitarian state and how it, the government, controls all the people of the state and tries to control thought. The book had a subtle and interesting plot. Orwell's characters generally demonstrated the emotions received within the context of the story. Winston, Orwell's protagonist, acted as a human trying to hold on to what makes him human his, emotions and ability to think freely. Now could a totalitarian state exist as it is portrayed in 1984? Yes, it could occur if we as humans do not fight for the liberty indebted to us by God. We fight totalitarianism by proper education, proper families, and proper participation in society. If nothing, else the message one should get from the book is to simply vote. If we as humans do act lackadaisical with our participation in the democratic governments, then we could lose the freedoms our fore fathers fought so hard to win. That is why one should read this book. One does not have to like what 1984 says or represents. Readers should then learn that &quot;Action is Freedom&quot; and stop a totalitarianistic societies from existing. As a literary work I thought the 1984 was a little too wordy and unfortunately forced up high school students. The ending is not what I hoped for, but none-the-less I think people should read this book."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Okay, this review will have spoilers, I am sorry, but it's the only way I feel I can make my point. I will say, without spoiler, that this book could have been amazing. I gave it two stars because the writing was very detailed. I could see it. I knew what the hall looked like, the house, the coral. I KNEW what he was seeing. But two stars is all I'm giving for that, and here's why... I followed this book, I felt the build up and the suspense, I loved it four stars worth... &lt;spoiler> until he started reading Goldstein's book. That's when the story began to fall apart, when I realized that there wasn't going to really be a story at all.At this point, it really felt like Orwell wrote everything up until then just so he could give a long drawn out speech about a society that could have been and if it had been, it would suck. And I think I may have still clung on to liking the book, I would have overlooked the lecture part, if at the end, there was something to walk away with, some point to the story other than 'if this happens, it will be bad'. Yeah, it would. But this is a book, give me more than a lecture. There were just so many parts that I could not get on board with.Let's start with his meeting with O'Brien. O'Brien told him that there would be no group meetings, there was not an organization. Winston would take his orders from O'Brien, himself, or maybe one or two other people. Though Winston held high suspicions of everything and everyone throughout the book, why not even a slight apprehensiveness here? Why not question why he might have to throw acid into a child's face or spread a venereal disease? If you are questioning everything about your society and world, why blindly grasp on to this line of reasoning without even asking about it? I understand that you are raised with a different set of standards and understandings, but you are telling me that you are suspicious of EVERYTHING else, but that this line of talk seems acceptable to you, and that you should blindly accept it? No questions? No sneaking worry that perhaps something is not right?And Julia in all of this? In earlier conversations, she had stated quite clearly that she had no desire to rebel like this. She wanted to rebel mentally and sexually, but that was all. And yet, he denounced everything for her, he said that she would also throw acid in baby's faces. She only spoke up when it came to them separating. Why? She was a strong woman earlier, very strong in her stance on only being a rebel from the waist down. She knew that his form of rebellion is suicide. But now, in the presence of O'Brien, she was mousy. She apparently wanted this too and had not a word to say otherwise. Why? Why, Julia, did you abandon EVERYTHING you had previously said, wanted, felt... and done it blindly without discussion?Then came the book of boredom. I kept waiting to read something to the effect of \\"so the government using mind control by lacing the Victory gin and using subliminal messaging in the Tele's\\" but no. Just Socia-Political garble again.Okay, so then they were caught. And it was O'Brien that was the Thought Police. Saw that coming after the meeting. And they start torturing Winston, okay... but why? O'Brien says to make you back to a good little follower so we can kill you then, as a believer... You know, because that's how we do it. We go through all this time and effort for no real end effect, just to kill you after you re-convert.Oh, and somehow, we can actually read your mind. Huh?And in the end, what was that? He was a good little lazy boy? What was the point of the whole thing? Of him knowing society and the government was wrong? Of him loving Julia? Of any of it? Why tell me a story like that? If not one single thing came of it, what was the point? There was nothing to hold on to, in the end. If, let's say, he was that shell of a man, but had constant dreams of Julia, his perfect love, though he could not recall who she was... only the feeling of that perfect happy... I could hold on to that. If, he died with her name on his lips, I could hold on to that. If she turned out to be the bad guy, or O'Brien turned out to be the jackass he is but was ALSO Goldstein, or Goldstein was actually Big Brother, or anything that was actually a twist, a plot, or somehow monumental or even pretty big, I could hold on to that. But this story just ended kinda blah. It was just 'This guy thinks the government is wrong. He realizes they are jerks. Some hot chick likes him and they get together. He then makes a friend from work who he thinks hates the government too. He promises to do mean things to get back at the government if his friend asks him to. But what? His friend ends up being a governmental prick and torturing him until he really likes the government. Then, he doesn't like his girlfriend anymore and he gets to drink gin all the time and the government doesn't change at all, and the girlfriend doesn't really like him anymore either. The end.' Where is the story in that?And I know! I get flak because it's revolutionary and deep and BIG BROTHER and all that. But I'm holding my ground on this one. Two stars at MOST!Ug"},{"Title":"1984","review":"If you're politically inclined, you'll love this novel about Oceania. Though this book is fiction, you'll find more similarities with your life than you thought possible. The symbolism is great and should be a must-read for any high school student in a high school civics course."},{"Title":"1984","review":"I read 1984 a few weeks ago after having ordered it from Amazon.com. My reasons for this were because the book had been mentioned quite frequently on some of the websites that I freqent online, and with all that is going on these days with the government, and everyone's fears (including my own) of our diminishing freedoms here in the United States, I found my site interested in reading this book. I haven't actually read anything else by George Orwell and not sure if I will or not, but I did enjoy reading 1984 and found it to be of great interest.Some of the parts throughout the book were scary. Some were sad. A few were humorous, such as when they were talking about the newspeak for the first time and how they wanted to get rid of a lot of words, which would no doubt make the language quite confusing. Much of the book was creepy, though, and I found myself comparing certain things in this book to stuff that was happening currently in the United States. While an exact replica of Oceania probably isn't likely to occur, it is very possibly, and unfortunately very likely as well, that the US may at some point in the near or distant future become something very close to what Oceania was in 1984, and that's what is so scary about it. I am not saying that it is a premonition set in stone, of course, but 1984 does serve as a warning that, yes, something like this could indeed happen and will happen if we allow it to; if only more people would listen to it...The character of Winston Smith was very well portrayed. He is a confused character throughout the beginning of the book, not sure where he stands, not sure if he is insane or not, though as it goes on, he becomes more sure in his stance against Big Brother, and his struggle to remain human in an inhumane society devoid of all emotion, save for a fierce loyalty and devotion to Big Brother.There isn't a lot of action and suspense in this book, so if you're looking for that, you might do well to look elsewhere.On the other hand, there are a lot of interesting philosophies and politics discussed throughout the book, and its definitely something that will make you think long after you are done reading. Along with being thought-provoking, it lends a credible, yet very terrifying vision of the future."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Like his earlier novel \`Animal Farm,' George Orwell's masterpiece 1984 explores the terror of totalitarianism. Both novels are cases of socialism gone awry, of revolutions which start out trying to throw off an oppressive government and end up establishing a new one which is even more oppressive than before. The masses (not very intelligent, according to Orwell, and easily manipulated and persuaded) are used by the middle-class to displace the upper-class, not so a system of equality can be established (though that is the promise given to the masses) but rather that a new upper-class can take the place of an old one. It is significant that Orwell, who was a believer in socialism himself, used socialism as the basis of the revolution, but it is also true that this concept can be applied to any form of government.This book expands upon Orwell's message in \`Animal Farm.' In that book, the animals stage a revolution--in this book, the revolution is already accomplished, and the new government firmly in place. The government of \`Big Brother' (the dictator figure of 1984) allows its subjects no liberties and no freedoms whatsoever--not even privacy in their own homes. The past-in the form of old media and history books-is controlled by \`The Party,' as is the language (The Party is working on a system of language, which will eliminate any words which do not agree with the Party's intentions). The Party government of 1984 seems very exotic, since nothing of that sort has actually taken place. But there are still lessons to be learned.Perhaps the most poignant lesson of the novel is described by the \`Newspeak' word \\"Doublethink\\" (Orwell coined this word). It means, in effect, the ability to believe something even in the face of evidence to the contrary. A parent who will not believe her child would use drugs even when she finds them in his room is a good example of this. In fact, \\"Doublethink\\" is a much greater threat than we choose to believe. The genius of this novel is that Orwell is able to point out problems such as these, problems in our own society. Though most of the setting of the novel is extreme, many of the ideals and guidelines the Party teaches are real threats, threats we face today.This is one of the great novels of the 20th century. It is almost standard reading for high-schoolers, but this does not mean that it is a juvenile work of fiction. On the contrary, the mental dictatorship of 1984 is not an impossible threat, even today, and for this message the book is justly termed a classic."},{"Title":"1984","review":"At the time this book was written, in the 1950's, this book was feared as a posssible future for the world. This story is a bleak prediction of the future of man. Whatever they say is the rule, whatever they you think is ungaurdable, and even the smallest change in your apperence is subject for search. The biggest question of all though, is not how you can escapes, but who can you escape from. They know everthing that you are doing because of the telescreens located in every room and any thought of treason is picked up. This is the story about a man in this world, all alone, trying to figure out which is which. He knows the Party lies, and can even alter the past, but in a world where alliances wavor, and there is no certainty about who you are, how does he know he is fighting against the right people.

All three have similar subject matter: the bleak future. Both Brave New World and 1984 depict technology run rampant and used to further de-humanize the populous. 1984 is a bleak book, but in parts very powerful. I would say, however, that at times Orwell lost my interest. He is in love with narrative, which is fine, but occasionally it drones on. I would say that Brave New World is a better book to read about how the future CAN go wrong, mainly because it is much more entertaining.

George Orwell's predictions are a dark and terrifying world that captures the reader and forces them on. The stories told is one that may yet come to pass.

All in all I rate it a 5 out of 5."},{"Title":"1984","review":"I first read 1984 in 1982. I was in my early teens, the Cold War seemed anything but that, and the fear of nuclear annihiliation was quite real. Although this fear has resurfaced in the last year and a half, at least in those years there was an antinuclear movement that gave some hope for disarmament. On my first reading, Orwell's vision of a nightmarish future seemed relevant to both superpowers' hopes for world domination. What has stayed with me through the collapse of the Soviet Union, however, was Orwell's fascinating treatment of language and truth, his dissection of the ways people in offices of immense power, regardless of their political affiliation, distort reality to suit their purposes. The idea that resistance to such distortion begins with being true to oneself and decent to the people around you has sustained me through a dismal political era. In 1984, Orwell shows how such truthfulness and decency are their own rewards.I've read 1984 five times in twenty years and I've recently taught it for the first time. It's remarkable that Orwell's perceptions, written over fifty years ago, remain relevant regardless of the party in power, whether there are two superpowers or one, whether people read 1984 in the radio age or the Internet age. In a society whose citizens are linked more by their spending habits than their political outlooks, where many personal desires are shaped by images of inaccessible lifestyles, Orwell's perspective on language and truth, appearance and reality, become even more relevant than when they were first written.Readers often criticize Orwell's pessimism but he didn't underestimate our capacity to go along with things as they are. He might have avoided this criticism had he made Parsons, the loyal, dim-witted Party member, a more prominent counterpoint to Winston. Most of us, sadly, don't need to go to Room 101 to learn to love Big Brother. If we think of Big Brother as the various industries and ideologies that help us convince ourselves that seeing is believing, then we already, willingly, do."},{"Title":"1984","review":"What a timeless classic, now that is a pun..

As in Orwell's first novel, Animal Farm, 1984 exudes great amounts of irony and symbolism in an incisive and meaningful way.The story consists of a brief chronology of events in Winston Smith's life. Winston is a disillusioned and repressed worker in the city of Oceania, a militaristic superstate. Winston believes that the bleek status quo was much better in his past, but do to the laws executed by Big Brother, the ubiquitous figurehead of the government, history itself has become alterable and destructible, and Winston can't mesh his thoughts into a coherent pattern. As Winstons circadian afflictions begin to grow on him heavily, a stroke of luck graces his misfortunate life when a beautiful young girl named Julia, who Winston was previously skeptical of, confides her love in him. Julia revigorates Winston's life and becomes an evergrowing source of light and happiness to his newly formed being.On a balmy June day, Winston and Julia's seperate peace is suddenly extirpated by a surprising twist of fate- Winston's kindly old friend Mr. Charington (owner of Winston and Julia's garret), who seems unaffected by the party, betrays Winston and divulges his whereabouts to the Thought Police, a sophisticated and merciless law enforcing team. From here on, things rapidly decline for Winston. He is beaten, tortured, humiliated, and deprived of any small solace to help him. During this period of debasement and castigation, Winston is interogated by his fellow worker named O'Brian, who Winston looks at with idyllic love and compassion throughout the course of the novel. In the paramount scene of the novel set in Room 101, O'Brian quashes all logic and sense that Winston tries to use against the Party, and succeedes in destroying every ounce of humanity left in Winston, forcing him to love Big Brother and betray Julia.1984 displays George Orwell's outstanding brilliance in an earnest, captivating fashion. Orwell's desperate, seemingly hopeless forebodings to society as a whole are thought to have been addressed to Communist or Nazi regimes, whose terrible dictatorships brought about the deaths of millions of innocent people. However, Orwell clearly illustrates that mutiny against any tryanical government is futile. One may be lead to believe that Orwell was a cynical, desolate individual focusing only on the bad or injurious parts of a civilization and the hopelessness of autonomous efforts to enhance goodness in a society. Contrary to this idiology, I believe Orwell's 1984 is a an ingenius device that accurately portrays a society that will be formed from ignorance and repression, but through such a powerful novel, Orwell disseminates his profound and wise message to the masses, and aptly conveys his yearning for a just and egalitarian society for everyone."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Through out the coarse of my reading carrier I must say that I have found only a few novels that may compare with &quot;1984&quot;. The cunning realism that is embedded upon every page is something truly worth reading. Personally as a writer I feel that after reading this novel I have grown and improved my own writing technique. Not to mention the actually genius involved in contemplating the elaborate world of restricted freedom and no piece of mind. George Orwell completely shatters all walls of possibilities when he introduces many variations of mass control as well as mass acceptance of lies. The complexity of the main character Winston Smith in itself is simply astonishing. So tragic and heart felt is his predicament that sympathy is quickly given to the fictional character. This is mostly because of the fact that certain freedoms that we have are taken for granted. While in &quot;1984&quot; the lack of freedom is equally accepted and taken for granted by the people of the novel. Which reminds us to think and judge for our selves what it is right.

Orwell not only wrote about the world of the future, but also stood out by writing his idea of the supremely successful, and everlasting government, the anti-Utopia. Within the story Orwell created the Brother Hood, an evil organization with advanced technology and the desire for power, even at the expense of sanity. Winston, the main character of the story, is a comrade under the Brother Hood. He turns out to be quite the odd man out, since Winston is always seeking for some sort of salvation from the evil grasp of the Brother Hood. Since the Brother Hood watches everyone in Oceania, the country Winston lives in, twenty-four hours a day through two-way telescreens, all personal and social lives of its countrymen are eliminated. The Brother Hood skillfully takes apart all connections between its citizens, leaving them weak and alone, also preventing them from rebellious organization. The Brother Hood destroyed the bonds between family members by instilling pure fear, the fear that your spouse, or even your child will turn you in for thought crime. To commit a thought crime, it would have to appear that your mind is thinking in some way that is opposing the Brother Hood and Big Brother's, the supreme ruler of the Brother Hood, bests interests. This is the Brother Hoods way of controlling what you think; giving them the power to break a man's sanity, and mold him in any way they please. This society formed as the anti-Utopia has one advantage over other ruling parties, it does not promise love and equality for its citizens in the end, but sets forth to create hate, separation, and total inequality among people, making their rule everlasting and indestructible."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Orwell was a pioneer in this form of literature.

The ending had me in tears."},{"Title":"1984","review":"I came to 1984 after reading a series of novels by Russian authors about life in Stalingrad during the onslaught by Hitler and then after the cruelty of Stalin. It's easy to see how Orwell extended the grim realities of the concentration camps of Germany and the labor camps of Russia into this dark prophecy. Of course, in many instances his vision has become realized. Big Brother seeks to invade our privacy at every turn via electronic media. Governments pose rhetoric immersed in \\"doublespeak\\". The Thought Police exist to bully our free expression. Power is exercised by imposing real human suffering upon multitudes. \\"The essential act of war is destruction, not necessarily of human lives, but of the products of human labour. War is a way of shattering to pieces, or pouring into the stratosphere, or sinking in the depths of the sea, materials which might otherwise be used to make the masses too comfortable, and hence, in the long run, too intelligent.\\" Oil comes to mind here. And munitions. And diverse other commodities. In 1984 the war is endless. \\"Everywhere there is the same pyramidical structure, the same worship of a semi-divine leader, the same economy existing by and for continuous war.\\" Sound familiar? The High, or the \\"priests of power\\" only fall when assaulted by the Middle and usually assisted by the Low classes. Then the Middle becomes the High and oppresses the Low for which change only means a new master. The protagonist, Winston, a \\"minority of one\\" questions his own sanity but ultimately defends the \\"spirit of man\\" as a force which cannot be overpowered. In the closing pages we see Orwell's true convictions about the infallible power of Big Brother and the triumph of the human spirit. This dark view has real overtones of Nietzsche and Machiavelli, who wrote with the view of realism based upon the inhumanity they witnessed in their heydays by \\"princes\\" with the \\"will to power\\". But the \\"spirit of man\\" is truly formidable and cannot be overcome, except temporarily, by totalitarian figures and corrupt democracies. The next US national election will be telling about down which road America will travel. 1984 is a cautionary, post-World War II tale but to say it's unrealistically dark and couldn't happen here and now is to overlook eons of history. And to be unconscious of the powers of orthodoxy infringing greedily and corporately upon the spirit of man in our time."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Anyone familiar with the lives of the Russian people under Stalin and his GULAG (Main Camp Administration) system will notice the many parallels between it and a lot of the goings on in the novel 1984. The story within the story is that of one man, 39-year-old Winston Smith, who works at the Ministry of Truth in London, the chief city of Airstrip One [England], which is (p 5) \\"the third most populous of the provinces of Oceania.\\" The party's slogans: \\"War is Peace,\\" \\"Freedom is Slavery,\\" and \\"Ignorance is Strength,\\" make it easy to accept the fact that Smith's job at the Ministry of Truth involves telling lies. More specifically, his job is to edit previously published official documents such that the \\"facts\\" du jour spewed by the government are shown to have been correctly predicted, (p 42) \\"Day by day and almost minute by minute the past was brought up to date.\\" As Winston thought of it (p 43) \\"It was merely the substitution of one piece of nonsense for another.\\" Each time the country's war opponent changes, Smith's job becomes especially busy modifying documents to show that the country has ALWAYS been at war with Eastasia and allied with Eurasia. Oceania's opponent and ally alternated regularly, but everyone is expected to unquestioningly believe otherwise. Smith meets and falls in love with a 26-year-old seemingly hard-core party member who, in fact, despises the party but has perfected the part of rabid party member to hide her true feelings. Outside the small world that is their relationship is the larger world of the all-powerful government, especially Big Brother, shown as an enormous face with a heavy moustache (Stalin?) on posters proclaiming, Big Brother is Watching You. Citizens are constantly being monitored by cameras and microphones as well as by their \\"comrades,\\" acquaintances and even family members. Everyone has a telescreen, which is always turned on since it can't be turned off. As expected, the couple is eventually caught. And Smith is tortured and starved before it's all over. The novel 1984 is an exceptional book about, among other things, the overinvolvement and of the government in the lives of its people. Also good: Planet of the Apes by Pierre Boulle, Brave New World by Aldous Huxley, and (for 9 to 12-year-olds) The Mysterious Benedict Society by Trenton Lee Stewart."},{"Title":"1984","review":"The book itself is quite great. I'll spare you all the trouble of another plot synopsis or critique. My one problem is that the OCR for this edition looks like it was done by an infant. There are consistent errors that one sees in OCR, the becomes die, time becomes tune, periods are missed, etc. I paid money for this book, and I didn't expect it to have so may typographical errors."},{"Title":"1984","review":"I just read this for the first time at 28. Wow, what an eye opener. The things Orwell predicted in 1984, such as the technology, is amazing considering how long ago it was written. The politics are messed up by current standards, but frighteningly possible. The tense mood of the book draws you in, and there are moments (especially near the end) that would be truly terrifying to experience. The chapter with \\"Room 101\\" I read with a shudder.The reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it bogs down a few times. I understand that this is to explain the world and how such a horrific existence came to be, but a slow start to any book is rather annoying."},{"Title":"1984","review":"This book should be manditory reading in grade school. As a whole, 1984 depicts the world as many in todays world want it to be,but won't admit it of course, a world with out free speech, with out free thought, without the ability to critique and question; yet Orwell created the book prior to the calamities we see around us. Prophetic in a fashion, buit also written in a time when PC sugar coating wasnt the norm and you could see and even say what needed to be said. Big brother is watching us, whether it be the ACLU, some church, some group of fanatics who want to take away freedom, the GOV't, whoever. This book shows the desolate result when human curiosity is censored and oppressed, and the will is stamped out. Dystopian literature is a good thing, it isnt all bells and happy ssmiles, but that is life, and in order to fight against terrible things you need to know why they are evil. This book shows why and how many things become evil even without the need for a diety. Collectively our \\"Room 101\\" is not far off if we dont wake up and stop the idiocy of placating becasue we dont want to offend. Part of being human is being offended, part of humanity is the capacity to be unhappy; some say being sad all the time is a sickness, but the person who thinks things are fine all the time I believe is far more ill because if you look around the world, things are not OK; they are turning out alot like 1984."},{"Title":"1984","review":"The classic original. The reason we use the term: \\"Orwellian\\". This is the book which predicted \\"The Lives of Others\\"The Lives of Others. Much of Orwell's work is now part of our lexicon: \\"Big Brother\\". This should be mandatory reading in High Schools."},{"Title":"1984","review":"If this book represents Orwell's circa 1948 prediction of 1984, he wasn't exactly right, but he wasn't completely wrong either. Some have argued that we now live in a pseudofascist state in the modern United States, in large part thanks to another George. I'm sure Orwell's book was profoundly influenced by the historical context of his own life, especially WWII. It's certainly a very well written book, with vivid imagery and several memorable scenes. The movie version with John Hurt is also very well orchestrated. Author ofAdjust Your Brain: A Practical Theory for Maximizing Mental Health."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Orwell has masterminded the collection of terminology resources that today we are aware of, but at times, I guess, without knowing their origin. Although modern terms like \\"hatecrime\\" and \\"hatespeech\\" in the book do not come to the surface, I am sure now, that they are implicit product of the heritage left by Orwell.The true value of a book is in the aftertaste, which urges one to think about human instincts and their function. And at the end, it is almost impossible to object to Orwell's argument, that the strongest human instinct is self-preservation and only then comes the drive to procreate.Winston Smith lives in the society founded upon hatred, he believes in the proles, and rightly so. Regardless of the fact, that two, and in some cases, even three generations of the Eastern Europeans experienced a number of Orwell's revelations to become reality (and to become truth!), they managed to change the course of events. In certain circles, though, the collapse of the Soviet Union is still being regarded as the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the 20th century. As long as such a view will exist, Orwell's messages will not loose their urgency.Finally, I remember that those who studied the law in the former Soviet Union were taught that every crime is two-sided, having its subjective and objective side. While fully understanding what is being meant by first, there was some difficulty, though, among the students, in embracing the later. This novel is like a textbook to understand that concept."},{"Title":"1984","review":"In 1984, George Orwell extends the social analysis into a devastating critique of the principles and processes of political rule. The world of 1984 is divided into the Inner Party, or \\"Brain of the State,\\" the Outer Party, \\"its hands,\\" and the Proles, who survive in a kind of squalid freedom. The plot centres around the attempts of the one Outer Party Member, Winston Smith, to escape the totalitarian society in which he exists. His failure results not in execution, but, more chillingly, conversion, the surrender of his will. Nineeten Eighty-Four contains the famous sentence, \\"If you want a picture of the future, imagine a boot stamping on a human face forever.\\""},{"Title":"1984","review":"For years I had stayed away from this novel because I feared it would be a whiny book about how the bad government was mean to us. I was dead wrong. But can you blame me? Everyone nowadays shouts \\"Big Brother\\" whenever they see a security camera in a public place.I swallowed my apprehensions and bought this book. Glad I did.My first surprise was that the novel was far more subtle than I had been led to believe. I was intrigued, I wanted to read on, and I did.The first two parts are good, though I wasn't affected more than that. I was interested in this new world, I still wanted to learn about it and understand it. Some passages are truly epic, such as the history and explanation of this new world. After the first two parts establish in practice and theory the world we're in, the third part comes in, and that's a wholly different ballgame.Without saying anything of the plot, let's just say that I was mentally and physically shocked. By this I mean that I have rarely been so affected by words before. Everything *1984* exposed in its first two parts comes to a head in this third part and the point is gotten across with the force of a hammer to the heart. While I could remain safely out of reach during the first two parts, the third part had me. Newspeak, doublethink, all this stuff and more appeared to be pure evil, and if you're someone for whom truth is the ultimate value, and someone for whom language is a vital proponent of our thought, evolution, and morals, then you should feel like you're facing pure evil too.Orwell did what few authors have done - to my knowledge - in that he hits one of the biggest literary homeruns I have ever read. A boot stamping on a human face forever.I can't say enough about *1984*, but I will say that it was nothing like what I expected from the hearsay and the abuse of terms from this novel. The depth of this book is downright frightful. Pure evil inhabits this novel. Few books have made me feel this uneasy.I absolutely recommend it to anyone, and I also recommend forgetting people's use of \\"Big Brother\\" and other Orwellian terms applied to things that are, in truth, far remote from what Orwell was writing about.Lastly, while this edition is excellent, don't read the inside flaps as they give away major plot points. I couldn't believe such major plotpoints would be disclosed in the flap, but it was. The people who designed these books seem to think everyone has already read them. Do not read the flap! Take that dustjacket away as soon as you get the book and only look at it after you're done."},{"Title":"1984","review":"This book provides a dark but compelling vision of the future. It isn't always comfortable reading, but you are engrossed in the concept and the relationships in the book.

Despite being written by Orwell in the 40s, this classic novel is still relevant. Instead of the Ministry of Information, we have the TSA and other government authorities telling us things we know not to be true. Orwell was a prophet when it came to predicting how governments would try to keep control of information. Fortunately for us, there is no \\"memory hole\\" down which inconvenient facts can disappear - we have the Internet and the free flow of information.

Its a highly entertaining book that makes you think and wonder, excellently written from beggining to end.If you have not read it, consider its among the best novels ever written, and one great page turner too.HIGHLY RECOMENDED"},{"Title":"1984","review":"\\"1984\\" by George Orwell is a great novel about what happens when a government becomes consumed with power. The story takes place in London in 1984 which was in the future when the book was written. London is part of a country called Oceania. The main character is called Winston.Oceania is continually at war with either Eurasia or East Asia. Once Oceania makes peace with one of those countries and goes to was with another it pretends in its government propaganda that it was always at war or at peace with whatever country it is at war or peace with.The majority of the population in Oceania are Proles who are like a peasantry. The elite people are only allowed to have sexual relations for the specific purpose of producing children but the Proles are freely allowed sexual relations.The citizens are kept under almost constant watch by camera-like screens. Writing in a diary is not allowed.This novel depicts a future where there are almost no human rights granted citizens. There is no privacy. Anything people do is known by the government. In our modern world so far this hasn't happened in the country U.S. where I live. Due to knew technologies which could give the government a greater ability to watch its citizens there is a danger of it happening so this book serves as a good warning."},{"Title":"1984","review":"This book is \\"about totalitarianism\\" and \\"about socialism\\" in the same way that \\"Star Wars\\" is about combat spaceships or \\"The Matrix\\" is about computer technology. If you read the book it becomes quite clear that the totalitarian regime depicted bears no resemblance whatsoever to socialism (it's the opposite, a totalitarian oligarchy), so when people say this book is a warning against socialism they are revealing their own practice of doublethink and so the warning of this book becomes even more important. \\"1984\\" is about the ways in which the human mind can become silently (and forcibly) stolen from an individual, and therefore from the masses, through manipulation of media, perception of scarcity, scapegoat-targetted engagement of strong emotions, and anti-intellectualism, among other things. All of these influences exist in our Western world, not merely in Stalin's Russia or National Socialist (Nazi) Germany of the past. The afterword by Erich Fromm should also be required reading. I wish I could find this edition (with that afterword) in hardcover form."},{"Title":"1984","review":"A confession from this reviewer: 1984 was first read in the early 1960s as a high school junior. Too young to really catch on. The readers of this review can be assured, though, that 1984 got just re-read before recommending now.This personal sequence turned out to be a good and lucky order of things. Reading 1984 as an older teen served as a good \\"memory bookmark\\" for the work about how wildly different was the storyline, especially having been written in the late 1940s. Reading it again much later let the whole ugliness of the theme sink in. Thus the realization grew during the years from awe (\\"cool\\"?), through bleak horror, to appreciation of the comprehensiveness of its scientific terror or at least the understanding thereof.The \\"naughty\\" parts of 1984 - the reader will be on his/her own finding these - are few and rather tame by today's averages. The truly overwhelming and blunt description of the terror-managed society-continent of Oceania (along with its equal counterparts, Eurasia and Eastasia) creates a fascination which is hard to stop reading about. Part II describes how Oceania (and the other two) came about in the 50s and 60s and its development, told ingeniously through a \\"smuggled\\" anti-Oceania revolutionary handbook. The reader will not be able to put the book down here, nor fall asleep during its reading as did Julia, the main girlfriend in the book. Part III takes the reader through the imprisonment and interrogation of Winston Smith, the main character and victim. Further description here will only serve to ruin the story. The reader will almost certainly be infuriated at various places! Yes, the very recent - 1st half 2010 - unfortunate remark by a US government executive about a \\"boot on the neck\\" of a certain oil company will find the phrase said much earlier by Winston Smith's interrogator, \\"... imagine a boot stamping on a human face, forever.\\" In the paperback version, page 267.The reader will find little problem coming up with possible flaws with the functioning of Oceania. Some events and outcomes may not look likely. These do not matter. The governing \\"inner party,\\" a sharply-defined and merit-selected upper 2% of society, formed the most illiberal government imaginable, with the future destined to become more repressive even as the resistance becomes weaker, and stretching out forever. Further, this inner party had to believe in the party philosophy more rabidly, more thoroughly than the other 98% in order to remain in power. You will finish the book and ponder!"},{"Title":"1984","review":"George Orwell in his essay \\"Politics and the English Language\\" makes explicit his belief that language and thought are intricately intertwined, and in his masterpiece \\"1984\\" he makes this even more explicit.The protagonist Winston Smith is almost 40 years old in the year 1984, making him as old as George Orwell's adopted son who was born in 1944. Under the Ingsoc (English socialism) system, Smith is an Outer Party cadre, but what he really is as a writer. He is neither a Alexander Solzhenitsyn nor a Noam Chomsky because there simply is no tolerance for any dissent whatsoever. He is trapped not physically but mentally, and every second of his life is like torture to him. As a writer he, like Orwell, believes that language permits thought which permits the self. What Ingsoc enforces is the negation of language (Newspeak) and the negation of thought (doublethink) which equals the negation of self.Newspeak is the reduction of language ino meaningless absurdity, and thus Newspeak is the ultimate bureaucratic language -- it eliminates all the nuances and subtleties of the language, making it only functional. Newspeak is the ultimate straitjacket for a writer.Doublethink is a mode of thinking that accepts contradictions, holding two opposing ideas to be both true. Doublethink negates logic, and thus higher order mental processing. More nefariously, it creates servility in most men, and duplicity in some: most individuals cannot comprehend two competing ideas at once, and thus doublethink negates them into no-think; those geniuses who are capable of holding contradictions in their head automatically become deceptive and manipulative -- in holding two competing truths the person becomes the only truth.In \\"1984\\" there are two individuals capable of doublethink: Winston Smith and the book's antagonist O'Brien. Smith refuses to submit to doublethink, and instead seeks the freedom to pursue truth. He writes in a diary, a blatant crime, and he addresses his writings to O'Brien, who Smith correctly suspects can understand him. They are doppelgangers of each other, and their difference is in their attitude towards doublethink. If Smith is doublethink's greatest critic, then O'Brien is doublethink's greatest practitioner. If Smith cannot stand to live another day under Ingsoc, O'Brien is in fact Ingsoc, Big Brother, and the Party, for he alone is the truth. If O'Brien wishes to be Big Brother's greatest enemy he is the truth, and if he wishes to be Big Brother himself he is still the truth.Ingsoc is a system of slow banal torture, whereby individuals must voluntarily (under the threat of torture) surrender their selves to Big Brother. They are not permitted to write, to think, and above all to be intimate: the greatest act of rebellion by Winston Smith and Julia was to make love and to love each other. It is not enough for Big Brother to demand your obedience -- he must also control your thoughts and your memories.O'Brien is clearly a psychopath, and Smith is his plaything; O'Brien does not fear and hate Smith -- he is just contemptuous. For seven years, O'Brien had been watching Smith (\\"Big Brother is watching you\\"), and when Smith carelessly and faithfully went to O'Brien with his subversive thoughts then O'Brien's only thought could be: he's always known. Smith orchestrated his own sacrifice, but it was not a martyrdom: it was in fact just an escape from his life. If a writer cannot write, then that is a fate worse than death."},{"Title":"1984","review":"I am a history teacher and always recommend this novel to my class when we embark on the 20th Century single party states IB paper. Orwell lived during the era of the great dictatorships of the 20th Century and was acutely aware of the brainwashing techniques such regimes used to control their populations. The concepts are clearly and horrifically articulated so they rattle the brain - ideas such as Thoughtcrime, the scrutiny of our innermost mental processes, and newspeak - the rewriting of the language to prevent any freedom of expression.Yet, more than this, Big Brother can also be read as a piece of English pastoral - scenes where Winston Smith conducts his love affair with Julia in the countryside, and his dreams and memories of the 'rabbit bitten pasture' evoke a lament for a pastoral Britain in danger of being submerged by out of town shopping centres and motorway culture. George Orwell, changing his name from Eric Blair to encompass both England's patron saint and one of its main rivers, was a true patriot in the best sense. His writing holds moral clarity towards the best of British freedom, and encourages us to think for ourselves as to how to carve out our own independence.No, we are not currently living in a dictatorial regime, and whatever the shortcomings of the present parliamentary system it would be intellectually lazy and insulting to those who are living under such regimes to claim that we are. but Orwell's novel alerts us to the preciousness of the human mind, and its vulnerability to systemic outside forces that destabilise us. Which makes 1984 compelling literature."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Bought this book as a replacement. One of the best books ever in my opinion. Orwell was right, he just got the date wrong!"},{"Title":"1984","review":"It has been nearly 20 years since I first read \\"1984\\". I thought I hated reading as a child until I came across this book. It started me on my road of Poli-Sci-Fi books such as Animal Farm, Brave New World, etc. It also made me recognize my interest in Non-Fiction books such as histories and biographies.Reading this book as a teenager and now in my 30s- makes a world of difference. There was much that I had forgotten. Now that I'm older and worldlier, the point of this book is taken with much more concern. I do believe we have entered a stage in human history that consists of perpetual war and an eventual police state. While I read, I couldn't help but think of the tome written by historian Carroll Quigley, \\"Tragedy and Hope.\\" Fiction and non-fiction running a parallel course.Twenty years later, I still don't understand how George Orwell had such a keen grasp on human nature and managed to call himself a Socialist. This book and those like it birthed my Libertarian convictions. It is only with centralized governments, such as those that Socialism institute, that allow for such evils upon mankind as portrayed in this book.The \\"Why\\" doesn't matter. Whether its Winston's belief that The Party's purpose of power is due to the belief that men are \\"frail and cowardly creatures...and must be ruled over and systematically deceived by others who were stronger than themselves\\" OR O'Brien's admission that the The Party's purpose of power was simply for the sake of power. Whether Compassion or Despotism- the end result is the same. Man should never be allowed so much power over his neighbor, no matter the root cause of his intentions."},{"Title":"1984","review":"1984 is the biggest achievement of Eric Blair as a novelist and anybody even slightly interested in politics, history or the future should give it a read. I think 1984 is one of the few books which you can't skip reading and just watch the movie.

I've read it more than 5 times now, but the paperback copy from amazon is definitely the nicest edition I've had - printed on something that looks like recycled paper, roughly cut and printed in weird, but nice font - I recommend buying it."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Nineteen Eighty-Four is one of those books which you feel you must read at some point in your life, and after sitting on my shelf for a long time I finally decided it was time to pick it up.It is 1984 and in the state of Oceania, Winston Smith is struggling with the oppression of Big Brother. Everything is under the watchful eye of the party and with most things being banned, everyone must be very careful of what they do and even more so what they think. Winston is trying hard to hang on to his memories of when life was different, but nowadays he is starting to doubt if things were ever better or if everything was in his imagination. He does not agree with what the party is doing and has always had rebellious thoughts, but it is only when he decides to pursue a relationship with Julia that their actions bring him under the spotlight.I had great expectations for this book but I was somewhat disappointed to find that it was not what I always thought Nineteen Eighty-Four would be. The beginning was good and it had me hooked for a while, until it started to dwindle and even got a little tedious at times. I liked the premise however the characters seemed weak and most of them not very interesting. My biggest complaint about this book though has to be the entire excerpt from \\"The Book\\", this was too long and it quickly got boring, I would have preferred if there were shorter highlights or even just a brief description of the concept. If this book is meant to instill the fear of Big Brother in the reader, it didn't do that at all for me and that is probably why I was disappointed, I was expecting it to be more thought provoking in the way that Animal Farm was. I am still glad that I read Nineteen Eighty-Four and perhaps this would have been more valid in the time it was written, I am just a little let down that it wasn't the great book I was hoping for.I must say that I loved Animal Farm by the same author much more. When I finished Animal Farm I had to stop and think for a while and it was scary how true it felt. I expected to have the same reaction to Nineteen Eighty-Four but in the end it wasn't quite the same."},{"Title":"1984","review":"OK, I get it that this book is not merely about totalitarian regimes; rather, it is warning that \\"negative utopia\\" can stem from democratic societies, and things like doublethink, thought police and such can take the individuality from every person in the society, and so on ..But we are reading a novel, not a political thesis. In this book the writing is as bland as water, the characters are cardboard cutouts, and the story is boring. Judged by its literary merits, I simply cannot agree that it is a masterpiece."},{"Title":"1984","review":"I want to address the people who rated this book low because it is just a warning about communism or socialism, and people who rate it high for the same reason. There are many aspects to this book, and one of them is that Orwell is warning anyone who wants to go extreme socialism that you can never get rid of the upper class type people, because even if you get rid of all the upper class, there are still going to be people in the middle class who want to be upper class, and see the revolution as their chance to gain power, or make things equal between them and those in power. They don't want equality with the lower class, because they have nothing to gain from a society where everyone is middle class. This book helps revolutions, by warning them to be on the lookout for anyone trying to take power for themselves in the new government. It needs to be democratic in order to control those people. Orwell accepts it as inevitable that these people will always exist. The power hungry in America are mostly controlled by competitive elections, although having candidates that are similar defeats the purpose sometimes."},{"Title":"1984","review":"This is such a great book!

Orwell would not live to see that far into the future (having died only one year after the book's publication), but one can see how prophetic this novel is. Privacy has been a hot topic as of late, from the U.S. Patriot Act to the debate on abortion. This book conveys to the reader the true horrors of a \\"Big Brother.\\"He does this by the use of the world \\"telescreen\\" -- a device where Big Brother can see the citizen and even communicate (most notably with his demands and orders) with him/her. Actions of the citizens are not the only things controlled by the State; thoughts are controlled, and history is constantly rewritten to exclude all that threatens the State.

If you haven't read this book, and you are into politics, it is a must read for everyone!"},{"Title":"1984","review":"The term Big Brother is almost a cliche today, but I imagine most folks who use it have never read the book that made the name so infamous. For Orwell's purposes, Big Brother was the personification of \\"the Inner Party\\" or just \\"the Party,\\" that 1-2% group of elitists who ruled over the fictionalized country called Oceania [a.k.a., the UK, US and all other English-speaking countries].It's ironic that Orwell was so pessimistic throughout this book since he was himself a socialist. His idea of socialism, however, was not so malicious, even though just as powerful. Like most idealists, he had hoped socialism would bring about an end to elitism, where the law of the jungle would be managed by a brotherhood of man [Humanism, the religion of the New World Order]. By the late 1930's though, the soviet experiment was proving that true socialism was an impossibility for inevitably ruthless individuals always rise to the top, ulimately producing an oligarchy [rule by a few].I see in the figure Big Brother another evil that Orwell would never have suggested, being an atheist/humanist. Big Brother is the god of this world, the prince of darkness, the devil -- Satan. The issue that allows me to make this connection is knowledge. Note throughout 1984 that Big Brother's goal is to control minds by controlling knowledge. The \\"Proles\\" [85% of the people] were severely limited by their education, an education supplied [rationed] by the state. Sound familiar? Do you ever wonder why public schools are failing? Do you suppose it's possible they're actually succeeding in their intended purpose? Of course, a more forceful control was required of \\"Outer Party\\" members, that 10-14% given just enough education and training to perform complex tasks required by the state. Thus, the neccessity for the Thought Police [sort of like the PC pundits of today, only with official government power to cure thought criminals like pro-lifers, gun owners, Christian fundamentalists, etc.].Then too is the application of \\"Newspeak,\\" that effort by Big Brother to control the minds of everyone by limiting vocabulary. Although a limited vocabulary doesn't limit one's ability to actually think, it does limit one's ability to articulate what he or she is thinking, so that eventually the thought vaporizes. Knowledge is built on knowledge. Prevent a core knowledge from developing and you can essentially control how people think about certain issues. Unborn babies aren't babies; they become fetuses. Sexual deviants becomes gay. And enemies of the state become anyone refusing to accept the absolute authority of the state.Where does Satan fit in with this analogy with Big Brother? Was it not Satan who beguiled us regarding knowledge by asking, \\"Yea, hath God said?\\" He has always tried to control our knowledge of good and evil, even to the point of quoting Scripture to the Lord Jesus in an attempt to trick the very Son of God into doubting Himself, if not the Father. Shortly after the 66 books making up the Bible were established as canon, papal decree forbid the lay Christian from possessing a copy of the Bible. Why? More recently, modern bibles have been edited for political correctness and reflect the belief system of the Gnostics who were thriving in Alexandria, Egypt in the 4th Century. Gnostics denied the deity of Christ and absolute moral values, claiming only that which is spiritual matters, so what men and women do in or with their bodies does not. Thus the roots of moral relativism.All those who attempt to control knowledge, academic and biblical, are doing the bidding of Big Brother. Those who fall for it are little more than simple \\"outer party\\" members, foolish \\"proles\\" or scornful \\"inner party\\" members. Think about it.Other books similar to this one include the following: Animal Farm, The Deliberate Dumbing Down of America, New Age Bible Versions, The Underground History of American Education, Educating for the New World Order and Legally STUPiD: Why Johnny doesn't have to read."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Truly, a more bleaker look at the future you could never find.No one can advocate revolution, if the words to express revolution don't exist.A fascinating concept on the part of Mr Orwell.This is the only book I couldn't stop thinking about months after I'd read it,and now with CCTV cameras just about on every street corner, in every city of the world,makes this story more relevant now then when first published.If there's a bit of Winston Smith in us all, then there's probably a bit of the O'Brien character too.Fascinating and terrifying in equal measure.Down with Big Brother?.... not likely.This is most deservedly, a Classic.(First published 1949.)"},{"Title":"1984","review":"George Orwell did two supremely difficult things in this book: he wrote a brilliant polemic (unless you're a Communist, you'll know that polemics don't get any better). And he wrote a dark, unforgettable story in a perfectly crafted style. Ignore the polemic and you still have one of our best novels.Orwell gives us so many brilliant insights. I'll mention my favorite. Orwell saw that totalitarians will always hate beauty and try to drive it out of ordinary life. Why? Because beauty reminds people of what freedom feels like! This theme runs through 1984.Want to see Orwellian in action? Letting a far-left thinker like Erich Fromm write an essay for this book. Fromm manages to turn things upside down so that what Orwell is REALLY writing about is conformity in American corporations. Totalitarian twaddle."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Some books you read you enjoy and forget and then there are books that stick with you for the rest of your life. I can honestly say this is probably one of the most important books written in human history. One of the reasons is that it is an almost recognizably real dystopian world eerily close to the one we live in. This book is a stark warning of what we could become; what unchecked government erosion of liberty can eventually lead to.If you read this, you'll read the news in a different way.In the end, you'll love Big Brother."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Orwell's _1984_ has become such a part of everyday language, a re-reading was in order. I was amazed at how well his frightening vision of the future has withstood the test of time, and how easily one can read the present (whether the ealy 21st century or the mid-20th century) into his story. Truly, human nature has not changed (nor is it likely to.)Eric Blair, nee George Orwell, was a socialist and idealist whose hopes of a better world were dashed with the arrival of a Stalinist system in central Europe. His disaffection with this was the impetus for his book. It remains relavent today as governments contiune to attempt to manipulate and control their populations. (This has always been the case throughout history - a major difference now, of course, is the sophistication and technology at government's disposal - Orwell recognized this.)While Orwell's vision of the future has not come to pass (nor is it likely to), _1984_ remains one of the greatest books of the last century and is certainly worth a read - or a re-read as the case may be. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"1984","review":"George Orwell's bleak book is one of the top selling books of all time, currently selling over 750,000 copies every year. This volume is probably because many schools have the book as required reading, but it still shows just how important and powerful this book is in modern times.Written back in 1948, the book was primarily a warning against the communism of Soviet Russia and what that style of government could do to society. Many of the phrases and images in the book have become part of our culture. We expect people to understand what \\"Big Brother\\" means when we refer to it. We talk about the \\"thought police\\". If only to be able to understand modern conversation and references, this is a book to have familiarity with, just as having at least a passing knowledge of events in the Bible will help you understand references in culture to 40 days and 40 nights of floods, gathering animals up two by two, and so on.But aside from its position as a \\"foundation of certain phrases in society\\", how does the book stand as an actual story? As with most fables, it is very heavy handed. There are few shades of grey in this book. The government is Evil. Evil, Evil, Evil. They delight in being evil. The people are completely helpless and know this. They march around in their dingy lives, watching as things get progressively worse, and knowing they cannot do anything to change it. Their life is going to suck, and then they are going to die. Even if they break the rules to grab momentary happiness, they know that this is doomed. They will be found out eventually.It is impressive that a writer in the late 40s was able to come up with some of the technology that he did, the pervasive ability of the government to watch and scan everybody. The ability for a power (government, media, educational institutions) to mold the human mind subtly had already been shown over the centuries in a variety of situations, so that was less of a stretch. Go to any corporation, any university, and you'll find indoctrination being done at many levels, usually for \\"good cause\\". Building school spirit by uniting against a classic foe is all in fun - but that ability to build up hate so easily gives one pause.On the other hand, Orwell missed out on the power of massive computer networks. With the advent of TV and the Internet, viewers have the luxury of multiple information sources. This is something unprecedented in our history. Back in medieval days, you only knew what your local priest told you as far as news went. Most people could not read, and few traveled. Even in South Africa before apartheid was abolished they refused to bring in TVs, for fear that the population would be able to learn about life outside their own lands. That isolation is almost impossible in modern times. With a computer, you can gain access to news sources from around the world - both commercial and personal. You can hear, from people in Sudan, what life is like there. Even in countries like China where they attempt to control access to certain sites, there is always a way out, to find out from different sources what is going on.The book is still of course a cautionary tale, a warning of allowing any particular power to go too far. It is a look into the way human emotions can be manipulated, and how a society can be pressed down. However, it's important to remember this is a fable, a deliberate \\"Bleak! Despair! Death!\\" overly cynical view of things. In reality, we have seen *many* societies who were pressed down, and who successfully rebelled. Mankind is far more resiliant than portrayed here.SPOILER ALERTA key scene in the book involves the lead character's \\"betrayal\\" of his loved one. First he is tortured for months and months, something which makes little sense in any realistic viewing of these events. It is actually brought up by the character as being silly, and a throw-away answer is given. If the government actually spent this much time and effort feeding and torturing every single person who committed a crime, there would be no workers left. It is a plot device to ratchet up the tension in the story. The tension reaches its climax with a specific torture - the character is going to have a cage of rats attached to his head. This is, of course, his Worst Fear. To evade it, he asks that the box be put on his girlfriend instead. At this great betrayal, his heart is shattered.That this was some incredible failing that should have shattered his spirit does not make sense. Every human body has limits of emotional and physical pain. As much as we might value pride, honor, loyalty, love, or whatever else we hold dear, there will always be a point at which we will break. Knights who trained from birth to live a life of honor could be forced to confess if tortured for long enough. That is why things like cyanide pills exist in spy novels.Still, even though those parts of the story always nag at me when I read it, I do find the general lessons the book tries to convey to be quite important ones, and for that reason I definitely count this as a book that every adult should have read at least once."},{"Title":"1984","review":"1984 overview/reviewIn the beginning of 1984, Winston, you might think, is a normal Outer Party member, but when you get to the second chapter, it becomes clear that he is against Big Brother, the hero of the totalitarian state he lives in.An obscure friend of his, Syme, lectures him on newspeak at cafeteria's, his \\"Girlfriend\\", Julia, appears before as another Outer Party member, slipping a note into Winston's pocket in the bathroom, reading, \\"I love you\\".

Newspeak is the language of Oceania, and a propaganda language as well, the three slogans that the party has, \\"Ignorance is Strength,\\" \\"War is Peace,\\" and \\"Freedom is Slavery.\\" Are quite untrue, but the Proles choose not to worry about it, while party members use \\"Doublethink\\" mostly.Suggesting this is a good book is unworthy, this is an AWESOME book, so you should read it, get depressed."},{"Title":"1984","review":"1984 is a dark and melancholy novel depicting the life of the average intellectual in a totalitarian world. The decription is striklingly deep and realistic. People who have lived in authoritarian countries would connect a lot with this book.

After reading this book you will perceive life and history in a different way."},{"Title":"1984","review":"A preliminary:The site says that this is written by Erich Fromm and George Orwell. NOT TRUE. George Orwell wrote every word himself, and years later Fromm wrote a forgettable afterword. Do not give Fromm more credit than that.I own three copies of this book. I'm currently reading it for the second time and it's better than I remember. This book made me want to write, to teach, to forever immerse myself in the world of literature. It is the most superbly written novel of all time. After this, I devoured all of Orwell's books, to similar (but less) enjoyment. This is truly a book that changed my life. I recommend it to anyone who is capable of reading. Read it again if you've done so before. Put down \\"Brave New World\\" and \\"Farenheit 451\\" which cannot come close to the level of greatness achieved in this volume. Read this book. Read this book. Read this book.

Overall it is one of the best books i have ever read."},{"Title":"1984","review":"George Orwell's classic tale of a dysponic government ruling a futuristic society is, in my opinion, the greatest book I have ever had the pleasure to read. What is so disturbing about this story is how it parallels our own society. In an age where technology,media, and good old-fashioned human rotteness are all on an out of control path, it seems big brother is getting nothing but bigger. Orwell is not only an author of incredible talent, he could very well be an unknowing prophet. The best book of its kind anywhere!"},{"Title":"1984","review":"Although morbid, it's fitting to know that Orwell basically died writing this masterpiece, as it clearly encompasses a life's work.Cast your mind back fifty years. You read &quot;Animal Farm&quot; when it came out and enjoyed it immensely. Now this hits the market and blows everybody away by its grim forsight and bluntness.Whether you think Orwell's predictions were overly accurate or not, that's not necessarily the most important thing. Orwell portrays the *potential* that exists, clearly making this novel timeless. Change the name of the book to &quot;2044&quot; and it would be just as effective as it was fifty years ago. Too many people take Orwell's predictions literally, when in many ways it's a warning...Winston is Orwell, he is the tool, a technique Orwell neglected to use in &quot;Animal Farm&quot;. This book could easily have been written in first person, but the use of third person puts a necessary distance between Winston and the reader, meaning that although the reader shares all of his experiences, and the world he lives in, there is enough distance to look at the wider world.An interesting footnote I was praised for when I went to school that I have not seen anywhere else is to note the very striking parallels between Winston and O'Brien. I got the feeling that O'Brien basically *was* Winston years earlier, before he was &quot;cured&quot;. Behind the rock of the torturer, there is a feather of a man that does care, but isn't allowed to.This novel is what Orwell was trying to achieve. He scratched the surface in &quot;Animal Farm&quot; and went a lot deeper here."},{"Title":"1984","review":"This book is as powerful as it was when it was written. The universality of literature in this book is evident. It clearly shows the effects of totalitarianism and a loss of human spirit; this novel shows it almost as well as Anthony Burgess's &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot;, which holds the best novel of all time in my esteem"},{"Title":"1984","review":"This book describes an extreme situation of what totalitarianism can lead to. But I think that's just the power of the book; because the state, as talked about in the book,is an extreme example, but I think that extremes show the real danger of something; it makes you more aware of a situation (a state form, a social question etc.) than a report based on real facts does. therefore you also shouldn't take this book for real, but you should take parts of this books and compare them to reality. and by doing so you'll find a lot of things that form, as described in the book, dangers in present day society also. this book actually shows all what totalitarianism can lead to, and therefore enables you to see the danger of it"},{"Title":"1984","review":"1984 simply can't be described. It's the most fascinating and worthwhile book I have ever read. Orwell dares to ask 'what if...' and he succeeds in constructing a frightening yet possible situation for the citizens of the world. Great book."},{"Title":"1984","review":"It sure doesn't take much of an imagination stretch to realize that the society Orwell describes in 1949 is becoming reality in 1999.

Definitely get this book and read it-- just make sure you do it away from any telescreens...."},{"Title":"1984","review":"This book really makes you think about how powerless us, the citizens can be.

No book is with out flaws, however, but this book still deserves 100%."},{"Title":"1984","review":"I liked how true this book was, even though it was written 20 years before 1984. Most of the futuristic devises that Orwell was talking about came true. Such as, the security cameras and trackers in the airport. Also, the government was prying into your personal inforamtion. I believe that the society was high tech and the government had more laws to look at a persons information. Soon, the governmnet will be able to track anybody anywhere. Also, they will be able to read a person's thoughts and ideas. If a person wanted to revolt against the government they will be able to stop him/her before they can overthrow the government."},{"Title":"1984","review":"In these novel there are many actors,characters. To manintion the major actors like Winston Smith, O'Brien Mrs. Parasons,comrade Ogilvy, Mr. Charrington, Julia, were the one who make the novel very intersted to read. It is very hard to imagen to live in these kind of society,that had three kinds of people. One who control everything which is known as the Big Brother and they are the high class of Oceania society, and the other one who is manipulated by the high class ( Big Brother )known as the inner party or the middle class, and the last one of the kind that are living majority in Oceania and they are called the &quot;Prole&quot; or the outer party. All these stratarfication of society is because the government(Big Brother)want to controls and manipulates by any means, for example the telescreens, the newspapers, and the party people. I read it with wondering that If I was right there inside the Oceania's society, what would be like being control all the time. I even can not stand if my mother or my girl friend( whom I love the most) want to run my live. But you what is going on now a day, I thought that the telescreen and the televesion have a lot in commen to start with the TV. programmers manoipulates the people who watching the show by thew means of advertising."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Poignant, scary, and doused with a sense of unignorable urgency that is not as urgent as it was when Orwell wrote it. His horrifying prophecy thankfully did not come true, but prophecies aside, &quot;1984&quot; is an unmistakably brilliant account of a normal man's search for &quot;truth and decency&quot; in a frightful, loveless world. The novel is very hard to put down, and can be not only riveting, but genuinely entertaining at times. A true empathy for the characters, Winston and Julia, stems from a humanity which they possess and a love that we can recognize, that is contrasted by Orwell to the extreme squalor and general de-humanity of their surroundings. A definite must-read, &quot;1984&quot; is not only a fascinating novel, but its bleak and intense imagery, its memorable characterizations, and its involving narrative will stay with the reader long after completion. My favorite part is when O'Brien places Winston in front of the mirror, shows him his decayed body, the tells him that quite certainly, he is &quot;the last man.&quot;"},{"Title":"1984","review":"I have read this book many times and have written many of my high school english papers on it and others similar to it. I must admit that this type of fiction is not right for everyone and I do believe that you have to have a very open mindset to understand it. But to all of those who gave it 3 stars or less, I implore you to consider reading it again when you are older or willing to accept a new and different way of writing about our society and our future. No, it is not the type of book to be taken at face value, or exactly as it is printed. To really understand the thoughts of Orwell you have to be able to read between the lines and make the story and its lessons plausable in any time and with any society. There are many timeless lessons here, you just have to get past the actual fictional story. Just try it again when you are more openminded about novels."},{"Title":"1984","review":"This book changed my outlook on the future.

This is a stunning piece of art. The most impressive part is, to my opinion, part three in the book- where O'Brien makes Winston an 100% supporter for the Party. In this part, you can feel the pain, the panic, the screaming, and the range of anger junt under your skin. Also the flashback Winston had throughout the book where he's being selfish to his motherr and sister really touches, in some horrible-kind-of-way. My conclution- if you can handle this book, you can handle anything."},{"Title":"1984","review":"The main idea of the book is to portray how evil and corrupt the government is becoming. It continues to become more powerful and controlling as time goes by. In fact, the government is so powerful, that people no longer have freedom to make their own decisions in their lives. I think George Orwell wrote &quot;1984&quot; because he wanted to warn people how society was slowly becoming like Oceania's in which the people begin to think less and the goevernment gains more power. I feel this way because during Orwell's lifetime there were many wars being fought and he was in a few of them. I believe he saw how greed , power and money could change a government and ultimately become corrupt.I definitely recommend this book. It is such a touching, powerful story. George Orwell writes such an interesting, sad story that is totally plausible. &quot;1984&quot; is a &quot;haunting novel that creates an imaginary world that is completely convincing&quot; (back cover). The book just goes into so much detail from the character's mind. I love this book - it is just so thought provoking. I recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Orwell portrays a great image of a utopian sociaty, although the part in the story where Winston is reading &quot;the book&quot; is rather boring and takes a while to read.

You brush your teeth, you go to work, you eat, you talk to your spouse, you water your plants ...and they are watching. Not only is every activity monitored, but also your deepest inner thoughts are screened, picked and prodded through for the smallest indication of rebellious thoughts. Telescreens constantly feed propaganda from the government into unsuspecting minds. War is just a normal incidence. A neighbor or even a friend might turn you in to the thought police at any moment. The government is in total and complete control. You can trust no one. George Orwell created this enslaved world in the book, 1984 and put an ordinary middle class man, named Wilson, in the position of the protagonist.Wilson, an average member of this controlling society, begins to have an itch for rebellion as the novel, 1984 commences. He has an underlying craving for freedom, of thought and expression. He has a job that includes activities considered inappropriate by most of today's standards. Basically, Wilson edits history to fit the beliefs and preaching of Big Brother for the populace. Wilson finds a forbidden love. He searches for a sympathizer, someone who shares his same beliefs and values. But above all, he searches for clues about the past and the truth. Suspense, Deceit, and Passion are foremost components in this novel.For many students and adults alike the thickness as well as the font size of the novel sends them running. Others find the genre that the paperback is placed in - Science Fiction - to be discouraging. And many of those who do actually start reading are quickly bored. Some, who are required to read it, hurriedly skim the pages and discontinue comprehending and processing the book.The story doesn't begin to pick up steam until about thirty pages into it. However these first pages are essential to have a complete understanding of the book. After that, Orwell adds depth and dimension to the plot that is unlike many stories. Orwell also adroitly applies high-level vocabulary and sentence structure to his tale. 1984 is exciting and gripping with a distinctive and unforeseen ending. It is a chilling tale of what could happen to the human race in the midst of the race for technology and an unattainable utopia. Encrusted with many essential and important themes, every student should read it, so they can reflect on their individual lives and prevent possible future atrocities from coming to fruition.This novel is well worth anyone's time and thought. It is not just your average run-of-the-mill science fiction story that will captivate only the Trekkies among us. 1984 is thought provoking as well as emotionally stimulating. This narrative, written more than half a century ago, still applies today. It ends in a unique and unpredictable way."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Of all of George Orwell's works, \\"1984\\" must rank as his most famous, most known and most read book - and with good reason too. It depicts a society under the iron grip of a totalitarian terror state, where the Thought Police are in control, and the population is held under the mystical will of \\"Big Brother\\", the unseen leader of the ruling party. Orwell's protagonist, Winston Smith, is incredibly unique in the sense that he enacts a rebellion, and demonstrates a small vestige of free thought that one believes has been completely eradicated by the Party.As a lower-level propagandist in the Ministry of Truth, Winston is a participant in the very system that he believes himself to be rebelling against. His duties include disposing of unwanted, or potentially dangerous historical facts, and the alteration of past newspaper articles to suit the line of he Party. This can range from the amount of chocolate in the week's ration, to the wartime enemies of the state. Nothing in Winston's world, is what it seems. Orwell's masterful prose takes the reader through the progessive stages of Winston's \\"rebellion\\", from his writing of \\"Down with Big Brother\\" in his secretive diary, to his love affair with Julia, a co-worker at the Ministry of Truth - and a notorious philanderer (this however, is pleasing to Winston!)Orwell makes excellent use of the contrasting themes of hope and despair to weave a complex tapestry of Oceania's political system. As it turns out, Winston's perceived success is a mere illusion, as he finds himself unable to trust any of his fellow citizens (the Thought Police are personified in a humble, ageing shopkeeper, who reveals himself upon having gained Winston's trust). The tragedy of Orwell's novel is that whatever hope is created by Winston's rebellious actions (such as his dissent in his diary, his affair with Julia, his enquiries about the past times) is countered by the overwhelming revelation that the omnipotence of the Party is unsurpassed. The reader could even conclude that Winston was lead from the nose by the very system he believed he was challenging.The novel ends on a grim note, with Winston experiencing frightful torture in the chambers of the Ministry of Love, and reconditioned as yet another mindless, thoughtless and conforming pawn in the never-ending game played by the Party upon it's own people.Orwell's tragic novel also had political relevance in reality. Written in 1948 (hence the title), Orwell was in fact writing a searing indictment of a totalitarian system that is the identical twin of that depicted in these pages - Stalinist Russia (Big Brother's description is a mirror image of Stalin). Stalin's reign of state-sanctioned terror, brutality and thuggery lasted from 1929 until his death in 1953, and during the Second World War (when the Soviet Union was the ally of Great Britain and the USA against Nazi Germany), Orwell was one of the few British political commentators who had the courage and will power to reveal the true nature of their so-called \\"ally\\". Through reading Orwell's masterpiece, one can draw a solid conclusion as to how life was in Stalin's terror state 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.Orwell's most endearing work is testimony to the value of human liberty and why we should never let it be wrested from us."},{"Title":"1984","review":"This book demands many readings; every time you do so you will gain something you missed (mainly because you will, hopefully, mature between each reading and thus gain heightened awareness of the subtleties of the novel). I disagree with another reviewer who said this could never happen; anyone with a cursory knowledge of Nazi Germany or Communist Russia can tell you it almost did happen. In Germany children denounced their parents to the Gestapo; in Russia there were purges of all political opponents. In both countries, there was history revision to suit the government. Hitler attempted to create a perfect society chillingly like 1984's Oceania, with all unattractive or deviant elements eliminated or pushed aside (like the proles). Also, anyone who has read The Brothers Karamazov can see the strong influence of \\"The Grand Inquisitor\\" in this book.The book is terrifying not so much in its view of the future but in its climax, when the Party proves itself capable of destroying all human feeling and individuality. Winston believes he will die hating Big Brother, and thus be free, but in the end he is killed with only love in his heart for the Party and B.B.; there can be no freedom. The story shows Winston as the last of his kind, the last with memory of the past and hatred for the Party combined. In the end both are eradicated; the Party controls everything. It has the power to say 2+2=5, and can prove it so; it can repeal the laws of nature and no one can perceive it otherwise. Winston Smith knew how to die free, but the Party destroyed even the desire to do so. It did not kill him until it knew he was \\"cured\\" and loved Big Brother. No one can be free; only the Party can exist in people's minds.Horrifying, and absolutely necessary. This is the most important book ever written."},{"Title":"1984","review":"The best anti-utopian book imaginable!And yes, there are many and a lot of them take themselves too seriously and are quite pompous. 1984 also takes itself seriously but it has a right to. It is so well written that gravity is the only appropriate sentiment in a very dark world.Most people have heard of Big Brother and the Thought Police and the hype over and over again. Is 1984 really that good? Yes!The most moving scene for me was at the end, when a character succumbs under torture to betray someone (hope I'm not giving too much away - after all torture and betrayal are compulsory ingredients in an anti-utopia anyhoo) and the empathy portrayed in the book was so strong that I got depressed because I felt like it was ME that just betrayed everyone I care for.A wonderful book, a must read especially since it can be done in a day (and should definitely take no more than 2!). Unlike the anarchists and conspiracy theorists who reckon 1984 is especially relevant &quot;in today's global climate&quot;, I say it's a book for all time."},{"Title":"1984","review":"George Orwell's 1984 is a book about control in the reality of his world to the connection it has to ours; it's fascinating and shocking how Orwell was able to see a world such as the one in his book. The book is a prediction and shadow of our world today. Ever since Orwell published his book, it has been like a bible to people everywhere. This book is fascinating not because of the feeling put into it, but because of how it shows and gives the reader a sense of how humanity is and can become like the world in Orwell's book.The only freedom shown in the world of 1984 is the self-thought of what the word actually means. Winston Smith is the man who experiences this and leads us through this horrible world. He doubts the righteousness of the totalitarian government (Big Brother) that rules Oceania, (one of three superstates in the world of 1984). The book starts with Winston and then shows how Big Brother (the government) is unreal. The government made its own language, is at constant war with the other two superstates, and watches its citizens at all times. As Winston's rebellion develops, we see how Big Brother is not as unreal as we think, he seems real, and to all the citizens he is real, this is what helps control Oceania the belief of Big Brother.Oceania, Eastasia, and Eurasia are the three battling superstates. All want control, have the same kind of government, and are at constant war to obtain what they want. The process used to get absolute power is one used by past, present, and future dictators, like Stalin, Mussolini and Hitler. Big Brother manipulates its citizens psychologically into suitable ways of thinking. Instead of only using propaganda techniques, Big Brother also uses something called Newspeak and telescreens. Newspeak is the official language of Oceania, and it is used to control the citizens' unorthodox thinking. Winston works at the base of Newspeak; he changes words, news, stories, and information for the government. The telescreens monitor each citizen and stop them of their privacy, revolt, or un-orderly behavior.Winston meets a girl named Julia who also feels the same as Winston does about Big Brother. They become lovers and their relationship leads them to what gives the reader the true sense of what the book is truly about. The backbone of Big Brother (the government) is revealed. When Orwell shows what really is Big Brother, gives the reader the true sense of the masterpiece of George Orwell's book.The manipulative technique used by Big Brother to control their citizens is unrecognizable; it is all about mind control. The secret for Big Brother's success is doublethink, the power of holding two contradictory beliefs in one's mind simultaneously and fully accepting both. Big Brother is supposedly a person, the head leader of the government in the book 1984, but he doesn't exist. The government controls people by creating a false leader with a system of mind control.The book shows us how a government can become powerful and how it is possible in our world today. The thought of the possibility actually happening is frightening because our world now can become the world of greed for control, violence, mystery, and slavery that is shown in the book 1984. That is what makes this book so good; it truly pulls us into the reading because the reality in the book and our life, is paralleled by the possibility that can exist."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Cynical, pessimistic, and utterly untrusting of the motives of anyone in a position of power. It's all you need to decipher any political speech, posturing or campaign."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Read this book. No matter what your political affiliations, this classic will open your eyes to the dangers of conformity and control. In Orwell's chilling vision, only opinions and views approved by the State are permitted. Is the world we live in today so very different? Yes and no. No, we are not arrested for listening to the Dixie Chicks. Nor are we jailed for reading Ann Coulter. Yes, there are those in positions of influence (on both sides of the political spectrum) who would probably like to make a few such arrests. Just kidding ... maybe.This book is brilliantly written, the characters well-developed and compelling, the setting frighteningly real. The central thrust of this novel is the idea that being able to tell the truth is essentially being free to comment upon the world as you understand it. We all have different points of view, none of which represents the sum total of reality. Orwell creates a world where the ruling powers dictate the perception of reality to the masses. Reading this book will help to train you to identify this practice in the modern world and, hopefully, also train you to resist."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Being a ninth-grader, I looked over the required reading list for high-school and saw that later, incoming juniors had to read 1984. I don't know about you, but I looked at the book and in my opinion it looked quite bulky. I figured I should start reading it now and in two years I might finish it. Surprisingly, though, the book read awfully quickly. Parts of the book are so terrifyingly captivating that I was drawn in, and at points I just found myself reading faster and faster. The reason for this is: not only does Orwell use stunningly descriptive language combined with expert storytelling, the message is clear and profound: A government can only be as perfect as the people running it and living under it, and we should not try to make people perfect. By purging man of evil, we also destroy his good, and drain all humanity from him. Orwell gives future peoples a choice: a perfect society in which people are mindless drones, or a society in which we are human and do our best.In the story, we see a society in which people cannot step one toe out of line, or they are swept away to the Ministry of Love, a vividly and horrifically described torture chamber where one is mutilated physically, mentally and emotionally until one corrects his way of thinking to match that of the Party, an all-powerful upper-class which can very well proclaim that 2+2=5.After reading \\"Animal Farm,\\" I expected \\"1984\\" to be a satire on government of the day. I found it hard to believe that the two books were written by the same author. \\"1984\\" is much, much deeper and warns us that a greater power than the government of our day may soon arise to steal away our humanity. Since we are supposed to be the future, I suggest that any high school students read this book (hey, it's probably going to be required reading sooner or later, right?)Orwell takes the reader from the depths of fear to the height of romantic literature to a spark of hope and then back to fear again in a highly powerful novel, and a good read."},{"Title":"1984","review":"In the book 1984, George Orwell depicts a dystopia, a world that went wrong, a world of manipulation and control which uses its people against themselves like pawns. It provides stimulating themes of dehumanization, isolation, repression, loneliness, social class disparity and abuse of power. Orwell has mixed these themes and has blended them into a classic image of a dystopian world. 1984 was meant as a warning against totalitarian tendencies rather than a prophetic work. These various fears and uncertainties disclosed in 1984 can be perceived as a reflection of today's society.Although 1984 was written in 1948 and published in 1949, Orwell was successful in portraying the world's totalitarian society-which exists today. He was able to prophesize about what the world is going to turn out like. As the year 1984 has passed, many think of Orwell as a skeptic or just a mere critic, while the case is quite different. George Orwell's predictions have been proved to be quite accurate. 1984 is the first book which gives us an accurate insight on today's world. This thought-provoking book encourages the reader to believe that this stereotype society of today is actually under control of governments which are hiding things from the local public. By giving examples, 1984 shows how these governments and \\"big fish\\" can use innocent people as puppets for their own use and tools for their own machinery.Some of the dark shadows portrayed in 1984, like subjugation, social class discrepancy and abuse of power can be eye-openers. One of the worst realities/fears disclosed in 1984 is invasion of privacy and oppression by the government. These factors count as the crux of 1984 and the message Orwell wants to convey to his readers. Invasion of privacy by the government is revealed at every stage, as the chapters of 1984 unfold. Evidence such as \\"Big Brother is Watching You\\" and the monitoring of actions by the telescreen and the police patrol system, which keeps track of people and check over what people are doing, clearly shows that there is no privacy in the dystopian world exposed in 1984. This invasion of privacy of the people of Oceania, keeps them from living their life like normal people and this is how Orwell convinces readers to avoid any path that might lead toward such societal degradation.Orwell's main goals in 1984 are to depict the frightening techniques a totalitarian government (in which a single ruling class possesses absolute power) might use to control its subjects, and to illustrate the extent of the control that the government is able to exert. This totalitarian society shown in 1984 is indirectly related to the invasion of privacy which is further connected with the oppression by the government. This domination of the government in Orwell's dystopia can be seen in various instances, like the unsanitary and squalor conditions of Airstrip One, which indirectly makes it possible for the government to suppress the locals. Another technique of repression is that of how they tell incorrect numbers of increase or decrease in ration production etc. By carrying these type of activities, the government is not only hypnotizing the citizens of Oceania but the government is also making them realize that they are helpful and concerned about the welfare of their society, which makes the ignorant people of Oceania (proles) happy and satisfied with their helpless lives, and most of them do not even understand that the Party is oppressing them.Of course, the world that Orwell envisioned in 1984 did not materialize. Yet 1984 remains an important novel, for the alarm it sounds against the abusive nature of authoritarian governments, but even more so for it's in depth analysis of the psychology of power and the ways that manipulations of language and history can be used as mechanisms of control. Examples such as how America is trying to take over all the resources of the world and how it is trying to tap phone calls and keep an eye of what is going on all over the country are all examples of invasion of privacy and the initial process of the formation of a totalitarian society. If a person focuses on today's world, he will surely be able to visualize a world which has not come under authoritarian rule today, but a world which will definitely materialize in Orwell's words, tomorrow. Though the world did not fall under authoritarian control as Orwell feared it might, 1984 has not become dated; it remains an invaluable book, warning against a world that could come into existence and a world that has not completely escaped from the dystopian dangers that Orwell once described.1984 has definitely found its place in the world of literature. It is a book that awakens those people who are victims of autocratic governments. It awakens people from their robotic lifestyles. 1984 gives a chance to all its readers to grasp the realities of totalitarian regimes and how innocent people are hypnotized and used as automations. 1984 is unquestionably a worthwhile read. It is simply mind grasping, thought provoking and mesmerizing. This is what makes George Orwell a genius of the 20th century."},{"Title":"1984","review":"1984 is centered around a male worker by the name of Winston Smith.

Althought it leaves much to be figured out by the reader, it is extremely descriptive. Even if you follow the story closely, each new step is a shock, and every discovery will intrigue.

Orwell's compelling story of the the future not only presents an interesting and suspenseful plot but also warns the world of a possible society that seems good on the outside but is rotten on the inside. Orwell makes a powerful point that government control can lead to the worst, particularly when it monitors every aspect of peoples' lives. He also demonstrates the fact that conformity and sameness is not necessarily happiness. I think Orwell was commenting more on communism and totalitarianism than our society, since Americans are allowed to be indiviudals, plus we have the right to freedom of speech (along with freedom of thought). Personally, I would not be able to survive in the world of 1984, where one cannot think what they please, where emotions and ideas are constantly supressed and destroyed. Overall, I thought this was an absolutely amazing book. I especially enjoyed the fascinating concept of doublethink. I recommend this novel to anyone who wants to read a good eye-opening and thrilling book. I plan on reading it again myself."},{"Title":"1984","review":"I believe George Orwell was a visionary, a bit imaginative, but very intelligent nonetheless. His views on individual privacy and freedom of thought in 1984 are a very serious issue.Freedoms are beginning to be limited in our country, whether in the form of tighter airline security or the banning of books in schools. What is next, the ultimate oppression of our thoughts? What would it take for a government to control thought?In 1984, the majority of Oceania's inhabitants are compliant with \\"Big Brother's\\" oligarchical totalitarianism. This greatly bothers me because I think that in the event of another devastating depression era, the world could again turn to radical forms of government, including ones similar to the principles of \\"Ingsoc\\" (English Socialism).Some say that society would never resort to supporting such a system; with this I must disagree. Take a look at leaders like Lenin, Mussolini and Adolf Hitler. Society followed these destructive men regardless of what some knew then, but all know now. The people wanted change-needed it; they were desperate, and this will happen again.Will you be a denier? Ultimately, a system resembling Ingsoc will be an option, with thoughtcrime as its consequence. Do you wish to keep your privacy, your freedom to thing? I do."},{"Title":"1984","review":"I think that part of the impact of 1984 is lost now - I think it meant A LOT more to my parents growing up in the '60s.

It is a muscle that grips the attention unrelentingly from first to last like a vice, rearranging your consciousness and perception. I pick this book up and cannot believe it is so light. Because, to read it is like the feeling Winston gets when he looks at the pyramidal headquarters of The Party: \\"It's too big. It can never be destroyed!\\"Orwell, more than any historian, made the greatest stain on the memory of Stalin with this book. 1984 poses the terrifying proposition of what would happen if insane leadership were not deposed as happened in Soviet Russia. It is also a euphoric, exhilarating plea for individuality. The right to think differently, the right to act differently. The simple, basic, human right to be an individual. Is there a more salient point to be made? I doubt it."},{"Title":"1984","review":"i thought the book 1984 was the most well written book ever"},{"Title":"1984","review":"I read this book many years ago and have re-read it several times. This is a must-read for all who would dare to close their minds for it describes the end result of a dictatorial society in which no-one is allowed to think, speak or publish freely. The &quot;Thought Police&quot; will punish anyone trying to do so! It is an exciting storyline with a profound message. Yet, despite all our freedoms there are not many such thoughtful, newly written books on the store shelves these days. I would therefore, like to sincerely recommend one that issued recently. It too reminds us to keep an open mind and lend an ear to our global ecological mess. It is a sharp 21st century social critique in the form of an exciting, fun and enlightening science-fiction, entitled, &quot;ACCUSED BY FACET-EYES&quot; (C.B. DON) --- and just like &quot;1984&quot;, it too makes one stop to ponder about our many thoughtless human actions...but thank goodness that we have the freedom to do so!"},{"Title":"1984","review":"Yes, this book is simple to understand by anyone. You do not need to be a philosopher or literature student. This book illustrates Orwell's vision of what would happen if humanity saught a utopian society. This is a book not of the pleasure and perfection we usually think about with utopian literature. It is the anti-utopia. This book will allow you to see humanity in it's true light.Orwell uses the ideals of 'the party', 'big brother' or a governmental power to illustrate his point on socialism. What ever Orwells means are, the fact remains that we can replace his governmental control with that of any particular group, and their need for complete power. It is the great agenda conspiracy. He makes his point. What I gather from the deeper meaning of this book is that humanity has an agenda. To gain power and create the world they wish it to be. Power is to be a God. This is the type of book that can be stripped down and analzyed page by page philosophically.The book is about a man named Winston. It is about his struggles to survive the world he exists in. A world where individuality, religion, unorthodoxy, love, compassion, and free thought are crimes punishable by torture and death. The party and big brother are all people in this world are to live for. They are not to live for themselves or their fellow humans. Hate is taught, war is life, the people are simply cogs in the party machine. They are worse than slaves, they are objects in the party's main goal...power."},{"Title":"1984","review":"There are only a few books that I believe should be on the required list for any student; this is one of them.1984 represents the world that we most feared; it is a world where pain is synonymous with living, and illusion is synonymous with progress.This book is designed to scare everyone who reads it into imagining a world where there is no such thing as personal freedom, there is no private property, and the ability to love is a crime against society.Prior to the fall of the Soviet Union in the early 1990's, this was the staple vision of what we considered to be the future of Western Europe and Asia. It is this horrific vision of an all-comsuming and controlling State apparatus that keeps the reader thankful for what freedoms we do enjoy.Orwell elegantly argues that the true danger of the world is that people can be easily manipulated, controlled, and ultimately defeated in the struggle for individuality. Like its counterpart, Brave New World (by Huxley), Orwell creates a world in which individuality is not only lost, but humanity forgets that we ever had the capacity for it.Orwell masterfully describes every detail of this world, with the greatest care to the cold, and impersonal touch of opression. His arguments are both compelling and smattering of intense nuggets of rhetorical flavor; once you begin this book, you will not want to stop. Moreover, you will feel compelled to continue as you are drawn into the intense world of helplessness and despair that every fiber of your being will rage against. I urge any interested reader to dig into this book, and to finish it in one sitting if possible."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Viewed one way, George Orwell's work reads like a quasi-biography. The protagonist, Winston Smith, is a man trapped in a totalitarian society whose first major act of the novel is to begin a diary, so that people in the future can piece together what his present was like and what the past was like, too. That, of course, is exactly what Orwell was doing: writing this novel as a warning to future generations. Orwell was not, as one earlier viewer noted, ahead of his time. He was very much a man of his time. The world during the period preceding and contemporaneous with his work was afire with the sorts of totalitarianism - Nazism, Communism, well-intentioned but disastrous Keynsian socialism - descibed in this work. F.A. Hayek's book (\\"The Road to Serfdom\\") on the threat socialism was to basic human freedom, which may or may not have influenced this work, came out around the same time. Orwell makes it personal. And he reminds us, rightly & properly, to fear anyone who would bend and distort the truth for their own purposes. When others fear the truth WE have reason to fear THEIR motives. We have, of course, seen this recently: the college newspapers refusing to print an anti-reparations ad or the theft and destruction of conservative newspapers on college campuses. No one who genuinely believes in the validity of their argument need fear the effects of dissent: if wrong, it still helps them to clarify their argument; if right (presuming they care for the truth), it serves as a valuable course correction.Orwell's novel also serves to show the importance of organizations - civic groups, churches, even corporations - as a bulwark against government power. Without them, the government can quickly crush any individual it deems a threat. A lone voice in a large country is seldom heard. The freedom of assembly allows men to magnify their voices. In this novel there is nothing that stands between the government and its citizens. When the government is able to bend any group to its will (think of the lawsuits against the Boy Scouts or the Rotary Club), nothing stands in its way, and the end is truly near.Given the dreariness of the movie I was rather scared to pick up this famous novel - I was 12 when that red letter year came around, and I wholly remember the hype. But through the depressing storyline the personal struggle of Winston Smith shines through. And so does the storyline of mankind itself."},{"Title":"1984","review":"This book is a real kick in the face for anyone who has read it.

The plot follows thirty-nine year old Winston Smith, who struggles with accepting the seemingly immortal regime. Much of the literature and other media that deals with totalitarian society owes its elements to the ones developed in Ninety Eighty-Four, and sometimes it's hard to recognize that that which has now become clich&eacute; was still novel at the time of publication. I think this contributes to the first part of the novel feeling quite slow. However, one thing to keep in mind is that while some plot elements may seem predictable, the reader should be prepared to be pleasantly surprised. One major flaw in the work, in my opinion, is that the narrative grinds to a halt about two-thirds of the way into the book. Orwell introduces what is essentially a treatise on the society he constructed. While fascinating at first, I found that it detracted from my overall enjoyment of the work. The last one hundred pages, however, make it completely worth it. The psychological elements here are terrifying, and even the reader begins to lose hope in this frightening but always possible future. Orwell sends a stark warning to future generations with this novel, which makes it plain to see why it has become such a classic. I would recommend to anyone to re-read if they had read it in their youth."},{"Title":"1984","review":"George Orwell's genius and prophetic book does not need my review. I would only mention that Orwell made also a scientific and sociological discovery that is valid in today's world: If you change the very meaning of words, if you change the language, you are able to change the society. Newspeak can destroy the Western civilization. Change the very meaning of words 'justice,&#34; &#34;freedom,&#34; &#34;fairness,&#34; and we will be in the Stone Age in no time.Kindle addition looks good, and its new X-Ray feature is interesting and helpful."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Narratively speaking, it's no more than an average story. In fact, there are many plot gaps and false steps. But the implications itself are staggering. Somewhere along the way, this book becomes less science fiction and more science fact. Orwell accurately predicts the advent of things like \\"perpetual wars\\" -- not for the sake of winning, but for the sake of warring for profit, and \\"doublespeak,\\" or, as we refer to it now, political euphemisms, or \\"political correctness.\\" When our politicians sidestep an uncomfortable question by answering one that was not asked instead? that is Orwellian. Even the questioner, apparently, has forgotten what he or she just asked. And when the motive behind a question becomes the question itself, supplanting the original, that too is Orwellian. The removal of certain words from the english language to cover up crimes? It's Orwellian, and comes straight out of 1984 -- as when torture suddenly becomes \\"harsh interrogation techniques.\\" And it is happening more and more; more, perhaps than we'd like to admit. For the good of more, the less are squashed, and the president mangles his principles. There are many people today who believe wholly in a past which in fact never actually existed -- unless it was on shows life Leave it to Beaver and Father knows Best."},{"Title":"1984","review":"All starting to sound familiar... great book.

The Soviet Union was flooding fear into the world, this book gave a conception to the possibility of communism taking over. And it did this in the most conventional way possible, the book gives the perspective of a normal man in a world that he fears completely. Constantly retaliating in his mind but to scared to actually revolt. I highly recommend this book to everyone, its one of my favorites and definitely worth your time."},{"Title":"1984","review":"If you've never read this book, one should.

Orwell's narrative retains its relevance because we still seem to go through phases where the freedoms of the enlightenment are challenged from many angles. Whether you read Big Brother as Joseph Stalin or Sam Walton and The Party as being representative of a fascist or communistic authoritarian State, the \\"truth\\" of this novel, that liberty, personal freedom, and the freedom to speak and be understood are ideals that should be treasured and protected in practice. As long as there are human beings who wish to control and eradicate the humanity of others, 1984 will remain a novel worth reading."},{"Title":"1984","review":"An eye opener vision of how far big government, big business, and any dictator can control apathetic people and societies when we decide to go with the status quo. We don't want to lose our jobs so we accept compromising what is right -- it gets easier every time. How about putting the fun and easy things in life before fixing the things in our nation, neighborhoods and families that are failing. More laziness leads to freedoms lost when peoples of a nation live with the mindset of let the government take care of us , let's trust them to do what is best for us without complaining when the loss of our freedoms are disappearing ,slowly, but usually in the guise of - being told these laws will be better for our safety, our pocket books, the health of the earth etc... Apathy to the extent of having 1+1=3 be an acceptable \\"reality\\".... we reap what we sew and a whole nation sewing apathy seeds in their lives every day paves a path to our own destruction.Look at what is on TV we have shows telling us vampires, big foot, werewolves, zombies etc... may be or are a reality , how many people believe this nonesense... again I say we reap what we sew. Orwells 1984 is well on its way to becoming reality and noone cares enough to ban together in thought and ideals to say 'no more' . The USA constitution reminds us that people are willing to suffer all kinds of evils and do nothing until the suffering is absolutely unbearable. That in my opinion is the reality of todays' America. And it is the picture so clearly painted by George Orwell in his book 1984. I would give the book a 5 , it deserves a 5 , but my heart cannot stand the thought of the horrors my grandchildren and great-grandchildrens lives will be if we pass them our legacy of apathy - sheep led to slaughter, by the actions (or nonaction) of our own laziness."},{"Title":"1984","review":"I want to give you all a heads-up about what reading this book did for me. The more objective things are well documented and I don't want to go into that. Reading this book really got to me, gave me creepy feelings about my own hard childhood in the family gulag and made it hard to sleep for a few nights. I guess my comment is that a prospective reader might think about this kind of affect and mull things over before getting into it. The book is well written, for sure, and Orwell keeps the action going...but that action literally goes straight to hell. Not an easy read--at least for me it wasn't."},{"Title":"1984","review":"The Kindle Edition of 1984 is incredibly sloppy.

Written over 50 years ago, this book was to serve several purposes, one being a warning to the present that a future like this, however fantastic and unbelievable, could be in the making should we allow for it to happen.Winston leads the dull life of a worker, not encouraged to think, or dream, for feel for himself. His whole life must be driven to support the Party, which promulgates an apparent non-entity Big Brother as the supreme one. Winston early on shows the spark of individuality that the Party so wants to extinguish; by daring to write a journal on his own, he seals his fate early in the story. Soon he meets Julia, another worker, who charms and dares him even further to enocurage having an affair. Together they make a lethal pair, and some lethal decisions, which leads to the great climax in the Ministry of Love.What lies in the story is an amazing prophecy of government gone mad. The Party believes in creating present truths by writing and rewriting the past on its whim. The Party understands in order to control the people, it must control the language, thereby, creating \\"Newspeak\\". The Party makes people simply vanish, eradicating them from existance. The Party realizes the people who follow are merely plebians in society, and therefore, should be encouraged to not think for themselves. In fact, the Party is able to directly lie to the people, using \\"doublethink\\", where they say one thing but mean the other.How much of Orwell's nightmare is something that can be true today? Do we have a government out of control, one that manipulates information for its own benefit, to justify war, ensure fear and terror reigns over the country; one that illegally detains people without trial, right to counsel, or even being charged with a crime; one that wants to extensively monitor our personal phone calls, e-mails, the books we check out of the library, the things we buy in stores. The dots are there to connect them; the challenge is, will you dare to do it, like Winston Smith dared?I believe 1984 is ultimately a hopeful book. Orwell wants to challenge humanity, that during times of crisis, we are able to rise up and change things, so the fateful prophecy so nobly and horrifyingly espoused in 1984 , will only stay between the covers of the book. The choice is up to us."},{"Title":"1984","review":"1984 is unquestionably one of the greatest books in the history of English literature. A terrifying look at the dangers of totalitarian government, it is ingeniously written and scarily realistic. George Orwell is meticulously thorough in his depiction of a world that is bleak, hopeless, and horrifying--and perhaps not as distant as we think. The writing style is factual and almost impersonal, reflecting not only the government but the people themselves, who have been reduced to unthinking robots. Protagonist Winston Smith's resistance against Big Brother (the symbolic leader of the Party) and ultimate complete acceptance and execution demonstrate the debility and irresolution of the human mind and spirit. The authoritarian government itself is eerily familiar, complete with conspiracies, cover-ups, and double-dealing politicians. While the year 1984 is long past, the book is still a relevant and potent warning of what the future may bring if we let it. The concept of 1984 is brilliant, the writing is brilliant, and it is nearly impossible not to love this book. 1984 is a definite must-read for anyone. Enthusiastically recommended; 5 stars."},{"Title":"1984","review":"That is what George Orwell warns us against in his bone-chilling and now increasingly accurate description of a world of revisionist history and massive invasion of privacy, abetted by technology to produce a society of conformity and fear.Borne out of Orwell's personal experiences in Burma (the present day, repressive Myanmar) and his observations of totalitarianism at mid-Twentieth Century, \\"1984\\" is the story of an average bureaucrat of middling intelligence who seeks no more than to be a whole man who can think and speak his mind, display passion outwardly, and not lie awake wondering who may be watching him. Paranoia rules. Orwell gives us a riveting, sometimes grotesque explanation of what it finally takes in \\"1984\\" for one man to try to restore whatever remains of his genuine identity and self-respect.Since the first publication of this timeless work around 1948 (reverse the digits, you're through the looking glass), Orwell's philosophical sentries have made a point of looking for examples in recent history to prove how prescient he was, and those signposts abound. For example, in the U.S., the Department of War was renamed the Department of Defense (Newspeak), a soldier in Vietnam had to \\"destroy the village to save it\\" (Doublethink), certain municipal hate crime legislation was enacted to curb the utterance of mean-spirited language short of action, and law enforcement officials began publicly naming so-called \\"persons of interest\\" and spending years tracking their activities under the microscope of media coverage. Later, opponents of the Iraq War were branded by the government as unpatriotic (Thought Police). Overseas, Europe and Iran continue to feud over the existence of the Holocaust, with one government staging a conference to help prove it didn't exist while Austria threatens an anti-Semite with prison, raising the nettlesome issue of to what degree free speech should be curtailed in the name of community stability as defined by government.\\"1984\\" does not have a happy ending. Its last four words slam the book shut on freedom. Orwell hoped to foment enough concern with his masterpiece to influence the course of history, and he has to some degree succeeded. There are millions of people around the world who have yet to taste true freedom and who will not relent until they have acquired it. There are others who constantly observe Big Brother, latter-day Orwells who gird each day for a fight to defend individual liberty.A quarter-century after the real 1984, the public and private sectors, enabled by technology, have made it easier to know what the public is saying, thinking, and feeling. And in our own discourse as individual citizens, some of us have taken to playing fast and loose with the facts, or retreating from the world of terra-firma into a make-believe electronic neighborhood.Will we, as a people, accept the \\"truthiness\\" of a Web posting, manufactured definitions on Wikipedia, or be content to have high-powered computer algorithms track our Web footprint in the name of consumerism? Will we retreat to our iPods and virtual reality games? How well will we pay attention? How much do we read? What do we read? And when are we willing to speak up, and to whom?\\"The price of freedom is eternal vigilance\\". - Jefferson"},{"Title":"1984","review":"Having just re-read 1984 it struck me that, whilst the quality of the writing is \\"timeless,\\" (Orwell constructs a better sentence than most \\"literary artists\\"), the book's themes get more and more frightening as Western culture decays toward the millennium. My first school reading was in the days when 1984 was literally \\"the future,\\" (even though Orwell had always intended it as a satire on contemporary Britain, with \\"1948\\" the originally intended title); in England today the resonances are especially profound, and what looked \\"old-fashioned\\" to \`sixties and \`seventies sci-fi readers has gained a new and bleaker realism. We're beginning to catch up with the US when it comes to presidential-style \\"leadership\\" and \\"spin,\\" whilst the rewriting of history - with its horrible parallels with the politically correct mythologies espoused in transatlantic universities and the like - is already being implemented, with particular regard to the guilty denial of the achievements of the British Empire, (whilst the Roman and Greek civilisations still manage to escape trendy censure).The worst shock comes with the realisation that everything 1984 says about the manipulation and reduction of thought by language-control, (Doublethink and Newspeak, respectively), is demonstrably happening right now. Things you can't say become thoughts you can't think, and an attempted conversation with most contemporary English youths on the street will reveal how hard it has become for our ill-educated masses actually to formulate rationale thought: what you get is a monotonic patois recitation of received simplistic opinion - or a boot stamping on your face, followed by a law-suit for your assault on them! One recent encounter left me with the reflection that we are so far from Shakespeare one could weep; then I read 1984 again, where Orwell has Winston wake up one morning with the name on his lips, a fleeting memory of a better past. The book is brilliantly written, shockingly painful and horribly, horribly relevant! (It's also fantastically entertaining and often very funny). Read it, read it again, and read it to your children!"},{"Title":"1984","review":"Orwell wrote 1984 at a miserable juncture in history. The Second World War had just ended, the Europe of his memory was in ruins, the full horror of the holocaust had been laid bare and the victorious powers seemed bent on completing the destruction the planet. The best of optimists would have quailed, and Orwell was no optimist. Surrounded by this stark despairing landscape, he wrote a stark despairing speculation. It was his damning indictment of the dark places of our souls.It has been called a masterpiece; one of the twentieth century's greatest prophecies; a visionary dystopia that will speak for all time.I beg to differ.I do not question the brilliance of Orwell's writing. It exactly conveys the utter dejection and despair that he felt in the aftermath of the war. It is an incredibly taut development of character, theme, setting, and plot that strikes our psyche like a fist to the stomach. It attains exactly the right balance between storytelling and polemic.It is also all wrong. It felt wrong thirty years ago when I first read it. It feels just as wrong today.If we ever manage to create hell, it won't be Orwellian. Humans are far more amenable to seduction than oppression. Why spy into every household when one can be persuaded to spy on oneself? Why use techniques as inefficient as torture when far more can be accomplished by appealing to our basest pleasures? Why need doublethink be forced when we will freely embrace it where it is invested with enough allure? And why would the denizens of a misbegotten future bother to listen to voices of discord when their every waking hour can be filled to excess with titillation, shallow ecstasy, and unending bombardment of the senses? The dystopia of the future will not be one of oppression, but of gluttony.An observant person, looking at the here and now, might conclude that hell has already arrived. But it has arrived via Huxley, not Orwell. We already have the Brave New World of test tube babies, mass pacification, casual sex, and broadcasted voyeurism. The key to keeping a society docile is to make docility so pleasant, so seductive, that we will freely and willingly embrace it over the rigours of a well-examined life. The road to hell is paved with syrup, not vinegar.Orwell was a brilliant thinker and writer, not just of fiction, but of social and personal commentary. His essays are probably the finest since Montaigne's, and his powers of human observation and his sheer intellect are overwhelming in their stature. This is what makes 1984 so difficult to understand. Such a keen mind should have arrived at very different conclusions from those exposited in this book.In a really hellish future, there will be no need to destroy malcontents; they will simply be irrelevant."},{"Title":"1984","review":"So much has been written by others on this classic text that I will limit my comments to that aspect of the book I feel is still the most important - the manipulation of language to control behavior. Orwell understood how crucial meaning and communication is to social and political behavior. The Bolsheviks first and then the Nazis both went to great lengths to manipulate meaning, creating an acceptable vocabulary of politically positive words and images and an equally negative vocabulary for that which was to be vilified and destroyed. Attempting to channel behavior into patterns predefined by these limited modes of expression represents the greatest part of the state propogandist's art. Orwell reduced the complexity of this enterprise to something that could be seen for the con game it is. His invention of 'newspeak' demonstrates the reducto ad absurdum of such verbal restrictiveness.In our day, whether Big Brother is really watching or not, we suffer from some of the same contraints of limited language and, in term, limited behavioral options. On the one hand we suffer from a language of polictical correctness that strives to offend no one, but makes speech clumsy and artificial. On the other extreme we suffer from the limited categories that the professional news media use - the narrow meanings available to them for understanding and communicating what is considered 'news'. Since politicians contribute to this limited vocabulary and play off of it, it saves them from facing much real in depth analysis and critique and limits the public to shallow expositions that distort reality and make meaningful political choice impossible.So 1984 has come and gone and we haven't fallen into the dramatic pit that Orwell pictured, but the language we use to deal with social and political issues has been so attenuated that we are in danger of becoming slaves to a limited set of possibilities because we cannot even articulate any alternatives."},{"Title":"1984","review":"+++++This novel by George Orwell (whose real name was Eric Arthur Blair, 1903 to 1950) is about the effects of totalitarianism. Totalitarianism is a characteristic of a government or state in which one political party maintains complete control under a dictatorship and bans all others.This story, which takes place in London in 1984, follows one man (named Winston Smith) and his love interest (Julia) as they struggle against this totalitarian party (\\"The Party\\") whose leader (actually dictator) is \\"Big Brother.\\" The Party political orthodoxy rules the giant country of \\"Oceania\\" (in which London is located).At the heart of this party's political orthodoxy is the process of controlling thought through the manipulation of language and information by the use of \\"Newspeak\\" which utilizes what is called \\"doublethink.\\"Newspeak is the official language of Oceania (but is not the only language spoken). It is a language that eliminates unnecessary words and is designed to diminish rather than help expressive thought. For example, Newspeak states that there is no good and bad but only good and \\"ungood.\\" Doublethink is the ability to simultaneously hold two opposing ideas in one's mind and believe in them both. The three Party slogans that title this review are examples of doublethink. Another good example is that (2+ 2 =4) and (2 + 2 = 5).The Party keeps everybody in line through Newspeak and doublethink. But they also have other methods. For example, they have the \\"Thought Police\\" that investigate \\"thoughtcrimes.\\" These are \\"crimes\\" of just having negative thoughts about The Party. Another example are telescreens that watch your every move even in bathroom stalls. Thus, \\"Big Brother is watching you\\" at all times.Winston and Julia are discovered to be guilty of thoughtcrimes by O'Brien (who is the personification of The Party). O'Brien also represents those leaders who use cruelty and torture as their primary method of control (like Hitler and Stalin did). He makes them pay for their \\"crimes.\\"This novel clearly shows how totalitarianism negatively affects the human spirit and how it's impossible to remain freethinking under such circumstances.This novel also contains an appendix written by Orwell. Here he explains various aspects of Newspeak and to my surprise he states that by the year 2050, Newspeak will be the only language that anyone will understand. Why does he state this? He wanted to keep the fear of totalitarianism alive in his readers well past the year 1984. (Thus, this novel is still quite relevant for today!)This novel is in a word fascinating! It is well written and is filled with symbolism and imagination. It begins slow but gradually picks up speed. And the story is very interesting.Finally, after reading this book, I recommend watching the 1984 movie \\"1984\\" starring John Hurt and Richard Burton (his last movie role).In conclusion, this novel is a masterpiece of political speculation that serves as a warning to us all. Read it for yourself to see why it brought Orwell world-wide fame!!(first published 1949; 3 parts or 24 chapters; 325 pages)+++++"},{"Title":"1984","review":"It seemed so innocuous, just sitting there wedged between two other books on the shelf, collecting dust with the others on my \\"yet to read\\" list. I may have passed it by altogether had it not been for the fact that I needed to complete my three hundred pages for the second quarter of my junior year. Besides, I'd read this author's work before and knew that I enjoyed his writing fairly well. So, without realizing what I was plunging into, I picked up George Orwell's 1984; the most unceremonious beginning for a most extraordinary event.As I unconsciously flipped the pages, not realizing that I was still me and not Winston Smith, the story's protagonist, barely cognizant, in fact, that this was a book and not reality, I was dimly aware that this was something special; something far beyond what I had been expecting. If Animal Farm was a slightly humorous, if morbid, look at communism, then 1984 was a ghastly, apocalyptic vision of a demented future. After reading the first twenty pages, I determined that this was the single most quotable book of all time.The infamous Party slogans: \\"War is Peace,\\" \\"Freedom is Slavery,\\" \\"Ignorance is Strength.\\"\\"Thoughtcrime does not entail death; thoughtcrime IS death.\\"\\"I understand HOW: I do not understand WHY.\\"\\"Freedom is the freedom to say that two plus two make four. If that is granted, all else follows.\\"Chilling words from what could have been, from an averted catastrophe in which the human race subjugates itself through ignorance. Yet who's to say this could never come to pass? None can honestly look another straight in the eye and say, \\"That is not the future.\\" To presume so is vanity manifest.The one enemy man need truly fear is himself. The notorious Big Brother, the faceless autocrat in charge of Orwell's nightmare world (incidentally, it is never established whether Big Brother is a single man or a surreptitious group superciliously dealing justice to the masses), mercilessly dominates life on Oceania, one of three nations in existence. These countries, Oceania, Eurasia, and Eastasia, are continually in a state of war with each other, in which Oceania and one of the others are allied against the last. Big Brother's control over his people is absolute, executed through a methodical censorship that keeps the faade of truth as a contorted mask. Big Brother has the power to efface any record of an event or person - to rewrite the past as he sees fit.Perhaps less relevant as a prophecy today (1984 has come and gone and no dictatorship has arisen to consolidate the Americas and the United Kingdom into a single communist entity), 1984 remains a very real piece of culture, with its own voice in the way it challenges one's preconceived notions and ideals. My English teacher perhaps said it best, when comparing 1984 to Animal Farm: \\"Animal Farm hits you with gloves on; 1984 just smacks you bare-fisted.\\" And it's no slap, no half-hearted jab; it is an in-your-face, force of a moving train blow to the jaw from which the reader reels for weeks, even months after. It is an illustration, as well, of the need of consolidation and the hopelessness that such a government can be beaten: Winston, after waging a personal crusade for his secret freedom, winds up a brainwashed pawn of Big Brother.In the end, Orwell proves that, if the government so wills it, two and two really make five, not four, and no amount of protest is going to change that. This book was a life-changer for me in many ways, but mostly because it made me see a broader view of the world and made me appreciate life as I know it just that much more.\\"He gazed up at that enormous face. Forty years it had taken him to learn what kind of smile was hidden beneath the dark mustache. O cruel, needless misunderstanding! O stubborn, self-willed exile from the loving breast.

George Orwell predicted the future and what is really going to happen. Although he figured it to be around 1984, it is in the process of happening now. The government is slowly taking over us by taking away our God-given individual rights, and they are doing it right in context with their (insiders) plan. In 1984, he said that we were going to end up having a system where we won't even have money in our pockets, it would automatically be put into the bank at the end of each work week. Then if we needed to pay for something, we are assigned individual numbers for which we use. Everything Orwell predicted is actually happening now, but most people see it as a good thing that the government has planned for us. If they actually researched more in-depth than the media, they can find out what is really going on. Orwell was not wrong when he knew that the government was going to be controlling our lives, and I personally think this book was a warning. This book was very early for its' time to most people, but little do Americans know how long this conspiracy has been going on. 1984 was a very scary novel to read, especially to think that it will eventually happen to us if we lose our rights guaranteed to us in the Constitution of the U.S.A.The main point I gathered from this book is that if we don't take control, we will be controlled."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Overall, this book is pretty good.

No one can deny this novel's power, its hold on the imagination of whole generatins,or the power of its admonitions-a power that seems to grow not lessen, with the passage of time.It is the story of a man by the name of Winston Smith he lives in a time when love of a woman is illeagal not just the act but the nature and feelings to one. A time when you are watched by your television and never have a life by yourself. A time when no one is safe from big brother. And a time when no one can rebel."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Orwell creates a frightening picture of how easy it is to manipulate human minds using extreme nationalism, unification from a common enemy, misplaced love, and the love of hating things. Readers ask themselves &quot;WHY? Why do these people let themselves be subjected to such mind control?&quot; Really it's all the people know. Somehow to them it makes perfect sense that the past doesn't exist. Scary. One of the best books I've ever read"},{"Title":"1984","review":"1984-A good example of what government can and may do. Good warnings of what may happen when government is given too much power and how it may completely take over without being noticed. Depressing but gives good insight. READ IT!!"},{"Title":"1984","review":"1984 ReviewGeorge Orwell's novel, 1984 is classic, thought provoking literature that everyone should read. 1984 relates to many of the radical ideas of the communist era. Orwell points out the fake reality portrayed by the government with his incorporation of such things as \\"victory cigarettes and victory gin.\\" This story exhibits the reality of life in many small, exploited countries.The exaggerated ideals 1984 expresses, represents the oppression felt by many in the world that is gilded by a thought of true freedom. The story is very descriptive and allows the reader to feel the true emotions that the main character, Winston Smith is feeling. Orwell shows that in our world everything is deceptive to reality. Conformity is the main concern for the masses working for the elite and even the name Winston Smith is symbolic for this lack of individualistic qualities. This book shows the militaristic tactics used by the government of \\"Big Brother\\" to inspire people to work and keep an interest in the common good. Every four years the government of Oceana started a fake war with one of the other two super powers to maintain the work ethic and inspiration of the slaving people in the middle class. Winston represents all people who rebel against the system and know that the illusions presented by the government of aristocrats are wrong. He represents the middle class which work as tools of the elite and the proletarians are the people who the government leaves to their own ignorance. 1984 holds a great amount of symbolism and connects fiction with the real world. This book is a must read for everyone and to me, quite possibly one of the greatest books ever written."},{"Title":"1984","review":"George Orwell's 1984 is not a prediction of the future, but more of a warning of where mankind could be heading. Written in the year 1948, this book is a satiric statement of what might come to pass if people did not take action against the problems facing the world. These problems include totalitarianism, fascism, and - most importantly - the use of language to alter thought. This form of mind-control is what gives a lasting impression on anyone who reads this book. Humans are separate from the animal kingdom because of their ability to grasp abstract concepts (love, hate, etc.) In 1984, people no longer have any privacy, the ruling class spy into their homes, and frighteningly - their THOUGHTS. Anyone guilty of a thought-crime (harboring thoughts against the government) is tortured until they &quot;reconsider.&quot; They are eventually brainwashed through this torture, and the final result is a citizen drained of his personal thoughts and devoted to the government. This thought-provoking satire left a lasting impression on me and I would recommend it to anyone. The symbolism, the characters, and the plot make this story a must-read."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Orwell understood the why, the what, and most importantly, the who of post modern tyranny. He is a conflicted and tortured man. A man who exposed his own deepest beliefs in &quot;progressive&quot; politics and plumbed the depth of the consequences. In the year 2000 Orwell is joined by Jerry Furland, Claire Wolfe, Vin Supranowizc, Neal Boortz, David Horowitz and many others in warning us of the dangers of blindly following the newspeak of the Utopian Left. They are with us today. Just as deadly and just as implacable.The Clintons are, in essence, the quintessential inner party dictators. Gore is a bland understudy. This is still, half a century later, political dynamite."},{"Title":"1984","review":"It was quite edifying to read the reviews, as you may read, preaching the book's outdated prophesy and it's over exagerated message, yet when I looked at where these poor souls inhabited I laughed. We are presented with people from the United States to England to Canada slandering a man who beautifully wrote an inspirational attack on that which would prevent you from living in such a lifestyle as you most likely do live in or want to live in. If you have never lived under tyranny how could you know? Now please forgive my hypocritical words for I am only sixteen but this along with other books has opened my mind to something so great and terrible. The more I look at who should be my fellow brothers and sisters the more I think about this novel's relevance. I see how easily one can except anything presented with a superficial answer and how much hate is spread through pride. From the &quot;Two Minute Hate', and 'Big Brother' to the 'Telescreen' and the last four words of the novel, this book is a clearer mirror than any other to view our own times, all throughout time, no longer bolstered up with impressions and controversy."},{"Title":"1984","review":"I think Orwell is one of the English language's best writers. 1984 is his master-work. However, to really grasp many of the themes in 1984 one must also look at Orwell's other political writings. (There is an excellent collection of them on the Web - search for 'George Orwell' in Yahoo).Much of what I would say about 1984 has already been said here. However, it never fails to amuse me when socialists and left-wingers seek to cast 1984 as an attack on capitalism. Even the little piece at the end of the edition offered for sale here tries desperately to protest that Big Brother and Ingsoc might also be the product of capitalism. If you believe this, ask yourself how well the words 'laissez-faire' would fit into Newspeak.It is absolutely true that Orwell was a 'democratic socialist.' It is also absolutely true, and Orwell knew, that democracy could produce totalitarianism. 1984 is a critique of two things: relativism (the view that there is no objective truth), and the planner's mentality (that endemic to both the left and right). To think of it as a criticism of any purely economic system is just plain silly."},{"Title":"1984","review":"There are many different types of books out there: fiction, non-fiction, science fiction, fantasy, horror, history, and biography. But only a few of them have the same impact that George Orwell achieves in his book 1984. It seems part paranoid fantasy, part tribute to the malleability of the human psyche, and part historical allegory.The issues, even presented in the outdated means that they are, still ring true for our modern society. The line between patriotism and nationalism is a thin one, and one that Americans look at each day. But in Orwell's world that line was crossed, and the result was a totalitarian government beyond anything most of us can imagine. With the government controlling all jobs, information, deeds, and actions, even to the smallest thought of their peoples, his world is stark and horrible to those of us used to a freedom. But the steps into that world are not that far away from our modern media control. In his world of 1984 the media serves the purpose of brainwashing the populace at large, and an ongoing war keeps the pressure on. And while some may claim that the media in our own country has the same control over us, in his world, the media is the government, and has no other agenda than that which the government sets forth.The strange part is that all of this occurs to us, through the eyes of the main character, Winston Smith, as he falls in love with a young woman named Julia. In Oceania, the nation-state in which Smith lives, love is not allowed, and not tolerated. Winston Smith is, in essence, an insurgent in his own nation. He sleeps each night knowing that something is wrong, but not being able to say exactly what. As a reader we can see exactly the horrors to which he is made to endure, and though they might make us scream and shout, he is unmoved. But love draws him out of that sheltered reality, and into open insurgency against his own nation.This is the beginning of the end for Wilson, as the romance, and the pleasures, are short lived. Like a terrible wave the police of the world he inhabits come crashing down upon him to break his spirit. The way they torture him is gruesome, and should offend anyone who values our human rights. But in the end, Wilson himself comes to love \\"Big Brother\\" the face of the state of Oceania. He forgets his insurgency, through a conscious adaptation of his logic processes. He has to know that whatever the nation does is right, even when it contradicts what he has experienced in the recent past. In Orwell's words, Doublethink.These are just the surface issues that come across in Orwell's vision world the deeper issues are buried. As in, how could such a world come to exist? Well, he explains that after World War 2, there came a mighty nuclear war that wiped out most of the population centers of the world. And that out of the nuclear ash arose a political methodology that swept the nations, a kind of socialism that blended into totalitarianism. This totalitarian regime took hold and great purges, on the scope of the great purges in the early communist USSR, ran across the world as we know it. 3 stable nations were born: Oceania (The Americas, the Pacific Islands, Australia, and England), Eastasia (China, Mongolia, The Indonesian Peninsula, and Japan), and Eurasia (All of Europe save England, and all of the Former USSR). The rest of the world was in a constant state of conquest by one of these 3 super-nations, with the captured populations used as slaves. The constant state of war between the nations served to keep control over the people within the nations.This is a world devoid of hope. Indeed, devoid of any emotions except hatred, fanatical delight in the war effort, and the obedience to the governments of the nations. This is the worst vision of what the Nazis in Germany hoped to accomplish in their conquests. A world without any laws, but what the government states to be true at that moment. A world where people disappear, but no one notices, or even cares, a world of total devotion to the state as a whole, without regard to creed, race, or social status.It isn't often that the characters in a book become common usage in the world at large, but the phrase \\"Big Brother is watching you\\" has become synonymous with the government watching over its citizens. It shows up today in almost everyday speech. Especially when people are talking right to privacy issues. This seems apt, as privacy is one of the things that Wilson Smith never had, and will never have. Big Brother (the government) watched his every move of his life, recorded his every word, and rifled through his belongings at their leisure. This book is the origin of that phrase.Orwell gives us a black and white view of the virtues of that world, and its drawbacks. The astounding thing is that it isn't still more talked about. We have, most of us, read this book. But how many too the time to understand the social and political ramifications it speaks of? I will from now on, that is for sure."},{"Title":"1984","review":"with ourselves ....... 1984 is an epic of living terror. Of the haunting spectre of communism that has gone paranoid.

He meets Julia who is a rebel (but only from the waist down as Winston remarks) and is well aware of the prevalent hypocrisy and fear.They are unmasked by the thought Police who watch your every move thro hidden telescreens.

Take his \\"telescreen\\" for instance, which closely mirrors our giant-screen TVs today and soon-to-be two-way viewing technology that we enjoy with our computers. The little helicopters buzzing around spying on everyone could just as easily be drones and satellites today.And take the ever-changing alliances between the United States, Russia and China -- which could easily be called Eurasia, Eastasia and Oceania. There's always a war somewhere and when you turn on what passes for news today and it's all double-talk spin -- not so much concrete reality than it is flip-flop opinion. The world has yet to degenerate to thought control or \\"thoughtcrime\\", but the increasing constraints of political correctness has us edging that way. And when it comes to our economic system, Orwell nailed that too -- \\"oligarchical collectivism,\\" a system made by the few for the few.The Orwellian lexicon lives on: \\"Big Brother.\\"In the end, it boils down to the book itself. In short, it's a once-in-a-lifetime novel that begs to be read. An enduring classic. It's a book you can read time and again -- I know I have. One man resisting authority. The quest for freedom of thought and speech and liberty.And I've said nothing no one else hasn't said already.You may as well quit reading what people have to say about this great classic and find out for yourself."},{"Title":"1984","review":"I first heard of this book when, at the age of 17, my best friend, a year older, told me about it. One year later, I read it as a college freshman. I have brushed up on it several times over the decades -- five decades to be exact. At first, to me it was simply a science-fiction novel. But as the years have rolled by, it seems to me that Orwell's nightmare has come true. This is true with regard to the endless wars, the shifting identity of the latest bogeyman, the lies that are our daily provender from all directions, the demonization of the individual, the internal spying, the hesitation to defy conventional thinking, the shifting definition of words, the dumbing down, state control of the media, the two-minute hate (called by another name, of course), all the jugglery with \\"truth\\" and so forth, it is all here and now. I hesitate to give concrete examples for fear that some of you will think that all of this is to be identified with certain factions, when in fact there is only ONE faction in our society, operating in unison like the tentacles of the octopus. It is not simply political correctness, it is everything. This is not something that can be voted out in an election. You will say that our students are taught this book as required reading, they have all been warned, we are on our guard, we cannot be deceived. You are deceived every day of your lives, you are surrounded by deception. You deceive yourselves in your very thinking. You think in Newspeak and do not know that this is what you are doing. I have seen this coming and it is before us and in us. You -- yes, even you -- love Big Brother."},{"Title":"1984","review":"The book is gripping and holds the reader captive for the majority of the book. The characters tale is told intelligently and the plot has all of the litte things it takes to make a good book. However, towards the end of the book it becomes boring unless you really have the perserverence to go on. On a less technical note the book tells a story that you can see in the lay of tomorrow and it is not a good prospect. A time when propoganda is the daily news and and you love your government, dead or alive. They say that love will always find a way, and here it does. For a short time that is. The government goes even so far as to control a persons personal life, and the struggle against them is fruitless, if not gripping. Definetly a good book for everybody."},{"Title":"1984","review":"By revealing the extreme; George Orwell, in 1984, described a chilling reality. This reality was a testimony to the extremes that a government could reach if given the license to do so. Big Brother is a microcosom for the greater socialistic atmosphere that was created in the Soviet Union of the 1940's."},{"Title":"1984","review":"I read 1984 when I was in High School and its still amazing how many of us remember it and refer to &quot;big brother&quot; in our everyday lives. After all 1984 has come and gone but has the concept of an all seeing government watching our every move? We are in a digital world we every bank transaction, movie rented,item we buy can be electronically tracked that allow others to see more of our private lives than we realize. Doesn't it ever make you wonder where all the junk mail comes from? The concept is still valid and probably more so...it would be interesting to see what the generation X'ers think."},{"Title":"1984","review":"When 1984 was first published, Orwell's fellow socialists denounced it for its clear criticism of Stalinist Communism along with the Nazi regime and all other forms of totalitarianism. After two generations, the common view was that 1984 was on-target for its time but was now dated as the Communist regimes evolved into ordinary authoritarian ones. Today techno-enthusiasts like Peter Huber say 1984 was based on fallacies, because the spread of information technology aids freedom, not oppression. And to today's teenagers, the totalitarian experience seems to be ancient history. Why should anyone still read 1984?Partly, of course, they should read it for the same reason they should read Wiesel, Milosz, Solzhenytsin, and many others-- because we ought to remember the evils of this century for memory's sake. But the autobiographies and histories written by those who lived under these most evil of regimes-- important as they are-- necessarily offer a bottom-up view of them.1984, among many other things, offers insight into the psychology and mindset of the rulers, the torturers, the propagandists. Through reading a (possibly forged) samizdat manifesto, through his conversations with O'Brien, and through his knowledge of the workings of the Party's rewrites of history and language, Smith learns-- and through him, we learn even more-- about the tight links among cruelty, terror, and power over the body and the mind.At the moment we are mostly free of the specific kinds of regimes Orwell attacked, though we should not lightly assume that they will never return. We are not and probably will never be free of those who seek power for power's sake, of those who use torture and terror, of cruel and evil rulers and would-be rulers. We are not free of the corruption of history and language by politics. 1984 is in that greatest of categories of fiction-- the literature that allows its readers to understand reality better."},{"Title":"1984","review":"I didn't expect much from a book written in 1949. I thought I was going to read about ideas which we would view as humorous living in the 90's. But Orwell's vision of the 1984 might as well be called any year in the future. For one simple reason, this could happen too easily. The three powers Oceania, Eurasia and Eastasia are in fighting a war that keeps there citizens in oppresion. Only a handful of secretive revolutions toil in the dirty, drab society of 1984. To read this book is to almost read a non-fictional work of the struggle of man and the over powering forces of government at work. Winston Smith is an ordinary character who leads us through the innermost thoughts of human psyche and the truthes and terrors which lie within. This book is scarier than any work by Stephen King, H.P. Lovecraft or Dean Koontz. Quite simply put the dangers of the olligarchy collectivism seem to real and are just as close to home as they were to readers of the 50's and 60's."},{"Title":"1984","review":"1984 must be called an epic. Few stories have so firmly entrenched themselves into the fabric of our society like Orwell's masterpiece. From the concept of Big Brother to those of &quot;newspeak&quot; and &quot;thought crime,&quot; this book has filled several voids in our language. Perhaps the book has frightened us into paying it homage. It hits us at home by addressing issues such as our right to privacy, the extent of control a government should wield over its people, the boundaries of patriotism, the value of love. This novel runs deep in my veins for these reasons and more. In case you hadn't noticed the 6 movies, 15 albums and 3,645 features on 1984, it is the story about life in a hypothetical future. At the time Orwell wrote the novel, the year 1984 was a far-off place in the future. Now it belongs to an era with which we associate opulence and injurious Presidents. For the sake of argument, however, 1984 represents a hypothetical future in any era whereby government has reached too far down our pants. We follow the life of poor Winston, smoking his Victory cigarettes and drinking his Victory coffee, who has the unfortunate affliction of thinking for himself. We follow Winston through the dim corridors of his housing facility hoping that he remembers, BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING. Big Brother is watching Winston and the rest of the community to make sure they stick to the law. After all, they must keep up in their perpetual war with Eurasia and Oceania, the ENEMIES. Of course, Winston has the misfortune of falling in love with a woman, which has no place in the effort to win the war. You'll have to read the book to find out what they do with Winston... This novel builds on a brilliant premise that makes the reading - and learning - fascinating throughout. Read it before the government tells you that you can't."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Orwell's 1984 was a compelling, haunting book. I liked this book and would give it an &quot;10&quot; because, although it dealt with large contemporary political issues, it addressed them in a personal way. The reader was forced to see that human dignity, intellectual integrity, freedom, and personal needs of love, passion, family, warmth, and security were mankind's true imperatives. This was a message worth both sending and receiving. It was conveyed on an individual scale that engendered an effective emotional reaction. I liked Winston; I wished to free him. I hoped he would escape into the &quot;prole&quot; world with Julia and be content. When Winston was captured I wanted his torture to cease; but most of all I longed for his intellectual integrity to survive-its destruction was devastating. For me, therefore, Orwell created an effective warning. Winston told Julia &quot;we are the dead,&quot; since because of their individuality, private beliefs, and his intellectual integrity they were doomed. Thus, Orwell vividly reminded us that we must value and safeguard our personal freedoms."},{"Title":"1984","review":"I found 1984 to be a fascinating and realistic portrayal of human nature. Orwell's insight into the nature of governments is amazing and enlightening. He has this detached, slightly pessimistic attitude toward human nature that I love. He is so frank about man's selfishness and greed -- not only as it relates to the governments in 1984, but also to the rebels like Winston who, in the end, care only for themselves. There are no glamorous heroes in 1984 just as there are any in real life. Orwell has stripped man of all glory and glamour and shown him in an honest, if unflattering, light.I was also very impressed with Orwell's thoroughness. He described the society, the history and, most of all, the language of the futuristic Oceania in such detail. 1984 is truly a masterpiece."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Alright, George Orwell was largely wrong in one of his major premises- technology ended up undermining totalitarianism. Technologies like the Worldwide Web have lubricated the flow of ideas; government hacks are too incompetent, lazy and stupid to crack down effectively on computer users. Orwell, a democratic socialist, was anti-Stalinist to his core and this book is a brilliant attack on the whole Stalin machine. Sometimes the best critics of a system or idea are those who share some of the same assumptions. No right-winger has ever been as effective (with the possible exception of Solzenhitsyn) in bludgeoning Stalinism. Orwell is unusually prophetic in his use of the Telescreen as a government propaganda device and indoctrinator. Remember, television was in its infancy when Orwell wrote this book in the late 40s. Television has become a propaganda device though it is not used as crudely as in the Big Brother state of Orwell's 1984. Television has effectively dumbed down the population with insipid, trite programming to the point where the average bloke is as intellectually tame and lazy as the Julie Christie character in Fahrenheit 451 (one has to believe that Ray Bradbury was heavily influenced by 1984). Television has numbed the brains of a majority in the Western world to where they are compliant to the whims and wishes of the current ruling classes. One last night- George Orwell's mastery of language is a thing of beauty. Read him for the robust joy of the written word."},{"Title":"1984","review":"This is an incredible book. It'll totally change the way you think. That's the irony of the book. Orwell seems to be trying to make you think, Don't let people control what you think. Irony aside, this foul little book seems to be a commentary on both bourgeousie and socialist society, which makes it ever more timely. A great companion for Brave New World and Animal Farm."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Unlike \\"Animal Farm\\", this book isn't inspired solely by the Soviet Union. The totalitarianism described in the book is very different from every-day life in Socialist countries while not lacking some coincidental similarities.You are going to see a totalitarian regime through the eyes of a small party official. You'll get introduced to his every-day life and work, and see him starting to have strange thoughts that he's actually not supposed to think.Orwell's world is much worse than the Soviet Union ever was. I must warn you that some very brutal scenes are described in detail and are really hard to take. The end is very Orwellian - too abrupt and somewhat disappointing.The movie was pretty good, too."},{"Title":"1984","review":"I read this book, curious on government issues during the late 40's. I was shocked at what lie beyond the doors of this classic novel. Orwell has introduced me to a society where propoganda dominates. today, I can easily relate this to the media and press. Orwell wanted to clarify his stand on Communism and propoganda and did so with this intriguing work of literature. What lie beyond the doors of room 101? As I say, something worse then death...."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Twenty years after having read &quot;1984&quot;, I can still feel its visceral and intellectual impact. IMO, it stands with &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot;, &quot;Age of Innocence&quot;, and &quot;Name of the Rose&quot; as the very best of the hundreds of fictions that I've read in my lifetime thus far.It's a testament to the power of Orwell's masterpiece that, after the title of the book has been relegated to the past, its message of warning is still more relevant today than ever - just look at Iraq, North Korea, Bosnia, Congo, just to name a few.A must-read for those who fight to preserve freedom of ideas, and also for those who seek to repress it."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Across the country there is a travesty going on. High School teachers are requiring students to read Animal Farm by George Orwell. By the same author there is a much finer example of satire and the multiple levels Orwell attached to each of his books. Nineteen Eighty-Four is simply one of the best books written this century. It approaches a subject matter, Communism, attacks it and then inadvertantly exposes a greater meaning and truth, the essence of freedom. Orwell meant 1984 to be an attack on Russia and what would happen if Stalin and Lenin won. It trascended that and became a handbook for freedom. If anyone doesn't come out a Libertarian after reading this book, they didn't read it close enough. One of the many books that will be on classic reading lists for centuries to come."},{"Title":"1984","review":"George Orwell's novel 1984 is a dystopia about a world where authoritarian governments rule the world. Everybody should read this book, because freedom of thought is not something that comes naturally to all of us in every country.Even in democratic countries like the United States where people will cross the ocean to fight for democrazy, but can't be bothered to cross the street to vote in national elections, freedom of thougth is something each individual has to gain themselves.Apart from oppressive governments sometimes religions decide that they know what's best for people they have control over. Authoritarian religions and authoritarian governments have so much in common that Orwell's book could just as well be about religion. Sometimes those in powerful positions even decide that their subjects don't have to think for themselves, but blindly obey what the leaders think is in their best interests.I was raised a Jehovah's Witness. 1984 was one of the books that opened my eyes. Don't be afraid to think for yourself. A good start is to read this book.If you have a loved one whose mind is controlled by a religion this is an excellent gift for them. Because this book is not really about religion Jehovah's Witnesses can read this book, although they are forbidden to read material that is critical to their beliefs."},{"Title":"1984","review":"George Orwell's 1984 is one of the, if not the best science fiction novels of this century. A warning about the menaces of totalitarianism. The novel is set in an imaginary future world that is dominated by three perpetually warring totalitarian police states. The book's hero, Winston Smith, is a minor party functionary in one of these states. His longing for truth and decency leads him to secretly rebel against the government. Smith has a love affair with a like-minded woman, but they are both arrested by the Thought Police. The ensuing imprisonment, torture, and reeducation of Smith are intended not merely to break him physically or make him submit but to root out his independent mental existence and his spiritual dignity. Orwell's warning of the dangers of totalitarianism made a deep impression on his contemporaries and upon subsequent readers, and the book's title and many of its coinages became bywords for modern political abuses."},{"Title":"1984","review":"I wish there was a way Amazon would let you rate ONE book with six stars, your all-time favorite. If they did that, 1984 would be my pick. I've read it at least four times, once when I had insomnia I read the whole thing front to back again. The first time I read it was in high school, and I was disappointed because it didn't have a happy ending, because Smith didn't manage to somehow smash Big Brother. But now I recognize the book for what it is: a timeless statement on totalitarianism and individualism. Don't let the title fool you: if we're not very, very careful it can happen yet."},{"Title":"1984","review":"This book will stay with you forever. It is such a horrific prophecy of socialist control of government that you will find your resolve strengthened to continue to fight for the freedoms with which we are blessed in this country. You will be intrigued throughout this book and find yourself with a new heightened awareness of the brutal nature of governmental control of our lives."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Breathtaking, in one word. Compellingly written, with a chilling plotline which is familiar to virtually all: a terrifying vision of an authoritarian future. It doesn't matter that it didn't happen, or that the settings are stylised: the real undertows of emotion and concept are played out in your head. It may have drawn inspiration from contempary communism, but the true commentary is far deeper - freedom, compromised in any system, and the appearance of freedom. The beginning is monochrome (dull, as some have referred to it) because Orwell was crafting some of the finest textural novel-writing ever - the contrasts with Winston's violent mental rebellion, the freedom of his reckless affair and the dark, futile scenes in Minilov are there for a reason. The ending may be 'depressing' but it is also one of the most powerful and affecting conclusions devised. The courage to end this way is telling of Orwell's uncompromising artistic stance, and his deeper intentions behind the novel.Three things really stand out. Firstly, the interesting and intriguing conceptual work expertly weaved into the plotline. Orwell used both satire and philosophy to emphasise a single variable - control - in his fictional world. It's a gritty, naturalist way of working; rather than through elaborate symbolism, and Orwell's journalistic style shines through. Secondly, his portrayal of this world. Although repeated readings have bought out subtler tones eg.the proles, newspeak, my first reading was dominated by the overwhelmingly convincing tone of observation and everyday slavery. The opening section builds up to a great atmospheric crescendo. Finally, although I mention a lack of symbolism, 1984 stands as a symbol itself for all the great struggles of the individual. Within its pages are independence against control, love against adversity, the vivid against the mundane, freedom against propoganda and expression against conformity - perhaps even life versus death. (see the attitude of the Party towards death, both in regards to others and its own continued existence). In displaying Winston's will waged against fate and society, Orwell has created one of the great political fables, and a supremely human novel."},{"Title":"1984","review":"I first read this book about 5 years ago ( being 9 years old !! ) and at the time I didn't understand it well, considering its a book based on life experiences but after it I felt sad and a little scared ( of O'Brien ). Now I'm older ( and re-read the book ) I think different of the book. I find it ironic that the bad reviews here tend to have the effect &quot;it never happened and its unrealistic&quot; because they don't seem to think of the effect some things have on them. Personally, I think its double-standards to MAKE people read this since they have the freedom not to.This book is brilliant. O'Brien is probably the scariest person created by an author, and in the end when Winston traces 2+2=5 in the table you see the fraility of the human spirit. You can see many parrells to today in many of the events in the book ( people disappear in Latin America everyday ). I think this is A LOT better than Animal Farm. Also, for those out there who gave this 3 stars or less, 1984 is NOT insulting communism. You can see that it represents other systems other than communism more. You can see where you would fit in ( I would most probably be Syme ) and where you would turn out. And the best thing about this is that the more you discover about life, the more you discover in this book. I am no way near understanding ALL points in 1984 since I am only 14. My ending note would be - READ, that is if you dare... You'll be trapped into a new realm for life."},{"Title":"1984","review":"George Orwell is an accomplished author and 1984 is a classic novel written much before its time. Although much of what the world turned into within this story didn't occur, for the most part, I fear what Orwell would say about the advacement in electronic surveillance and reduction in privacy today. I very much enjoyed this story and can easily relate much of the allusions of this book to today's society and it's possible future. However, I don't find the politics and geography of this story very realistic; the same for its primary ideologies. Yes, it's a work of fiction written over 60 years ago but for example it's unlikely Europe (minus England for some reason) would ever side with Russia to make Eurasia any more than South America and South Africa would side with North America to make Oceania. Geographically it sort of makes sense but politically it does not. The whole \\"Equatorial Region\\" discussion didn't make much sense either. The land area on/near the Equator is probably the least populated with the fewest resources in the world; though I'm not positive about that. I also felt that the chapter containing sections of \\"The Book\\" was much longer than it needed to be. That one chapter probably took up about a quater of the whole book, and it wasn't even real. The main character was tricked into thinking it was and even he claimed to not learn much from it. Granted this is the chapter that pretty much details Orwell's political ideologies for the world of 1984 but the same points could've been in a more succinct manner which wouldn't sacrifice a thing. Aside from those points, and the fact that 1984 is incredibly depressing/pessimistic (I prefer at least neutral endings), I would recommend this classic book to any political, historical, or literature fans.P.S. The editors really need to go through this book again; it was full of spelling errors."},{"Title":"1984","review":"This book should be required reading for every student who purports to live in a \\"free society\\".

I underestimated the length of the Afterword/Appendix so I was not expecting the story to end when it did because it seemed I still had such a sizable clump of paper between the fingers of my right hand. The ending came up so suddenly and kicked me in the face. After I turned the page and saw there was no story left I literally said out loud \\"f---, son\\".No wonder this is a classic. For those of you who think they read it but really only skimmed it for school-- read it eventually. Damn it's powerful. Part 1 was my favorite. Part 3 seemed to drag on and get redundant but then I realized that's the entire point. Also I thought it was awesome that it included within itself excerpts from \\"the book\\" enabling Orwell spit his philosophy right out in front of the reader in an analytical fashion without taking anything away from the story.9/10...took 2 days to read cover to cover.

Spend more time with your family and become more independent of mainstream culture."},{"Title":"1984","review":"To understand this book, is to have experienced it first-hand. I smuggled a copy of Orwells's \\"Animal Farm\\" in German to East Berlin in the mid 1980's for one of my wife's cousins to read. I gave them the book in \\"Alexander Platz\\" thinking we would not be observed because it is an open area. Wrong! In the 1990s when the tactics came out of the East German secret police, it was shown that the whole area was under hidden video surveillance. Welcome Big Brother! Orwell's dystopian world still exists in many forms in our society today. Look at what governments are still trying to do - control the internet, video surveillance systems everywhere etc.This is a classic must read for all. Its message is still plain to see today as when it was written in 1948 and the year that ii discusses. We may not have reached that point of North Korea, but it can become a reality in the near future. This is one of the top 100 literary fiction books to maintain in your personal Library.And remember my favorite Orwell quotes. \\"Big Brother is Watching You & Some pigs are more equal than other pigs\\""},{"Title":"1984","review":"the author talks about how the \\"big brother\\" is mind controlling everyone. i believe this is the case in our own society. with the government controlling the majority with entertainments and news. and the mass also teaches their children these beliefs, and this is how false information passes down. the way to cure this sickness is to read books, and THINK for yourselves. this is the only way to get out of the cycle. i recommend this book to anyone who wants to think for themselves."},{"Title":"1984","review":"**Minor SPOILER\\"There is no doubt that George Orwell was ahead of his time when he wrote this book. If you look at our society today, although no where as severe as Orwell's vision, the shear human stupidity that abounds and the oppressive governments still present in certain parts of the world leads one to believe that his vision if we are not careful could become a reality in the near future. It seems that as time goes by and with all the technological advancement we've made, individuality and uniqueness are in danger of becoming extinct. It's enough to listen to today's music, to see what we now call \\"entertainment\\" for the masses to know that George Orwell ( at least when it comes to human beings) was right on the money.It certainly wasn't a pleasure read and while I do admit that it is a relevant book and it is one of the most thought provoking books I've ever read, I can't say that it is one of the best books I've read in my life. It was deeply disturbing and depressing and I was thoroughly disappointed with the end. I consider myself a realist but I was really hoping that Winston's idea of the defeat of Big Brother would become a reality, but in the end the Party is the one that wins. Did Orwell write this book with the intention of scaring us? No, he wrote it as a warning of how seriously screwed up the world can become if we stop thinking for ourselves. I only recommend this book if you like dystopian (opposite of utopia) society books."},{"Title":"1984","review":"I first read this book in high school because it was required. Needless to say, I have read it a few more times on my own since then. Why? Because it's worth it. Orwell offers eerily accurate correlations to a hypothetically world that places heavy reliance on media. Not only do people begin to forgot how to think for themselves, but a world of pure uniformity and lack of individuality begins to develop. One will be shocked at the little things that will remind you of devices that exist in our culture today and perhaps spark a bit of motivation to embrace one's flaws and unique attributes. After all, Orwell essentially warns in this novel that if we conform the ending won't be good. I guarantee one will complete this novel in record time because it's simply one you can't put down until your questions are answered."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Gods, where do I even start with this?As with To Kill a Mockingbird, I wanted to read this during Banned Books Week for two reasons. First, it's on the ALA's list of top banned or challenged books, and second because it's really, really good.As with all the books I read, there's always a little part of me thinking about what I'm going to say about the book once I finally decide to write about it. Sometimes I start composing in my mind, coming up with the pithy words and phrases that have made me into the international book reviewing superstar that I am.This time, however, I could barely concentrate for the cacophony in my head. There's just so much going on in this novel that doing it any sort of justice would probably require writing a book that was longer than the book that it was analyzing. And as much as I love you guys, I'm not about to write a whole book about this. Probably because I reckon better minds than mine already have.Regardless, it's hard to choose where exactly to go on this one. There are so many political, sociological, psychological and philosophical threads to pick up here that no matter what I write about, I'm pretty sure I'll get responses about how I didn't mention the solipistic nature of Ingsoc and its relationship to the philosophy behind modern cable news network reporting strategies. Don't worry, guys - I got that one.I suppose two big things came to mind while I was reading it this time, and the first of them was inspired by the previous book I read, To Kill a Mockingbird. In that book, Atticus Finch talks a lot about bravery. To teach his son about what it truly means to be brave, he gets him to take part in an old woman's struggle to free herself of a morphine addiction before she dies - an excruciating process that is more likely to fail than to succeed. But she does it anyway. Atticus says to his son about bravery, \\"It's when you're licked before you begin but you begin anyway and you see it through no matter what. You rarely win, but sometimes you do.\\"The question in my mind, then, was \\"Is Winston Smith brave?\\"It's a hard question to answer, really. By Atticus' definition, you could say that he is. A member of the Outer Party that rules the superstate of Oceania, Winston Smith is a part of a greater machine. He works in the records department of the Ministry of Truth, diligently altering and \\"rectifying\\" the data of the past to bring it into alignment with what the Party wants to be true. His is a world where there is no such thing as objective truth - the truth is what the Party says it is.A good member of the Party sublimates his will to that of the Party. What Big Brother wants, she wants. She has no love but love for the Party and no dreams but to do what the Party wants of her. A good Party member doesn't have plans or hopes or dreams. He doesn't ask questions or idly wonder if things could be different from what they are. A good Party member doesn't think. He is born, lives, consumes, and dies.Winston, however, cannot be a good Party member. He wonders why the world is the way it is, and begins down a road to assert his own identity as a human being. He knows full well that he will fail, that in the end he and the woman he loves will be delivered into the hands of the Thought Police, and he is appropriately terrified. But he goes through with it anyway. He keeps a diary of his thoughts and actively tries to join an underground movement that is determined to overthrow the Party and Big Brother. He declares himself willing to undertake acts of heinous treason, all in the name of resistance against the Party.And in the end, he fails, just as he knew he would. So does this make Winston, a man who is so far in character from Atticus Finch, a brave person? Well, yes and no.He does meet Atticus' definition of bravery - persisting in what you believe to be right, even in the knowledge that you will probably fail. Winston puts his own life on the line multiple times, committing Thoughtcrime of the highest order. But is he doing it for some higher ideal, or is he doing it for more selfish reasons? Flashbacks to his younger days suggest that Winston Smith was an unrepentantly selfish child, who was willing to disregard the dire straits of his own mother and baby sister in order to get what he wanted. Could we not say that the adult Winston does the same? That he is more interested in freedom for himself than for others? Is his rebellion against Big Brother political or personal? He claims that he wants to see the world changed and freedom brought to all people, but how far can we trust a mind that's been well-trained in Doublethink?This, of course, gets right back to the Big Question of why people do the right thing, when it might be so much easier and profitable to do otherwise. Atticus Finch could have let Tom Robinson swing, thus saving himself and his family a whole lot of trouble, just as Winston could have just given up and emulated his neighbor, Parsons, becoming as good a Party member as possible. Neither man could do that, though, because is was not in their nature to do so. It was impossible for Winston to continue to live the way the Party wanted to and, given time, he may have been able to reach beyond meeting his own personal needs and seen to the needs of his greater community.Unfortunately, we never get the chance to find out, as the Thought Police eventually get tired of watching him and take him in. To his credit, he does hold out to the last extreme before he betrays Julia in his heart, so perhaps he is brave after all.The other thing that came to mind while I read was the modern use of the word \\"Orwellian,\\" and how it falls vastly short of what is depicted in this book. It gets thrown about any time a city puts up a few CCTV cameras downtown, or a business decides to put surveillance cameras in their store. It comes up when we put RFID chips in passports and credit cards, or when we think about how much data Google can hold about us. The word brings to mind a sense of constant surveillance, never being able to move or act without some government or corporation knowing what we're doing.While the concept of the two-way telescreens in this book certainly are a logical extension of surveillance culture, to call a customer database or red light cameras \\"Orwellian\\" is like calling a Bronze-age chariot a Ferrari. It betrays an incredible lack of understanding of what exactly is going on in the world that Orwell has built. We may be watched by these people, but in comparison to the average citizen of Oceanea - prole or Party member - we are still remarkably free.There are still freedoms available to us that people like Winston never had, and couldn't understand even if they were offered. We can protest, we can voice our disagreements, we can channel our energies into whatever pursuit we choose, or not channel them at all. We have the freedom to decide who we want to be and how we want to live, at least within the limits of a well-ordered society. We do not live in daily terror that we might be abducted from our beds, our lives ended and our very existence erased from record and memory. Honestly, I think a few security cameras pale in comparison to the horror that is Oceanea and the world of Big Brother.There is so much more to talk about with this book. I find Newspeak fascinating, and its foundations both amazing and terrifying. The idea that a concept can only truly exist if there's a word for it brings to mind those \\"untranslatable\\" words you find in every language. For example, there's no equivalent to the English \\"miss\\" in Japanese, as in \\"I miss my mother.\\" Does that mean that people in Japan are incapable of missing people? Of course not, but the underlying theory of Newspeak suggests otherwise. Once the party reduces the English language to a series of simple words with no nuance or subtlety of meaning, the idea goes, Thoughtcrime will be literally impossible. After all, how can one wish for freedom if the concept itself is impossible to articulate?Then there's the idea of the mutability of the past. The way the Party exerts its unbreakable control over the population is by virtue of the fact that they control all media - newspapers, radio, television, publishing of all sorts. If the Party wants to, say, claim that Big Brother invented the airplane, all they have to do is revise all relevant media to reflect their desired past, and then replace and destroy anything that disagrees with them. With no evidence that Big Brother didn't invent the airplane, all that's left is fallible human memory, and those who do think they remember the \\"right\\" version of the past will eventually die anyway. Whoever controls the present, the Party says, controls the future. And whoever controls the past controls the present. By remaking the past, the Party guarantees that they can never be gainsaid or proven to have erred in any way.Fortunately for us, Big Brother never had the internet to contend with. As anyone who's been online for a while knows, nothing on the internet ever goes away. Ever. The words of any leader or influential person are all there, in multiple copies, all of which can themselves be copied and distributed in mere seconds. While it is possible to fake a photograph, the awareness of that possibility, as well as the technology to suss out the fakes, are just as available to anyone who wants them. Even in cases where there are disputes about the past, or re-interpretations of past events, it is impossible for one version to systematically replace all others. While this sometimes results in competing versions of the past, the one with the most evidence tends to prevail.Continuing in that vein, the understanding that the Party controls all information about itself leads to a very interesting question that's not addressed in the book - is anything that is not directly witnessed by Winston Smith true? We are led to believe, for example, that there are three world powers - Oceanea, Eastasia and Eurasia - which are locked in a state of perpetual war. The nature of this war and how it serves the interests of these three nations is laid out in Goldstein's Book, which is the text of the Revolution that Winston and Julia want to join. But here's the thing - Goldstein's Book is an admitted fiction, written by the Party as a kind of honeypot to bring suspects through the last stages of their Thoughtcrime. So we have no proof that the world of Nineteen Eighty-four actually is laid out the way it appears.The Party could in fact dominate the world, using the pretext of war to keep the world's citizens terrified, needy and compliant. On the other extreme, Oceanea could just be Britain, turned in on itself like some super-accelerated North Korea, its borders sealed and its citizens kept in utter ignorance of the world outside. We don't know. We have no way of knowing, and neither do any of the characters in the book. Even the Inner Party members might not know the truth of their world, and wouldn't care if they did.One more thing, and I'll keep this one short - Doublethink. The ability to hold two contradictory ideas in your mind, believing in both of them simultaneously and yet being unaware that there's any conflict at all. Knowing, for example, that last week chocolate rations were at thirty grams, and at the same time knowing that this week they had been raised to twenty. All I can say here is to look at the current health care debate in the United States. Here's a fun game: see how often someone says, \\"We have the best health care in the world,\\" and then see how long it takes before they tell us that health care in the United States is irrevocably broken. Your average politician and pundit does this kind of thing all the time and, in accordance with the basic principles of Doublethink (also known as Reality Control), they immediately forget that they had done it.This game is much easier if you watch Glenn Beck for half an hour.There is just so much to be gleaned from this book. Probably the most important is this - the world depicted in Nineteen Eighty-four is certainly not an impossible one, but it is unlikely. The people of that world allowed the Party to take over for them in a time of crisis, and in that sense this book is a warning to us all. It is a warning to keep the power that we have, and to resist the temptation to let a government decide who we should be.-------------------------------------------\\"I understand HOW: I do not understand WHY.- Winston Smith, Nineteen Eighty-four-------------------------------------------"},{"Title":"1984","review":"this book is great. it shows how if we let ourselves become ignorant and don't protect our rights then we will be taken advantage of. if we do not consistently farmiliarize ourselves with our surroundings we will allow ourselves to be manipulated, and if we suddenly realize and protest there will be devastating outcomes."},{"Title":"1984","review":"After I read this book, I was so disturbed that I couldn't concentrate on my homework.

However, Orwell's work is more importantly a powerful depiction of the power and danger of an unchecked government. He grimly depicts the psychological, economic, technological, and other weapons a government has at its disposal against its people.I recommend this book highly to everyone; I would even say that it is a must read. The writing is not difficult to understand, however, the political concepts are better appreciated with first hand experience and interaction with government and its potential for power abuse. I first read \\"1984\\" as a sophomore in high school and did not fully comprehend the books meaning. The book is even more valuable as a comparison to modern day political events."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Put simply this is the greatest work of dystopian literature ever created. It's not filled with useless details like Atlas Shrugged and is more vivid than anything Huxley or London have ever created.Nineteen Eighty- Four shows the ultimate consequences of government intervention into the individual's life. The book takes place in a totalitarian state called Oceania where even the thoughts of the citizens are controlled and punished by the ruling party.Follow the life of Winston Smith, a mal adjusted government propagandaist, as he struggles to keep his mind, body and soul free for the death grip of the all encompassing state.A must read for all who value individuality, liberty and non-comformity.Come and discover why Orwell is one of the most influential and referenced author of the last century."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Several concepts from \\"1984\\" - especially \\"Big Brother\\" - have been popular cultural references for many years. Despite being familiar with them long before reading the novel, I still found the novel to very engaging and entertaining. One easily identifies with Winston Smith, trapped in a brainwashed society and wanting to rebel, knowing things could be better. Instead of feeling dated, the story feels even more relevant today with the level of surveillance that governments across the globe exercise currently.Some elements such as doublethink may appear to be a bit far-fetched, but still remain scary because one can see a government seeking absolute and unending control going to any lengths to achieve their goal. Indeed, attempting to control people's thoughts isn't outside of the realm of possibility; it can almost seem like \\"political correctness\\" taken to an extreme. So while fans of science fiction and readers of almost any dystopian future story will be familiar with some of the concepts seen here, this is well worth a read, being both one of the earliest examples of the story and still one of the best."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Obviously a great book, but the Kindle edition (at least) omits the Appendix \\"The Principles of Newspeak\\" which any reader should want to have!"},{"Title":"1984","review":"George Orwell's \\"1984\\" is such a powerful read, and a fascinating look into the world where one is under control of the State through the \\"Big Brother.\\"There is one quote that stood out for me from this book:\\"Who controls the past controls the future; who controls the present controls the past.\\"What if this \\"Big Brother\\" is true?

The three slogans of the Party as described in book is very familiar with what we hear from our leaders in these times:War is PeaceFreedom is SlaveryIgnorance is StrengthOrwell paints a picture of how this fascist totalitarian state is controlled by control surveillance, the new language of Newspeak and the three main ministries that are:\\"Ministry of Peace\\", which concerns itself with war\\"The Ministry of Truth\\", which takes care of news, entertainment, education etc. in short translated as the place of propaganda\\"The Ministry of Love\\", which is concerned with law and order and according to Orwell the most frightening one.It is truly a must read book as the rise of fascism is happening.

The characters, the setting, the message, still ring true today. Individualism is crushed in this books world; humans become like insects, and think with a hive mind. The doctrine that the people of this world chant like a mantra are all basic contradictions, such as, \\"War is peace\\". Putting the mind in a double bind where normal thought is paralyzed. A lot of people say that we are moving forward towards the 1984 world. I agree in a sense but we are going about it in a subtle different way. Such as the current cry for everything in the name of safety, really, Can you ever be safe enough? Therefore any law could effectively get passed in the name of safety, or battling terrorists or global warming, or equal rights, or etc infinitum. We have to remember to use common sense when something is presented as truth. Further we must be careful and ever vigilant when it comes to human rights and freedom of speech, and learn the lessons that Orwell tried to teach us."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Reading this novel again in today's context is even more enlightening.

Of course, the closer the world moved towards 1984, the more we wondered how closely the world would resemble the picture drawn by Orwell.Reading the novel again after 1984, and especially now that the cold war has ended and been replaced by other threats to humanity, it is interesting to think about what Orwell's message really might have been about, and its relevance today.Certainly, the psychology of fear and abuses of authority remain central issues. Media manipulation has been elevated to an art form and control of information probably doesn't matter much if people are not well enough educated to dissect facts from interpretation and possible consequences from likely causes.1984 is a great novel. It invites the reader to think about the shape of the future and about a more ideal society. One, perhaps, that optimises the balance between individual rights and responsibilities, and collective safety and obligations.Prescience, irony or paradox? Thankfully, each reader can form their own view(s).Highly recommended.Jennifer Cameron-Smith"},{"Title":"1984","review":"I do not much enjoy reading the works of George Orwell; they are far too grim and pessimistic for me. Despite their unpleasantness, however, Orwell's books are amongst the finest ever written, particularly \\"Animal Farm\\" and his masterwork, \\"1984\\". Having recently experienced \\"1984\\", my being is still in a state of disarray, as will be that of anyone who encounters the novel. \\"1984\\" challenges everything humankind stands for, examines what it means to be human, and then spits on the face of humanity. It does more than that, though - it also tears out all our insecurities and flaws, exposes them in bright sunlight, and then strips us of all confidence and hope, leaving us feeling like little more than dust in the wind. And yet still \\"1984\\" is as much a celebration of humanity as it is a ghastly warning of the dystopia awaiting us should we allow the human spirit to be corrupted.Orwell's novel was written in 1949, shortly after the end of World War II and the detonation of the atomic bomb, and the paranoia and fear that arose from those conflicts as well as from the threat of communism (which even at this time Orwell was well aware of) clearly spawned \\"1984\\". The book is set in 1984, probably (because in the future no one can really keep track of the years). The world has been grouped into three opposing forces: Oceania, Eurasia, and Eastasia. Winston Smith is a citizen of Oceania (which grew from America and England, among others), living in London. In this society, you are monitored at all time, primarily through \\"telescreens\\" placed in every room (a telescreen being a device which transmits and receives information simultaneously). When you are alone, you are never really alone. Individualism is not only discouraged against - it is forbidden. Everyone must work toward a better Oceania. Sex is frowned upon, and is to be used strictly for reproductive purposes. The only music and films are those put forth by the government, and there is no such thing really as \\"entertainment\\". One's time should be divided between work and community activies, such as joining the Anti-Sex League or, for children, joining the Spies, a group which encourages youth to turn in their parents should they commit \\"thought crime\\". Thought crime is when, even for a moment, one should think a negative thought about the government. Crime is monitored by the Thought Police, an elite and secretive government organization which \\"vaporizes\\" criminals - that is, takes offenders in their sleep and erases all records of their existence. In essence, this future society is a far more perturbing version of communism.Winston is 39 years old and works at the Ministry of Truth, a division of government dedicated to revising old news articles so that any record of something being slightly different from the way it is at the present does not exist. (Time is shaped and controlled, even, by the government.) Winston is a dreamer, however, and he suspects that things were not always this bad. Not that that could be proven; any real documents detailing life before the last few years say only that it was very bad. One day he buys a journal and begins writing in it - an act punishable by death, should ever it be discovered by the Thought Police. He fantasizes about a future when the \\"proles\\", the majority of society, the peasants, will rise up against Big Brother (the mascot and ruler of Oceania) and overthrow the government, returning things to the way Winston believes they once were. Winston doesn't think of any way to begin this revolution on his own, however, until he receives a note from a co-worker whom he suspects to be a member of the Thought Police. Then Winston discovers the ultimate way to rebel: he falls in love.How grievous an existence George Orwell must have led. \\"1984\\" is the work of a man not only perturbed, but horrified of the future he saw looming ahead. Fortunately, 1984 has come and gone and present society is not anywhere near as terrible as Orwell's dystopia, but under the control of George W. Bush and our current government it is growing nearer. Thus the message of \\"1984\\" comes across strong as ever, and the \\"inevitable\\" future it predicts remains the most horrific thing imaginable. Indeed, \\"1984\\" is very probably the most unnerving novel ever written.Nevertheless, it MUST be read. It is the strongest message one could send about staying true to the ideals of those who founded the United States of America, but more than that, it is the strongest warning one could make about violating human rights. Human rights must be protected, whether the human in question is black, white, American, Japanese, man, woman, criminal, innocent. Otherwise, society will turn into the nightmare predicted in \\"1984\\", and that is the most tragic thing I can conceive.It's endlessly terrifying, entirely bleak, and ultimately hopeless, but \\"1984\\" is a brilliant novel and unquestionably one of the greatest ever written. George Orwell set out to concoct the most powerful and timeless warning he could, and \\"1984\\" was his grandiose success. The human spirit must not be oppressed, lest all that should remain are humankind. And what is humankind without humanity?"},{"Title":"1984","review":"This book shows how democratic countries shows how they look in a totaliterianistic government. When I read that Oceania also included the U.S. I couldn't believe it. The whole phrase of &quot;Big Brother is Watching You&quot; came from this book. This book comes a little bit short of Animal Farm to me, but it was still a great lead.

While i was reading, i was truely affected by this book, and i really couldn't force myself to put it down except to sleep.I'm really tired of kids complaining that it has a sad ending: it couldn't have worked out any other way.

It is certainly about communism. You can tell from their physical descriptions that Big Brother is Stalin and Goldstein is Trotsky. At a time when many people admired the Soviet Union, George Orwell saw the Soviet system for what it was- a brutal dictatorship based on fear. However, it is not just about communism. It is a warning against all totalitarian systems of thought that seek to impose forcibly a particular ideology on people and to mould people at will. Winston Smith's struggle to hold on to objective truth in a world of lies and human decency in a world of cruelty symbolises the real life struggle to do just that of so many people in this century that has brought us the horrors of the Gulags and Auschwitz."},{"Title":"1984","review":"After being a smart English teacher for 41 years in Venice, I've reached the conclusion that Nineteen Eighty-Four is a vivid satire on the Russian Revolution.

It is more than the socio-political commentary, on which many other reviewers have focused on solely, but has an enchanting love story weaved seemlessly in to it. I apologise for my 'flowery' style, but I can not speak highly enough of this novel. It is also written to think about, not just to read. I read a review which stated that the novel had a sad ending. Once you have read the book, ask yourself 'When is Winston at his most happy?'. That is the books contradiction, and its achievement."},{"Title":"1984","review":"I read 1984 for a book report.

First George Orwell was a socialist. He fought on the side of the anarchists on the Spanish Civil War. His book is not about the dangers of communism but about the dangers of totalitarianism, the two are unrelated, not that anyone knows this. The book is also about more than this. It is about what is important in life, about humanity in general, and about war, to name a few.

Nineteen Eighty-Four is not just a supreme work of art: it is politically relevant, because the phenomena identified by Orwell (doublethink, newspeak, etc.) are, in various forms, actively used today in even the freest societies.

This amazing piece of work stands as my favorite book of all time, and the starting point that lead me to dystopian works of Aldous Huxley, and even Kurt Vonnegut."},{"Title":"1984","review":"1984 is about several things but mostly it is about language: the fact that a vibrant and expanding language is the greatest sign of freedom while the destruction and reduction of language is the path to opression. This and the description of the many approaches used by the state to assure the loyalty of its people make this an all-time great. Plotwise, the key approach is the use of Emanuel Goldberg to locate and draw out those who are not loyal to Big Brother. My only problem with the book is the reprint of Goldberg's entire manuscript, which unnecessarily rehashes much of the first third of the book. But this one flaw is not enough to take it down a star. This needs to be read by everyone."},{"Title":"1984","review":"This book tells us about how one person's Total thinking can be altered by means of a simple tool called Torture."},{"Title":"1984","review":"In my opinion this is Orwell's best novel and is also my favorite book.

Big Brother can portray not only a dictator, but god. does he really exist? no one has ever seen him. of course, this is only secondary to the main theme of this book, totalitarian governments. this book can be interpreted on many levels. to all those people saying this book was slow and boring: i'm 15 and if i can understand it, you should be able to also."},{"Title":"1984","review":"In my British Lit class we had to read a wide variety of books.

It, as well as all the other books I read in that class, made me want to go back to the classics and read them.It gave me inspiration that not all classics are dull and boring."},{"Title":"1984","review":"1984 was a phenomenal book. Few books I've read have caused me to think so closely about societal issues, the government, and human instinct. The book proposed a sociey in which the government has complete and utter control over every action and thought that it's citizens experience. I don't usually enjoy books that have a science fiction basis, however, 1984 truly captivated my attention, and I found myself reluctant to put it down. It relays the story of a man, Winston, who wishes to change a society where all oposition to the government is dealt with swiftly and severely, usually by death. He joins forces with Julia, a strong willed woman, who also acts as his love interest. Together, they attempt to get in touch with the Brotherhood, an anti-Big Brother agency, in hope that one day Big Brother will be overthrown. The twists and turns that the book contains are exquisite and they culminate into one superb ending. The book is at times somewhat dry, but none the less, I would highly recommend it to anyone who is ready to read a thought-provoking piece of outstanding literature."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Hmmm...some pretty hyperbolic reviews for this book so far. Well, I can't deny that it is now the equal best book I've ever read (along with One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, which I'm going to read again, to see which is better), but all this talk of causing depression and paranoia is a little over the top. Frankly, it made me feel euphoric to be so engrossed and stimulated. It certainly stirs emotion, it certainly is prophetic and it is impossible to put it down, but the real strength for me lay in the absolute craftsmanship present in the writing. I think this is because the book is a combination of fiction and political philosophy - all the more clever because the political philosophy has to ring true in regard to the fictional content, and also be relevant to reality in order to make it's impact on the reader.Much of it describes the conflict within Winston Smith's head; the contradiction between what he believes to be true and what he is told to believe, so you have a lot of thoughts and concepts being discussed at length during the story. To order and structure a novel of this kind and present a cohesive description of a system of government in such a way is an amazing feat. Having seen the film, I could not see how the people employed alongside Winston Smith can be involved in their own deception and be blind to it, but Orwell is absolutely convincing. It is such an intricately woven novel. I have often thought that I would like to write a novel, and one of the things that stopped me is the knowledge that I would not have the patience to get to the end, but then to read something like this makes you realise that there is no point because it would be impossible to write anything as complex and compelling as this. Orwell discusses so many ideas yet every time he revisits one, he takes it further and delves deeper into the system, and deeper into the mind - without repeating himself.Frankly, I find it difficult to explain just how well written this is, to say nothing of the great story.To sum up in one sentence...absolutely fascinating."},{"Title":"1984","review":"1984 is, quite simply, a book that everyone should read. It is one man's view of the world that we were, and still are, becoming, and it is a view that is not a pleasant one. Told through the eyes of an ordinary citizen living in London, George Orwell expounds upon the ways in which an unchecked government would intrude into our daily lives. From the cameras that are always watching, to the children who are brainwashed by the state to spy on \\"thought criminals,\\" to the revisionist history that is nothing but pure propaganda, and the continual reduction of one's rations for military purposes, the country that is run by Big Brother is one in which there are truly no freedoms, and those who speak out are quickly silenced.It is also a story of hope, even in the face of such an invincible enemy. The main characters attempt futily to fight back, trying to find their own form of seclusion. Yet, whom can they trust? It seems as though everyone is on the government's payroll. In the end, they have to make a last ditch effort for a piece of freedom, knowing the consequences will be severe if they are caught.1984 is, to some extent, a slow read, but this is necessary due to the intricate descriptions of the characters' ordinary actions. While news of the war is always heard of in the background, the front is far off, if it exists at all. Rather, we are taken into the homes, workplaces, pubs, and streets of a horrifying world in which we have no power, save that to succumb to the wishes of our rulers. 1984 is a warning to those who would place too much power into our government's hands, for as we have seen in real-life examples, the government is not afraid to abuse the power it is given."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Written in 1949, this book has become such a part of the culture that even people who've never heard of it (if there are any such) would recognize the terms \\"doublethink\\" and \\"thoughtcrime\\", among others that this book introduced to the lexicon. The truly scary thing is not that there are noticeable similarities between our political culture and the culture portrayed in this book, but rather the even closer similarities between that culture and our corporate culture.After all, in the corporate world, as in the \\"Oceana\\" of this book, the \\"proles\\" (common laborers) can pretty much think and say what they want, although it IS possible for individuals to go too far. But if one wants a comfortable life in an office job, one not only has to watch what one says, but how one says it, and what one can be demonstrated to think. If one is caught in the \\"thoughtcrime\\" of being insufficiently enthusiastic about one's company, or showing doubts about whether what it's doing is right or not, one will surely be \\"disappeared\\"; one's co-workers will show up one day and simply not find you there, and if anyone is foolish enough to ask what happened, they will simply be told, in a tone of voice that brooks no further questions, \\"s/he is no longer with the department\\". If the offense was serious enough, that person will never work in as high-level a position again, anywhere. They won't have been taken off and tortured; they will simply have been exiled to the status of common laborer, where they're no longer dangerous.Also, if you doubt the existence of \\"doublethink\\", consider that corporations want honest, trustworthy employees, but heaven help the employee who speaks his/her mind (even quietly, on his/her own time) if it disagrees with corporate policy.The real world may be more subtle than the novel, but truth is no less truth for being subtle."},{"Title":"1984","review":"How easily can humans be influenced and manipulated?This question has to be considered to decide whether the novel \\"1984\\" written by George Orwell in 1949 as a \\"negative utopia\\" is realistic or not.The protagonist Winston Smith lives in London, the capital of Oceania which is one of the three existing superstates. As an outer party member he is constantly controlled and observed by the \\"English Socialist Party\\" (Ingsoc) and its imaginary leader, Big Brother. The country is always in the state of war with some other state to prevent an increase in the living standards to keep the power over the population.The plot of the novel is divided into three parts that reflect Winston's development in the totalitarian system that requires full orthodoxy. In part 1 he secretly starts to rebel against the horrible circumstances, the emptiness and loneliness of his life while he works in the Propaganda Ministry of the state. The second part describes Winston's relationship to Julia, an uncomplicated, optimistic woman. When the two are arrested because of unorthodoxy and so-called \\"thoughtcrime\\" Winston is tortured and brainwashed in part 3.The novel describes the experiences and reactions to a cruel suppression of individuality. The continuous control body and mind (emotions and thoughts) by the Thought Police and the punishment Winston is afraid of, force him to look expressionless to the telescreens while his doubts and emotions whelm up inside him. He tries to express himself in a diary (thoughtcrime) though his feelings are manipulated by indoctrination to hatred towards a virtual enemy. In his work Winston has to manipulate himself: he has to alter the past by rectifying newspaper articles the party needs to prove their correctness. One has to learn to believe in two contradictory aspects simultaneously (doublethink). In his love affair with Julia Winston experiences peace and trust, but, at the same time, he knows the cruel end that must come. As expected, the two are discovered after Winston tired to understand the sense and intention of Ingsoc. In his torture, that is carried out by O'Brien who has a sort of father role, Winston has to learn that nothing exists than through human consciousness, that truth is what the party claims to be true and that the individual is only a biological cell. Winston finally accepts what is required after he has given up his hope and starts to love Big Brother in the belief that it is an authentic feeling.You see in part 1 a common manipulation of the party members through the everyday recurring \\"Two-Minutes-Hate\\" and information given on the telescreen. After Winston' s search for his authentic feelings in part 2 he is individually manipulated by O'Brien the way of brainwashing \\"to make him sane\\".As the story is conveyed through Winston' s perception and written in an eloquent style, you can be easily involved, so while reading you get almost always the same opinion as Winston even if they are sometimes contradictory. When finally the party uses Winston' s counter-strategies against himself I got confused what happened to \\"me\\".The manipulation of emotions and thoughts is quite obvious in the novel. Even the reader can be partly manipulated by the imaginative and convincing expression.In our time the technical methods to manipulate are numerous. For example in the advertising. But I think, because of Orwell's intention to make ways of influence obvious we shall be critical to search for our own thoughts and authentic feelings.This is what I think we can learn out of this novel."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Nineteen-eighty-four is a prime example of what the future may have looked like had the world had fallen to a reign of totalitarism; a world of total government control. If you enjoy lengthy narratives with details oozing out of the binding, or take a fancy to history and government, this is a must read. If you like books that make you think, this would be a good choice; however, if these subjects don't excite you, you may want to stay away from this one. The incredibly detailed writing clarifies and depicts each scene with stunning reality, but can slow the reading with the intriguing, yet tedious facts.The main themes are love, oppression, and hidden rebellion. It deals with the struggle of man against the indomitable machine of politics. Nineteen-eighty-four is set behind the perspective of the main character, Winston. Only what the he sees is what the reader sees. Given this, you see a great deal. If you harbor even the smallest interest in totalitarian government or communism, this is a good read. The book follows Winston through his daily life and describes its intertwining with the people around him, the &quot;Brotherhood,&quot; and the &quot;Party.&quot; Through hatred of the governmental restrictions and an illegal love interest, Wilson secretly plans the Party's demise as the plot progressively thickens. The insight and imagination that Orwell used to fabricate an entire world is outstanding. He has a marvelously terrifying viewpoint of Marxist policy, scary to the point of realism.However, as good as this book may seem, it is aimed at the mature reader, a fabulous choice for the high school and college students and great for adults too. So for all of you who have always heard the well-known phrase &quot;Big Brother's watching you,&quot; and never knew what it meant, take the chance to figure out what it means by diving into 1984; you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Orwell, for a skinny accountant-looking Englishman who's real name is Eric Blair, you rock for this single shining moment in literature history. Yeah, kudos to you.The nightmarish world of 1984 has yet to hit us yet, though we are getting there sometime. His world of Oceania is completely thourough and believable, with many similarities in today's society. It's an Animal Farm for the real world, no metaphors, no representations, just humans so idiots who didn't understand the latter can feel smart, too.Winston, our hero, is almost a perfect mirror image of Orwell himself, wandering around the plot and pointing out the ways people will try to control you without even really trying to point it out. It is written so well it just speaks for itself. It doesn't need to be explained, it is understood at first glance.The world is alive with sugar rations, forced morning exercises, paroles, betrayals, hipocrisy, and chestnut trees (You'll understand all too well when you finish the book).Winston sees cracks, deep and ominous, in his utopia and eventually tries to rebel against it only to be &quot;re-educated&quot;. The book explores the meanings of truth, of history, of what really is for our own good.From the first sentence to the last four words, this book is one that will stay with you forever."},{"Title":"1984","review":"George Orwell's 1984 is a riveting story of science-fiction where everyone is constantly watched and every move analysed.It is also, and more, a sociological book about totalitarism. It asks the question?: What if the government could read your mind? How could they control your life? What do they need to do to control your life? How to they get you to think like they do? The answer to all is by controlling the media. You control the information the public gets, then you can control their opinion. It is a book about power and how bad it can get. It also talks aboutthe different classes in the society, how they act toward each other. Even if the book was written quite some time ago, the answers it provides are still quite accurate, and that's what makes it such a powerful book."},{"Title":"1984","review":"George Orwell's classic '1984' was absurd to me when I first read it in 1984 at the tender age of sixteen. Now, at twice that age, I realize how close we really are to the horror he envisioned. It is a cynical and depressing look at how weak the human spirit really can be. Even now, it is appalling to see my generation sacrifice liberty for security at every turn. The novel leads you along expecting the best for our protagonist, but in the end his doom is sealed not by his own unwillingness to fight, but the unwillingness of mankind. A society where people would gladly live in shackles (even in the metaphorical sense) rather than make a stand for the right to live free, is not so hard to invision. The society described in Orwell's nighmarish future is only off by a few generations...we are on the road to &quot;doublethink&quot;. WAR IS PEACE, FREEDOM IS SLAVERY, IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH. This novel should be read by all high school students, and read again by all parents."},{"Title":"1984","review":"George Orwell's novel 1984 is an intriguing piece ofliterature. It is interesting, inspiring, and terrifying all at thesame time. Published in 1949, the novel's unyielding dystopian realism gives a warning that concerns the menaces of totalitarianism that Orwell feared could completely grip the world in the near future. The novel is set in an imaginary future world that is dominated by three constantly warring totalitarian police states. The novel's hero, Wnston Smith, is a minor party official in the Ministry of Truth, where the motto is, &quot;he who controls the past controls the future, and he who controls the future controls the past.&quot; Ironically, it is Winston's relentless longing for 'truth' and decency that leads him to secretly rebel against the government and its esteemed leader, Big Brother. In doing so, Smith becomes involved in a love affair with a like-minded by the name of Julia. Together, with the purpose of overthrowing the totalitarian government, they join an underground organization called the Brotherhood. Unfortunately, they are both apprehended by the Thought Police shortly after their admission into the organization. The ensuing imprisonment, torture, and reeducation of Winston and Julia are intended not merely to make them submit or to break them physically, but to root out their independent mental existence and spiritual dignity to the point that they betray the only thing that they have ever loved: each other. This novel made a deep impression on me. Orwell does an excellent job of getting his warning across while at the same time touching on romance and the natural instincts of the human heart. The daunting part about reading this novel is that it is very realistic and possible. 1984 is a novel that should be read by everyone, and the warning that it gives should be heeded. By Alicia Crawhorn"},{"Title":"1984","review":"\\"1984\\" is a haunting look into a post Nuclear War world where all world governments have evolved into all-seeing, all knowing, ruthless police states constantly at war. It is a very worthwhile read for all of us now in the post-industrial/nuclear era. Whether humanity is capable of degrading to and sustaining such a system is hard to know, but as Walter Cronkite explains in the forward, this book is a warning about what we may be capable of allowing if we are not vigilant in defense of our liberties and human, not mechanized, way of life. Written from the first person perspective, the reader bonds with Winston Smith, a likable and familiar fellow to any reader. We experience the terror and fear omnipresent in his society and join him as he begins to question the Party. The \\"Telescreen,\\" the infamous device in every party member's home that both broadcasts the party line and watches the residents is a pessimistic preview of what our broadbanded, HD media devices could become."},{"Title":"1984","review":"\\"In the old days, he thought, a man looked at a girl's body and found it desirable, and that was the end of the story. But you could not have pure love or pure lust nowadays. No emotion was pure because everything was mixed up with fear and hatred. Their embrace had been a battle, the climax a victory. It was a blow struck against the Party. It was a political act.\\" The year is 1984, or so Winston Smith thinks. Nothing is ever certain anymore except he lives in Oceania and they are constantly at war with either Eurasia or Eastasia. They had always been at war with Eurasia, until a quick announcement and falsification of thousands of records made them always at war with Eastasia. The Party is always right, or so it would seem. By looking at records you know existed, you would find only lies. Winston Smith knows this because he works for the Ministry of Truth, which deals with the falsification of records. The Party is the single reigning body of totalitarianisim for 1/3 of the world. But, is this simply a mere story, or something more? Was George Orwell trying to warn us of the direction our own government is heading? This version is a little extreme, but it proves its point. Winston Smith is an average man working for the Party. Scared of it, but also hating it, Winston believes that he is good as dead. He does not believe in the Party or its values, and in this world, that will earn you an arrest from the thought police for thoughtcrime. The Party can virtually read your mind through the telescreen; a two- way video broadcast system. You can never be alone with your thoughts."},{"Title":"1984","review":"George Orwell was way ahead of his time with this book. It's amazing that in the late 1940's when in the West relatively little was known about the life under communism and it's impact on everyday life, Orwell was able to capture this so brilliantly! However, this book isn't just about communism, but about any social, religious or other structure that is trying to suppress freedom and exert control over human mind. Still relevant today.Probably the only thing that he did not get right is that he associated communism too closely with the ability to innovate. When there are no personal rewards and people live in fear, there isn't innovation. But that's just a side note and it does not take anything away from this brilliant book.It's a timeless classic that has something to say to every generation and should be a required reading.

You'll be reflecting upon this book for days and even well after."},{"Title":"1984","review":"The power of 1984 lies in its author's uncanny prescience. The ordeal of protagonist Winston Smith is similar to that which many Americans are experiencing today, through the gradual erosion of personal liberties and the creeping intrusiveness of government. The most chilling aspects of the novel concern not its depiction of graphic torture, but rather its treatment of its fictional media, which distorts reality at whim to suit the aims of Big Brother. The extent to which betrayal by government plays a part in the story should also be haunting for today's citizens. These maladies are too eerily close to what is happening today in America, as media spin distorts every story out of control and politicians are making themselves more impossible to trust every day. That George Orwell foresaw so many decades ago the rise of leaders like George Bush and Dick Cheney truly testifies to his sagacity, just as the story's power to transfix and haunt modern readers testifies to his brilliance as a storyteller."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Today's American is mentally incomplete if he/she has not read this book. If you haven't read it, please do so. If you have read it, please read it again. And keep in mind that reading it is not the goal. Knowing it is the goal.The distinction is important because Orwell so masterfully describes the loss of truth, the loss of individuality, the loss of freedom so subtely and so effortlessly, that the crucial points are missed if the reader has a lack of focus.with uncanny brilliance, Orwell describes the tactics used by a totalitarian state against its own people to gain submission and cooperation. The submission is so complete that the proles (the masses) no longer have ownership over their own thought! It is a subtle and painless process and only Alexis De Tocqueville, in his monumental work, \\"Democracy in America\\" has come close in the past 175 years of describing it, but even Tocqueville admits that he can't give it a name.\\"In fact there will be no thought...Orthodoxy means not thinking-not needing to think. Orthodoxy is unconsciousness\\" writes Owell. Orwell later writes that \\"orthodoxy is stupidity\\". What the reader needs to understand with this point is that \\"orthodoxy\\" is the \\"news\\" we get from our mainstream media, our establishment press. Because our mainstream media is government controlled, as explained in the book:U.S. Television News and Cold War Propaganda, 1947-1960 (Cambridge Studies in the History of Mass Communication), naturally only government orthodoxy will be espoused.In the novel, Orwell writes, \\"There is no possibility that any perceptible change will happen within our own lifetime\\".There are so many unbelievably essential tactics described in this book that I can't do much justice to them in this review, but the reader needs to connect with Orwell's cleverness and understand how important it is to Big Brother to control the language and rewrite the history, in fact, write the history before it even happens. This, the torture to get confessions, attacking an ally and blaming an enemy (false flag terrorism) is all here and Orwell wrote this masterpiece 60 years ago!This book, Nineteen Eighty-Four, is drawn from heavily in the book,Don't Weep for Me, America: How Democracy in America Became the Prince (While We Slept). Here, the relevancy of \\"Nineteen Eighty-Four\\" will blow a lot of minds..."},{"Title":"1984","review":"This is an incredible book. I was very impressed with how well it is written and amazed that someone in the mid 40's was able to come up with such futuristic ideas and almost shocked at how much of it pertains to the realities of life. I loved every word of it and was almost sad that it was over."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Well, not exactly Animal Farm, but the same themes are pushed to their maximum logical end. Orwell writes of a government bent on controlling the people that obviously stems from a comunist base. his stark future is frighteningly belivable and his characters are human to a fault. they live fictiotuious lives to the best of their abilities. they are individuals in a see of conformity no matter what the goverment may say.The book makes the reader aware of any numerous ways that people can be controlled. After reading it, any action heard taken by the government becomes suspect. As good literature should, it demands the reader superimpose the book onto daily life and do all they can to prevent such a future."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Many people that I have spoken to that have read this book have downplayed it's genious and told me of it's tediousness. When I chose this book for an Independent Reading Project in my English class, mostly out of spite and interest in the title, I was brought into a world of tolatanarist leadership and of a little man struggling to find himself.I'll admit, the book itself is difficult reading, but at the same time is very descriptive and almost fortelling of an apocolyptic disaster. There is not one boring point throughout the entire book, and at every turn, someone is decieving someone else and the world is revolving again.I recommend this book to anyone who has the knowledge to comprehend stereo instructions but at the same time, fully understands them. This book is full of symbols and if you can't figure them out in the beginning, you will be lost at the end."},{"Title":"1984","review":"This was a decent book it was written well, there was times when I did not want to put down the book becuase it had some interesting parts in it. But the down side is that I thought that these were to few and far inbetween becuase it was kinda of slow paced and I would lose interest and want to do something else. I found myself forcing myself to read it (becuase I had to for school) rather than read for enjoyment. another negative about the book is that 1984 has pasted and it was nothing like this and it just kind of ruins it for me I would have given this book a 4-5 stars if I had read it sometime between 1950-1965 which I bet was a very good book back then. But I think that some people would really enjoy it and I can understand why alot of people rated the book higher than I did but I personally didnt feel the book."},{"Title":"1984","review":"I think that the book &quot;1984&quot;, written by George Orwell was a book that raised many questions.

I highly recommend this book to someone looking for a challenge and a well written book!"},{"Title":"1984","review":"Quite a dark story. It became boring at times and had a bit too much informational writing. Definitly not your average story. Well written. The plot was okay. Read it if you want the experience.

It is much more light hearted and easier to read."},{"Title":"1984","review":"a dark anti-utopian book with under lying meanings about history in foreign countrys"},{"Title":"1984","review":"George Orwell looked ahead in 1984 to a time when totalitarianism might rule society. Written in 1949, Orwell wanted to force people to think about the possibility, real in his mind, that a government-Big Brother-could control our thoughts and actions. So the actual 1984 has come and gone, and nothing happened quite like Orwell might have thought. Still the book gives us something to think about and somebody to watch out for. Be careful. Big Brother is watching."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Orwell's view of the world in 1984 is amazing, capturing thedeception and reality that exists around us. This foresight from the1950s into the future is great because its accuracy is undeniable. The life of Winston Smith, as well as his interaction with society, can be directly related to the current day.Winston unknowingly is under the watchful eye of Big Brother, who has telescreens and informants everywhere to note Winston's actions. With today's video cameras and listening devices, this fiction becomes reality. The Thought Police are comparable to communist governments and the media, trying to conform people to their standards and/or ideas. Love is also restricted, like the love Winston has for Julia. A person can no longer carry on a simple relationship without intervention from outside sources.The novel was truly ahead of its time, and may still hold true for future generations. The primary reason \\"1984\\" remains popular is because it can still be applied to the world today. Orwell has written a marvelous story of the past, present, and future, allowing us to all live the life of the oppressed Winston Smith and see reality for ourselves."},{"Title":"1984","review":"1) Read Erich Fromm's afterward.2) Don't imply that 1984 was somehow meant to be a prediction for the state of the real world in 1984. Even if that were the case, the fact that he wasn't 100% right does not need to be reiterated for the 8 billionth time.3) Don't reduce this complex and subtle masterpiece to a mere allegory for Stalinist totalitarianism.4) If you don't know that Orwell was a liberal with strong socialist leanings, read some of his other books and possibly a biography before thinking that all 1984 is about is damning communism or socialism.5) If your review is shorter than three sentences, you're probably not saying anything new, so don't even bother.6) If you just finished reading 1984 for your high school English class, please do not write a review. Wait until you've gone through college, and read it again. (related to Rule 5)7) Don't call Orwell &quot;Eric Blair&quot; - as if you and he were old school chums. As a writer, he is George Orwell.Thank you. Following these rules, there would be about 50 reviews left and maybe a person would have time to read them all!"},{"Title":"1984","review":"Written in the late forties, Orwell's 1984 is clearly a product of its time; a time when the advent and eventual use of the atom bomb threatened the end of civilization. I admire Orwell for the amount of thought and imagination he must have put into the development of this book. It is an example of how a powerful imagination can teeter between extremes of pure optimism and, in this case, paranoia. In 1984, Orwell's vision of the future is grim: war is constant; freedom, as we know it, is an ancient and outdated concept; and love, for anything but government, is perverse. Winston, the book's protagonist, struggles with a lost sense of self and his fear of a government (the Party) that punishes the pursuit of individual fulfillment. Most disturbing is that, in the end, rather than die as a martyr, he embraces his oppressive government fully aware his capitulation will precipitate his own death.Orwell's commentary on the evolution of totalitarianism is profound. Orwell asserts that post-Neolithic governments, with the benefit of written history, were, over time, able to reduce the threat of overthrow using lessons learned by fallen predecessors. Orwell argues that throughout history people have been divided among high, middle and lower classes; and that, with the advancement of successive governments, the intent of the higher class to maintain power over the lower classes has become less explicit. This has left the lower classes less inclined to revolt. In 1984, the proletariat is under the illusion that their government represents their interest. The Party fosters this illusion, in part, by constantly \\"updating\\" any record of the past. As a result, people are unaware of how terrible their lives are relative to the lives of those who lived before them.Newspeak, the language created by the ruling party in 1984, is amazingly detailed and seems feasible. It is based on the English language, and its vocabulary grows smaller instead of larger every year. An appendix, included in the book, enumerates some of the terminology and syntax of the language, and explains how the language is designed to control the thoughts of those who utilize it.Orwell's prose is not noticeably good or bad. The book's strength is in its power to make people think."},{"Title":"1984","review":"I was depressed for a week after I finished completing this novel. The torture that the protagonist endures is just too much to digest. I can only be thankful that this terrifying vision hasn't come to fruition...yet.Oddly enough, as I was trying to finish the final 100 pages of this book, I began reading \\"The Partner\\", which also has the main character endure series of torture to get him to crack."},{"Title":"1984","review":"After reading a few of the earlier reviews here I can see, sadly, that Big Brother is winning the war against the Individual and against Democracy. When seventeen year olds, \\"DON'T GET IT\\", it is clear that the propaganda and \\"education\\" that America and other \\"slowly turning fascist\\" nations are are being hypnotized with are hitting their mark and accomplishing their goals.Anyone who can read Orwell's call to action and put it down with a yawn is already dead! Their friends and family should bury them and shrug. Imagine channel surfing when Paul Revere announced that the Redcoats were coming?! Orwell has made his announcement. It's up to us to heed the call or be dominated and subjugated by a government no longer of, for or by \\"the people\\" but rather owned and operated by Big Money, Big Business and Big Brother.1984 has accurately predicted the state that we live in where we are being told by our? own government that there are threats around every corner, so watch out. Be afraid! Be very afraid! BEWARE! CONDITION ORANGE! CONDITION RED? THE TERRORISTS ARE COMING, THE TERRORISTS ARE COMING! LOCK YOUR DOORS AND HOARD DUCT TAPE AND WATER.I am acutely aware that terrorism is a reality. It has been all through history. But how many times now have we been \\"warned\\" that a terrorist attack is being brewed? How many times have we been put on \\"CONDITION ORANGE\\"? But no attack follows and no follow up announcement that the \\"imminent attack\\" was prevented!Where are all these terrorists that planned these imminent attacks? I would expect to see their faces on CNN every night.This is exactly Big Brother's STRATEGY. It keeps people in a constant state of low level anxiety expecting a bomb to be dropped on our heads any second! But no terrorist are found under our beds. Just what does it accomplish to announce these \\"alerts\\" via Big Brother's Big Screen and color coded DANGER LEVEL lights?Does he expect citizens to do something about it? Can citizens stop terrorism if we \\"expect\\" it to occur at any minute? Are we being given guns to protect ourselves and metal detectors to check out the bags of the \\"suspicious looking dark man\\" next to us on the train?How does this work? Just what does our \\"National Homeland\\" Czar expect us to do other than worry, kneel and grovel to the Big Brother in the sky?Are we taking classes or receiving instruction about how to identify and thwart terrorists and \\"suspicious\\" activity? Or are we just being made anxious and paranoid in the obvious (at least to some of us) attempt to get the masses to empty their pockets of even more tax dollars and to give up our few remaining Democratic rights of a FREE COUNTRY? So that Big Brother can \\"better protect us?\\" Please!For the reviewers that can't understand this book I say: MORE'S THE PITY! You are ripe for the picking. All King Bill, George and John have to say to you is give us more money and all your remaining HARD-EARNED-BY-THE-BLOOD-OF-BRAVE-AMERICANS\\" RIGHTS, and we will keep you safe from the big bad terrorist boogie man! Yeah, right. Like they kept us safe in Oklahoma City and New York!THE SAFEST PLACE IN THE WORLD IS THE INSIDE OF A PRISON CELL!This is where our great leaders really want us all to be. Not an actuall prison cell but a controlled society with ID stamped into our flesh and eternal fear pressed into our souls.GET YOUR HEAD OUT OF YOUR ASS, MY YOUNG FRIEND AND READ THE BOOK AGAIN. YOU SHOULDN'T BE ALLOWED TO GRADUATE HIGH SCHOOL WITHOUT UNDERSTANDING ORWELL AND BECOMING A REAL AMERICAN.Orwell's classic 1984 is, very simply, true. Many believe that it was a prediction of what our world would be like in 1984 (it was written in 1951). It was not a prediction but rather an analogy to the world of Orwell's time. He was ALREADY LIVING IN 1984.Most people cannot (or will not) see that our world is already controlled by BIG BROTHER. It is sad, scary but true. In 1984 Orwell shows the governments of the world scaring their own population. Well, America does the same thing! So does any country that wishes to extract huge taxes from its population to support \\"needed\\" war machines. Now that the Soviet \\"threat\\" is gone, America needed a new one. Enter: TERRORISM.But if the reader cares to do a bit of research he or she will find that American militarists have been suggesting that the American military and CIA conduct terror against ITS OWN POPULATION for many years now. During the Cuban \\"threat\\" the pentagon asked Kennedy to allow it to blow up an American ship killing Americans! He declined.Are we SURE who was responsible for 9/11? No one has taken credit for it. Why? All terror groups IMMEDIATELY TAKE CREDIT FOR THIER WORK when they pull something off. Why wouldn't the Taliban or Al Quaida jump at the chance of taking credit for the greatest example of terrorism in America? The only LOGICAL explanation is because they didn't do it!I'm not saying that American militarists did it. Maybe it was a country that stood to gain from having America go after those \\"crazy Moslems.\\" Israel? How about Israel and America? Who knows? But there is no EVIDENCE of who actually did it and more important WHY.You can sit back and take the easy explanation spoon fed to you from corporate owned media with its own agenda. Or you can read and understand 1984 and start thinking beyond the \\"obvious.\\" If you want to read a book that picks up where 1984 leaves off try HOW TO SAVE AMERICA AND THE WORLD. Yes, I wrote it but that is no reason not to read it. Everyone advertises his or her own books. I simply offer it because, like Orwell, I want people to know what is really going on and why.Read between the lines when you read American \\"news.\\" Better yet listen to news broadcasts from other counties. It's not a matter of writing outright lies as much as OMITTING details and SKEWING various parts of stories.Orwell gives you the tools to begin to think for yourself. If it's too much work or too scary, then just put your faith in your president. He would never lie to you, would he? Like his Daddy said, just \\"read my lips.\\" Oh, that's right. What he was referring to turned out to be a lie and he DID RAISE TAXES after all! Oh, well. At least you can trust Orwell.Joseph Francione [author of HOW TO SAVE AMERICA AND THE WORLD]"},{"Title":"1984","review":"I read george orwells book 1984. I didnt really like this book due to the fact it was a total negative outlook throughout the whole book. His prediction of the future was a little to far fetched for me. That book wasnt really my style. I can see this book being liked by many people so I would recommend it due to the fact everyone has different opinions. This book being such a negative outlook of the future just wasnt what i wanted to read about."},{"Title":"1984","review":"By giving it 2 stars I'm not saying the book had no affect on me, 2 stars means it's ok, now my review.When I read Animal Farm by George Orwell, I was blown away, it was a great book, with such a great meaning behind it. So when I decided to read 1984, I was hoping it'd be better, but when I started reading it, I almost fell asleep. It is said to have a warning for Governments behind it, and I guess in 1943 it did, but in the year 2000, I dont think it warns anyone. He was trying to say, that when a government or anyone tries for a Utopia(perfect place) that it falls in on them, and can never work out. Just like The Giver, by Lois Lowry, that book was very good, where a boy grows up in a town where it's all black and white, and people ride bikes everywhere. The people ride bikes so there is no pollution, and also because they dont leave their little town, it blew me away, and maybe you should read it, if you already haven't.But as for 1984 I dont know, I guess I was expecting too much, and didn't get what I was hoping for.Jesse"},{"Title":"1984","review":"I think that this book is a bad book. Not only is it unrealistic, but also a boring book. Orwell has an imaginative mind, I must say, but thuis book talks about 1949, when he published it when there were such things as totalitarism. How could he know it would still be the exact same thing in 1984? This book also has strange events. The author skipped around too many times. At one sentence, he would be in the appartment in Winston's home, and without telling a reason for it, he would be some where else. The book is also boring. There is not enough action and suspense to make the reader willing to read it."},{"Title":"1984","review":"1984 is a classic. any aducated man and woman in the western world should at least here about it. George Orwell was a major political writer in the 20th century, his novels read by millions.However, 1984 os not by any means a good read. Its plot is incredibly weak, shallow and unitresting- but its not a story we wanted to read, its an opinion we expacted to learn.and you will learn- Orwell leaves no way for you, the reader, not to understand his point. Its annoying. evreything, evrey single metaphore, or situation, or element of the book is epxplained throughly and lengthly. nothing is lrft for the reader to figure out by himself. at times, the didactive tones of the book make it feel more like an elborate sort of lecture than an actual novle. the way things work in the book is radical, the point of view incredibly one sided and narrow, the conclusions unsurprising. overall, while the book has potential, Orwell's insistance on using it as nothing more than a conduit to pass his ideas through makes it a tedious read. on top of evreything, what little story we get is full of plotholes and pushd my way over the cliffs of my suspense of disbelief."},{"Title":"1984","review":"This is the first time I have ordered a book online and was a little hesitant due to time restraints.

You might like this book if you are interested in predicting the future and you can read lots of difficult words and know what they mean. Keep your dictionary close!"},{"Title":"1984","review":"I can understand that maybe in the wake of Nazism and under the continuation of Stalinism, the message of this book might have seemed more relevant than it in fact is. Looking past that overplayed message, though, it's difficult to detect the kind of substance, complexity of theme and depth of character which ought to make a classic. The writing is decent, but it's time to stop touting it as something everyone should read. There's no need whatsoever to read it; get the three-sentence summary from someone who has: \\"This novel is about a totalitarian state. The abstract totalitarian authority figure is called 'big brother.' Totalitarianism is bad.\\" But it's not as though that message needs to get spread around these days.As a seperate criticism, never minding that the message it obvious, it has quite a few weaknesses. Presenting the top five reasons why the scenario in this book would never, ever come about:5) This is the English we're talking about, and they don't put up with much. I mean, they're too cool for a constitution; they've got by so far on _common law_. They've had totalitarian rulers, and when they got to be too much of a load to bear, they were beheaded.4) If children were responsible for detecting unpariotic leanings in their parents, given the usual state of parent-child relations, the secret police would recieve upwards of six thousand false reports a day, and the department would collapse.3) Aesthetics. People would complain of sexism and demand a 'big sister.' As ideals of beauty changed and people decided that Big Brother's omnipresent facade was unnatractive (too fat, maybe) they would lose all respect for him.2) Corruption. The evil in this book is some sort of abstract, monolithic thing, but there are concievably real people behind it. Give a group of real people control of the hearts and minds of a country, and it won't be long before there's only one of them. He will eventually die. Chaos will follow.1) Inefficiency. \\"Johnson, the spy camera in living unit 3J07 has been offline for six weeks; I thought you were going to take a look at it.\\" \\"I ordered the parts, sir; I don't know what went wrong. It's not my fault.\\" \\"Fleming, have you recieved an order for spy camera parts?\\" \\"It's difficult to say, sir. Not my department. You'll have to talk to Roberts, and he just left on vacation.\\"If you want proof, just look at how quickly Nazism (and even Stalinism, though it was more persistent) fell apart. No pure system can survive for long."},{"Title":"1984","review":"This is the 'textbook' of today's Democratic party under the spotlight, where they declare the 'days of peace' under the previous Administration, when in fact we were involved in far more conflicts across the globe than we are today as revealed in a recent report by a University of British Columbia research group. To Democrats, lies are truth and truth are lies. Conclusion: \\"War is Peace\\".The premise that \\"Freedom is Slavery\\" is paramount in the way the Democrats portray their ideology as one that will ensure greater freedom, when in fact their self serving means to demand more and more dependency upon Government and demonizing independence is contrary to achieving the American dream. This 'entitlement' mentality underscores the results of this practice as it serves to remove incentive so we can all live in some socialist 'utopia'; an oxymoron at that. If anyone subscribes to the old adage of \\"money is power\\", then one would have to wonder if the Democrats are always finding ways to increase taxes, rules and regulations that expands the very control by government rather than people, it should become very apparent as to their 'doublespeak' rhetoric when they denounce economic growth policies such as 'tax cuts' by taking that 'money', i.e. power away from the people.\\"Ignorance is Strength\\"; is a platform of conformity which has displayed profound and destructive results from our failing educational system where students are more proficient with condom usage and having 'great self esteem' without any real defined successes, yet are deficient on the basics that lay the foundations for success in the real world, reading, writing and arithmetic.George Orwell laid out a myriad of 'totalitarian' truths that have been played out in parts in the history of Communist and in a lesser part Socialist led nations to the enslavement of it's citizens. These actions are continually expanded by today's Democrats when they use their ever divisive nature to separate out 'new' groups to exploit and demand special rights or status thus fulfilling their 'divide and conquer' goals. For what benefit does it serve to a nation when a group sets out to 'hyphenate' Americans by ethnicity, class or even gender and to a greater extent a 'melting pot' nation speaking one language, english, but rather an ever increasing unintelligible nation with the expansion of 'multi' language groups within that one nation other than to divide in the end?This should be required reading along with our Constitution for everyone so they can get a picture of where this nation is going if left to the Democrats insatiable desire for power 'over' the people, rather than 'to' the people.

The main character, Winston Smith, dares to defy what he is being told and tries to rebel, unfortunately he lives in a society where you cannot trust anyone and Big Brother is always watching you.This is definitely a thought provoking novel of blind faith, and the inner workings of the human psyche. What makes children turn on their own parents? What would you do if you were not even allowed to enjoy intercourse? These are just a couple of the questions that George Orwell brings to mind, I am not sure if we could ever truly know the answers to some of the questions that are posed in this novel and I hope we would never have to find out. It was an interesting book and I am glad I read it. George Orwell was able to capture such a frightening future so realistically some people have begun to believe this story may be prophetic, I myself see it as purely science fiction.

A friend suggested that this was based on \\"1984\\" and that I should read that again, so after 45 years I went back and discovered \\"the more things change, the more they remain the same\\".I would not go as far as to say that The Son is too reliant on the work of Orwell, rather to me, it showed a view of what could happen when freedom of thought is held in the hands of a few.Both great books well worth the read and the re-read. Having them now as ebooks also allows a rapid comparison which was very useful. Fortunately, to me, the writing styles were very different and thus both held my attention to the end.The characters in 1984 showed less depth and detail, rather the book focused on the fractured society in which it was set.

But I will explain my three star review instead of 5 star later in the review. The book has excellent characterization and theme. The main character Winston is fighting big brother ie; big government. This is a nameless, faceless power structure who controls things through double think; holding two contradictory premises as being true and newspeak and other illogical and insane techniques. When I read the book through, it seemed to describe some of the methods currently being used in the real world. In the introduction, the editor claimed that the book is about power politics. This book though should not have been published. There are people now who use the techniques in this book, whether they admit it or not. For instance, before this book was published, you could start at the bottom of the ladder in a job, work hard and go to the top of the corporate ladder. Now, you have the use of double think in job situations. They tell you that to get a job you have to have prior experience. But how do you get that, if no one hires you? So it goes. The entertainment business is a prime example of double think. To get anywhere you need an agent, but an agent will tell you to get experience. Ayn Rand would have had a field day with Orwells book. The fact is truth is eternal, and the war against it as in Orwells book is bound to fail."},{"Title":"1984","review":"George Orewll's 1984 is truly captivating however extremely disturbing. It's a story about a cold heartless society and the eradication of, by our standards, the normal human.With it's first copyright in 1949 it's written as an extremely pessimistic view of the future. The novel examines a socialist empire and the way they can control mankind, the future, and the past.The book revolves around a middle aged, middle class, although extremely intelligent man. Winston Smith works as part of the government changing the past. He is constantly watched and allowed no emotions other than hate and fear. The party controls every aspect of life.Winston can vaguely remember his childhood before Big Brother and the Party began controlling everything. He still maintains early 20th century morals and ideals of what life should be about. The book covers his rebellion against the party.1984 is well written for the most part, however there are some parts that you have to fight to get through. For example at one point Winston obtains an anti party book, Orwell then goes into long chapters that are excerpts from this \\"book.\\" These are long dry passages, that contain information that has already been reveled to the reader through indirect methods.Overall I think that this book is a good book to read.

What makes this dystopia stand out is the importance it puts on language & how those who want to manipulate a cultural mangle their language against them.Ungood : Keep in mind I mostly enjoyed the book & think there is a lot of food for thought contained in it. The aspect that disagreed with the most was the relationship between Winston & Julia not at first & not in the end but in the middle.Spoiler Alert : Up till Winston & Julia sneak away into the woods I loved the book. After their conversation in the woods I almost put the book down because of how much it alienated me & I lost interest in the characters & author. Based on the conversation in the woods, I felt if this was their perspective about love then I felt there was nothing for me to learn or enjoy by sticking around. Luckily I hung around because of how much I enjoyed the book up to that point & was willing to give the story another chance.Here's the issue. Julia first contacts Winston by writing to him that she loves him, indicating that she had special feelings towards him. In the woods Winston wants Julia to admit that she just likes having sex for the sake of having sex & the more people she's done it with the better. Winston didn't want Julia to just want to want him, but to want men in general. Winston's speech may have been intended to get people to shake their heads in agreement but instead it made me dislike him for the first & only time in the book. It doesn't even make sense in the context of the story why would Julia tell Winston I love you & have since I first saw your face if she really is just wanting anything & anyone to have sex with. The motivation isn't there. If all she wanted was, sex why not just go with the willing upper party members she mentioned she knew would comply. I say that, in rebuttal to people who may argue she picked Winston because she may have guessed he'd up for it unlike people who were less likely to break the rules. Aside from it not making sense in the story I also had a difficult time relating to that sensibility or lack-there of. In the story's defense, it does seem like Winston grows found of Julia in particular & that he acknowledges they have a special relationship, & may have seen his comments in the woods as shallow or nave. Perhaps the story could have been improved if Winston later on reflected back to that conversation; whether or not he still agreed with his declarations, the more he get know Julia. Who knows, maybe I'm the only one who was so bothered by it. There is saying if you tried to love one woman solely, you've loved them all, & if you have tried to love all women collectively, you have loved none.Here's the issue.

His fantastic view on the year 1984 from his socialist based political opinion in 1949 is one of the most creative stories ever told. 1984 tells of the \\"utopian\\" society Oceana (present day England and the Americas), in which productivity is forbidden and intelligent thinking is dangerous. In this super-power dominated by the Party and held back from progression by continuous war, Oceana's leader Big Brother is always watching every move you make. The story follows the journey of Winston, a Party member that begins to have his own negative opinion on Ingsoc, or English socialism. The reader is absorbed in Winston's life of dangerous individual thought, his forbidden affair, and his ever-evolving view on the oppressions of Big Brother.

That is to say a society ruled by the few for the benefit of only themselves. The overwhelming majority of people in Orwell's Oceania work for the ruling caste in every sense. The masses of the citizens in this dystopia also live their lives under the control of the rulers. Even the reproduction of human beings is done in a controlled environment in a scientific manner.Orwell's Oceania is made up of the inner party (rulers), outer party (workers), and the Prols (isolated poor). Winston, the main character, is a member of the outer party in Orwell's dystopia. He works to maintain the society in which he lives while he despises it. Winston secretly wages a revolution in his mind until it can no longer be contained there. The problem is that in Oceania there is no place to rebel from or rebel to. Winston ends up falling into the hands of the state which attempts to fix him or cure him. Orwell leaves it up to the reader to decide whether the officials of Oceania have won and Winston has changed. -"},{"Title":"1984","review":"I read this book back in high school, thinking \\"Well, it's a classic.

Not sure what exactly the government would fall under; not a big government/history buff.This is one of those books I am truly happy to have read.

This is not a work of pure art or beauty, but it is a masterpiece of ideas and imagination. It is deliberate and powerful and still totally relevant. In a way it's a political treatise disguised as a novel, and it will have you nodding your head as you consider the state of the world today - perpetual war, sophisticated systems of propaganda, distorted news, doublespeak, the surveillance state... the list of parallels goes on and on.It is also a masterful novel, aside from the brilliance of Orwell's ideas. When the telescreen \\"surprised\\" Winston and Julia, I almost fell out of my chair.Certainly not a fun read, it is grim and bleak and wretched.

It illustrates a world in which people are merely shells of themselves and only live to please their government in it's hunger for power. The protagonist, Wilson, refuses to settle for that existence. He analyzes his surroundings and hates the all knowing, totalitarian government.Wilson struggles to live such a life. He must hide his thoughts and feelings from the Thought Police. As a reader you can sympathize with Wilson and his struggle. It is quite difficult to imagine living in such a controlled state where one ceases to be human to become another senseless drone. He is not allowed to show emotion. He is not allowed to love in this empire that runs on hate. To love is a crime in Oceana. On the other hand, members of the Party are forced to attend the daily Two Minutes hate that forces extreme nationalism into people's thoughts and corrupts them to hate an invisible enemy.These practices that Wilson is subject to make the reader thankful for our world and hopeful that such an existence will not be the future of the human race. The novel exaggerates human behavior in a way that almost makes it seem as though this could be possible. George Orwell tries to convey a message of peace and togetherness through this harsh example of what may come to be. He urges the reader to prevent our world from being ruled by hateful warmongers. The moral of the story is to be aware of yourself and hold on to your humanity. Being your own person and showing compassion for your fellow man are the most important things you can do. Wilson is a great protagonist in that he desparately tries to maintain his humanity even in the face of extreme oppression and opposition."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Read this book 40 years ago and find it very interesting in light of the events of today.

This book that shows the meaning of state is father and social services are mother."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Orwell is one of the few writers who can effectively describe a future like the one in 1984 and still maintain a sense of reality while doing so. This is one of those books that everyone should read just for the sheer fact that it has so much depth and a huge base of messages to pull from that it can leave a reader thinking to himself for days about the meaning of symbols or plot points. As far as symbolism is concerned this book has some of the greatest! The depth and dimension that Orwell is able to add using objects like a paperweight or even Wilson's ulcers is remarkable. Mastery of the art of writing is reflected in author's ability to turn the mundane into powerful tools which sub-textually say more about the story than perhaps whole chapters could.The plot of the story, in my opinion, moves pretty quickly. This can sometimes be a bad thing, but considering the length of the book and the way that Orwell handles it 1984's plot is engaging and entertaining. The one complaint I have is the suddenness of a love plot that develops. It has always seemed to jump out of nowhere, although I know that it would be hard to develop it more fully and still keep the main story moving. The description of the setting is phenomenal throughout the book. It is very easy for the reader to picture the place that Orwell is trying to take you. The images of Big Brother, the monitors, and even the government buildings all help to drive in the point of the book, an action which is mirrored in the repetition of these objects in the book.The most blatant allusion that Orwell makes is to communism. Describing the working class as Proles brings to mind the Proletariat hero of Marx and Engels' Communist Manifesto. In the Manifesto, the proletariat rises up out of frustration over broken promises and minimal compensation for their exploitation. The rebellion results in the capitalist system being over thrown by a united people and then establishing a society were all needs are met and where everyone is equal. This type of utopia seems like a logical desire from a working class that has been exploited and subjugated; however, Orwell very delicately handles the situation of the Proles and leaves the reader free to interpret what may happen. All that we really get is that the Proles have been relocated to a specific area and kept there pretty exclusively. This means that the more educated live away from the uneducated, drunk, slum-living working class of 1984. On a note of optimism Wilson notes that only the Proles, who are the majority of the population and ought to be the primary benefactors of \\"the Party\\" (which they clearly are not), are capable of rebellion. By sheer force and numbers it is only in the Prole populace that a successful rebellion could ever really take place to over through Big Brother, however, without well educated people among this group of people could the rebellion ever come up or reach the broader whole of the populace? It is those segments of a story that allow the reader to develop their own opinion that make a good story a great one. 1984 is a brilliant book not only because of its subject matter, symbolism, or depth but also because it is though provoking. The reading doesn't end when you finish the book and that is the hallmark of a great piece of literature."},{"Title":"1984","review":"I have heard the book 1984 mentioned many times in my life, and I finally decided to sit down and read what all the commotion was about. I must say that it certainly lives up to the widespread expectations. The author's writing style, his talent in story-telling, the complexity of the characters, and the plot itself are remarkable. As you read the book, it gives you the feeling of seeing the scenes with your own eyes. The author describes each detail with such emotion, that you can't help but think you are watching a movie, rather than simply reading words on a page.The main character is Winston Smith and he represents the modern day, average man (even though it was written more than 50 years ago). He presents questions and doubts that any one of us would have. As he goes through the journey of the book, things become confusing for him, and at points you are left confused as well. The author does such a great job at embodying the reader with Winston, that you try searching for the truth, just as Winston is. I found myself going back through the text, and searching for an answer that it is virtually impossible to find.The book leaves you with many questions, but you must understand that was the point of the author. You are Winston, and just as Winston is complicated, so are we. I must warn you that it is a disheartening tale, however it will definitely satisfy your thirst for a good read."},{"Title":"1984","review":"It's 1984! But not the 1984 you'd expect. There are no headbands, hair bands, sex, drugs, rock and roll, or Regan. Instead there is Oceana, East-Asia, and Eurasia, and the only thing you have to yourself are your thoughts.1984 takes place in the post nuclear war society of Oceana. Where people are constantly under watch by the government.1984 is about one man's struggle to thrive, in Oceana. His struggle against the government by joining a forbidden society and participating in a forbidden love affair. All in all 1984 is a philosophical revelation told in the form of a modern thriller. It is exciting yet still provokes philosophical thought. However sometimes the constant rants are not only superfluous but can appear unscientific. But all in all, 1984 by George Orwell is a well rounded novel.One interesting and rather exciting aspect the novel explores is the creation of new words in Gilead and destruction of obsolete words. Words like thoughtcrime and doublethink are created. These words are created for the government as a means to control the people. This thought provoking concept is one most people never examine.Even though the chapters are philosophical, some are hardly scientific. There are 10 pages in the middle of the novel dedicated to a giant rant, rather than any substantiated claims. The novel has several of these rants, and quite frankly, I get tired of them.But all in all, I would recommend this novel to everyone and in particular high school students. I like the fact that it is not only a thriller, but a novel that critiques the governments and societies that govern us.What I don't like about it is the fact that sometimes it appears to be ranting without evidence.But all in all, I recommend everyone read 1984."},{"Title":"1984","review":"I had heard many great things about the works of George Orwell, particularly with regards to 1984. As the brief description adequately puts it, this masterpiece is filled with almost &#34;dangerous&#34; ideologies, which are cleverly portrayed and frighteningly prophetic. I highly recommend this book to any person who has questioned authority."},{"Title":"1984","review":"1984: Been there, done that; Orwell has not. I have always attempted novels that do not seem to be the most appealing, however, George Orwell's classic, was in short a disappointment. The book was repetitive, slow moving, and did not hold my interest at all. After finishing it, I was left with a feeling as though I had been ripped off. The general plot was clever, but the lack of interesting characters and events left the novel fruitless and boring. I tried to read the book as though it really was a prediction of the future, however, it was hard for me to understand how anyone could ever think the future would possibly be in such disarray. 1984 has the lay out of other Science Fiction novels including conformity, a heretic, and finally the heretic coming to terms with the conformity, but throughout the story, everything appeared fantastical and this made it hard to relate to. In addiction, the contradictions throughout the novel were frustrating. After the first three chapters I could only hope that Winston would be vaporized as soon as possible, rather I would have hoped to be vaporized as soon as possible. However, Orwell manages to hold out two hundred and forty-five pages before allowing Winston to make any sense of his pointless existence. The novel, in my opinion is a waste of energy, paper and ink. I cannot honestly give this book any merit. I would definitely NOT recommend it to any person with a sane mind."},{"Title":"1984","review":"1984 is a very creative and well written book, Winston Smith the main character who is an insignifacant member or the ruling party in London in the nation of Oceania.

I enjoyed reading this book, it was very creative and well written. It makes me appreciate what I have in life. I also woundn't like the situation that Wiston is put by being watch all the time. I reccommend this book to people who are willing to sit threw some boring parts and who love science fiction. Overall it was a good book, but I don't think Iam ever going to want to read this book again."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Attempting to read this book is worse than watching the grass grow. At least the grass will become something you enjoy. The title and plotline of the story intrigued me to read it. Don't get me wrong, if well-written, this storyline could be very interesting. But even after just ten pages, the only thought going through my mind was &quot;When will this guy shut up and tell the story???&quot; The plot comes in a distant second to the narrator's monotone, seemingly unending monologue. If I could withstand this, I believe I would have enjoyed it.

On the surface it seems to be an interesting glance at the \\"future\\" that our grandparents envisioned. This however could not be farther from the truth. 1984 is in fact a lame, boring, and novel that attempts to be philosophical. I say \\"attempts\\" because any useful words of philosophy are lost or choked by the presence of Winston, the lame, spine-less main character who seems intent on boring the reader to death. Orwell attempts to make Winston likable but his acts of stupidity (i.e. trusting in a world where trust really should be earned) and lack or actions, other than sexual, make the reader hate him.However, even in the face of utter boredom and disgust, there are a few good things about this book. Number one would have to be the setting. The book is set in a \\"future\\" London. It is filled with small, aging apartments where Party members live, dark slums and alleyways for nonparty members, and large, imposing government buildings. You can almost visualize this London and replace it with the London of today. Number two would have to be that this book allows Westerners to get a feel for life under a dictatorship, such as life in Russia under Stalin and Germany under Hitler. This makes it a great book to read to understand such a life and appreciate the freedoms of democracy.In short, 1984 is nothing more than a second rate book attempting to develop profound, intelligent themes. However, these themes are lost in the monotony of the book and the reader gains only a better understanding for life under a dictatorship and appreciation for the freedoms of democracy. On a scale of 5 stars, I give this book 1 star for its attempts at philosophical content and its insights into dictatorships. It also makes a great substitute for a sleeping pill because it'll put you out like a light and is not habit forming."},{"Title":"1984","review":"George had a good idea, I'll give him that, otherwise the book fell short. Very short. For me the book took a downword turn during the time where Winston started having a love affair with some girl. This girl latter became a thought police inforcer, which surprised me none. I found the book to be a bore of a read and very predictable. My advise to all of you fair readers is to steer clear of this vile book. You will live longer because of it."},{"Title":"1984","review":"I have never read a bigger piece of garbage in my entire life.

The main character in the book, Winston, is an ordinary worker at a regular office in England. The catch is he can remember the past some what. In England's future it is ruled by an all knowing man named Big Brother of BB in new speak (the language of oceania earlier called England).Once Winston realizes this chick named Julia likes him he and she start secretively dating which is against the rules of the party. Winston finally realizes what is going on with society and BB. Winston and his girlfriend finally get the nerve and take a chance and join the resistance against the party.

Oh, sure, it is well written, but people make it into so much more than it really is. It is dark, depressing, and I finished reading it feeling like less of a human than when I started. Why is it that a work of literature that is so empty and void of any meaning is considered to be one of the best? I dont understand.1984 is one of the biggest cult classic ever. The only difference is that some people say &quot;The Rocky Horror Picture Show&quot; is very good, and some say it is very bad. I have only heard revered praise for &quot;1984&quot;.It is innacurate, too. In &quot;1984&quot; the government influenced people's minds, taking away their free will. In reality, that is not possible. When the Soviet Union collapsed, even those born into communism helped construct a democracy. Also, in &quot;1984&quot; the party is completely invinsible. It will remain in power forever. History tells otherwise. ALL empires fall. Humanity has been war-torn since it's beginning, and after 5000 years, the world has managed to not be controlled by &quot;Big Brother&quot;.Quote from &quot;1984&quot;: &quot;Humanity is nothing more than one man shoving another man's face in the mud&quot;So, &quot;1984&quot; tells us that humans are completely useless and we have no reason to exist.Let's take a look at Orwell. When he was not homeless, he lived in poverty. None of his books sold until after he died, and &quot;1984&quot; was one of his later books. Didn't he have plenty to be hateful about?The best books make you want to be a better person. &quot;1984&quot; does nothing but make you want to stop caring about everything.&quot;1984&quot; is purely a work of fiction, but even though it is grossly unrealistic, it is treated like it was written by God.There are so many better books out there, please don't waste your time on such an unfufilling and stupid book as &quot;1984&quot;"},{"Title":"1984","review":"In the past I've been reluctant to read 1984 because I thought it was \\"good for me,\\" like medicine. And the novel seems to have become very dear to one side of the political spectrum lately, the left, which enhanced my suspicion that 1984 was going to be a dreary exposition of an oppressed society not worth living in. I'd also seen the British movie released in the year 1984, which was good, but dreary, as I remembered it. But I sensed that there was something wrong with Michael Moore's quote of Orwell in Fahrenheit 911, which might mean that there was something wrong with our current embrace of Orwell, and that gave me the final push to read the book. To my everlasting gratitude, I found that 1984 is one of the most human novels I have ever read. It has a moving love story (which I had not remembered at all from the movie), and it has more than enough challenges to all forms of politics, left and right. The book is especially challenging if you do not read it merely as a political commentary but also as an examination of the human soul, particularly your own. It is the kind of book that delves so unflinchingly with cruelty and evil that it's hard to put down but also difficult to endure. It will leave you shattered; a truly great work.The context of the novel was helpful to me when I did examine its politics. I won't give away the plot, but I will talk about the society Orwell lays out in the beginning of the book.Orwell wrote at a time when it seemed that communism was on the march everywhere. Eastern Europe, North Korea and China, the world's most populous nation, had all recently fallen. The year after the publication of 1984, communist nations invaded both Tibet and South Korea, though the latter was not conquered; communism would not spread by full-scale invasion again until South Vietnam fell in 1975, but in the meantime, socialist and Marxist revolution would continue to threaten everywhere. Orwell saw the incipient Cold War of his time, with good reason, as the kind of perpetual warfare that is described in 1984. He felt that the democracies of the recently finished World War had not left behind their wartime command economies, and this was true in many ways; he probably believed that they would remain that way if they seriously meant to embark on an arms race or war with the communist world. The U.S. had moved toward socialism with the New Deal, and after the war with Hitler it had become a kind of New Deal big brother to a ravaged world; and Orwell wrote 1984 while living under a Labour government; so if we try to judge his thoughts from his novel, he probably felt that an ongoing state of war would lead the countries of the West into the kind of dictatorship seen in Russia, one that was socialist in name, but that really betrayed the ideals of socialism. (Orwell considered himself a socialist but was critical of communism). In that way, he saw England, the U.S. and Australia forming a society, Oceania, little different from Russia's or China's. The novel reports that atomic warfare occurred in the 1950s, and such a thing in real life might very well have produced suffering, privation, revolution and dictatorship throughout the world.So when the novel opens in the year 1984, the West has essentially gone down the road of warfare, which has destroyed all the free elements of its societies, such as private life and free markets. Orwell was essentially criticizing the left for going down the road of communism and not genuine socialism, as he saw it.Yet it's easy to find places where the novel challenges the right of today. For instance, Orwell's description of doublethink seems to explain how Saddam Hussein's government, openly built upon Stalin's model, knew that the American army was approaching Baghdad in March 2003, while describing the situation, in press conferences, as the exact opposite; yet George Bush has had a similar tendency to speak about the situation in Iraq as if things are going just fine, when clearly they are not.Orwell says that in the world of tomorrow, the war is meant to be perpetual, and this does seem to indict both the Cold War and the war on terror. Michael Moore quotes 1984 on the concept of perpetual war, but the quote comes from the movie of 1984, not the novel. The novel itself says that \\"the object of the [perpetual] war is not to make or prevent conquests of territory.\\" Fahrenheit 911, and the movie of 1984, both avoid this phrase, since American interventions in Korea, Vietnam, Afghanistan and Iraq do look like conquests of territory.Orwell writes in 1984 that the societies of the future do not ever try to conquer distant lands, and restrict themselves to lands on their borders, because contact with the enemy by millions of their own soldiers would run the risk of genuine, human contact with people described in wartime propaganda as brutes and animals -- and all this would reveal the lies of the Party. Orwell was right about totalitarian societies; all have invaded nations on their own borders. They have killed tens of millions at home or close to home. The U.S. and Britain, by contrast, have exported both armies and peaceful civilians, and their press, to far-flung societies, often literally on the other side of the world.There is much here that the left could embrace, but much that challenges the left as well. 1984 does not seem either to challenge or support the right of today in the same degree; it seems to me largely a book about the left, by a man of the left.As a critique of Western democracies, 1984 is very powerful, but I have read that Aldous Huxley's Brave New World is even better."},{"Title":"1984","review":"In my World Literature class in high school, I chose to read the book 1984 as my lit. circle book. I didn't like this book very much. It was hard for me to understand, but I got through it. I also didn't like this book because it scared me a little about what the government can do right now.

Mind you I find the romance in this story to be good so rate it 3 stars. Did this book introduce me to torture? I think it might have."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Upon reading 1984 I found myself questioning many things about different economic and social societies. When George Orwell wrote this, ideas of Communism were just beginning to become known and many people questioned Capitalism. This is greatly reflected in the book. However, the so-called hero of the book, Winston, wasnt really a hero at all. In the end, he was brainwashed and lost his sense of individual thought. This was to prove to &quot;evils&quot; of not having Capitalism- The biggest problem with the book was that I feel it is outdated in that it does not have as great of an impact in our society today due to the increasing rise of Capitalism and the fall of several Communist countries. It presents a very extreme idea, but not a very likely one."},{"Title":"1984","review":"This book hauntingly describes the danger of the totalitarianism. It's sad that so many people nowadays try to change this nation into communist or socialism ( same role, just different name) not really knowing the truth, just based on some political ideology that human history had repeatedly proved to be failed. In fact communism is the worst political system that ever presented on earth. Because of its brutality, I escaped from that regime. And I am happy to be in this country where human freedom is mostly respected, and protected. Communist lies saying every one shares equally: In fact only, those few comrades who caused the shift of power enjoy the wealth and power, but the rest of the general citizens have no equality nor basic human right. Any one speak against government---disappear next day to \\"concentration camp\\" w/o fair trials nor justice. Communist shut down all religious freedom, or freedom of speech ( all medias are government controlled) Communists deny any form of gods but instead, they set the status of Stalin or Ma chiding, or Kimjung ill, and have to sing songs and salute for them, worship them. From elementary children to elders... Anyone dares to go against the government, ---labor camp! Several millions who stand for their freedom were killed brutally in early 20th century, during the communism overturn. Stalin communist government killed 90 millions including the vicinity nations that were turn into communism, Macho-tong communist killed 100 millions, 2 millions by North Korea, by Cambodia each, 2 millions in Africa, 200,000 latin America..so on . But most of all they all became terribly poor after communist regime,oppressing the free capitalism, except China, because they started to adapt the partial capitalism from 10 years ago after they realized the harsh economic state. Now history tells also other evil regime; Hitler killed 6 million jew with other 4 million of Europeans; Japan' imperialism killed 20 million Asians during WWII, ..so on.When communism and socialism oppress people's creative and force them to work for \\"common Good\\", the productivity drops automatically. Why? men were not made to work for Common good. Maybe some aliens from different planet or maybe Jesus will do for common good. But not men's nature. That's why communism make every one poorer and poorer. When men get prosperous by working hard, with their creativity, they help others if they are normal. because normal people appreciate God's wisdom of love and peace.But if the much power goes to God-haters, but seeking totalitarianistic government, you will see the corruption everywhere. Because they basically don't know, or appreciate God's wisdom of love and peace for all, they will fully manifest their selfishness and brutality. If USA turned into communism, the power will shift to only those who hate the existing American system. They secretly controlling medias ( I already see it happened ) and brainwashing the youth with distorted facts in textbooks last 20 years. They keep change their names, their activity, and theory. Why? if they openly speak up, they know they will fail because any normal mind people will see the deception and its perversion. Look at these behind scenes of the head members. They are not normal mind, full of hatred, and causing always divisions, manipulations Men can't govern themselves.They are very selfish, greedy and evil by nature. If any political party, government have too much power, they will certainly hurt others unless they truly know jesus who always teach love and peace. That's why our America's constitution is truly great, because it was written by the God's fairness and wisdom protecting basic human rights that is originally from God . I realized only those who hate God fall into \\"deny the constitution, or change it because it's old ideas\\". Too old constitution? Then why the whole world always look upon America when it comes, most well practiced freedom and human right? Please have reasons.Collect the real historic facts, separate from the author's propaganda. Lineup the real facts, then you will see the history more accurately. Always develop the \\"reasoning power\\" of your own this way, not swayed by many false propagandas in most books out there. If you don't have your own reasoning power, you will be always vulnerable and get deceived.Interestingly always angry, poor people become the front line deceived victims of these evil ideology. So instead, ask God to enlighten your heart to live with love and peace with others and ask your personal blessing instead of trying to destroy others who seems have.If you believe somebody or some classes hurt your people, look at this. Bible says: forgive your enemy, don't live with your past: Don't covet your neighbors: work diligently on your own hands so you don't steal, become a burden to others. And lastly, love your neighbors as yourself. Then you will live in the true blessing of God, the creator. Those citizens of chines and all the other communist countries, including north korean, who are brutally oppressed in the middle Eastern Islam tyrannies still wants their human freedom with the destruction of the oppressing totalitarianistic regime still today. So why move to backward of mistakes people?"},{"Title":"1984","review":"Read NO PLACE TO HIDE by Robert O'HarrowCheck it out on www.muckraker.orgHey, folks, Big Brother has arrived Big Time!"},{"Title":"1984","review":"I read this book for the first time after noting all the comparisons various friends and journalists have made between the system of government in the book and the system into which American government is evolving.But the book lacks subtlety and hits readers over the head with the details of tyranny. No doubt, Orwell writes this way to underscore the dangers of complete trust in government, but I find the plot to be so far fetched as to be unbelievable. NO form of government could ever gather the resources or achieve the efficiency needed to monitor each individual in the way the Party does. Wouldn't a more realistic cautionary tale be more effective and entertaining?"},{"Title":"1984","review":"1984 is extremely influential on the way we as a society label each other and our government with names such as \\"Big Brother\\" Orwellian and such. These names like calling someone a Nazi allow us to appear to argue but actually allow us to dodge the real issues. This is fairly ironic considering the origin of such terms. Basically 1984 is set in London in the distopian future. Orwell wrote it in response to Stalin's corrupting the ideals of Socialism. He was a socialist and so was really bothered by that failure.The plot to 1984 isn't so important as the setting. Basically the story follows Winston Smith. Smith harbors less than perfect views of his environment, for which he will one day be arrested regardless of his actions. Not loving the government (thought crime) is the only crime that is recognized. Hidden cameras and microphones are omnipresent in the city, included mandatory TVs which can't be turned off, only show a single government station and contain hidden cameras through which \\"thought police\\" may monitor what is in front of the TV at any time. Social interaction doesn't exist, since that would be considered weird and therefore criminal.There are three classes of people in London: Inner Party members, Party members like Winston and the proletariate, who aren't watched so closely because they aren't considered human. In this world Winston goes from merely not liking the government to engaging in unusual behavior. He starts by buying decorative antiques at a proletariate shop and progresses to having a girl friend, who he can only meet with in remote country side settings on account of social interaction is not allowed by the government. It is obvious to him that he will one day be taken to the Ministry of Love, a windowless building which handles law enforcement, and never fails at getting thought criminals to love the government.The novel is always dark. No happy beginning, no happy middle and no happy ending. Still it is important to read it before throwing around terms like \\"Orwellian\\" It has been so influential on society that it is required reading - if you want to pass your tenth grade English. Failing to read is a sign of insurgence against the government."},{"Title":"1984","review":"The name of the book that I am reviewing is 1984 by George Orwell. I choose to give this book four stars.The reason that I give this book four stars is because it is an excellent written book that gives a scary future of what the people in the 1950's thought the world was coming to. It follows the main character Winston Smith who is a member of the party of Oceania in a oligarchial world of three superpowers: Oceania, Eastasia and Eurasia. Winston feels as if he is different because he doesn't believe that they are getting the best that they could be getting. He decides to join a secret organization that goes against the government. He learns in a book that is given to him how the government works and why makes the certain choices that it does. The book shows that in the future war will just be used as a way for a power to get rid of surplus goods. The book also states how the government works with the ministries of peace, love, plenty and truth.It also seemed very cool to me some of the ways the government would manipulate the people just so they could maintain control. In the book Winston begins an affair with another party member named Julia and they together plan against their oligarchial society. They rebel at the fact that the government changes history so that it may be able to control there country with ease. With nothing for them to judge there life against they are forced to go by what the government tells them and they each have. They are captured at there secret hideout by the thought police(a group of individuals that monitor for traces of thoughtcrime punishable by death). They are thrown into a jail cell to rot untill they are forced to confess for what they have done. The only reason that I would not give this book five stars is because most of the concepts in the book were very hard to follow.Other books that I would recommend would be Shogun by James Clavell, the Cherub series by Robert Muchamore or Animal Farm by George Orwell. I am a student at HRMS and am in seventh grade."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Orwell's classic dystopian novel is an excellent read. I was forced to watch the movie as a sophomore in high school and wasn't interested in it, nor was I old enough to really grasp the concepts. That has changed however. This book is enthralling to the point that it is hard to put down. Following Winston Smith in his life under the totalitarian regime of Oceania, 1984 weaves a scary and alarming story of what happens when government gets out of control. In today's political environment, it is a shining example of what we, as citizens, need to be on the lookout for in the name of \\"national security\\". The political propaganda used by Big Brother is quite relevant to that which our own political parties push on us during elections (obviously to a lesser degree)."},{"Title":"1984","review":"1984 is a book that can be talked about for hours and hours.

Orwell projects a totalitary and brutal world. The world has become a totalitary nightmare. The government and its leader Big Brother control their citizens with an iron fist and a heart of steel. Everybody is being watched every second of the day were ever they might be.The main character of the book, Winston Smith, has felt a feeling in the back of his mind his whole life. He has always felt that something is wrong, there is something in his society is not the way Big Brother claims.On a deeper level 1984 is not about a single person, it's about a society, a dictatorship more totalitarian then anyone might have imagined. 1984 is one of our times most discussed and quoted books. How come? First of all it's a brilliant descriptions of the hitting similarities between fascism and communism even thought the ideas are different the product those ideologies being with them are always dictatorship and oppression.Up until 1984 there was a saying all over the world. When a state or government did something to control or supervise citizens people said \\"This is like 1984\\", it became a expression.In my opinion 1984 is one of the best books ever, mostly for its extremely hitting critic towards society. Certainly the book is written in a past time, but still it tells us something about today society. George ORwells nightmare during the forties is alarmingly much like the world today.Even if you look past the society critic, 1984 is still a very good book. Orwell is in my opinion a master when it comes to describing environments and persons. The half sci-fi environment feels as realistic as anything I have ever read.At last, some words of wisdom. George Orwell have been quoted many times, this is one of his more famous quotes from 1984, think about it fore a moment.\\" - Political language - and with variations this is true of all political parties, from Conservatives to Anarchists - is designed to make lies sound truthful and murder respectable, and to give an appearance of solidity to pure wind.\\"./ Jakobs Erik DanielssonGagnef,Sweden"},{"Title":"1984","review":"Orwell's tale of a society where not only behaviour, but also thought is controlled, seems to grow ever more relevant as the years pass and new technologies of surveillance emerge. 1984's concept of \`Big Brother' has passed into everyday use, and the \`telescreens' used not just to broadcast, but to watch people, increasingly appear throughout the real-world society in the form of surveillance cameras. Whilst the totalitarian governments of \`Oceania, Eastasia and Eurasia' depicted by Orwell may seem to have passed (in the majority), his general sense of helplessness, as expressed through both the protagonist Winston, and the oppressive atmosphere, is as relevant today as during the years of the Cold War.

Orwell switched 1948 to 1984, but his future society is an eerily accurate portrayal of the future that is more 2006 than he could ever really have feared.In 1984, there was a lackluster film of the same name that tried to capture the paranoia and the futuristic evil society. The film failed, but Monty Python alum Terry Gilliam fortunately brought us his brilliant version in his 1985 film \\"Brazil\\", which was originally titled \\"1984 and 1/2\\". The story is the same premise as Orwell's 1984, and is a must see for those who enjoy the book.I also recommend the equally inspired book/film combinations of Kurt Vonnegut's \\"Slaughterhouse Five\\" and \\"A Clockwork Orange\\" by Anthony Burgess. These movies are just as powerful as the books. But by no mean should you miss out on reading the books in favour of the films!"},{"Title":"1984","review":"Many readers will love the way that Orwell is able to paint a vivid if bleak picture of the futre of London. In this masterpiece of dystopian literature, you will find yourself questioning everything that happens in the book. From the perceived reality to the altered history, it is difficult to tell what is real and what is planned. This is also the brilliance of the book since you are able to feel as Winston does, never quite sure what the Truth is. For those that are fans of dystopian lit and even casual readers, 1984 will grip you from the beginning until the ultimate end."},{"Title":"1984","review":"There is nothing that I can add to the cacaphony of praise and reverance for this book. I won't really try, other than to say that it seems to me that the story in 1984 is so compelling and the scenary and mood are so masterfully described that I think that the reader can miss the fact that this is (a) fiction and (b) it is fiction written so well that you almost forget about the writing and enter the world itself. As a piece of creative art, this is extremely well done. I'll add a little to the chorus that 1984 describes a world (or at least a political unit) that could exist and has and does exist to some extent on Earth. It's not America - otherwise we'd be arrested for participating in this forum; but it does bear clear resemblance to the Communist regimes that arouse in Orwell's day. Of course, those regimes were too heavy to support themselves for long. Perhaps that is the 'unbelievable' part of 1984, that a totalitarian regime has the stamina and resources to so control it's subjects that even the past can be erased and every single citizen can be monitored inside and out - and individually tortured and reprogrammed as needed.I am not an Orwell student, but it seems to me that Orwell may have had a personal struggle with grasping the concepts of reality and truth. The thread that runs through 1984 is the control of the Party over history and thus over reality. We see Winston Smith broken down to believe that things he saw and knew in fact never really happened, and that, if he was told so, that 2 plus 2 equals 5. Orwell takes Smith to a nightmarish place where the only thing that you can really know for certain is the thing that is right in front of your face, and even then you may be mistaken. Caeser and Charlemagne and the lack of hot water in your shower and the misery in your mind are not really there unless the Party says so - and how can you say otherwise? I suspect that Orwell dwelt in a place a little like that. What did he struggle with? Ethics? Economics? God?Anyway, great story, beautiful descriptive fiction, and thought-provoking premises. Add to that the gifts to our cultural lexicon of \\"thoughtcrime\\" and \\"Big Brother\\" and \\"Newspeak\\" and even the title itself (a year now more than two decades in the past), and you've got yourself a classic that must be read."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Fast shiping, the item arrived as described. Different cover though, but it's alright.I have not started the book yet, but I have heard that it was a great book"},{"Title":"1984","review":"This book is a little more intense than the style of books I usually go for, but after seeing it listed on the \\"Books you must read before you die\\" and seeing so many strong reviews for it, I thought it was one I should definitely make time to read.I had to read A Brave New World in high school and even today I still thoroughly enjoy that book. To me, Nineteen Eighty Four is the next level of extreme when compared to A Brave New World, and although I really enjoyed George Orwells writing style and the overall theme of the book, I think that a lot of the intellectual political notes went over my head.To fully understand and appreciate this book you need to be able to give it 100% concentration for the whole time you are reading it, and at time I struggled with doing that as I found myself skim-reading over the extreme political jargon (i.e. when Winston was reading The Book).I did enjoy the book, and while it is one of the most thought-provoking books I have read, I wouldn't read it again, nor recommend it to someone unless they specifically enjoyed this genre of book."},{"Title":"1984","review":"I liked the idea of the book, but I hated it in the end. The hopeless feeling was important, and I think there are ideas to be learned from it, but I like a story where the human spirit triumphs. I like to read a book with heroism. This is fine for people who like bad endings, but it was not for me.There were also many elements that were not believable. Three totalitarian states would not constantly maintain equal power. A society such as Oceania would weaken and either one of the other states would gain supremacy, or another would rise up.I originally rated this book as 2 stars, but had to change it, because I can't stop thinking about it. Though I think some things could have been done differently, I have to say this book deeply affected me."},{"Title":"1984","review":"If you believe our world is going to turn out like this in the future,we're in for BIG TROUBLE ! book is excellent and shiped fast"},{"Title":"1984","review":"This is yet another book that is difficult to put down.

This is a very thought provoking novel and is beautifully written."},{"Title":"1984","review":"1984 has come and left, some may say that this book has lost its importance after the collapse of communism. I think that if we want to keep our freedom than we need to pay attention to the politicians we elect and the agencies that they are suppose to regulate. The important point about 1984 is that if you don't pay attention 1984 can always become a reality. Need to listen to some of the people running for the top spot in this country and you can see them building their own ministry of truth.R HemingwayPast Twilight"},{"Title":"1984","review":"This book had its ups and downs. But it finished strong.I was mildly interested in Orwell's dystopian society. My interest waned until Julia, Winston's love-interest, is introduced. I almost put the book down when Winston reads 'The Book'. In fact, I didn't bother speed-reading through it but literally skipped several pages. These pages pulled me out of the story but just as soon as it was over (many pages later) it jumped right back without missing a beat.I'm not often interested in long narrative. Give me the bare facts and let's get on with the story. But Orwell does such a wonderful job of scene-building that I frequently relished his descriptions of rooms, weather and personal effects. I felt the bone-chilling winter, the guilt, the longing. The suffering.But most of all, it was the ending. Like Animal Farm, I was impacted by the story long after I finished. His portrayal of the systematic breakdown of a human being, the stripping of a soul and the remolding of a mind, is chilling to the very last line.After all, 2 + 2 = 5."},{"Title":"1984","review":"I read 1984 and LOVED all of it. (except the ending was a not really what i would have liked to happen) Its a great book, definitely one that everyone should read in their lifetime. Orwell is an amazing writer. 1984 is one of my favorite books."},{"Title":"1984","review":"1984, is a book every high school student should read--it is compelling and truthful about what can happen when the government is not kept in check by its citizens. Another novel, which is newer, yet fascinating, The Gateway by Castleberry, should also be read--not just by highschool students, but by anyone who appreciates our history and wants to go back in time and visit their great-grandparents. Castleberry's, The Gateway, has received only the Highest ratings and reviews on Amazon.com for its realistic blend of physics, rural American history in the late 1800's and its extremely haunting message at the end of the book."},{"Title":"1984","review":"If you read Nineteen Eighty-Four trying to see where the author or right or wrong about the future, it will be disappointing -- as most books of this kind are. Obviously, the book was written in a whole different political context. However, if you go past all that you'll see that the book is really about the human nature -- our way of keeping all this contrary to our interests under surveillance, then control, and perhaps our tendency to eliminate them. I liked the book very much."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Winston Smith is a pitiful lead character, yet we doubtlessly empathize with him and feel his infinite despair. His destitute disenfranchisement from any semblance of normality is not only shocking and frightening, it is downright abominable. I would hate to spoil this ingenious book for anyone, so I will refrain from dissecting the ending. However, I must say that it did leave an immensely pungent taste in my mouth - as is intended.1984 is as potent as it is mesmerizing. It is infinitely unique as there is no other book quite like it, albeit Brave New World is strikingly similar. Two Minutes of Hate is classic. Who cannot appreciate the ThoughtPolice, DoubleTalk, DoubleSpeak, and the many other Orwellian words that have been firmly implanted in the English language? 1984 could very well be the most profoundly provocative work of the 20th Century. 1984 projects an appalling, yet veritable premonition in lieu of our continually decreasing civil liberties. Highly recommended by this humble reviewer. Enjoy."},{"Title":"1984","review":"The power of Orwell's writing comes from the ideas expressed therein, not from the characterization or the quality of the writing. Orwell's characters in this novel are crafted of the finest cardboard, the writing is crafted of the finest of didactic lead, but the ideas therein are important -- because they are prophetic of what 2004 could be, and what 2003 may be becoming, if the current leadership of our country has its way."},{"Title":"1984","review":"If you read one book in your life this one should be it. I read this back in the 7th grade(I am in college now) and I cannot say how much I appreciated this book. From the expansive sci-fi in it to the vocabulary words to represent the society... this is a work of art.If you haven't read this book... read it. If you have read this book, then read it again."},{"Title":"1984","review":"1984 has some of the most powerful images of totalitarian authority and lasting depictions of a world devoid of moral structure -- of any work from the 20th century. Yet, the greatest contribution of Orwell to our present day is his critique of language and it's effects via his fiction.As O'Brian says to Winston \\"You're not very good at metaphysics.\\" If you want to understand the philosophical ramifications of relativism this book is a great place to start or, if you read it in a literature class a while ago and currently have an interest in ethology, deontology, aretology, moral philosophy and ontology, a must read - again.Morality can only be viewed as a positive, yet even now our language has begun to be distorted by subjective interpretations of our words. Example: Do we have a positive moral structure or a negative moral structure? -- There is only one *moral* structure. This book lays out the frame work of a society engineered on the basis of definition control. Vocabulary is perverted to serve the machine.This is the world we can choose to create or destroy."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Walter Cronkite said that this story has ..&quot;a power that seems to grow rather than lessen with the passage of time.&quot;This story is even more relevant today than it ever was. If you want to understand today's events and where we might be going- READ THIS BOOK! Any thinking person will see the relevance, all of those less cerebral should still take the time and either read or listen to the audio verion of this story.I simply cannot emphasize enough how vital a part of your personal library this book should become."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Big Brother is watching and I don't mean the reality tv series. This book is not only an interesting read, it also holds a deeper meaning. It is a window through which the possible dangers of communism/socialism in the extreme can be viewed. A comparison can also be made to Plato's idea of a utopia.This book makes one question the validity of our own past and reality as we know it."},{"Title":"1984","review":"I will start off by saying that if you have not read George Orwell's &quot;1984,&quot; then you have missed out on one of the true masterpieces of English literature. The ideas presented here have become so essential a part of Western society that phrases such as &quot;Big Brother is watching&quot; and &quot;Orwellian doublethink&quot; have become forever incorporated into our vocabulary.&quot;1984&quot; is above all a commentary on the social and very human forces that drive authoritarianism. At every step the role of human nature, a nature which is at times so independent and yet at other times obedient, is explored in multiple facets. What motivates us as social beings? What creates the need for control? How do we, beings whose ultimate love and need is freedom, become acquiescent in authoritarian governments? Orwell answers all of these questions with amazing clarity and directness. He convinces us with his powerful vision of the &quot;future&quot; that human fragility and human strength are two sides of the same coin. Without one the other cannot exist.The issues raised in &quot;1984&quot; are extremely valid today. In the terrible aftermath of September 11th, Americans, as lovers and upholders of liberty, have been eager to protect these most valued keepsakes. Yet this protection comes at the expense of freedom, the ultimate goal, with greater government surveillance and control over the lives of innocents. Thus we face the classic dilemma of &quot;1984,&quot; as puzzling a problem today as it was then. All we can hope is that as individuals we do not face the same fate as the protagonist, whom we last see proclaiming his love for Big Brother."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Wow is the first phrase that came to my mind after finishing this book. It is one of the best I have ever read and certainly my favorite read over the last year. I am sure everyone knows the plot by now so I will not rehash. But I knew the general plot beforehand i.e. \\"Big Brother\\" and the thought police, and I was STILL overwhelmed by 1984. Orwell's writing makes you keep coming back for more, always eager to find out how the current situation will turn out, and what will happen next. Besides the sketch of a tyrannical government using mass propaganda to literally brainwash its citizens, Orwell also shows how powerless the ordinary citizen becomes, how much trouble must be gone through to engage in illegal conduct, and how brutal the aftermath of getting caught is. And the love story, which I expected to be the weakest part of the book, is actually fascinating and heartbreaking. A Must-Read if there ever was one!"},{"Title":"1984","review":"No matter what happens in the world this book continues to provide us with warnings. With the coming of Homeland Security we should be ever watchful that the small liberties we enjoy aren't taken away. Orwell writes of a world in which the masses have been deemed weak and harmless, while the intellegent have been brainwashed and those that aren't are vaporized.With the government asking our country's truckers, toll booth collectors, garbagemen, etc, to bascially spy on the population and report any out of the ordinary occurrences this book once again proves how on the money Orwell was."},{"Title":"1984","review":"&quot;Freedom is the freedom to say that two plus two make four.&quot;In the world depicted in this powerful novel, the use of logic is prohibited. Citizens are required to follow the Party's ideas, believe the Party's lies, hate the Party's enemies, rejoice at the Party's victories. If the Party contradicts itself (which is common), the members are forbidden to ask questions, but to follow blindly, as sheep led to slaughter. Big Brother perfected what the Communists only dreamed of -- absolute obedience, total loyalty to a cruel master. Even simple human emotions are discouraged.What a perfect setting for a love story! Of course, there is romance entwined into the precise fibers of 1984, but the novel is not a love story. It's a society story, a political story. A story of human existence, if you will. This is a story about an eternal food chain. Though Winston's story is not the message, one grows to love him for endeavors to understand his twisted world.I read this book after hearing about it for many years. People will hear of it for many years to come, no doubt. The main message of the novel leaves the reader reeling, suddenly needing some time to reflect. Questions arise in the reader's mind: What holds our society together? What keeps Communism from working in reality? Could this ever happen?As a citizen of the US for all of my 17 years, I have come to value my freedom more after reading 1984. I'm thankful to live here where I can do pretty much anything I please, instead of Orwell's imaginary Oceania, where imagining committing a crime could land you several months of torture at &quot;The Ministry of Love&quot;.I can say for certain that this book isn't in my high school's literature curriculum. It should be. If we could learn to appreciate our liberty while we are young, the US would be a much better place."},{"Title":"1984","review":"A frightening look at what might have happened at the end of World War II, &quot;1984&quot; provides a fascinating look at a fictional society that is the PERFECT dictatorship. The Party is all-knowing, its citizens under complete control, and the truth is subject to the party's wishes. It would be impossible to overthrow the Party. A very disturbing book."},{"Title":"1984","review":"This book is skillfully written, intrusting, and entertaining. It is not a difficult read, but is not oversimplified in its language, and despite being written in 1949 the story and language do not seam dated (this, I consider it worth noting is the opinion of a high school student, who read this book voluntarily, rather than for school.) The books image of life in a society, that is an example of a communist society as it is most commonly perceived, though is certainly not a society that follows the equality based principals of communism (no 'communist' nation ever has). The story, in summery, is definitely worth reading, and I would recommend it to anyone over the age of 14. (Worth is that I read, and liked, Animal farm, though I do not consider it to be nearly so good a book as 1984. I would recommend that to anyone as young as 12, due to the simplicity of its language."},{"Title":"1984","review":"1984 is the best book I have ever read. The storyline is supurb; there is suspence, pleasure and even horrer. Although you may not expect it, 1984 is quite scary and it plays with your mind. It gets you thinking things like; &quot;what if the world was like this.&quot; and &quot;How horrible it must be to live like that.&quot; at the end it made me want to cry, shout and screem all at the same time. I have made everyone in my class read it and I give you some advise- READ 1984; THE BEST BOOK EVER!"},{"Title":"1984","review":"Winston Smith is a normal person in 1984. Constantly being monotored by a telescreen, he cannot do anything against the government, or the thought police will arrest him. His little hidden betrayals to the Party soon transform into a conspiracy. He knows inside him some day he will be caught and killed. Winston knows the Party is wrong, but cannot prove it. Maybe he is wrong, and the Party is right? The book is wonderful, and could very well open your eyes to what the government could be doing behind our backs. Winston is led to believe that he has a memory disorder that causes him to believe events that never happened have happened. The reader is led to believe that Winston is right, and is perfectly sane. Some slogans that seem to be oxymorons make perfect sense. &quot;WAR IS PEACE&quot; &quot;FREEDOM IS SLAVERY&quot; and &quot;IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH&quot; are a few. This book will have a very big impact on you, and your view of the world."},{"Title":"1984","review":"reading this book wasn't a lot of fun, but it was good for me. It's a classic for a reason, and should be required reading not necessarily for high school students, but at least for frosh/soph college students. The scenario is extreme and highly unlikely, but serves as a good and fair warning from an age when totalitarianism was a frighteningly real threat to humanity. If you haven't read it, pick up a copy - it's cheap, and it'll do you good."},{"Title":"1984","review":"1984 was one of the best and most thought provoking books I have ever read.

But you know, sometimes a book is just a book and there is no hidden meaning. Winston loves Julia and Julia loves Winston. I hate it when teachers and &quot;experts&quot; try to get you to see the &quot;meaning&quot; behind the book. What if it's just a fictional story about a man who lives in a future world where people live in fear of being found out and he falls in love with a woman? I won't give away the ending. I only gave it 4 stars because some parts of the book are a bit tedious...especially when Orwell(Blair) begins to tell you things that you know you read not 30 pages earlier. Just remember it's a love story...and a good one at that."},{"Title":"1984","review":"The book is not only well written but, in my opinion, an accurate picture of where the world is headed. Although parts may get a bit confusing, if you plow through those parts it all makes sense in the end. A bold and daring novel written as fiction but parts may be frighteningly real when you look around you at our current society. I recommend it to everyone but specifically those who are either paranoid or totally detest the way our society behaves."},{"Title":"1984","review":"The book was scary! It woke me up about the governments absolute power. It is a scary, story about the geovernment controlling its entire population. Telescreens follow and record every movement, speaking to you if you are doing something wrong. It will scare you every word you read. I would recomend reading it, if you would like nightmares, about the government controlling you. Every foot step, &quot;Big Brother is Watching You&quot;. WAR IS PEACE, FEEDOM IS SLAVERY, IGNORANCE IS STRENGH. The thought police enforce the crimes that Big Brother makes. If you are involved in a thought crime, you will first disappear from the population, and you will never be heard of again. They government brings you to their jail, and it involves severe gang beatings, and tortures. Everybody works for the government, but their job descriptions are faint. On what exactly the do, Winston(main character) gets a list of names, and is told to delete them off the computer, but he does not know what for. He deletes everyones name and erases their past. The beginning gets off to a slow start, but it is well worth the ending. It wraps the whole book up. Giving the total image of the governments power."},{"Title":"1984","review":"George Orwell's classic &quot;1984&quot; is thought proviking and has not lost any relevance since the collapse of the Soviet Union. When the book was written, people were just learning about the pros and cons of Communism (I'm not going to make any political statements in this review.) Arguably, the book reached its prime in the cold war era, but it still as relevant as Orwell's other essays such as &quot;Shooting an Elephant&quot;, which, athough it dealt with British imperialism, is still very relevant when applied to other reigons of the world. The protagonist in this story shows the futility of rebelling against a totalitarian state when advanced to this level. I thought that the story makes a strong point even though the events in the story are not probable to occour in the near future. I personally am a big fan of negative utopias (&quot;We&quot; by Zamyatin is very good, don't waste your time with &quot;Brave New World&quot; by Huxley) because they show the human's primal desire to live and be free in a very raw manner. The policy of never creating martyrs for opposition really struck a chord within me. I have read this book at least five times and have come to appreciate it greatly. It probably is my favorite book, second only to The Brothers Karmozov."},{"Title":"1984","review":"If we will not defend love and truth, this stuff book writes about can really happen.

The issues presented in the story affect all nations and all people around the world. It makes you realize how influenced and manipulated people can get because of a dictating government. I recommend this book to anyone and everyone because it is important that we know about what could happen if we let the government take things too far. Also, there is a love story involved in the book, which holds your attention well. A book like 1984 helps to remind you not to take things for granted, because once you read about what Winston and his people go through, you realize you probably have it so much better."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Most certainly a must read.This book shows how the government can easily take control of its power, and use it against the ordinary people.

Many, I'm sure, feel that since this is NOT the case today, that Orwell and his book were / are a wast of time.As for me, the more I read this, the more I see how the overall concept of &quot;Big Brother&quot; -- i.e., how information is &quot;cleansed&quot; to &quot;protect&quot; us; how we are teaching technology itself to out-smart, or at least, stay one step ahead of us -- IS, in fact, all-too-real in our lives today!In any case, very intriguing!"},{"Title":"1984","review":"1984 is the story of the main charcter ( Winston) and his life living under the control of Big Brother. Big Brother is the \\"governmental\\" power of the time. The main slogans of the party are: War is Peace, Freedom is Slavery, and Ignorance is Strength. Throughout the book it becomes evident that the party trully believes these staements and does not let anyone else believe otherwise. We see Winston's stuggle with self control and how his meeting with Julia is what evintually takes him down. His feelings fo sin for her and his hatred of just about everything destroys him. He and Julia have several encounters and are eventually caught and only after denouncing Julia is Winston treated fairly. In the end Winston gives in and submits to the growing and ever controling power of Big Brother.My own feelings:This book is certainlly a strange one. In the beggining it makes you think that it is about a lunatic who wants physical attention. But then you realize that he is misguided and that ifhe would not have been corrupted by Big Brother and given some rights he wouldn't have rebelled."},{"Title":"1984","review":"\\"1984\\" is a classic novel that centralizes around the theme of what happens when human civilization has lost its innate, human qualities and is predestined to have its individuality debased even more. The author, George Orwell, conveys this throughout the context of the book by showing that the government controls virtually every aspect of human life. The main character is Winston Smith, and he is a slightly rebellious and wondering adult who questions the validity of past events and the overall value of human life.On a scale of one to ten, I would probably rate the book an \\"eight\\" because it is a very captivating novel to explore the depths of human thought and fictionalized imagination. However, the concepts are slightly difficult to comprehend, so a person who understands the concepts of utopia would really understand the plot. I would recommend this novel to people who enjoy reading other pieces of literature by George Orwell (such as \\"Animal Farm\\" and the essay \\"Shooting an Elephant\\") because it is yet another book Orwell probes the concepts and ideas of civilization and government, and the results of corruption. I must mention that Orwell uses a direct and rebellious tone, as the plot is in perspective to the third person point of view of Winston Smith. He uses interesting diction as Orwell assumes that the reader knows the order of society in \\"1984.\\" It also contains a lot of detail and imagery as he continuously describes the atmosphere of futuristic society."},{"Title":"1984","review":"I first read this book when I was only 17 or 18.

This is the only book I have ever read that has given me the shakes."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Thankfully in the year I was born which was 1984, the world wasn't exactly like it was in the novel.What makes 1984 important to the modern reader is several things.First is the fact that culturally its an incredibly relavent book. Most people have today heard terms like \\"How 1984\\", \\"Orwellian\\", or even \\"doublethink\\", in the modern vocab. Hell, even Radiohead did a song called 2+2=5. The reader, particularly the young one trying to grasp a sense of history, in the sense of the progression of modern thought, will find this book very important.That relates to the 2nd reason why you need 1984, not only is it culturally relavent in its influence and often referenced nature. But it is one of those books that have shaped the way that we think, particularly in the free market west, and has helped give us moral justification in avoiding what becomes the excessive totaltarian nature of many collectivist style government. Perhaps in Orwell's mind he may of been more successful then he orginally planed to be in his warning, as he was a english socialist, and was deathly afraid of what he had seen happen with Stalin in Russia.As a story, 1984 is a well thought out and griping story. The intergration of idea's, action, depth, and even a great deal of dark satire blend together well.Although it is a good idea if one does have at least a decent understanding of Marxism before approaching it, as i've seen younger people in my generation approach the novel without the understanding of Marx and walk away with little more comprehension of the tale's warnings then they could.Overall however, one of the few books everyone in our culture should at least attempt to read."},{"Title":"1984","review":"one of the best books i've ever read. makes you think about what is true and what isn't. though written in the 50's i believe, the concept can be applied to the present and the future."},{"Title":"1984","review":"In a society that has eliminated many imbalances, surplus goods, and even class struggle, there are bound to be deviates; Winston Smith is one of those. He starts out, due to his inability to doublethink, with thoughtcrime. This is in a society that believes a thought is as real as the deed. Eventually he graduates through a series of misdemeanors to illicit sex and even plans to overthrow the very government that took him in as an orphan.If he gets caught, he will be sent to the \\"Ministry of Love\\" where they have a record of 100% cures for this sort of insanity. They will even forgive his past indiscretions.Be sure to watch the three different movies made from this book:1984 (1954) Peter Cushing is Winston Smith1984 (1956) Edmond O'Brien is Winston SmithNineteen Eighty-Four (1984) John Hurt is Winston smith1984"},{"Title":"1984","review":"This book was great but made me so afraid for the future. The book was written sometime in the 40s or 50s and takes place in England in 1984. In this futuristic world Big Brother is the boss and everything he says is right even if he's wrong. Everyone is under constant surveillance and history can be erased or changed at Big Brother's whim.The form of government in this book is similar to that of any tyrant totalitarian. What happens in this book is something that I believe could happen to society if we let the government obtain too much power over the people. It really gave me a new perspective on just how easily things can change in the world. Overall I was really nervous for the future of the world, but I couldn't put the book down. It is really well written and it kept me guessing until the end.I felt really badly for the two main characters. I couldn't even imagine what I would do in their situation. This was a great book.

Its not only politics its has a hint of a love story, but its mostly about the control of the government in a totalitarian society. It was really interesting how it gave a look at the life of somebody in that kind of society where you have no freedom or choices. 1984 makes you want to know whats happening in government more. It was also fun to see what he thought 1984 would be like because 1984 was nothing like it.The book i believe would to be too hard from anything below 6th grade, a slight challenge for middle schoolers and a perfect level for mid highschool any older or wiser it would be a great quick read."},{"Title":"1984","review":"This book is incredible. So he wrote this book in like 1950's I believe? and hes writing about 1984.. about the future.. and he was right.. he does an amazing job writing about how the government controls the people.. about how the government uses propaganda, how the government watches the people, listens to the people.. this book is good if you care about the world. this book is good if you are aware of propaganda and how people are fooled by it. this book is good if you are someone who doesn't want to be controlled or fooled.kindof like the way we are today sadly.."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Katelyn Bollow Hour:4 Book Project1984 was one of the best books I have ever read. The main character, Winston, goes through a series of events. First he gets a little green book that he writes nasty things in. He goes on through life watching this girl who seems suspucious. She gives him a note that says: I love you. Winston and the girl, Julia, get together. They have some good times. Then they join a group that is against the Party(people who own and watch everyone). They both get caught by the Thought Police. They go into what is called \\"jail\\". They get tourmented and badly hurt. While they are doing this they get seperated and later on meet each other again. All this is taking place in London, on the streets, in work,and in the \\"jail\\". As Winston is in \\"jail\\" he learns by being tourmented. He learns that the Party can never be beat. It will always win. 1984 is a book I highly suggest. 10/31/06-11/1/06"},{"Title":"1984","review":"\\"1984\\" has made an impressive impact on literature, as well as society in general. It is a classic of the dystopian (or \\"Negative Utopia\\") genre. Though it was written in 1949, and the real year 1984 has already passed, the totalitarian society of the future George Orwell describes is remarkably believable and seems more possible than ever.The world of \\"1984\\" is much different than our present world; the territories are now divided into Oceania (which includes Great Britain and the Americas), Eurasia (includes the Soviet Union), and Eastasia (includes China, Japan, and Korea). These three powers are engaged in perpetual war, in which alliances are constantly formed and split. The governments of each of the three \\"superstates\\" has an enormous amount of control over the citizens and media. \\"Big Brother\\", ruler of Oceania, is seen as an omnipotent, infallible leader. The departments of Oceanian government are the Ministry of Peace (concerned with war), the Ministry of Plenty (concerned with rations of food and other goods), the Ministry of Love (concerned with the arrest and torture of those opposing the government), and the Ministry of Truth. The Ministry of Truth is perhaps the most influential of the four, as it is concerned with spreading propaganda of the Party (the only political group allowed in Oceania). The government places \\"telescreens\\" in most of the citizens' homes and various public places, which are generally unable to be turned off. These telescreens continuously provide information about government affairs. They can also be used as monitors for the government to observe what citizens are doing inside of their homes at any given time.The book centers around the protagonist, Winston Smith, a citizen of London, in Oceania. He is employed in the Records Department of the Ministry of Truth, where he alters recent and historical articles and documents to coincide with what the Party desires to be represented as absolute fact. He finds his work challenging and interesting, but starts to increasingly wonder about the real facts that are hidden in the past and deeply questions \\"Ingsoc\\" (the form of English Socialism in Oceania's government). Winston begins keeping a journal of his thoughts about life and government, sitting at a place in his house away from his telescreen so he can't be watched. This is just one small part of a chain of events that leads him to become increasingly evasive and defiant of the Party, trying to keep out of the government's watch.Winston becomes romantically involved with a girl named Julia, who also detests the government's restrictions and lies. Winston and Julia try to sneak away to places free from government surveillance as often as they can, so they can be together. Winston hears rumors of a \\"Brotherhood\\", a group secretly working to disobey, and perhaps eventually overthrow, the Party. He constantly searches for evidence that such a group really does exist and that there may be hope for a revolution after all.Orwell takes important details into consideration to make this society seem real, particularly \\"Newspeak\\". Newspeak is regarded as Oceania's official language, and is \\"the only language in the world whose vocabulary gets smaller every year\\". The goal of Newspeak's usage is to narrow the range of thought and individuality. Synonyms and antonyms are constantly being obliterated and many meanings can be summed up with greater rapidity than in \\"Oldspeak\\" (standard English) through abbreviations. Though Oldspeak is still used throughout the course of the novel, Newspeak phrases often appear in government publications and occasionally in dialogue. One of the common expressions, \\"doublethink\\", occurs when citizens accept the government's new and false facts as truth, in the place of previously established and real facts. The fear and oppression within such a society, where words are twisted in the government's favor and freedom of expression is destroyed, is conveyed with incredible believability in Orwell's work."},{"Title":"1984","review":"It was interesting to read this book again in 2006. It is fascinating to read this book and then analysis and compare the different governments in today's world."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Because nothing else will be able to compare. this book is number 3 on mensa's top 12 list and number 1 on mine. George Orwell's predictions of a horrible socialist oppressive future puts our own society in perspective. The only thing greater than this book is the last 4 words which will send chills down your spine. A definate must-read."},{"Title":"1984","review":"One of the great books of the 20th century - it is amazing how much of Orwell has entered the language : Big Brother, Thought Police etc. The story is a bleak one - &quot;Imagine a boot stamping on a human face, forever!&quot;. Orwell intended it as a warning, not as a prophecy. As a warning, it worked - 1984 was read by every Russian dissident, about the only English book (besides Animal Farm) that can make that claim. Yet, the abuse of language described by Orwell, the way thought can be controlled by inculcating poverty of language, in a certain sense describes much of today's media - &quot;dumbing down&quot; actually limits the possible human response - look at the jeers and cheers on 'the Jerry Springer' as pathetic subjects explode their inarticulate rage. The nearest thing to the '5 Minute Hate' that I have ever seen. Yet, Orwell possibly made the warning too bleak (he was dying of TB as he wrote, it was his last book). You feel that while Julia and Winston Smith do ultimately betray each other, yet it was done under duress of torture, and there could possibly be forgiveness in their hearts afterwards, not the disillusion of the book. The power of human love could defeat the Party, perhaps. A book that repays several readings."},{"Title":"1984","review":"1984 is a book about a controlling government taking too much power over it's people. This book totally reminds me of my favorite movie series, Star Wars. The dictatorship is close to the communism in present-day Cuba where the people have no say in any matter. The government known as Big Brother has developed a language, Newspeak, for the people of Oceania. The language prohibits people from acting against Big Brother. All citizens are under intensive constant watch including the main character Winston Smith. All thoughts, actions, and words are recorded by telescreens at all times. These telescreens are watching for anything out of the ordinary. Winston is constantly thinking rebellious thoughts while knowing the government is &quot;ungood&quot;. The common English word &quot;bad&quot; translates into Newspeak as &quot;ungood&quot;. The setting holds three superstates Oceania, Eastasia, and Eurasia who all have simmilar governments looking to gain ultimate power over the other two.As the book goes on Winston finds a co-worker and future lover Julia who thinks the same way as him. The two share thoughts and present them to O'Brien, a third worker who is believed to be in charge of &quot;Brotherhood&quot;. Brotherhood is the rebel group who disagrees with Big Brother. Two weeks later we find out the secrets of Big Brother. Doublethink is the known method used by Big Brother to have a single person think to opposite thoughts and believe both. O'Brien tells us about doublethink with &quot;Reality exists in the human mind, and nowhere else,&quot; says O'Brien. &quot; . . . In the mind of the Party, which is collective and immortal. Whatever the Party holds to be truth is truth.&quot;Orwell obviously was a strong believer in the warnings of a &quot;controlling American government&quot;The book makes me think to myself could this all happen if the government became everything it has become throughout 1984."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Very good book, and certainly deep in terms of political ideas, but a little slow in the middle, and the ending is too pessimistic. &quot;We&quot; by Evgenii Zamiatin (which was written first) is similar and though it has its own weeknesses is probably a better book overall. Nevertheless 1984 is a thought provoking book and well worth reading."},{"Title":"1984","review":"When Orwell originally wrote 1984, it was to be called 1948. This was because he'd figured that by 1948 the world would be split into &quot;superstates&quot;, and all a form of some totalitarianism or other. And a terrifyingly new kind of totalitarianism. One that utilizes technology to invade the privacy of every one of it's citizens. Orwell gave us the term &quot;big brother is watching&quot;. And this is done by cameras that are placed everywhere. Knowing it to be impossible for someone to watch you 24 hours a day is small comfort when you never know when you're being watched.It bothers me that Orwell is not considered to be one of the great authors of the 20th century, as he was so adept at breaking down complex societies, and goverments into contexts that most everyone can understand. Both in 1984, and Animal Farm.1984 is the story about an average man who finds more and more that the life he's leading, and the government he works for is wrong. Horribly wrong. The society he lives in is sick. In time he discovers, through a forbidden book, that the decades long war they've been fighting against the other superstates is actually a fabrication based on the concept that war can sustain an entire economy, because everything that a society produces is destroyed. And that stoking the fears and hatreds towards the other superstates can create a nucleus that a society can form it's self around. We are versed on double-think, and double-speak; where one can spout, and believe government rhetoric, all the while knowing the truth right in front of their face. The book is endlessly fascinating, well written, and deeply provocative. It is, after all, a classic."},{"Title":"1984","review":"One of the most irritating and literal-minded criticisms of this book is that the events in it didn't happen in 1984--as though Orwell were writing prophecy rather than social commentary or just plain fiction. In fact, the majority of thought-control processes he described are in full effect today, as Fromm's splendid addition to this edition makes clear."},{"Title":"1984","review":"A while back I started listening to a record by Radiohead. At first two songs really struck me as &quot;Whoa&quot; but I couldn't figure out why. I listened to the rest of the songs and they soon struck me as &quot;Whoa.&quot; I continued listening and I wanted to know what other people thought. I found a comparison between the book Nineteen Eighty-Four and this album. I didn't read anything more than the idea because I knew that I wanted to investigate for myself. I read the book and for the longest time I could not figure out any minute connection between the two. I listened day and night and eventually it made itself clear. OK Computer is the soundtrack to 1984. Each song has some relation to this book. This book is great, and everyone should read, while listening to radiohead. yeah."},{"Title":"1984","review":"This book is very engrosive and is what I consider &quot;literature.&quot; In my mind literature is what makes you think.

It was eventive and had good ending (which surprised me)The charecters were well thought out and had recognizable (for lack of better words) emotions.THis is one of my favourite books."},{"Title":"1984","review":"This book is incredible. It is almost haunting how close to home some of it hits. You must read it for yourself to truly understand how startling it is."},{"Title":"1984","review":"1984 is a book written in 1949 by George Orwell and is a prediction of what he thought the future was going to look like in the year 1984. The book revolves around Winston Smith and his life in the outer party, the middle of three classes. Winston lives in the country of Oceania, one of the three major superstates in the world.Orwell secretly hates the communist government though it is very hard for him to do so because there are Telescreens in every room that see everything. To add to the effect there are posters hung everywhere with a face that say \\"Big Brother is watching.\\" Propaganda is constantly shouted through the Telescreens and everyone but Winston believes it for fact. The past is constantly changed and is made to appear that life had always been the same if not worse than it currently is. Winston hopes that the government can be overthrown and he hopes for the success of a secret organization targeted by government propaganda simply known as the brotherhood. He meets a woman who loves him and in secrecy they defy the laws of the government. He also suspects a man from the inner party is in on the plot to overthrow the government.This is a very good book no matter how long after 1984 it actually is now. It provides a very real picture of how the government can control huge populations in poverty. This book gives a view of how life would be if communism were to take hold on very large portions of the world while ridding itself of certain fatal flaws that have caused past governments to collapse. Some of the things in this book are very hard to imagine because they are impossible. Doublethink, for example, is a concept in the book where someone says one thing and believes it, and then believes something else that is contradictory to the first thing, which is hard to understand because it isn't possible for people to actually do so to the degree done in the book, but that is one of the few things that are impossible in the book"},{"Title":"1984","review":"1984. It was a year, and it is also a book. The book is a classic. You cannot finish high school without reading it. And why is it considered a classic? For the creepy window it gives us on what the future may be. And like all disturbing images of the future, people are now convinced it is coming true.As is the case with many other modern classics, as time goes by, people are absolutely convinced that the situation is getting worse, and that slowly, slowly we are moving towards a totalitarian universe like there is in \\"1984\\". What I think is that with so many people reading the book, we'll stay farther away from the disturbing image Orwell (or Blair, more accurately) painted for us.\\"1984\\" can't really be summed up, but it's pretty simple, when you think about it. Totalitarian state. No freedom, even in your head. Methods of brain-washing. Constant propaganda. It's as freedom-less as you can get. And in this state you have a few people who try to fight back, but by this time it's practically impossible.I both liked and disliked this book. I think that it's definitely creepy and good, but on the other hand, there were many parts that were simply too boring. As someone who has managed to survive through the great unabridged classics (think War and Peace, The Count of Monte Cristo, etc.), having twenty pages of \\"1984\\" be unreadable was an incredible failure on the writer's part. There were parts that did not have to be as boring as they were. Honestly, the plot is a bit flimsy too. The love story isn't exactly a love story, but more of a passion story. I happened to enjoy the second half of the book much more, where it all starts to make sense and become clear how the government has so much power.If you want me simply to tell you what the book is about, I can't. It's not exactly describable. You have to read it to understand. You shouldn't trust other people's opinions either. Everyonoe thinks differently in regards to this book. You have to read it to find out, and you HAVE to read it.On the other hand, if all you're looking for is the \\"anti-utopia\\" book, go for the much better, much more interesting \\"Brave New World\\". \\"Brave New World\\" follows the same concepts (though it preceded \\"1984\\"), but is written in a much easier manner and is a superb book. Read THAT first, and then move on to here.I recommend you read this book. While it's not superb, it's the sort of book everyone needs to read. It is informative, slightly creepy near the end, and very powerful at the end. It does its job, showing us what the world may be like if we don't take care of it. It's a must read, but beware of some boring parts."},{"Title":"1984","review":"this book was unstoppable!i couldnt put it down.i suddenly felt like i was being watched from everywhere just like the folks in the book.ive read it twice.the 1st time i was on winstons side but i learned to love big brother by the time i was done the 2nd time.big brother is watching!writer george orwell gets a lot of props for \\"animal farm\\" but this ones way better!"},{"Title":"1984","review":"In Erich Fromm's afterward, he says: the book is about the near despair of the future of man and the warning that unless the course of history changes men will become soulless automatons.A fascinating read, Orwell keeps the pages turning. The story focuses on a man of the \\"party\\" who starts questioning big brother.It's where Nazism left off.Orwell concocts a new dictionary-language, called \\"newspeak\\"; the melding of words, a simplistic speech that controls the masses. It is now the world of the thought police, there watching you; a totalitarian rule, be mindful who you choose to associate with; the \\"party\\" is always monitoring your moves and your conversations; a world war that never ceases; a time where anything is legal and nothing is; total power will be the only pleasure.In reality the story is a bit ridiculous, how could a country function or survive. It is obvious the book should not be taken seriously, but read as a warning. There are still amazing insights that closely resemble the future, now. Compare it to the war were fighting and the \\"new world order\\" arising.There are many reasons why this book is quoted, but may I interject one thought on this? Could not the thinking be: that the materials used for war could be used to uplift the poor out of poverty. They would then have the insight that the rich have, hence bettering society, an equality. The thing is, we are not equal.\\"Double think\\" is already here. The holding of two contradictory beliefs. This coined by Orwell."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Im a big fan of Anti-Utopias and this is arguably the best in the genre. Orwell takes you on a journey of Hope and dispare, love and betrayal. while this is a great story what kept me reading is that this book is very well written and I couldnt wait to pick it up again and read on. If you are interested in books of this type, books like \\"Men like Gods\\"-HG Wells, and \\"Brave New World\\"-A Huxley are also excelent. For a little Harder read try \\"Utopia\\"-T Moore The language is a little difficult and with out understanding the latin and greek humor it is still an excellent story."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Orwell goes into extreme detail and outlines, with vivid detail, life in Oceania.

The ties to modern society are fairly obvious - especially the idea that one can be watched at all times (sattellite imagery). The overall idea, however, is that it is hopeless to change a system that is based in such fundamental deception. It makes us ponder our own fate and how much control we actually have over our lives. When people know what your deepest thoughts are your deepest fears they have power over you..."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Did George Orwell actually believe that in the year 1984 the world would resemble the chilling, bleak vision he portrays in this novel ? This is a truly engaging work because it's a cautionary tale speaking strongly against Fascism, Communism and Totalitarianism that Orwell saw rise in his time during World War II. Orwell's characer Winston- drawn from Winston Churchhill-is a British man living in Oceania, which is presumably the UK or the West, is a working-class stiff slaving away in the Records Department of the Ministry of Truth, which ironically specializes in destroying the truth and giving it an illusion of truth through re-editing. The official language is a mutated English, Newspeak, that is so incredibly condensed it's purpose is to eliminate elaborate and intelligent thought! Instead of saying thinsg like evil they use \\"ungood\\", instead of using the whole word Ministry of Peace they say Minipax. Winston secretly loathes the stifling and totalitarian world he lives in. The empowered Party, headed by a fictitious Big Brother, is constantly monitoring everyone's thoughts, and urging families to spy on one another. Eventually, Winston falls for Julia, a rebellious girl from the supposedly virginal Anti-Sex League. But Julia is no virgin and has engaged in sexual relationships with even members of the Party. However, because they fall in love with each other and are against the institution of the Party, they are punished through torture and seperated. The story is well-written, with enough description and character development, particularly that of Winston and his enemy, the wicked Party pawn O'Brien who works in the Ministry of Truth. O'Brien's character is devilish and cynical, a man who represents devotion to the Party and its system of mind control. They have everyone so subjugated that they believe one plus one is four if the Party says so. What is the theme of 1984 ? If we are not careful in preserving civil liberties and maintaining strong democratic systems, we will live as close to this nightmarish world as possible."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Though the novel does drag when you read tracts from the conspiracy's manual, I found the novel to be rather enjoyable. The idea of how the world would be shaped and for what reasons was interesting, and the narrator was able to lead the reader into the world and allow the reader to be engulfed into things.The end was well done, and it was a good closure to the work. The character does not die, but he is changed. Indeed, he awakens to thye doctrine of the state and accepts it. Yeah, he has been tortured and brainwashed, but he does not give in under that torture, though seeds are definitely laid.If you have the time and you like depressing books about totalitarian states that try to stamp out individual thought and reason, go ahead and pick this book up. If you want something lighter though, I would try to find something else."},{"Title":"1984","review":"I would never have come to the conclusion that Nineteen Eighty-Four was going to be as it was - frightening, thought provoking and ultimately distressing. To think that a work of fiction from the 1940s could so accurately discribe elements of life today is amazing, and almost unheard of.This book speaks about a guy by the name of Winston Smith. He seems like a pretty cool guy in the story in the story. He started out with thoughtcrime. He graduates through a series of misdemeanors and even plans to overthrow the government that took him in as an orphan.It is a book that makes you aware because your every move is watched and where the media is controlled. This book has it's own language, a twisted corruption of English, which can in part be seen today. It is easy to imagine that a camera is on you all the time, that people can look inside your head. This book makes you wonder about things like that. Like what if somebody can come into my mind and read my thoughts and what if somebody is watching me all the time and I never sat down to think about this. To me the book was very good I think if you just give it time and really get into the book you would really enjoy yourself. It is kind of scary, but hey so is life."},{"Title":"1984","review":"This is the first time I have read 1984. I guess it never came to be that any of my high school or college classes made it a required reading.Obviously, there is nothing one can add today to the discussion of the central theme of the book that probably has not been discussed already. However, I think it is a book that one needs to read and discuss today, and in the future, in terms of the parallels we find in Orwell's 1948 vision of 1984 and the world of today. It's bothersome to realize how many connections you can find on a global or national scale and then again on a smaller, local day-to-day scale. On the smaller, local scale I mean to include not just governmental but also office and even family.Orwell truly had an ability to identify and register the extremes that man is capable of obtaining. Through looking at the extremes we are able to see the potential harm that slight breaks in treasured behaviors and freedoms can lead to. Unapproved monitoring of the population, taking the face away from the enemy, the use of language to deny freedoms or manipulate facts and fear, torture for the sake of confession and re-education have all been headlines or points of discussions in the recent past and I am sure will be in the future. After all, man is man. Somehow Orwell captured a timeless and scary side of man in 1984.My one knock on the book is that somewhere in the second part of the book, I put it down and gave it a rest for some time. Somewhere in the middle of Winston and Julia's sadly dark utopia, I moved onward to something else. I did come back to it though and am glad I just didn't leave it unfinished.Anyway, enjoy the book.

That was more than a little upsetting.The whole thing about DOUBLETHINK was especially unsettling. People today do use this all the time - especially in the media. Not a good thing. Maybe if more people read this book, they would realize what they are doing and stop. I know I will be on the lookout so as to avoid being guilty of this myself.Though Orwell may not have thought about this when writing, he did seem to provide readers with a warning against politically correct speech going too far. Consider the issues with NEWSPEAK in the book and see what you think.There is a movie version with Richard Burton that is well done, but read the book first.If you haven't read 1984, then get hold of a copy and read it.

And that is the world George Orwell (real name is Eric Blair) envisioned back in 1948 (the last two digits diverted, very clever), two years before his death. 1984 is a futuristic novel with a political message. Orwell predicted that humans would become robots, a shell of their former selves, brought on by communism. The word \\"communism\\" is not used in the novel at all -- or at least I don't remember it being used -- and Russia is seldom mentioned, but it is clear that this is what the author alludes to. Orwell was an opponent of Russian communism at the time, and used his protestations to create fiction. Some describe this book as \\"prophetic,\\" and might even go as far as to say that some of the book's prophesies have come true, especially in the last couple of years. I know one thing though: Orwell's views were light years ahead of his time, and it is as impressive as it is frightening. As for the book itself, at first, it seemed boring to me. It just showcases the every day life of an average Joe with opposing feelings for the Party. He is paranoid about making wrong moves in front of the telescreens and other Party members, yet is helpless to resist his traitorous thoughts, going as far as writing them down on a personal diary. The first part also showcases what the Party consists of and the changes that London has gone through since the \\"Revolution.\\" Things get interesting when Winston meets Julia and begins an affair that could get them both into serious trouble. The third part is the most riveting -- and the spookiest. It is a thing of true nightmares. I can go into detail, but I don't want to ruin it for those who haven't read it yet. One thing I would say is that one of the novel's themes is centered on how human beings cannot be completely controlled, that their refusal to yield helps them survive even the most unfathomable torture. O'Brien and the Inner Party might have taken Winston's freedom, but they would never able to overtake his soul. But did they take his soul? Read the last sentence in the book. It shook me to the core. The language is dark and gloomy throughout the novel, and the ending is creepy in its subtlety. I could give out numerous examples about how real life events and political manipulation (the whole War Against Iraq, and the fact that easy access to one's credit, criminal, medical and employment history does make one feel that Big Brother IS watching us) that mirror Orwell's \\"negative utopia,\\" but others have done so already, and better than I would have done. All I know is that I love this book and will reread it again and again. I'll look into reading Animal Farm and other Orwell books in the future."},{"Title":"1984","review":"This book is a classic, and should be read by everyone claiming to be literate.The good thing about this particular version is that it's relatively inexpensive, and doesn't have a lot of extra material.The bad part about this particular version is that the afterword, written by Erich Fromm in 1961, has been overtaken by events. Communism has been exposed as an unethical, immoral system, and I am offended by Fromm's suggestion of some kind of moral equivalence between capitalism and communism.There needs to be a new afterword, written sometime after the World Trade Center attacks. It would actually be nice to have two small afterwords, written by people on different sides of the political aisle."},{"Title":"1984","review":"The slogan Big Brother is Watching derives from this work. Winston Smith decides to keep a diary, (against all regulations prevalent in Oceania). He detects that a man named O'Brien is a fellow dissident. Smith works at the Ministry of Truth. The really scary organization is the Ministry of Love. The danger of history is not knowing history. Winston Smith has a problem. He remembers. Ingsoc may have dated back to 1960. Newspeak has a vocabulary that grows smaller every year. There is a Ministry of Plenty, but there is rationing. Winston separated from his wife eleven years earlier. The Party prefers celibacy.Winston believes the best chance for the future is the proletarians, (proles). He decides to wander among them. The one thing they pay attention to is the lottery. There are big prizes. The book shows Orwell's mastery of the uses of propaganda, the perils of bureaucracy, and an understanding of totalitarian trends as exemplified by the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany and in smaller ways by the modern democracies of England, the United States, and the colonies of India and Burma. Orwell was a student of the uses and abuses of authority. Winston Smith's descent among the proletariat resembles Orwell's experiences, THE ROAD TO WIGAN PIER and DOWN AND OUT IN PARIS AND LONDON. Loving details of the scene reflect also Orwell's love of Dickens and Kipling.A girl from the Fiction Department writes a love note to Winston. He is amazed. They arrange to meet at a crowded square. Even though there are telescreens, it should be okay. (Not only is the Party Puritanical, but it is expected that Party members engage in wholesome communal activities. Sexual privacy induces hysteria.) Surveillance of citizens is carried on with the cooperation of other citizens rather in the way of Stasi or the block captains of Chairman Mao. Winston rents a room above a shop. Julia brings Inner Party coffee to the meeting, not the victory coffee everyone else drinks. Winston and Julia know their conduct is suicidal, but they continue. Winston is no longer bored with life.Julia believes that everyone secretly hates the Party. As under Stalin, there are show trials. (Taking things a step further, there are hate campaigns. One means of civil control by the Party is mass demonstrations.) Children are encouraged to spy on their parents. Winston explains to Julia that the past is actually being abolished. Suddenly Oceania is at war with Eastasia. All information concerning Oceania's war with Eurasia has to be obliterated.The Party has an enemy, Emmanuel Goldstein, a Trotsky-like figure. There is an anti-Party organization, the Brotherhood. Goldstein has a book, although most copies have been destroyed. O'Brien endeavors to get a copy of it for Winston and Julia. Reading Goldstein's book, Winston learns that the three superstates are permanently at war. Even if war hysteria is continuous, war takes place on the margins, and is the product of specialists. War cannot be decisive because the parties are too evenly matched. War uses up surpluses. A war that is continuous ceases to be dangerous. Party weapons are doublethinks and the mutability of the past.The end is nightmare. There is a Cold War flavor to this, (Orwell seems to have anticipated everything). Beyond politics there is the point, raised recently in a journal, that the author of this masterpiece was dying of tuberculosis during its composition. It is his testament. Our clever author has left us with a prized gift at the end of the volume, an Appendix detailing the Principles of Newspeak. Bravo--this is a book to be read and reread only by the strong-minded."},{"Title":"1984","review":"This is the gold standard dystopian novel which all others are wan and pale by comparison with, and it is so clear and brilliant that it makes the mind reel at its inventions and delivery. If it were discovered a few thousand years from now the reader would still get the sense that at best, civilization was teetering on the edge of annihilation at the hands of its own institutions. There is a timelessness and immediacy in the prose which defies description. Every character in this book is suffering in ways that strip him or her of all the joys that can be shared between people. Only a genius in immense pain is capable of producing a work of this caliber; this is the culmination of a life that was, in the writing of this book, essentially sacrificed. When some people die young we think they left great works undone, but if someone makes something like this, it's something we should all be thankful for and leave it at that; no one having done a thing like this can have died in vain. Of the few that can make a book like this in the first place, only one of them has. This is a treasure of the most vital importance and I say this without hesitation or fear of contradiction, one of the greatest books ever written."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Absolutely scary outlook on the ramifications of allowing government to creep incrementally into our lives--eventually consuming and controlling every one of our actions.

Winston becomes a free thinker in a society where the Thought Police will kill for doing such criminal acts. He starts to rebel against Big Brother in ways that I couldnt even believe (writing in a diary, having sex, purchasing certain items at a store). Winston's journey is a scary one from beginning to end. Part three is especially creepy. I know that this story is very extream, but it is kinda crazy how it describes things that happen in our world today."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Big Brother is watching in a utopian vision of 1984 where everyone is being watched. With the invent of modern cell phone technologies and such it is entirely possible that we are all being watched by someone or multiple someone's without being made aware. Love is also forbidden and mixing between classes is frowned upon. Love in modern society is under attack by the pressures of a bad economy, work schedules, children, and fifty bajillion other things and I personally have noticed that there isn't exactly a lot of mixing between people of different ethnic and cultural backgrounds and occupations, so my thought is are we really that far from the basic concepts of 1984 : technological watching possible at any moment, a loss of love and intimacy and a divides between ethnic and cultural groups that still can't mix ?"},{"Title":"1984","review":"I'm a first time reader of 1984 and am in love. I can't believe that it didn't show up in my reading list before now! I have been a long time fan of dystopia and am so excited to have read finally a founding book of the genre.I was absolutely enthralled. It has been a while since a book has grabbed me like this. To say I'd recommend this book is a gross understatement. If you've been holding off on reading this stop holding off!!"},{"Title":"1984","review":"I read this book many many years ago as a teenager. Since then it has had a lasting impression on me. It really makes you think. It was a pleasure to read and have read it a bunch of times since then.

This book is highly entertaining to read and will change your life as you know it. I'm glad I was forced to read as a teenager."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Too much has been said about this novel to even try to be original in a review. I will underline that this is one of the most important books I have ever read. It taught me the value of freedom, its pricelessness in fact.The book is written very well, fluent prose and gripping plot, but that is not its main value. The value is its moral about democracy, which we may take for granted now but is to be nourished all the time. The book, of course, was written in the late forties, at the height of Stalinism, so it is obvious it refers to that scenario, at the peak of the Cold War. But too many people seem to forget the value of democracy today, in the information age.One could argue that Orwell was wrong about the state controlling people through technology, in fact internet has provided all of us with tremendous power of horizontal communication that governments have a hard time controlling. But the game is an ongoing one... not yet over! I think this book should be taught in schools."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Well I just finished reading this book about a half hour ago and I've been trying to find even a sliver of hope within its pages. When O'Brien hands Winston the book about the underground movement known as The Brotherhood and swears Winston to do anything for the movement, I have to believe that there is a possibility that the Brotherhood does actually exist and that O'Brien is an actual member of this Brotherhood. I recognize that later in the story O'Brien is the one torturing him but remember that one must always show no sign of deception to Big Brother in order to not be discovered. O'Brien must play his role in order to avoid detection and may have simply been better at avoiding detection by being a long time member of the underground movement and knowing ways to avoid detection. Winston may have been discovered through his careless acts by the various spys and/or telescreens.I felt that the arguments between O'Brien and Winston was the climax in the story and it was my favorite section to read. The ending where Winston meets Julia again one last time seemed to me to be the saddest part of all as Big Brother has destroyed there love for one another and their humanity."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Over the years I've read 1984 many times, the first time was for a book report in High School and the last couple of times as a paperback.

It is beautifully written and one of my all time favorites. I recommend it for everyone."},{"Title":"1984","review":"George Orwell's last book - 1984 was published in 1949 for the first time. It has since been reprinted in 1961, 1977, 1981 and 2003.Many reviews have been written. I do not presume to have anything new to say about the book.As the author of the foreword of the Centennial Edition, Thomas Pynchon, observed \\"It is not difficult to guess that Orwell, in 1984, was imagining a future for his son's generation, a world he was not so much wishing upon them as warning against. He was impatient with predictions of the inevitable, he remained confident in the ability of ordinary people to change anything, if they would.\\" It seems to be a thread woven through the book...\\"that human decency, like parental love, can always be taken for granted - a faith so honorable that we can almost imagine Orwell, and perhaps even ourselves, for a moment anyway, swearing to do whatever must be done to keep it from ever being betrayed.\\"In his Afterword, Eric Fromm offers this observation. \\"Orwell. . .is implying that the new form of managerial industrialism, in which man builds machines which act like men and develops men who act like machines, is conducive to an era of dehumanization and complete alienation, in which men are transformed into things and become appendices to the process and production and consumption...Orwell...is not a prophet of disaster. He wants to warn and awaken us....the danger with which all men are confronted today, the danger of a society of automatons who will have lost every trace of individuality, of love, of critical thought, and yet who will not be aware of it because of 'doublethink.'\\"Fromm continues \\"Books like Orwell's are powerful warnings. and it would be most unfortunate if the reader smugly interpreted 1984 as another description of Stalinist barbarism, and if he does not see that it means us, too.\\"As in all timeless creative writing Orwell has given us, the reader, many lessons. He has raised the alarm - it is up to us - 21st century humans - to heed it."},{"Title":"1984","review":"I personally hold this book in so high a regard that I find myself unable to make it justice by way of an extensive review, so I'll try to keep it brief. For me this is perhaps the greatest novel of the past century, almost any other book looks childish and frivolous by comparison as regards style, narrative pace, plot, structure and of course allegorical and metaphoric power (\\"The Trial\\" by Kafka, is the only other worthy contender of \\"1984\\" that I can think of).Orwell masterfully describes a nightmarish future in which all individual liberties have been rooted out. The book chronicles the alienated existence of Winston Smith, a minor bureaucrat, and his personal and solitary rebellion against the establishment until the final annihilation of his personality. There is terror and horror in literature (as understood by authors like Poe, Lovecraft, Barker, etc) and then there is this book, which is one of the most disturbing experiences a reader can face in a lifetime. Some people hate it precisely because of its very bleak denouement. I can tell you that this is a compelling novel that will stay with you after days of having finished it. It is also one of the very few literary triumphs hailed in equal measure during decades by critics and readers alike. No other writer that I know of has been able to describe the sheer abstract terror exemplified by the infamous Room 101. Horror has many faces and the powers that be many ways of imposing their tyranny upon an isolated individual. Unfortunately, there are things worse and more humiliating than death, and that is what the protagonist of this terrifying novel will discover...It is difficult for me to find any kind of flaws in this book, the underlying message is tremendously powerful and the writing addictive and stylish, plus the plot leaves you virtually breathless. It ranks easily as the very best dystopian fiction ever written, and it doesn't look like it is going to be overthrown in the near future. George Orwell who, some years prior to the publication of this book, already showed to the world what he was capable of with his amazing \\"Animal Farm\\", inscribes himself with ease among the greatest authors of all time thanks to this masterpiece.Do not go to your grave without having read this book first."},{"Title":"1984","review":"I had to read 1984 in high school for English, usually I never engaged with the required readings for class and sometimes I wouldn't even read the book, but 1984 was an exception. I could not put this book down, I read it slowly not wanting it to end and it completely took over my mindscape, I was thinking about it constantly! I remember we had to do chapter summary oral presentations in class and we went through about 10 chapters a class, but I was only up to chapter 4 at the time, I used to either block my ears or skip those classes! Riveting read! Chances are if you're reading this, you've already read 1984, and if you haven't then you must pick it up. Basically the plot follows a character named Winston Smith as he attempts to hang onto his humanity and creativity in a dystopic society that has abandoned both. The world of 1984 is one of Big Brother, constant camera surveillance, \`thought police', thought crime, new speak and even more Orwellian insanity."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Loved the book.

Oh, and the news that the media prints isn't always true and isn't that &quot;history&quot;? This book does get tedious at times but it's definitely worth reading, I know I have thought about this book of fiction/fantasy off and on for the past few decades.

Our fears of Orwell's book being a prophecy fully abated.Like most people I first read this book in school. Like most people I came away with the idea that the collectors of information will end up like Big Brother. I too cried '1984' when the government tried to collect even more info on us.Shortly after Princess Diana's death, though, I read this book for a second time. I then realized that we have been looking for 'Big Brother' in all the wrong places. Big Brother isn't the collector of information, he is the controller of information. Who controls information today? The media. Compare Princess Diana's life to Winston's.Very good book. Well worth reading again as an informed adult. At least that is this proles opinion."},{"Title":"1984","review":"I wonder what people in the early 50s thought of Orwell's view of the future. They must have thought it unimaginable, but to the current reader it appears to be less and less bizarre.I thought the book was well written and exciting for the most part, but it started to really drag when Winston started reading &quot;the book&quot;. Overall I give 1984 three stars primarily because of the dragging toward end (I had to speed read some of it just to keep the pages turning), but also because the ending wasn't what I wanted--I can't fault him for that though.Good book."},{"Title":"1984","review":"I have read 1984 many times. Each time that I have read it I come away with new insights to its pure genius. The very concept of 'DoubleThink' and 'NewSpeak' are not just literary devices in a great book, they are current trends that exist in todays world. In Americe, the land of the free, the insidious grip of Political Corectness has worked it's way through society. We have manged to criminalize words, because their meanings have been perverted by special intrest groups who have their own agendas. New words or terms have been formed to gradually herd people into new ways of thinking. We have a leader who by all indications has broken the laws of the country, the bonds of his marriage, and the basic morals that all people are expected to live be. Most anybody can recognize this yet at the same time cannot see where any wrong doing has taken place. A court appointed counsel has taken the form of Goldstein, where virtually every crisis and point of evil in the nation and possibly world has been blamed on him somehow. The internet has come into most peoples homes and office. A person cannot go anywher now without being watched by security cameras or electronically tracked at airports and by credit card transactions. It is 1998 now, but in many ways we are living in 1984. We just haven't looked up and noticed it yet."},{"Title":"1984","review":"love this book, no problems on my kindle fire. amazon wants me to write more blah blah blah blah blah"},{"Title":"1984","review":"This is a powerful book that I first read in high-school and like with most everything in school you don't fully appreciate until you are much much older. With that in mind I recently re-read this classic and was shocked and appalled how much of George Orwells dark and dreary vision has become a reality in our lives since my high school days.Winston the protagonist in this book is a low level party grunt working at the Ministry of Truth in a fictional London dedicated to scrub history books and records of inconvenient facts, such as who we are at war with and why to streamline history into lockstep with the ever changing party line. Orwell foresees technology that for his day was in its infancy and describes how this technology can be used to oppress people and that whoever controls the past will control the future (and present).Orwell Imagines a world in which every home has a two way 'television', that is used inbound to disseminate propaganda while at the same time allowing the thought police to check up on its citizens. Virtually every inch of his imaginary world is covered in listening and spying devices and even small deviations from the norm carry the death penalty. Winston's crime is to keep a journal to record his own version of history, this will ultimately bring down the thought police on him, who (SPOILER) captures, tortures and kills him, but not before breaking his spirit and making him love big brother and his henchman.The most striking thing about this book is that we can see almost all of Orwells more imaginative concepts come to life in our modern day society, not necessarily exactly the way the author envisioned them, but in a more subtle but no less disturbing way. One can't help to draw parallels between Orwells concept of thought crime and the political correctness movement that is doing its best - and succeeding in - making certain words unspeakable and by extension certain thoughts unthinkable. It's chilling to read a news article on how interest groups trying to change Mark Twains classic to strike a specific word from the book for school versions where it is appropriate in both the text as the context of the time it was written. The ministry of truth resides not as a specific location it rather resides with special interest groups fighting to revise history.The Internet - obviously unimaginable at the time - serves as a close and even more powerful parallel to the ever present surveillance in Orwells world, but instead of a government forcing us to be available (and surveillable) we willingly surrender our deepest emotions, private thoughts and actions to social media sites like Facebook and twitter where they are for sale to the highest bidder including our government.9/11 as global watershed moment has served as justification for more and more snooping and warrant less searches while our airports serve as testing ground on how much more privacy intrusion we are willing to take at one point. In the name of 'homeland security' we are living in fear of the boogie man, not Goldstein, but Osama Bin Laden and his band of Islamic terrorist serving as the external threat on which more and more intrusions on our personal freedoms are being justified with.If you ever wonder how a prequel to 1984 would look or how Orwells world got to where it is, turn on your TV and browse the Internet and you will find that you are living it.

It is decentralization of power from the human being, in all aspects of one's life, to a higher power, a bigger cause, communism called the great Lucifer because all was given to the collective body and not to God, now God is the great Lucifer because we give ourselves to the collective body of something that we can not prove, so Science is the great Lucifer, producing weapons to kill the world a million times over, toxins to poison us a million times over, are all forms of giving to a collective body the nature of death? Is it the giving to a collective body that robs the soul of its power? Is it giving oneself wholly and utterly to something other than one's own self the conduit of decent into the investment of despair. 1984 sees men and women working their themselves to skin and bone to achieve a greater good that never emerges, the ultimate failings masked by a strict authoritative regime, BIG BROTHER, the power all seeing and ever controlling, rewriting history, editing the world around them, at war with this nation one minute and switching to another the next, neighbours up and vanish and protagonists invest in each other for but a fleeting glimpse of love only to be captured by the THOUGHT POLICE for engaging in illegal activity, men at the top of this society using torture and mind control to enforce a pathology of unquestionable and undeniable supremacy of all the power to the BIG BROTHER system, and that this is the system and that is why they are alive at all, at which point we question if it is worth living at all to which Orwell delivers a resounding, no, of course it is not worth living this life, why bother at all, and that this is a piece of work that must be understood by everyone and anyone who can read and is certainly mandatory reading for anyone in least bit interested in politics or political science.Unfortunately however we tend to vote in military commanders, lawyers and extreme capitalists into government and then ask why it is all going down hill.The problem is there is no terminology in the English language to describe the act of one human being killing their unborn future children by process of setting up a bad management system with a legal body incorporated into that system before they die. This prison kills, yet it is justified. 1984 is maybe that word, filicide being the closest English equivalent."},{"Title":"1984","review":"No novel seems to be more relevant these days than George Orwell's 1984.

The only negative thing I can say about this book is it becomes slow in some parts, but over all it is a great read."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Great book. Some of it is funny too. The ministry of Love, which is in charge or torturing, is called Miniluv in the language of Newspeak. The book presents a picture of a futuristic cruel society. Unlike A Brave New World, I would not want to live in this society. Some of the things that go on in this book one can relate to the real world. For example, in the book constant war is a stimulant to the economy, which resembles how some presidents use war to stimulate a bad economy in our times. The book also contains a book within a book, which appears to be an original concept. The book within the book describes an elaborate construction of the workings and politics of the Party. The torture that takes place is incredible. The Newspeak language was an interesting idea designed to reduce the possibilities of thought crimes by reducing the numbers of words in the language. The ideal speaker quacks like a duck, duckspeaking, such that speaking originates from the larynx as opposed from the brain. Duckspeaking is a marvelous, but scary idea indeed."},{"Title":"1984","review":"I first read this book on a friend's reccomendation and since then, it has become one of my favorite books of all time. many other reviews give you the plot summary, so i won't bother.

With his descriptive depiction of the future, Orwell really puts the fear into the reader's heart. With his description of a totalitarian socialist regime, Orwell's masterpiece stimulates a fear that is reminiscent and matched only by The Red Scare of the late 1950s. The most amazing feature of this book is that it still holds relevance today. With America's War on Terrorism, the Bush Administration has started restricting American's basic civil liberties, such as a right to trial. This action almost seems to be a precursor to the restricted socialist atmosphere described so well by Orwell. Still if this book has one message, it is that the individual mind is stronger than any government and that humanity and freewill are things to cherish, not taken for granted. This book is a crystal ball into our country's future and deserves to be read."},{"Title":"1984","review":"I would like to make a very brief comment on other reviews.Wh do so many reviewers of this book confuse Socialism with Communism?"},{"Title":"1984","review":"...well imagine your face being crush by a foot, for ever. Yeah yeah I have to admit I took it from 1984, but it's ok because its only THE BEST BOOK OF ALL TIME. I loved that book, poor M. George, he had one sick mind. In this book, around the 1950's(I'm not sure sure, but I know it was during the first or the second war) George Orwell imagined what the world would be like in 1984. The Government, or should I say YOUR BIG BROTHER, knows everything, EVERYTHING ! He hates people that are againts him, so free-thinking and having friends is a crime. With so much power, it's easy to make people believe events that never happened. The kids, ahh those stupid kids, let's brainwash them ...yeah, and let's turn them against their parents, they are so young and easy to manipulate. Yes this book is creepy, so creepy, that you're happy of the world that you are living in right now, that's what makes this book such a masterpiece. When you read the book, you hate BIG BROTHER so much, you want to the guy to beat up his ass, but who is MR.BIG BROTHER anyways, no one ever saw him before, right ? You just cant wait to reach the end, and the ending wont let you down, it's one of the best endings I ever read. Everything is good in this book. If you like DAN SIMMONS, ALDOUS HUXLEY and RAY BRADBURY, you'll salivate over this book.There is no hope if you don't have power, there's only hope in BIG BROTHER.....and Don't forget, BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING YOU."},{"Title":"1984","review":"George Orwell depicts a horrible totalitarian state that suppresses all opposition. In 1984 the world is divided into three parts, Oceania, Eastasia and Eurasia. These three parts are constantly at war. The charismatic figure of Big Brother stands in the forefront of the Party. It is a figure of mythical power. Winston Smith struggles against the Party, he rebels against Big Brother and the totalitarian regime. But his rebellion will result in his own destruction. We should bare in mind that this novel was published in 1949 and we so realise that Orwell's imaginary future world is a brilliant creation, his vision of brutalised and manipulated humanity is gripping and unfortunately still supremely relevant."},{"Title":"1984","review":"I first read this book in grade 7. I was just discovering books at the time and soaked up the distopia genre.I gave book reports on Clockwork Orange and Brave New World, instead of The Outsiders like other students.

The book reads as if it were written only yesterday with many aspects of the story describing the current state of affairs in America and warning of the dangerous path that we as a nation are travelling down - a path where we are coaxed by fear into giving up essential liberties and freedoms in exchange for greater &quot;protections&quot; from numerous false threats to our security. Ours is a nation that has become consumed with fear, and consequently one whose people are willing to swallow whatever bogus stories our leaders come up with to justify their unjustifiable wars and the profiteering they engage in. &quot;[The people] could be made to accept the most flagrant violations of reality, because they never fully grasped the enormity of what was demanded of them, and were not sufficiently interested in public events to notice what was happening.&quot; Ignorance and fear have taken over our lives in America, and Orwell shows us in frightening detail where it must eventually lead. This book is a must read for every American."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Dear &quot;reader from Mt. Pleasant, MI&quot;:What on earth are you talking about? You think Orwell actually wrote 1984 because he was mad at the world? Christ, you make it sound like 1984 is the work of a nihilist. 1984 is a dark satire of totalitarian governments. No, the Soviet Union was not as bad as Oceania, but a satire is supposed to exaggerate.The novel has a perfectly legitimate political purpose, and has nothing to do with Orwell being mad at the rest of the world. You clearly didn't understand much about the book at all.As for why I liked it, most of it has been said already. It offers great insight into human nature and politics. Plus it's very well written.

Oceania is a nightmare of totalitarianism. The Party controls everything, from Oceania's history to people's freedom of thought. War is peace. Freedom is slavery. Ignorance is strength. Big Brother is always watching you. Winston Smith is a rebel who is desperate to overthrow this all-powerful system. Nineteen Eighty-Four documents his quest for a way to defeat the Party.This book astonished me from beginning to end. The things I love most about it are its unrelenting darkness, each part's unique theme, and its overall message. The dark tone fits the book perfectly. The way everything unfolds paints a picture of bleakness and horror. The layout of the story is what interested me the most. It's organized into three distinct parts: Part I illustrates the world around Winston Smith, Part II describes the hopeful steps Winston takes toward rebellion, and Part III recounts Winston's downfall. Most importantly, I could comprehend the urgency of Orwell's message. The author's purpose was clear: to communicate not the evils of socialism itself, but the dictatorship and tyranny that complements it if it falls into the wrong hands.I strongly recommend reading Nineteen Eighty-Four. It is a landmark classic. The external story is pretty easy to follow, but you'll only truly enjoy it if you are able to interpret its underlying meaning. If you can understand its message, then you, like me, will love this book to death."},{"Title":"1984","review":"A Review by Jordan1984, by George Orewell is a book about what our Country could be like in a negative point of view in the year 1984. The book begins with a future Government trying to gain complete power of the world and its people. In this world there are no freedoms, no freedom of thought, no freedoms at all. The thoughts of the totalitarian Big Brother and the Party were nothing but complete power. Can you have complete power without pain and torture? The Party and Big Brother control everything, history, science, time, everything. Also the Party and Big Brother believed that if enough people believed something is it not true? They think if enough people believe that 2+2=5 then does it not?I liked how the book kept you in suspense and how it was somewhat dark. The plot is very well done. I also liked how Winston started as a Loyal to Big brother and then changed and joined the rebellion. The author allows your mind run wild with ideas of what is happening or will happen to Winston. I really liked how the author actually made you think that it is possible for out government turn out like this or maybe already headed that way.I would recommend this book to anyone who likes sci-fi books and dark adventures and mysteries."},{"Title":"1984","review":"First off it was a great book, and i wanted to say something to Sheri that lives in Grennsboro,north Carolina, when you said that George Orewell needed to stop writing books i almost crapped my pants because he has stoped because he is DEAD stupid!Anyways it was a great book and you should read it. It makes you think about what our country could have been like if we made the wrong choices or lost a war."},{"Title":"1984","review":"I finally got round to reading this 'classic', and I must say I wasn't too disappointed, as up until now I've disliked nearly all the so called classics I've read. The first two parts of the book are largely mediocre- Orwells writing style has never really been particularly special and the world and characters he depicts are somewhat clumsy.It is only upon reading the final part of the novel that this book rises above the crowd, as Orwell firmly clarifies the message of the book, not only depicting the true horror of an omnipotent dictatorship, but also the systematic manipulation of information and fact to it's ultimate extreme. This latter point has tremendous relevance as it does occur in western societies, hence in America words such as 'liberal' have had their meaning altered by the media to the point at which they become non descriptive, merely remaining as a form of abuse. This use of language manipulation is revealed in the book to be the final step in ultimate control- to manipulate peoples actual ability to think.The book does leave the reader with much to ponder, and indeed many will take different messages away from it, though I must admit how anyone who has read the whole book can go away thinking that it was merely a straight forward attack on communism, is beyond me. Left, right and centre poltics are all capable of using the methods warned against in this book, and have all done so to a certain degree.Overall, well worth reading."},{"Title":"1984","review":"George Orwell wrote a classic novel, 1984, which was, at the time, science fiction. It was a look into a forbidding totalitarian future. The enemy was Communism.After the inevitable nuclear war, the world has been divided into three sectors. The sectors are at continual war with each other, necessitating severe restrictions on personal freedoms. London is capital of the sector of Oceania. Here, Winston Smith is a clerk, working for \\"Big Brother,\\" the media-hyped totalitarian dictator who keeps a close watch on all of his subjects. One can almost hear him saying, \\"If you are talking on the phone with someone from another sector, we want to know.\\"When Winston discovers a little personal freedom, he is amazed. Delving further, he carries on a love affair. But this is all forbidden. Officials try to brainwash him into giving up his free will, using torture, sleep deprivation, and psychology (finding out what he fears most). Finally they make up give up not only his free will, but his reason. The interrogator holds up two fingers and gets Winston to say he is holding up three fingers.One can hear the chilling line in today's world: \\"Winston, tell me about how we can cut taxes for the rich, and cut benefits for the poor. That is only justice, right, Winston?\\"They work on his girlfriend the same way. And they pit one against the other until their loyalties are to Big Brother alone.The book was also an admonition against the Nazi dictum that if you repeat a lie loud enough and often enough it becomes the truth. We are making progress on the war in Iraq, aren't we Winston? Or is it the war in Vietnam? I forget. You should forget.As early as the 1960's Charles Colson was raising his technique of \\"mind f**king\\" to an art form. As documented in David Halberstam's book, The Best and the Brightest, when Colson became a White House operative he put his method to work full time in the service of the almost imperial president. To some, it looked like 1984, spying on the anti-war demonstrators. And people still remembered Orwell's novel. Of course, Colson went to jail for his role in Watergate. Watergate? What was that? I forget.Now, in the post-9/11 world, we need strict curtailment of free will. After all, we are in an unending war with terrorism. We have periodic episodes of the \\"three minute hate,\\" to vilify Osama bin Laden, or Ayman al Zawahiri, or some other \\"evil-doer.\\" The White House spokesman will give us all the details we need to know about warrantless wire-tapping. Or, perhaps, the House will just change the law that makes this type of surveillance illegal.We all have cameras on our computers that we could hook up so that Big Brother could watch us all the time. We like surveillance cameras. They make us feel safe. At least, since they put that rat mask over my face, I've been convinced that I like surveillance cameras. They make me feel safe.You can read this book if you like, but whatever you do, don't take it out of a library.Buy it."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Certainly not a book for high school kids (I wish teachers were assigning more age-appropriate books). I first read it at 17, and that was too early. One of the greatest masterpieces of world literature. The book is too complex and multi-faceted to be discussed here. Indeed, it is like a Rorschach test - everyone finds something of oneself in it, or projects on it something that is not there. I would just like to correct some gross misinterpretations.1) This is not a prediction. Maybe Orwell should've called it &quot;Any year&quot;. The year 1984 came up simply because he took the number of the year when he was writing (1948) and reversed the last two digits. This book is not a prediction, it is a warning and a description.2) This is not a satire or an exaggeration. OK, maybe to a small extent (governments still cannot read people's thoughts). It is certainly not a fiction about a made-up world and it is not just a philosophical musing on life and humanity. While to the people in the West it might sound exaggerated or absurd, to those from the Communist world it is very precise and factual. Orwell is the only Western writer who got a true description of totalitarian communist reality. He got it perfect down to tiny details, such as the absence of razor blades.3) This is certainly about Communists, but it is more than just about Communists. By the time he wrote it, Orwell was not a communist any more. He was not a Trotskyite (in Animal Farm Trotsky/Snowball is just as much a pig as Stalin/Napoleon). He was not a socialist or an anarchist. He was an individual beyond labels. 1984 is a book about totalitarianism in whatever form and under whatever label.4) This is not about all of us. One has to make distinctions. Modern U.S. is far from an Orwellian society, surveilance cameras and political correctness nonwithstanding and whatever paranoids might think. Most of the newspeak in the West is self-imposed: people prefer to be blind slaves. Should one of us desire to break their personal mental chains, doublethinks, etc., who is there to stop us? But there are some countries that are indeed Orwellian. A short list:a) Peoples Republic of Korea (North Korea) - the most Orwellian of them all.b) Burma. Sorry, Myanmar (they renamed the country, just like in &quot;1984&quot;, England is renamed into Airstrip One).c) Afghanistan - dictatorship in the making. (&quot;1984&quot; plus civil war).d) Islamic Republic of Iran.e) Libya.f) Peoples Republic of China. &quot;Ministry of Plenty&quot; might be closed there, but &quot;Ministry of Love&quot; is certainly not. This country alone is 1/4 of humanity: how about that.g) Iraq.h) Syria.i) Cuba.j) Vietnam.Plus most of Africa and quite a few other places. Plus all kinds of cults. As you see, the book is still quite relevant. It describes what was and is. Be grateful that you don't live there."},{"Title":"1984","review":"George Orwell, whose real name was Eric Blair, was nearly alone amongst British socialists in his ability to see through the socialist rhetorical fog and saw that Russia's Stalin was not a socialist but an anti-socialist tyrant. George Orwell was to British socialism what Robert Higgs is to American conservatism. Higgs can see through the propaganda and information warfare propagated by the British sleeper cell in Washington and he sees George W. Bush as the anti-American, anti-conservative monstrous tyrant that he is.Orwell, who worked for the BBC during World War II and was therefore quite familiar with the state's disinformation methods in support of information warfare, could see right through Stalin's disinformation as easily as Higgs can see through Bush's today. Bothersome to Orwell was his fellow socialists refusal to see the truth on Stalin or that Soviet Communism was actually a betrayal of socialism. Orwell wrote \\"Animal Farm\\" just to make this point. Yet too many socialists remained duped over Stalin just as too many conservatives remain duped today by George W. Bush and his army of word-pushers.So Orwell set out to write \\"1984\\" to explain to us how people are duped by statist techniques of information warfare; how people can believe \\"WAR IS PEACE\\"; and how socialists were duped by Stalin. He drew heavily upon his experiences at the BBC where he had signed the Official Secrets Act barring him from mentioning anything he had done. So he set the novel in the future and maintained that any similarities were pure coincidence in order to cover himself from being charged with violating the Official Secrets Act.In 1984, there is a dreary monotony of provision in society rather than a vibrant free market; the heavy hand of the state has stunted everything. Food is bland and often rationed. Technical innovations are controlled by the state; two-way wall-sized televisions spy on people; the Thought Police (a futuristic version of Homeland Security, or is it vice-versa?) monitors thoughtcrime. Hidden microphones add to their NSA-like arsenal of state control and state terrorism.The novel's main character is Winston Smith - nearly forty and one of the few remaining humans that can remember having parents, who had sacrificed their lives to the state so that the youthful Winston may have a chance at life. He works for the State as a wordpusher, rewriting current events and even history books - turning history into \\"his story\\". Yet, he is society's few remaining yet hidden libertarians - a person who thinks and feels for himself. Watched always, he must remain on guard to never betray any emotion.The plot centers around Winston meeting a female supporter of the Party whose hidden agenda is much more hedonistic. They have a relationship between them, at the risk of all. In fact, they know their relationship is doomed and their actions to be suicidal. The heavy weight of the state looming over their heads is tragic. Like an Iraqi or Afghan today, they never know when the crushing weight of the state will descend.In the end, the state catches up with the two individualists. They are arrested and sent to a type of Guantanamo Bay where Winston is finally broken by his fear of rats - \\"Do it to Julia! Do it to Julia! Not me! Julia! I don't care what you do to her. . . Not me! Julia! Not me!\\". Winston lost his love for Julia - his ability to sacrifice himself on behalf of another. Yet through sacrifice lies our hope.Pynchon's Foreward is awesome: \\"This grouping of Britain and the United States into a single bloc, as prophecy, has turned to be dead-on\\", he wrote. Actually, Orwell probably knew something about the British sleeper cell dispatched to Washington to pull America back into the second part of the world war. Orwell probably knew, too, that FDR provoked the Japanese to hit Pearl Harbor and sat on his hands while they did it, so that the Yanks would become war crazy and provide the brawn to British empire (which they did). Nicholas John Cull's \\"Selling War\\" is a good review of the British sleeper cell.Today, Bush and Blair are doing American-powered British empire hand-in-hand. An American can only wonder what George Washington would say?!! But I wonder, too, what Orwell would say? Or has he already said it?!!"},{"Title":"1984","review":"George Orwell's 1984 is a thought provoking novel about a future which we were fortunate to escape...or did we? I enjoyed this novel not because of the storyline itslef, but rather because of the theories and ideas brought forth by the story. Orwell writes of a man named Winston, his girlfriend Julia, and their boss/confidant O'Brien, in the future continent of Oceana. Oceana is constantly at war with one or both of the two other super-countries, Eurasia and Eastasia. 1984 is the tale of two people struggling for independence and freedom in a country where the government controls everything down to our very thoughts. Winston and Julia set out to change the way things are, or at least try, but after only scratching the surface of the true reasons behind the way things are, they find that the government, \\"Big Brother\\", has powers reaching far deeper than they ever could have imagined."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Isn't it eerie how the Patriot Act could have come straight out of this masterpiece? Don't we have people in jails right now in Gitmo, people who have been detained for no legal reason, except they might be &quot;terrorists?&quot; Doesn't the government now have the right to tap our phones and spy on us without a court order (a la Big Brother)? Many people thought this book was silly when the actual 1984 came and went without this apocalyptic vision becoming reality. However, 20 years later, you can't read this classic without getting a familiar chill down your spine as a &quot;president&quot; tries to find imaginary weapons while seemingly rewriting history? If any English teacher wants to assign this book in 2003, they can find plenty of real world parallels to it, which should get the kiddies' attention!!!!"},{"Title":"1984","review":"So powerful and yet still so relevant. Shows you power of independent thought."},{"Title":"1984","review":"1984 offers a brilliant foreshadowing of the world we are coming to. The inhabitants of Airstrip One, or London, are constantly under the watchful eye of Big Brother, the semi-divine and metaphorical leader of the party. All citizens of Oceania, one of three superpowers in the world (the other two being Eastasia and Eurasia) worship Big Brother. The slogans of the party are War is peace, Freedom is slavery, and Ignorance is strength. You can see all of these things in today's America. George Bush told the nation that he was entering into a very long term war that would lead to peace in the middle east. Sound familiar? Meanwhile, the government, in order to ultimately protect our rights, has passed bills such as the Patriot Act, which allows the government to tap into our phone conversations and even enter and search our homes without a warrant. This clearly and directly infringes on our fourth amendment rights, which states \\"The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause...\\" And in today's society, there is certain knowledge that the general public is better off not knowing about. Who knows what the government is really up to? But if the general public knew all of the coverups the government has committed over the decades, the nation would panic and riot. The three slogans of the party, as predicted by George Orwell are very true today.The citizens of Oceania all believe in the party and in its slogans. They all wear blue overalls and conform to the party's principles. Much of the book is a shot at communism. This is evident in the fact that there are no laws in Oceania, yet you can be put to death for exercising free speech. Here Orwell was attempting to point out the hypocrisy of communism, the whole idea of \\"do your own thing, but only within what your comrades limit you to,\\" and I think he succeeded.In Airstrip One, there are four ministries which are the headquarters of the party. They are the Ministry of Love, the Ministry of Truth, the Ministry of Peace, and the Ministry of Plenty. One of the main principles of the party, Doublethink, is in full effect here. Doublethink is the practice in which someone simultaneaously believes two contradictory things for the benefit of the party. It is a common practice for any party loyalist. This applies to the ministries because they each concern themselves with just the opposite of their names. Love with torture,truth with lying,peace with war, and plenty with poverty. A loyalist must be able to practice doublethink because often times the party will state two contradictory things both as truth, and you must believe everything the party says. Doublethink is a fundamental practice of a partymember.But there is one man in the book who does not conform to this way of life. His name is Winston Smith. All through his life,he knew something was wrong with the way the world was. He would try to think back to when the world wasn't like this but he could never remember it. He knew that the party was not infallible as was the common belief. He stood and cheered at the news of a victory by the Oceanian army, but his heart was never in it. He thought he was alone.Then he met a young woman. He hated her because of her party pride. She proudly wore her Junior-Anti sex league sash and imploded at the sight of Emmanuel Goldstein, the leader of an association of anti-party advocates. But after a while he finds that she's not what she seems...Ok. If you're still reading this, which you're probably not, I'm not going to give away any more. But I strongly suggest that everyone read this book. It not only got me way into politics and the Libertarian cause for individual freedom, but it changed my life.

I hope that some sanity is also metered out in the process.After being a futures author, investor, and broker for the past 11 years, one of the glaring points in the book is how statistical data is constantly being modified and rewritten to serve who will benefit from the moment.

Its one of those books that you finish reading and you just cant stop thinking about. \\"What's for dinner?\\" \\"Who cares, I just read 1984, food's not important.\\" Its unpredictable, its innovative and creative, and its captivating; all while making very good political points.

I feel that I lack the writing skills to fully summarize Orwell's masterpiece. I also feel I lack the ability to write a review about this book without hitting every possible cliche used to describe it, such as it being &quot;Orwell's masterpiece&quot; or that &quot;1984 is as timely now then it was then.&quot;It's odd, though, that my school never had me read this book. It's that book my teachers would always mention, but never put it in the curriculum. It really is a long read and I know that students today would object to that. And hell, in school I barely read, so I'd definitely object to it. But this year I've been struck with a burning desire to read, and read I have.I'm not going to elaborate what this book is about, since it's pretty well known. Even I had a basic idea of the plot years before I read it.All I can say is it's the most captivating book I've read. Never have I felt such empathy for the protagonists of the book, nor ever felt such hatred for the antagonists. The ending really brought out my emotions. Meaning, I didn't put it down and go &quot;Oh, it's over.&quot; I put it down and said &quot;Why is it over?&quot;It's a beautifully written book. I don't think we'll ever have another author like Orwell, who's hatred of dictatorships and oppressive regimes and hypocrisy was poured into his two most famous novels, Animal Farm and 1984."},{"Title":"1984","review":"[...] As for Orwell, I recommend &quot;Keep the Aspidistra Flying&quot; more highly than &quot;1984&quot;. But if you must read something dreary, Kafka is more profound and more imaginative (in my opinion).nston believes that there is another man who believes that the party is a fraud, his name is O?Brian. He helps them join into the brotherhood. The only problem with all of this is that they are all being watched and heard by the telescreens that are set up everywhere. The party has set up divisions within themselves to stop such things as thought crimes, and other things. Anything could give you away may it be a twitch, or your heart beats too fast. The type of conflict in the story is person vs. society; it is Winston and some of his friends against the world. I think that this book is really good and shows some of the conflicts that we face in our own lives today. Sometimes we feel like we want to get away from it all, but we are still being watched. We still end up finding places that we think are safe to speak our minds and safe to act as we wish but find that we are still being watched and being seen. In the book Winston and Julia think that they have found the perfect place to be alone and do as they please but find that they are still not by themselves, they are still watched which is the cause of there downfall. The book showed a relation to Christianity because of the fact that there was a higher power that no one could see or touch, but all felt was there. The Big Brother character of the book is like a god to the people of London in the story. Winston and Julia are the ones who feel like the party has too many rules and cannot be tolerated. Just like in life, a lot of people feel that Christianity has too many rules and is too overpowering. Christianity is a force like the party, it will never be defeated, and it will always be there. In the book Winston feels like the proletarians (common people outside the party) are the only ones who could defeat the party. I think the proletarians are like us, we just accept Christianity and do not question it. We figure that God is a force that should not be reckoned with so we do not object to it. Only a few people think that Christianity is untrue like how Winston feels about the party. 1984 was written in a 3rd person point of view and in a very descriptive point of view. I would give this book a rating of eight on a scale of one-ten, one being the highest and ten being the lowest. It showed how life could have been in 1984, although almost none of the things were accurate it still showed the conflicts of life, and the conflicts of trying to be different. I recommend this book to any one from twelve to any age over that. It is a tough book to read because of all the in depth description of everything but should be read by everyone."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Eric Blair's 1984 is not only his finest work but also one of the most influential and provocative books of our time. The work obviates to us to full actuality how the world had evolved for the worse during the dark period from 1932 to 1949. Winston Smith and O'Brien are the most important characters whose keystone dialogue raises alert for the prospect of human future.Prophecy or Caution?While we might prefer to interpret \\"1984\\" as a precautionary tale or some social warning, bloodshed, warfare, massive torture and murder, not to mention Stalin's cruelty, the Nazi mechanized techniques of organized massacre, the Cambodian, the Iranian and the Iraqi, the North Korean, and all the other countless horrors, have inevitably to a certain degree changed \\"1984\\" from caution to warning, further elevating the work to a 20th century prophecy.Despair about Future of ManA sense of hopelessness about the future of man hovers over the book. In a way \\"1984\\" is an expression of such a hopeless mood about the bleak future of man. It warns readers that unless the course of history (and leaderships) changes men all over the world will forfeit most of their human qualities and become soulless automatons without being aware of the depravity.In the Winston Smith-O'Brien dialogue, \\"Imagine a boot stamping on the human face-forever\\" might have exaggerated the current state of human soulness. The 20th century history has confirmed and fulfilled dehumanized practices as mentioned in \\"1984\\" like 24/7 surveillance of all sounds, activities, and conversations; deprivation of freedom of speech, penitence for thought crime and wiping out of existence and memory and thus forfeiting any way to make appeal to future. For example, a Party member lived from birth to death under the eye of the Thought Police. Even when he was alone he could never be sure he was alone. Wherever he may be, he could be inspected without warning and without knowing that he was being inspected.The Party tacitly encouraged prostitution as such outlets for instincts that could not be altogether suppressed. This unforgivable crime was promiscuity between Party members in order to remove all pleasure from sexual act. Even to his wife, a Party member was expected to have no private emotions and no respites from enthusiasm. A real romantic love affair was all it took to crumple the Party. Desire was deemed thought crime, which entailed death.The Party saw that it was not infallible and that all its belief rested on the omnipotent Big Brother. It therefore called for an unwearying, moment-to-moment flexibility in the treatment of facts-alteration of the past and rewrite of history in order to wipe out existence of certain human beings and historical facts. It was not merely that speeches, statistics, and records of every kind must be constantly brought up to date in order to show that the predictions of the Party were in all cases accurate. It was also that no change of doctrine or in political alignment could ever be admitted. Whatever the Party held to be truth was truth. It was impossible to see reality except by looking through the eyes of the Party.Notwithstanding the Party contrived to have its way and imbued the belief in people, how could the Party control people's memory? The Party had wiped out most of the older generation during the great purges and the few who survived had long ago been terrified into complete intellectual surrender (sounds familiar like the Chinese Cultural Revolution?) When memory failed and written records were falsified, the claim of the Party to have improved the conditions of human life had got to be accepted, because there did not exist, and never again could exist, any standard against which it could be tested.\\"1984\\" is meant to be read as a warning, an exhortation, and not so much prophesy. However exaggerated and haunting the negative utopia is being depicted, the book is a startling work of an imaginary world that is convincing. 4.0 stars.2004 (4)"},{"Title":"1984","review":"1984 is indeed one of the best books I have read, its a books that got you thinking about the events happening around you and getting you to arrive to your own conclusions. I do not think that a long continnous read is desired for this book, its a book that should be read in smaller sections and then *absorbed*, rather then in a long contineous run which in the end the reader fails to grasp the smaller more important details of the book.In visiting literary post boards, and from people's reactions in school (high school that is), I have noticed many people fail to see the clear difference between Bigbrother-ism and communism.Is Communism the same thing as Bigbrother-ism? To be frank, the answer would be an stern no.If you have paid enough attention to Emmanuel Goldstein's essay on &quot;War is Peace&quot; (chapter 3 of Goldstien's book) you should have noticed that the constant warfare is support by the government of the 3 powers (Oceania, Eurasia and Eastasia) because without constant warfare a hierarchical society would cease to exist! The goal of communism is certainly not the existance of a hierachical socieity, but rather the elimnation of one.Stalinism, Maoism and perhaps even Leninism is not true communism, but a distorted version of communism, Stalinism, one can honestly say, is something that resmbles Bigbrother-ism. The constant warfare, as explained by Goldstein, is to prevent the build up of WEALTH in the general people. If WEALTH was evenly distrubuted, then POWER would be impossible to remain to a small privileged elite, therefore in order to have power, warfare is needed to take away wealth from the people and spent on military purposes. Therefore, one would be utterly mistaken to think of communism (the word &quot;commune&quot; as base) as the same thing as Bigbrother-ism.What Orwell offers us in 1984 is not something completely fantastic but very much likely to occur in the near future. Keeping secrets from the general masses, lies and propganda and the distoration of certain truths exists in all of the powerful &quot;democratic&quot; states. Orwell's Big brother simply goes a step beyond the conventional control and offers us a view of extreme control, in which only a small amount of people actually notices it. Rather, the general mass accepts it and whole-heartedly welcomes it (same as some of the general masses today), a very horrific thing to see.All in all, Orwell's book offers us a great, relavent story and desveres to be read by all who has an interest in our political future."},{"Title":"1984","review":"This is a great book. The book is full of suspense, you never really know what is going to happen next. It is also scary that someone would predict the future to be so negative and it is even worse that some things in the book are actually happening today. The author really brings the to life book by using good diction. Overall, I immensely enjoyed this book and I believe it is a must read for all people."},{"Title":"1984","review":"1984 is probably the most bonechilling novel I have ever read. It isn't even a cheap thriller either. A true testiment of the reality of human nature and that of the future. I cried at parts.

I would also like to say that you shouldn't read this book to young or you will be shocked and you will also not fully understand it."},{"Title":"1984","review":"In light of our current climate, a totalitarian government, the ministry of truth, newspeak, doublethink and the thought police seem chillingly real and not too far removed from our present circumstance. Inspite of the stark, cold, lonely world which Orwell warns us about,Winston, the main charecter shows us the real strength and ultimate weakness of human nature.It is a strong thought provoking and yet extremely touching work of genius.This is one of those books, which you will want to read again and againAs Orwell said &quot;during times of universal deceit, telling the truth becomes a revolutionary act&quot;"},{"Title":"1984","review":"George Orwell wrote 1984 to show us his grim view on what shape life would take by the year 1984. Orwell not only wrote about the world of the future, but also stood out by writing his idea of the supremely successful, and everlasting government, the anti-Utopia. Within the story Orwell created the Brother Hood, an evil organization with advanced technology and the desire for power, even at the expense of sanity. Winston, the main character of the story, is a comrade under the Brother Hood. He turns out to be quite the odd man out, since Winston is always seeking for some sort of salvation from the evil grasp of the Brother Hood. Since the Brother Hood watches everyone in Oceania, the country Winston lives in, twenty-four hours a day through two-way telescreens, all personal and social lives of its countrymen are eliminated. The Brother Hood skillfully takes apart all connections between its citizens, leaving them weak and alone, also preventing them from rebellious organization. The Brother Hood destroyed the bonds between family members by instilling pure fear, the fear that your spouse, or even your child will turn you in for thought crime. To commit a thought crime, it would have to appear that your mind is thinking in some way that is opposing the Brother Hood and Big Brother's, the supreme ruler of the Brother Hood, bests interests. This is the Brother Hoods way of controlling what you think; giving them the power to break a man's sanity, and mold him in any way they please. This society formed as the anti-Utopia has one advantage over other ruling parties, it does not promise love and equality for its citizens in the end, but sets forth to create hate, separation, and total inequality among people, making their rule everlasting and indestructible."},{"Title":"1984","review":"_Yeah. So I was bored. I picked this book up and read it cover to cover.When I finished, I was sortof angry, to be truthful. I was mad at the author when I read the ending. I wanted, y'know, a black-and-white storybook-type finale and was pissed when it didn't come. Yup.But after my temper had cooled and I pitched a couple pillows around the room (not literally, whaddya think I am, insane?), I sat down to think about what the author was trying to say with his book. And now I am really happy with the way he concluded the tale. Yeah, I know. I sound like one of those annoying English Teachers with their \\"What does this Symbolize\\" questions (no offense to all you teachers out there).But seriously. This book reminded me of all that BullS*** propaganda pervading countries around the world - And YES, that includes the US. The \\"Big Brother is Watching You\\" that runs throughout Orwell's book reminds me a bit of good ol' Uncle Sam, y'know? Which is kinda freaky.Anywho. READ THIS BOOK!! You can yell at me afterwards if ya didn't like it, but give it a chance. PLEASE!! I disagree with these (*cough* STUPID *cough*) critics writing on Amazon who are saying that only old folks will like this book. WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO SAY?!? I'm 15 and I liked it. What am I saying... I didn't like it... I -L-O-V-E-D- it! I'm a highschooler (we tend to have short attention spans sometimes).GIVE THE BOOK A TRY!!! for me?

It follows the life of Winston Smith, who edits history to serve \\"the Party\\" and its needs. THe Party controls every aspect in peoples' lives, watching and listening as much as possible. Nonetheless, Winston begins a love affair with a co-worker, knowing only too well the ramifications of doing so. 1984 also provides some interesting insights about how weak memory when compared to facts, or what everybosy says are facts. A true classic of 20th Century Literature."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Orwell's 1984 is one of the sharpest, cruelest and smartest books ever written. It critisezes the communist idiology, the way it was practiced in the former USSR. Although in those days few people outside Russia knew the horrors of life under Stalin's regume, Orwell draws the most correct picture of this life. Once a communist himself, he is not afraid to talk harshly of the ideas he once supported.But the book isn't about the Soviet regime in particulare, it's about dictatorships of any kind, that's what makes him very relevant today. An interesting plot and a tasteful touch of sarcasm."},{"Title":"1984","review":"I read this book in 1954 when 1984 was thirty years in the future.The book scared the hell out of me. But I kept re-reading it. The other day, I sat down and opened this book again.It still scares the hell out of me.Democracy and the free market are such sweet pastries. Freedom of thought is like the first zip of coffee with the first bite of the chocolate donut.This novel is cold and chilling. It has no warm fuzzies to soften the blow. This is serious stuff. George Orwell rang the alarm and it is still ringing.This is a nightmare lingering in the midnight moving shadows where your eyes don't want to go.1984 still lies creeping in the future, sleeping in the cold puddles in the dark nights just outside your window."},{"Title":"1984","review":"This book is about a society that doesn't exist. This society is evil and strict. In this world you have no privacy. Thinking is a crime. There is no freedom whatsoever.Winston Smith is the main character. He is the readers eye into this world. Luckily for you, he's a very interesting chap. This guy has a diary! That's not illegal, but it's punishable by death. Nothing is illegal. The government is called the Inner Party. These shady guys operate the whole society. The use strange techniques like doublethink. They can change the past.Big Brother is a major theme in this book. He's the scary face watching over everything. There are 4 ministries. The Ministry of Love deals with Hate. The Ministry of Peace deals with War. The Ministry of Plenty deals with the economy. The Ministry of Truth deals with news, entertainment, education, and the fine arts. These are all coined Minitrue, Minipax, Miniluv, and Miniplenty.This is a heart-wrenching book. It's very suspenseful. It's also unbelievable in some respects. Telescreens? Can you imagine being watched all the time? In the future it's possible. The unbelievable thing is that the government keeps changing the past. Smith is in this department. All he does is constantly change facts to suit Big Brother's agenda.The end of the book is frightening. If you haven't read 1984 and read everything above, I already gave you the main gist. Does that mean my little review substitutes the book? Of course not. There are many juicy parts I saved for you potential readers. The end is a really cool ending. There's also a little naughtiness, if you know what I mean.Anyway, 1984 is a book that I had to read for school. I was assigned a hundred pages. I thought that was a lot. It turned out that I finished the book ahead of schedule. Enough about me, I want you all to read this book. I think it's a book you shouldn't pass up. It may be the world in the future."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Let me tell you about one of my favorite books ever. The book is George Orwell's \\"1984.\\" It had been sitting on my bookshelf for several years but until recently I had deemed it too \\"boring\\" to read. It was only this summer, having nothing else to read in its stead that I began a full-hearted attempt to read this book.How wrong I was about its supposed dullness. By the first few pages I was hooked, trapped in the year 1984 as Winston Smith. I was unable to escape the ever-watchful eye of the telescreens that were in every room, watching every move I made, studying my face for any emotion that might flicker across it: unhappiness, anger, or anxiety. Never once during the whole book did I ever feel truly safe, as one might feel during a weekend or a vacation. That feeling that there is nothing to do but simply... relax, let loose all of your worries. Throughout the whole book I felt as though my nerves might break from the terrible strain of keeping my face devoid of any revealing emotion or feeling.That's half of the book; the feeling of hopelessness and depression that George Orwell masterfully weaves into his writing. The other half is the doomed world that his story takes place in. Never once throughout the whole book did I ever think to myself, \\"Well that could never happen,\\" or, \\"That's rather hard to believe.\\" The world that George Orwell masterfully created was completely, utterly, and... depressingly realistic.Even a few days after reading the book I felt the world to be small and bleak. I have a dream of becoming a great and revolutionary director, such as Francis Ford Coppola or Steven Spielberg. Yet how could anything I might accomplish, any change I might make to the world of film, matter if George Orwell's nightmare prophesy, or something similar to it, became a reality?Now, I consider this my one of my favorite books of all time. I would give it 500 stars if I could. It is my personal opinion that every person running for President should be required to read this book, to do whatever is possible to make the sure that the world of 1984 never comes into existence.Any people who liked this book (you rock!) might also enjoy, \\"A Canticle for Leibowitz,\\" \\"Watership Down,\\" \\"Starship Troopers,\\" \\"Bridge of Birds,\\" \\"Hyperion,\\" \\"Neverwhere,\\" His Dark Materials trilogy, and works by Howard Philips Lovecraft. There is no connection between 1984 and the books I just mentioned; these are simply some of my personal favorites and if you share my taste in books (way to go!) I would like to suggest them to you."},{"Title":"1984","review":"This is my first time writing a review, and i'm not going to bother writing a synopsis because other people before me have taken the liberty in doing so.

I think had I read it in high school - when the majority of readers experience it - I would have been more impressed. But reading it now, I was repeatedly struck by the book as anti-Communist propaganda. I feel that Orwell's decision to portray nothing as positive in this society is a major fault of the book. I think that what makes a dystopian society believable is that there exists some aspect that is highly appealing (absolute physical safety seems to be the most common tool). In the absence of anything good in the society, the reader is left to doubt the ability of such a regime to come to and maintain power.Additionally, I found the depiction of the proles as short-sighted and completely incapable of revolution to be insulting. I felt that Orwell's conclusion is that revolution can only be instigated by the elite, yet historically this has not been so.In respect to Winston's relationship with Julia, I bring my own bias. I simply find it unbelievable that love cannot withstand the pressure of a totalitarian society. Thus I found Winston's betrayal of Julia to be an unrealistic turn of events.Ultimately, I think that Orwell's mission to demonize Communism on all levels led him to make many seriously compromised choices in the book."},{"Title":"1984","review":"I find it very intimidating to review a well-known classic. I think since there is so much information on both the book and the author that I will just touch on a few of the concepts pervasive in the novel and, considering this is one of the daddies of dystopia, how the novel's presence has impacted literature as a whole.Big Brother is the ever-present leader of the party, staring at the citizens of Oceania wherever they go with the aide of telescreens. Winston, an employee of the Ministry, isn't really sure if Big Brother actually exists or if he's really even an actual entity. The point Orwell is making here is that the party is always watching and has complete control over its citizens' bodies and minds. As party members go higher up in the ranks, vagueness ensues until one realizes that no one really knows who is ruling the country.One of the most disturbing examples of the Party's mind control, and there are many, is illustrated in the description of Winston's job. His role within the party as propaganda officer is to alter official government publications in order for them to fit with the Party's official version of how events really went down. The Thought Police are constantly vigilant, searching out dissenters of the Party. They monitor citizens to the point where having a dissenting thought against the party is against the law and punishable.Inevitably, Winston becomes one of these disillusioned dissenters,and he is arrested and tortured for it. During his interrogation, his captors explain to him that he will be re-integrated, or brainwashed, back into the Party.The influence of Orwell's 1984 is indeed extensive; how many times have you heard someone describe something as \\"Orwellian\\"? Anthony Burgess wrote 1985, which was intended to be a sequel to Orwell's original work. In more recent work, Cory Doctorow's Little Brother directly references 1984's Big Brother, and Doctorow's main character, Marcus Yellow, is a direct reference to Winston Smith.I recognize this book's extreme importance in the field of dystopian literature, and I found parts of it to be truly terrifying. However, parts of the novel, especially the segment in which Winston read entire chapters of the underground opposition party's manual, moved very slowly and were very dry. I'm glad I've read it but will probably not revisit it."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Every American should read this book! It deeply touches the mind and heart! - Levin is brilliant!

I can count on one hand the books I've re-read in their entirety of my own volition, so that should tell you something about what I think of it.I'll resist the urge to draw current political parallels and just say that the way Orwell portrays how a collective autocracy intent on nothing but preserving its own dominance can erode individuality fascinates and terrifies me like little else I have ever encountered.

What follows is a description of the triumph of human depravity. The government, which seeks power for its own sake, destorys any human relationship that can be interpreted as a conflict of loyalty. Everybody must be made to love Big Brother, even if the cost of this love is the loss of dignity, freedom, and common sense. Based on Stalinist Russia, Orwell's novel certainly has broader implications and is a warning against complacently accepting what is being presented to us as real by the powers that be.The book starts slowly. Orwell tries to set an ominous mood for his readers. Unfortunately, Orwell is best when he does not try to write around too much and goes straight to the point. So I recommend that you press on, even if at the outset the book is not terribly exciting. You won't find many characters in this book, but those you do find are done pretty well by Orwell. The thrust of the book is, of course, social and political. It makes you think. For example, why can't something like this really happen, let's say in 2084? The answer to this, in my opinion, is not simple. Orwell gave us a warning. We would be fools not to heed it."},{"Title":"1984","review":"This book caught my attention by the first paragraph. I had HUGE trouble putting it down. The only thing that got me to put it down was the fact that I wanted it to last! This is by far the best book I've ever read. George Orwell put great thought into every aspect of this book. The most amazing thing is the technology that he accurately predicted like the SpeakWrite (program in which you speak into a microphone, and it types up what you're saying).If you like this book, you will probably like Clockwork Orange, and vise versa. They both have reminitions of Communism ruling the world (which was a great fear and quite controversial idea for that time), and they both have new languages, brutal police, and strong governments.My only warning, is that this book contains parts that can depress the easily depressable (like myself). So read it, and enjoy!"},{"Title":"1984","review":"1984 excellently depicts a negative utopia, a world in which government is everything and everywhere, and individuality means nothing. A man named Winston rises up to find the truth and to see through the government coverups. Since the government is so allpowerful and corrupt, it allows such people as Winston to rise up just for the joy of crushing them and turning them into mindless believers. 1984 is like the other great negative utopias, Brave New World and Farenheit 451, because in all books the governemnt controls all aspects of life. However, Brave New World uses material pleasures such as the drug somna to control it's citizens, Farenheit 451 burns books to keep it's citizens ignorant, and 1984 uses fear. In 1984 there are thought-police, people who can see you at any time through TVs, even in your own home. They would arrest those who would even just made 'face crime,' or not supporting the government even through just one upset glance. These three books are very exciting and while these futures may or may not be happen, it shows us that the human spirit will always strive for knowledge and individualism, even against impossible odds."},{"Title":"1984","review":"A wake up call!!

Today we stand at the brink of a technological society where the political levers of control and surveillance are far beyond Orwell's darkest imaginings. All that prevents their implementation is the political calculus of the time. As Jerry Furland has shown so vividly in the novel &quot;Transfer&quot; the systems already exist to enslave each of us. We are left wondering when, not if, the political will to execute the final transfer to a new Utopia will occur. This is the dilemma of our modern age."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Possibly only equalled by Brave New World, 1984 is a dystopia which unfalteringly relays the full horror of dictatorship and social manipulation to the reader. This magnificent novel has an almost perfect structure - Orwell has so delicately considered not only how this society could arise (offering detailed explinations of new social &quot;super powers&quot; and how dominace and political power could be successfully sustained), but why. His successful attempt to offer the reader a philiosophy of the nature of humankind, eventually distilled to the nature of power, draws some disturbing, horrific conclusions. Orwell's philosophy is that man dominates simply for the sake of power - the only, unchallenged reason. His unsettling final symbol of the new order - a man's face being crshed by a boot - is a symbol not only of totalitarianism, but of political human misery, and all it's destructive connotations. An extremely disturbing novel which must be read"},{"Title":"1984","review":"There are three novels I recommend to everyone, especially adolescents, to encourage critical thinking. These are Orwell's '1984', Rand's 'Anthem' (or 'Atlas Shrugged' if you have the time) and Huxley's 'Brave New World.' Orwell's vision of a totalitarian regime ruling its people under a microscope through propaganda and punishment is unfortunately realistic. It is also extremely well written. It is not chance that the symbolic \\"Big Brother\\" is so often referenced, feared, and loathed. Orwell christened a phenomenon: the increasingly observant eye of authority. The illustrative crushing of the human spirit is heart wrenching to bear witness to, but stands as a reminder of the value of our liberty. This is a must read for the freethinking individual."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Even if some people disagree with me, I will say this is one of the best books you can read. Everyone must read this book, it has the power to change your beliefs about the world.1984 goes deep to show you what the world COULD be like if a ruling party did all the right things to gain complete control over the populace. Your daily life monitored continuously, no rights to show individuality or freedom of speech, and constant fear of being whiped clean off the world if you did anything not in accordance with the Party, also known as Big Brother.I sure hope something like this doesn't happen to us any time soon, not until I build my rocket ship to go to Mars and live in a cave.I would certainly recommend this book to you, for only 300 pages it is some good reading."},{"Title":"1984","review":"I read George Orwell's classic 1984 in High School, as a summer reading project. I still have that dog-eared and worn book sitting somewhere in my library, and I refer to it or quote from it quite often. It is haunting and horrifying. I both love it and hate it; in many ways, I believe that is the reaction Orwell wanted a reader to have when he or she put down the book, having read those four, final words (for those who've read the book, and understand it, you know exactly what I mean). I remember asking a friend of mine in that high school what books she had read for the summer. 1984 was on her list as well, and she hated it: she claimed it was depressing, that it was too dark, too dismal. That she didn't think it could happen. To that idea, and to others who would argue the same thing, I say that it is SUPPOSED to be dark, and depressing, and dismal. It is supposed to horrify you, to grab you and tear you from one revelation to the next, and to finally make you realize, through the conversion of the most average man in the world (Winston Smith, the protaganist), that any person in the world can be made into a machine, and learn to love it.(...)One can walk away from this book with many different feelings on it: Orwell's predictions and fears leave a reader with so many ways of interpreting his prose. One can, and should, be horrified and sick to one's stomach at Smith's surrender to blissful ignorance. Personal freedom and thought, sex, love, honor, and hope are all crushed beneath a government that wants to reduce humanity to worker ants. The Party promises a future in the image of a boot stamping on a human face for all eternity. Reading this book, one immedietly begins to look upon the rest of the world, and begins to see how dangerously close to Orwell's fears humanity has come.Wonderfully written, with incredible complexity (he did, after all, make up his very own language--NEWSPEAK-- to prove his points), and full of imagery that only furthers the sense of hopelessness and hollowness that makes up the theme of the book, this book is simply incredible. Love it. Hate it. Fear it. Read it. It is, without question, one of the great classics of the 20th Century."},{"Title":"1984","review":"1984 is an awesome book! It changed my life.

Yawn. 1984 is the frightening tale of a future gone awry, and a brutal government well aware of its intention to maintain power at all cost.We follow Winston, an editor with an odd job, rewriting history. Wiston is forced to &quot;double think&quot; his way through a life he knows is contrived to forever remain stagnant.As Winston ponders the present, the war weary remains of Oceania's capital, London, he is forced to deal with memories of a very different past - and he fails to reconcile the two.Orwell's eye is a magic thing. A reporter at heart, his eye for detail in fiction and reportage is awesome. While reading 1984, one feels Orwell IS Winston, in his head and in his world. With any imagination it becomes easy to allow 1984 to become real, and Winston's desperation your own.Orwell side steps silly sci-fi detail (that dopey Huxley embraces too readily. What is it with all the helicopters in &quot;Brave New World,&quot; anyway?)and creates a desperate world that, though written 50 years ago, seems perfectly plausible now.This chilling masterpiece is a must read for anyone who ponders the delicate balance of power and politics. More so, this dark tome considers the loss of individuality in an increasing global society. At first blush, it is easy to dismiss 1984 as completely off the mark, but after some consideration, one is forced to concede that maybe nothing here is really improbably.A must read."},{"Title":"1984","review":"This is THE most depressing book I have ever read.

Too many on the left are still hellbent in plunging us into a worldwide Orwellian nightmare. Just observe their obsessive Orwellism, where aggressors are defenders and defenders are aggressors, where justice is injustice and injustice is justice, where war is peace and peace is war, where freedom fighters are terrorists and terrorists are freedom fighters, and with its total lack of interest in facts and truth. Despite the chilling socio-political warning the book still shows us an endearingly poignant portrayal of humanity and love struggling to survive in totalitarian society which will not stop at anything to stamp out all that is good and compassionate. Next time you hear anyone refer to anything disparagingly as 'borgeois' think of the alternative to love,honour,fair play and all the noble things that some brand 'bourgeois' and therefore plan to destroy"},{"Title":"1984","review":"The book takes the manifestation of totalitarianism to the worst imaginable degree. George Orwell described a world where people are constantly under surveillance by its totalitarian government. By employing two-way televisions and police in civilian clothes, the government monitors people's behavior, deed, and most frighteningly - their minds. No individualism is permitted, and anyone who remotely opposes the government will somehow be caught and completely distroyed.The idea of the book is as far-fetched as it is realistic. That's what's so haunting about the book. The described totalitarian practices may seem absolutely impossible, while when compared to the world we live in, we see more eerie resemblences than not. Moreover, the writing itself was splendid. The descriptions were so vivid that you literally feel yourself a persecuted citizen of the world described.On the negative end, perhaps in an effort to accentuate the point of atrocity of the negative utopia described, the author employed too much descriptions and time on the actual persecution process. The descriptions were grotesque at some points that you really have to have the stomach for it. My advice is, read it, but read it in small dosages. I read the second half of the book in one day, and was gravely depressed for three hours after I finished."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Growing up, I didn't read many books purely out of interest (most were school-assigned), but 1984 is one of the first I ever chose to read. I could not put it down. So much more than a fantasy or a sci-fi tale, it is so real. It says the ironic truths that governments throughout history were afraid to admit. Containing a language within a language (Newspeak) and a book within a book (Goldstein's book), I can't possibly regard anyone as being a literary genius above Orwell. He plays with readers' minds, turns truths inside out, and turns paradoxes into perfect sense like no one else. Reading this book will make you a lot less naive about the world. After reading 1984 and Animal Farm, I will surely read everything else Orwell has written too."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Orwell continues to grow in my heart and to be one of my all-time favorite writers, both because and in spite of this dark, dystopian masterpiece. It was definitely long overdue that I read this, and I am glad I did. Along with Animal Farm, this is considered his most noteworthy book. It is a scathing attack on authoritarian thinking and government, in which the reader is put in the middle of a bizarre and horrible totalitarian state. This is not a pleasure read, that is for sure. Orwell had a point to make, and he made it in a dark and doomy fashion. It was his last book; he may have been feeling a little harsh from the tuberculosis that would kill him in 1950. One can certainly appreciate the anger that Orwell, formerly an idealistic young leftist, felt toward Stalin's USSR and the Third Reich. In this book he draws on those states to create a state so tolatarian that it dominates every aspect of human life. Probably the closes thing to it today is North Korea.A mid'level propaganda functionary, Winston Smith, is the everyman thru whom we experience Oceania, one of the 3 states left in the world, along with Eurasia and Eastasia, who are also totalitarian. He works eliminating inconvenient stories and words from the archives when the word comes down from above. For in Big Brother's Oceania, the past and language itself must be sanitized. Winston is starting to go a little bonkers, and he begins to rebel in very minor ways. It does not take much - there are Thought Police out there trying to catch those who are showing any sign of rebellion. Although the book sticks to Winston so closely that the POV is limited third person, his life and character are not really that significant. What really matters is the description of the political world that the characters inhabit. Orwell outlines the structures of Oceanian society - the four main ministries, the party and its members, the proles that make up the majority of the population. He describes Newspeak, a strangely computerized version of English in which unnecessary and undesirable words are being progressively eliminated. It is a world in which anybody could be a spy and almost anybody could be guilty of some sort of infraction and eliminated.The only thing that matters is power, says the party boss who busts Winston and tortures him, and the individual is nothing. All that exists is the glory of the state and the party. Orwell throws me for a loop here by (unintentionally, I think) incorporating aspects of Buddhist philosophy into the reasons for totalitarianism. This is a very dark vision, and I find myself wondering why it is still considered so powerful and relevant. The kind of government being attacked here has been discredited all over the world, yet the book seems to really stay in people's minds. Perhaps its popularity is due to its being read by so many high school students. By depicting a nightmarish inversal of of the Western way of life, 1984 serves as an affirmation of that way of life."},{"Title":"1984","review":"I read this book the first time if I remember right in the late 80s. Its still as great, and scary, as I remember it being. More or less you can combine 1984, Huxleys Brave New World, and Camp of the Saints by Jean Raspail and you have a slightly exagerrated version of the world we live in now. Personally I believe that this book only partially came from Orwells imagination. He was involved in political movements to the point where he went to Spain and fought in the Spanish civil war, went to elitist Universities in England and wrote war time propaganda for the BBC so he had a view of the inside of elites and how they operate. Its such the cliche to say it but I believe this book was written as a warning."},{"Title":"1984","review":"There should be no doubt Orwell's \\"1984\\" is the gold standard for dystopian novels. It's about a Totalitarian society that exists in the future from when it was originally published in 1949 (certainly in our future as well). It's popularly believed the inspiration for \\"1984\\" came from Yevgeny Zamyatin's \\"We\\", first published in 1924, and there are similarities. Also, the suggestion, by others, that it's the direction that current politics are leading the U.S. is no doubt contributing to the story's renewed popularity. No matter the reasons, this story is frightening and depressing, but also a testament to the survivability of the human spirit. Prepare yourself though, \\"1984\\" will, without question, provide you a terrifying glimpse in a world bereft of personal freedom.I'd forgo the foreword by Thomas Pynchon though.

The characters show few really heroic or admirable qualities; love is replaced by sex, sex is replaced by duty. Good does not triumph over evil and there is no happy ending. You close the book instead with a sense of futility and hopelessness.Why do we continue to read \\"1984\\"? Because it serves as a warning - a reminder that we must resist when the state squelches conscience and replaces it with authority. A reminder of just how much good there is in the world, and what it means to think and to be human - and how empty the world would be if it all disappeared. And it's a warning that there is a point of no return, after which it is too late to look for change.Let's keep reading \\"1984\\". Once it loses its entertainment value because it seems too much like real life, it will already be too late."},{"Title":"1984","review":"The year was 1974 and I was a twelve year old Puerto Rican boy living in The Bronx where I would often see some of the older kids carrying this book around as part of their class reading assignment. I was immediately fascinated by the title. There was nothing particularly spectacular about the book's appearance, merely the numbers 1984 in a font that was rather friendly looking with only the tiny black silhouette of a running man printed along the spine indicating only the vaguest hints of what was written within.I had recently discovered science fiction and my interest was piqued by a title set that far into the future (to a twelve year old boy anyway) and I reasoned that it must surely have been a science fiction novel and evidently a good one I reasoned since it was an assigned book in school.Those were the days before we had VCR's (never mind DVDs and playable computer files) and as a twelve year old growing up in the Big Apple in that era I was pretty much at the mercy of adults as to what movies I saw and the few TV stations we had back then in regards to what science fiction they saw fit to broadcast. Since Star Wars and Alien were three and five years into the future you can imagine that there was a dearth of science fiction, most especially good science fiction. At that time I had only caught glimpses of 2001: A Space Odyssey at very inconvenient moments.Anyway I could not wait for it to be assigned to me, if at all (that year I got Shane instead) so on one of my many visits to my aunt across town I went around the corner from her apartment to The Grand Concourse where there was a tiny mom and pop book store (this was before the rise of mega bookstores as well) that kept a pretty good selection of sci-fi. To my surprise there were a couple of copies of 1984 not in the Sci-fi section but in the literature section and a few more in the classics section. Well excuse me.Remember that this was before Star Wars so my view of science fiction was not limited to space operas, in fact I was completely unaware of that kind of science fiction with the possible exception, later on, of Dune. The first science fiction book I ever read was Philip K Dick's The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch, a great book but quite possibly the worst book you could choose to introduce a 10 - 11 year old to sci-fi, but the point is that I was not nave enough to have any expectation of ray guns and the like. Anyway I read the synopsis on the back and for a moment I almost considered not spending my allowance on it but I went ahead anyway.By the time I finished this book I was not the same person I was when I started it.To this day there is no doubt in my mind that the course I was on in life prior to reading 1984 was no longer the course I found myself on after reading it. I was still a twelve year old boy with all the concerns of all twelve year old boys at the time (toys, summer fun and increasingly girls, who started becoming more interesting to me) but suddenly all of the real world concerns that I was largely shielded from became part of my conscious landscape and I began to experience a burgeoning appreciation of the apprehension the adults around me felt during times of national or world crises.George Orwell painted a picture of a world so horrific, so utterly devoid of hope (unless you reckon differently by considering the appendix as part of the story) and yet so seemingly plausible that its impact in the world of politics as well as the inclusion of phrases such as \\"Orwellian\\", \\"Big Brother\\" and \\"Double Think\\" into the lexicon should come as no surprise.While it is true that ideology of the state described in 1984 is labeled INGSOC \\"English Socialism\\" one should keep in mind that George Orwell was a Social Democrat and references are made in 1984 to some past betrayal, via the incoherent ramblings of a background character, that may be taken as a suggestion by Orwell as the primary reason as to why the state exists as rendered in 1984. I mention this lest one may assume that George Orwell may have viewed Socialism as inherently flawed for I truly believe he made the adopted ideology of the state in 1984 his own so that readers could not construe it as an attack on any particular ideology.I make this case not as a socialist or communist for I am not either, but rather to assure those readers that may find themselves avoiding this book because they fear that it may be a distortion and attack on their own political ideology. Rest assured that this novel is less a treatise on the evils of any particular ideology and more of an expose on the extreme measures undertaken by a totalitarian state to subject its citizen to whatever means are necessary to totally bend them to its collective will, right up to the point of not just breaking an individual's will but to the point of inverting it as well.What is key here, in spite of the compelling main story of a doomed and forbidden sexual affair, is the exhibition of engineered and finely tuned misery via endless war deliberately waged, not for the purposes of destroying a factual or imagined enemy, but rather for the dual purpose of wasting resources to keep the population in abject poverty and also to instill (or at least to coerce the appearance of) strong feelings of patriotism via nationalism which of course makes a foreign enemy necessary.Orwell also deftly illustrates that a dystopia of this kind cannot rely solely on a foreign enemy to maintain its Iron grip on the populous as this does not allow sufficient reason for the state to wage war against those citizens who would question it and undermine its authority. A common domestic enemy is also necessary; one that may actually be in league with the various foreign and interchangeable enemies and who, by virtue of their proximity within the state, are also in a position to sabotage the country's war efforts by the use of terrorist's tactics or by fomenting the rot of rebellion from within.Some citizens might actually suppose that they could benefit from losing the war, surely life could not be worse than it already is and they may consider taking their chances with an enemy invader; enter Emmanuel Goldstein the big domestic terrorist boogeyman who is largely an invention of the state and therefore a tool to entrap \\"thought criminals\\" as well as serving, along with his anonymous followers, as a focal point for patriotic rage the expression of which is mandated by a necessarily public ritual called the \\"two minutes hate\\".Orwell creates (in his fictitious state of Oceana) an endless logic loop in which the state relies on notions of patriotism and in which all citizens without thinking feel the need to protect their now antiquated notions of the nationhood (as opposed to the state). This is in spite of the fact that the state has drifted far from when such patriotism or any sense of duty to country actually made sense. As it is there is no real escape, for Oceana's deadly \\"enemies\\" Eurasia and Eastasia are similarly governed, indeed they cannot exist as is without each other.1984 is a world of near constant and near inescapable surveillance even within the confines of one's home. What is being attempted here however is not necessarily the documentation of any activity you or I would consider a crime for the purposes of prosecution but rather an attempt to discern any possible hint that the citizen may be committing a \\"thought crime\\", that is harboring any negative feelings toward the state or its titular head \\"Big Brother\\", for the purposes of \\"correcting\\" the citizen as the state cannot allow dissidents or martyrs.It is a world in which parents fear their children who are the primary agents of the state responsible for the capture of more thought criminals than any state agency.It is also a world in which there is an active state program laboring to narrow the range of thought by reducing the English language year by year to the final aim of a converting it to some sort of rudimentary drone-speak. Why have the word \\"bad\\" when \\"good\\" already implies its opposite and the word \\"un-good\\" will suffice? Why stop there? There would eventually be no need for phrases such as \\"great\\", \\"marvelous\\" or \\"fantastic\\" or any variation of such when one can merely say \\"good\\" \\"plus good\\" and \\"double plus good\\". The reasoning is that if you strip language down to its most elementary stage, stopping just short of interfering with society's ability to function you can do away with entire concepts such as freedom and civil rights.In Orwell's nightmare sex for pleasure is a punishable crime not for any of the usual reasons of morality but because the state wants you to channel all your energies toward being a productive citizen of the state for the sake of the state.In 1984 society has been dived into three classes.1. The poor, or \\"Proles\\" who are deliberately kept dumb and poor rendering them incapable of rising above their station and yet are largely left alone so as to enjoy the baser joys of life such as pornography strictly as a means of mollifying them. All of which combines to make them incapable of rebellion.2. The ruling class or \\"Inner Party\\" who remain un-incentivized to enact any changes not just out of fear of reprisals by their fellow inner party members via the state but also out of fear of losing the few petty privileges they enjoy.3. And finally the middle class or \\"Outer Party\\" relegated to actually carrying out the will of the state thereby bearing witness to all the lies and totalitarian tactics employed by the state which ironically makes them the primary targets of the \\"miniluv\\" or the \\"Ministry Of Love\\" that is responsible for law enforcement which in this book means oppressing, torturing and \\"re-educating\\" those Outer Party members accused of thought crime.Essentially 1984 presents a juggernaut state that has become unmoored from whatever benign ideals once berthed it and has drifted off beyond site of a reassuring oasis-like coastline. A state in which its inhabitants no longer strive to achieve their original goals be they based on economical, religious or political ideals and have allowed the state to become a living entity in itself with the destruction of the human spirit as its sole aim.Much is made about the last four words in 1984 but for me the most horrific line in the entire book is Obrien's revelation to Winston Smith as to what is in store for humanity.\\"If you want a picture of the future, imagine a boot stamping on a human face -- forever.\\""},{"Title":"1984","review":"So what can I say about this book that hasn't been said before? Having read it I can see how it has become regarded as classic fiction. Of course the year 1984 has come and gone and many folks say had it been titled \\"2009\\" it would have been much more accurate. I chose this book because my son had to read it for school (I was never assigned this one myself) but I always felt I \\"should\\" read it. So I have now.For those of you who haven't read it, it is a complex novel but with a fairly basic plot. The protagonist, Winston Smith, is a functioning member of a society in the future who meets a woman he is attracted to. Much of the book surrounds their attempt to form a relationship in this society that just won't allow that sort of thing. Of course the real point and value of the novel is to illustrate where our current society may be headed if we don't change course, a sort of anti-utopian (dystopian?) novel. This book has brought us common terms such as \\"Big Brother\\", \\"doublethink\\", and \\"thought police.\\" There are long sections where Winston reads to his girl friend from the official government manual detailing how the society came to be as well as the evolution of the government-speak (\\"Newspeak\\")language. I am glad that I've read this novel but at the same time I can't say that I would ever want to read it again. My political/societal views are already pretty much cemented in place and this book, while thought provoking, did not change my views. I do agree that it should be studied at the High School level though, not only for its value to the world of literature but also as a way to kick start young people's thinking on what a society should and shouldn't be."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Only four years after his critically acclaimed Animal Farm, George Orwell came back with another masterpiece in the form of Nineteen Eighty Four. Orwell, a British author, is known for his hatred and disgust towards a totalitarian society and social injustice. This novel clearly demonstrates the impurities and chaos that are brought about by such a dystopian society.The story follows the life of Winston Smith, a state worker who has much secret hatred towards the \\"Big Brother Society.\\" In the world in which he lives, citizens are forced to follow the strict rules of the society. Their state, Oceania, is constantly monitored by the government and by Big Brother, their \\"great\\" ruler. In this totalitarian state, the ruler controls all of the actions of his people and even their minds. He does much of this through propaganda and slogans such as the now famous, \\"Big Brother is watching you\\" (3). The rulers also are trying to dispose of all unneeded words in order to get rid of all unorthodox thought. Winston Smith is one of the very few who secretly rejects the society and its laws. He believes that he should live his life in a more free way because the end of his life is approaching soon. As a result, Winston has a surreptitious, illegal relationship with a co-worker, Julia. This is a large step for Winston because he knows what he is doing is a great offense, but he does feel very comfortable and safe when he is with her. For example, he states \\"...as they were actually in this room, they both felt, no harm could come to them\\" (152). Winston's life goes from good to horrible very quickly, and he is forced to live out the rest of his existence in physical and emotional pain.The novel mocks the greed, selfishness, and utter craziness that an unstable government can cause if poorly run. Orwell shows through the odd and hectic life of Winston Smith. He grabs the reader's attention with Winston's secretive and mischievous acts. He describes the instability and corruption of a government at its worst. With Oceania being contently at war, one can recognize that the governments are constantly corrupt and the concept of having this \\"Big Brother\\" always watching over the citizens illustrates how the government has an unreasonable belief that citizens will rebel. After reading George Orwell's masterpiece, I believe that \\"Big Brother\\" culture is not as far fetched as I originally judged. Orwell's story completely changed the way I look at how a government can be run and makes me rethink how our country is being run now. Just a few bad decisions can cause chaos."},{"Title":"1984","review":"War is PeaceFreedom is SlaveryAnd Big Brother is watchingThese are the slogans that the people in George Orwell's book, 1984. George Orwell does a great job of telling the story of Winston Smith's life and how he goes through life rebelling against the government. He describes every setting with emence detail and it felt like I was right there with Winston going through his every day struggles to survive and remain in his eyes sane. The way Orwell conveyed the story through the diary as well as just writing it really worked well. The diary tells about Winston\`s character and how he reacts to life around him. I believe that when writing this story George Orwell wrote a book that is a great success.As a high school student I enjoyed 1984. It challenged me to think outside of the box and more critically. To say that War is Peace and Freedom is Slavery and actually believe it causes one to question the meaning of certain things. In our world war is not peace and slavery is the opposite of freedom, so what could have led people to believe and just accept that these things are true. That is what 1984 truly explains, that humans can become brain washed into believing almost anything. The scary part about this is that it actually can happen as shown in the book through a series of torture and reeducating Winston was reformed into one who believed in what the Republic of Oceania believed. With propaganda, the party ruling over the people in 1984 can shape the minds of jst about anyone.In conclusion, 1984 is a well written, suspenseful story of a man who becomes the same as everone else. There is no room for individuality in the setting created by George Orwell. Everyone believes the same or are arrested and reformed!"},{"Title":"1984","review":"Orwell depicts a vivid portrayal of the ills of a totalitarian regime - even the consequences of government overreach in general. His society is the most extreme one imaginable created by a government with absolute power. While painting his picture of a dystopian world, Orwell links us into Winston Smith, the main character, an everyman who the reader is able to identify with. He is someone like us - an outsider in this totalitarian world, who is unable to completely submit his mind and will to Big Brother (the State). We are able to experience the absolute control of the government through Winston's eyes - its physical and psychological control of its subjects, to Winston's expanding discontent, his rebellious acts and finally their destined consequences.Under this veil, Orwell demonstrates how weak and frail a totalitarian regime truly is. In order to control its subjects, Big Brother has to have absolute control of information - to even alter the past, to constantly control minds through propaganda, to create constant war to keep the society poor, and to use fear mongering (i.e. encouraging kids to rat out their parents to the thought police) to force its will on the people. It even uses language as mind control - whittling language away to limit thoughts and expressions. Ultimately, Big Brother is only able to force Winston to submit by torturing and brainwashing him into an empty shell like the rest of its subjects.This book is great for the high school reader and beyond - it is an easy read while allowing the reader to consider the implications of living in such a society. Its endurance is also impressive - this book was originally published in 1949 - the same work could be published today and be just as relevant."},{"Title":"1984","review":"I am a big fan of science fiction. This book might be classified as such, as it was written to be set in the future when George Orwell published it in 1949. But as time passes, this book is showing itself to not be so much of a story as it is a warning. There are already so many phrases from the book that we use, like Big Brother or Newspeak. And the way some governments are now does not bode well. This is a classic novel that more people should read as a warning, so that we can avoid this kind of dystopia."},{"Title":"1984","review":"I read this book for fun (yeah, some of us still do that, even in the 9th grade), and it turned out to be one of my all time favorites.

The book portarys a dark future for mankind where there is no past except that written by the rulers, mankind has no free thought and all basic vestiges of the human spirit have been systematically &quot;cut out and cauterised&quot; to serve one purpose, that the &quot;party&quot; should 'freeze time' so that they can rule totally and brutally for ever with the object of power for powers sake.What if you feel you are the last vestige of humanity, but everything you do, everyone you speak to every twitch or drop of nervous sweat your body makes can be seen, heard and analysed.

After reading this book, I am sure you will be pondering its agenda and reality for time to come, and you will learn to think of your own life and freedom.I recommend also &quot;Animal Farm&quot; by George Orwell Also an excellent look at communism."},{"Title":"1984","review":"George Orwell's masterpiece, 1984, is a thoroughly astonishing look at a dystopian future- a &quot;negative utopia&quot; where free thought is a crime punishable by death. Winston Smith, an allusion both to Winston Churchill and to the common man (Smith being the most common English last name), is a member of the Outer Party of the Republic of Oceania, and lives in London. His job is the rewriting of past records for the further glorification of &quot;Big Brother&quot;, a figurehead that has come to be synonomous with any activity of invasion of privacy by our own government. Stripped of the simplest rights, like the right to free speech or the right to record any events or possess any records of the past, 1984 is the story of Winston's struggle to overturn both Big Brother and the ideas that he stands for. This book won't fail to impress, nor to depress- thoroughly sad at many different levels."},{"Title":"1984","review":"It is hard to belive that a totalitarian government can happen, People say it can't, but in truth it has. George Orwell's book has almost in a cense read the future. Take what happened in Stazi Germany, it is identical. And i belive that anyone who can guess at the future like that and be so right is deserving of some complement. And for the people out there who think that the readers of this book are all paranoied they are wrong.

Great book!"},{"Title":"1984","review":"The book 1984 is undoubtedly on of the greatest books of all times and deals with many issues today. It covers areas such as privacy, alteration of the english language and freedom of thought. As the government in 1984 used Ingsoc to alter the meaning of words and limit them to total neutrality, so do the mondern day politicaly correct. The alteration of language is an alteration of thought and it is wrong. I recommend the book &quot;Straight and Crooked Thinking&quot; by T.H.

Well that's your problem and it shouldn't affect your review of a book, that's like a film critic who doesn't like comedies giving a comedy a bad review for that reason.

It's been on my list for 7 years and I'm so glad I finally got around to reading it.The beginning of the book drags, but sets the tone for all that happens towards the middle and end. If you that can get through ther first 60-70 pages, you'll fly through the last 150-200. Julia was my favorite character and the way Orwell set up the first sexual encounter with her and Winston was a stroke of genius. I think my heart stopped when they were in their secret bedroom and got caught. I was waiting for them to get caught, but it happened so suddenly I got caught off balance. The action tails off towards the end but by that time the story has the reader so engrossed the end is like a carrot on a string."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Anyone notice that 1984 has already occured? Not the date, I mean, but big brother did come already. In Maoist China, in the 50s.

Written in 1948, he envisioned a society in which truth is manipulated to suit the needs of the Party. Big Brother is a ubiquitious system of cameras that renders any privacy of either action or thought to crime. Freedom, according to Big Brother, is slavery to the Party.Enter Winston, whose job is to rewrite books and other literature to suit the needs of Big Brother. He questions what he is doing, as well as loyalty. As he quietly questions his role, he comes to meet Julia and they have an illicit affair. The Party will not stand for this. Only Big Brother can supply all their needs, both physical, emotional, and sexual.This is a must for anyone living in America today. It is requires reading in my Government class and it never ceases to amaze me how the kids can get into it and discuss it with such frankness.Although somewhat dark and cynical, 1984 does reveal how even free governments originally found on Democracy will eventually do anyting to hold onto their power. Hopefully the depressing ending might inspire a sleeping society to wake up and realize what is truly going on."},{"Title":"1984","review":"PROPHETIC!"},{"Title":"1984","review":"Most lists of top fiction of the 20th century place this book in the top 10.Is this the future? The book is a social warning of sorts written by Orwell about the extreme directions that governments might take its citizens. The book follows the Nazi era of WWII, and the socialist revolutions in Russia and China. Orwell got his original idea from reading H.G. Well's \\"Utopia\\" written 50 years earler. Here he takes the concept a step farther with a breakdown of the government to become a flawed and highly controlling socialist society run by the political elite.This is a very interesting book that should be read along with the author's other book Animal Farm. I read the book and saw the VHS starring Hurt and Burton which is mostly a faithful representation of the book - and a good movie in color.Once the smoke and rhetoric clears this is essentially a love story about a man living in what appears to be a communist society or perhaps the National Socialists that has evolved into a tightly controlled and hero worshipping society, i.e.: pictures of the leader (\\"B.B.\\") big brother are omnipresent and everyone wears similar blue overalls, eats similar food, etc. Big brother has taken on a persona similar to Stalin or Mao and like those totalitarian communist societies, the misfits or independent thinkers or small business people are banished to camps or simply killed. Propaganda is the norm and (again) like similar 20th century communist countries history is re-written almost daily to reflect the current whims of the leaders.Unlike many imperfect countries including most western countries and other free countries that have survived the upheavals of the 20th century, we are subject to government propaganda and media bias but we are free to turn off our TV sets, not read the papers, buy any book that we so desire, have religious freedoms or free to be agnostics, and choose to protest and vote as we see fit. This is all lacking in 1984 where society is strictly controlled. Each TV is interactive and monitors the owner for deviations from the accepted patterns of behaviour; it is connected with the \\"thought police\\", and is turned on all the time to monitor the citizens. Only high party members have the luxury of turning off their interactive TV connected to the \\"thought police\\" and drinking wine and participating in the normally accepted pleasures of life. As we read in the book Animal Farm, the utopian ideals of a perfect society are replaced by the corruption brought on by absolute power.The \\"average citizens\\" including our hero in 1984 are subject to a continuous stream of propaganda about external armed conflicts, false production figures to offset real material shortages, criminal activities against big brother and the party, confessions of party members gone astray, etc. They cannot read independent books or articles. Such books, that would expose the government propaganda for what it is, are all banned. People who do not conform are routinely arrested and hung at public hangings - that are televised seemingly daily.The plot is sinister in that the ruling party members use thought control and torture to manipulate the masses including our hero, so the citizens lose most of their human qualities and are zombie like. This is a chilling movie about how a society can take a wrong turn.Written by George Orwell late in his short life, this remains a compelling and unusual read about a society gone mad. It is a \\"must read\\" work of 20th century fiction."},{"Title":"1984","review":"\\"1984\\" is recognized to be one of the most influential novels of the 20th century, and helped to expose the evil that is contained in totalitarianism. The only fear is that in a post cold war existence we may fail to remember the lessons Orwell taught us, and unexpectedly in our complacency we may allow that evil to rise again."},{"Title":"1984","review":"The scariest, deepest, most interesting, and undoubtedly the best book I've ever read. When I started it, I couldn't put it down. When I finished it, I couldn't pick it up for fear of paranoia. Even now, after I've finally somewhat gotten over it, there are still some nights I can't sleep thinking about this unbelievably incredible book. It's ten times scarier than any Stephen King novel, and it's at least as deep, if not deeper, than anything written by Poe or Shakespeare. This book should undoubtedly be a requirement for anyone in the entire world living under any form of government. The story takes place in 1984, but it could be set in 2084 and not much would change. There is absolutely nothing I've ever read which even comes close to projecting the kind of heavy, depressing, absolute fear which utterly consumes the reader and stays with them forever. Of course I would recommend this book, but I must warn that it can't be treated lightly. It will send you to the edge of paranoia, and throw you into a smothering kind of depression. This is not a book you will soon forget, and it's not a book you can read without questioning everything you think and believe. You'll never hear the phrase &quot;Big Brother is watching you&quot; again, without chills going down you're spine, and fear filling every corner of your being. I would also like to recommend another book that I recently came across------very thought provoking and unusual, titled THE CHILDREN'S CORNER. Not a book for children but a great, great, colorful romp through humor-land, darkness, great writing, and stellar prose. By Jackson McCrae. Check it out. I read it for a class and loved it. If you loved \\"Brave New World\\" then you'll like 1984."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Another great piece of literature by George Orwell, I'm just I wasn't forced to read this one in school. Animal Farm remains one of my favorite books, but I had to read it in class, so it will forever be tainted.This book brings up so many questions it is hard to know where to begin. The most horrifying thing about this book, I think, is that it can be related to so many situations. Everything from grand-scale government to the aforementioned class room is allegorized in this book in some way. It reminds me, in some ways, of a Harry Chapin song that shares its name with that of this post. In the song a child goes to school full of imagination and creativity; through the negative reinforcement of his teacher the child is forced to conform and never again regains what he had. The tragic loss of the human spirit is really what this book is about.What you really need to consider when reading something like this is: how far from the truth is this? As far as correcting history goes, isn't it true that every civilization writes history from its own perspective? Most American textbooks portray Christopher Columbus as a saint and Native Americans as primitive savages; they all contain direct contradictions of the truth that we are all taught to accept. Often times, even after learning the fallacies of these statements, people still cling to their ideals. A small amount of discrimination toward these engrained teachings still remains even after the facts have become accepted, our own, underdeveloped, form of doublethink. And what are these new \\"facts\\" based on? Primary sources, journals, accounts? But aren't all of these also biased by the person writing them? The only history that truly exists is the memory within one's one mind, also biased, in case anyone is keeping track. So, if history truly only exists within the mind of the individual, isn't it entirely logical that \\"modifying\\" that historical perspective would in fact change history? It's all very confusing and I commend Orwell for trying to break it down a little.Apparently it doesn't matter that such instances of \\"Party\\" thinking occur in our own time and place, it only matters that they don't occur to such a level as to make us uncomfortable. I know I'm not clarifying my point very clearly here, but what I'm trying to say is that everything that happens in Orwell's novel happens in our world too, just not nearly as severely. It's all a matter of perspective, most of the people living in Orwell's 1984 are perfectly content, even thrilled, to be where they are in life. That doesn't make it right, but that is our perspective of the situation. By our standards, the world in which they live is intolerable. Their world is our Room 101. That sounded a lot more philosophical in my head, but I think you get my point."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Creepy. Profound. Intense. 'Riveting'. And so on goes the string of 'good book review' words that one could easily associate with this novel. If you know what 1984 is, and if you know who George Orwell is, you don't need me to tell you to read this book. Because you should.But let's get over that, and dig underneath the book's paperdermis. Because yes, on the outside it appears to be the 1950s equivalent of 'the Matrix', a story laced with post-apocalyptic yet still relevant social commentary. But inside, 1984 proves to be much more valuable than that: this book perfectly captures the western political phobias and ideaologies of the World War II era.Orwell's 1984 was essentially Stalin's Soviet Union (made especially evident by the spot on physical similarities of Stalin and Big Brother, for one), but almost any totalitarian state fits the fiction. The state is ruled by the party, who control everything in life through the use of ignorance, propoganda and 'dissapearances' (purges). Sound familiar?When I first read this, I figured it was just the work of a paranoid British McCarthyist. But I was completely wrong. I came to realize that 1984 is a historical treasure worth reading, not because of the strangely convincing, yet absurd world of 1984, but because it recreates the western culture of the Cold War in an effective manner. This is not simply good fiction, but a bridge between the Cold War, and the political groups and ideas of today. A must read for all students of history."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Orwell crafts one of the most absolutle horrors of a future world in this celebrated novel.Written in the late 40's, Orwell crafts the tale of a bureaucrat in the future whose job along with countless other mindless peons, is (in essence) to erase history.Bombarded by slogans that hammer the totalitarian nature of the state, he finds some comfort in a woman who shares his ambition to break free from the controls of \\"Big Brother\\".Parables abound in this book, to a world and people seemingly oblivious to what is going on around them. Orwell has managed to create one of the most frigthening environments put to paper and weave a future world bleaker, but more importantly, theoreticaly possible in any day or age. So ingenious in usage of slogans, and terms made up by the author, that they are culturaly refered to still in this day and age.An astounding piece of fiction."},{"Title":"1984","review":"George Orwell's 1984 is a crowning achievement of the negative utopia novel, bringing forth oppressment and totalitarianism in a strict society in which all men are slaves to the Party. Orwell's use of symbolism and foreshadowing are fantastic, bringing forth all the elements of lost humanity which he wishes to bring about in the novel.The symbols in 1984 are striking and disturbing, but completely impressive. The entire idea of Newspeak is well used. It is a symbol of the deteriorating of humanity through simplification and the use of force by Big Brother. Also prevalent is the vanishing of people. People vanish not because of a clear violation of laws, but because they are turned in by others for a violation. Often there is no trial and no chance for a people to save themselves from being killed. This shows the complete deterioration of all human freedom as we know it. People are killed for mere suspicion with no definitive proof of wrongdoing, all so that society can go on smoothly.The foreshadowing throughout the novel is also very effective. Orwell uses Winston's dreams to show events that come to pass soon thereafter. His dream in which he hears the voice tell him \\"We will meet in the place where there is no darkness\\" ironically foreshadows Winston's being in a prison cell full of light, rather than a triumph over the darkness of the times as Winston first sees it. Also well used is \\"2+2=4\\" foreshadowing his change after the conditioning that \\"two and two make five.\\" All of this foreshadowing really works to create a sense of destination for Winston.Th novel's use of foreshadowing and symbolism coincide to create a sense of terror and impending doom. They work perfectly and the end result is one of the greatest warnings from literature ever."},{"Title":"1984","review":"George Orwell, whose real name is Eric Blair, was born in India in 1903. He served in Burma with the India Imperial Police and spent the end of the 1920s living in Paris. He later fought for the Republicans against Franco in the Spanish Civil War. He became well-known with the publication of \\"Animal Farm\\", a satire on Soviet Russia. He died in January 1950, shortly after the publication of \\"1984\\".\\"1984\\" is set in London, the chief city of Airstrip One and the third most populous of Oceania's states. Oceania is one of the world's three great powers - the others being Eurasia and Eastasia - and is constantly at war with at least on of its neighbors. Although the roles of enemy and ally change regularly, the change is never officially acknowledged : if Oceania is at war with Eastasia, then it has always been at war with Eastasia. The Party rules Oceania through four ministries. These include the Ministry of Peace (which deals with the war effort), the Ministry of Plenty (responsible for economic affairs and shortages) and the Ministry of Truth (responsible for all forms of propaganda - including news, education and entertainment). However, the Ministry of Love - which deals with law and order - is the really scary one. Heavily fortified and guarded, it is home to the dreaded Thought Police and is impossible to enter except on official business. Oceania's official language is Newspeak, an updated version of English with a vastly reduced vocabulary. Without the words to express an 'undesirable' thought, 'thoughtcrime' will become literally impossible. It is expected to have totally replaced Oldspeak, or standard English, by 2050.The Party is led by Big Brother, and all good things come as a direct result of his leadership. His image stares down from every wall, and he is widely viewed as a savior and protector. His nemesis is Emmanuel Goldstein, who was once a leading member of the Party before betraying the cause. He is now the 'Enemy of the People', and commander of the Brotherhood : a mysterious army dedicated to he overthrow of the Party and State.The book's hero is Winston Smith - he is reasonably sure he is thirty-nine, and that the year is 1984 (though that is not entirely certain). A member of the Party, he works in the Records Department at the Ministry of Truth and lives at Victory Mansions. Although his position brings certain perks - certainly in comparison to the proles - life is bleak. Many items - including food, razor blades and boots - are in short supply, and his home - despite its name - is an old, rundown block of flats. In every room throughout Airstrip One, telescreens are installed. Although similar to televisions, they can only be dimmed but never switched off. They not only receive programmes, but also transmit to the Ministry of Truth - meaning the Thought Police can monitor whoever they like whenever they like. Winston is officially married, although he has been separated for nearly eleven years. Marriages between Party members have to be approved by a committee, though any attraction is apparently frowned upon. Sex is an act widely viewed with disgust, while sexual immorality is known as 'sexcrime'. Winston's life changes when he starts keeping a diary. This is not technically illegal, though - when caught - he knows it could be punishable by death.Generally, I don't like making blanket recommendations, but \\"1984\\" is one of the few exceptions. While it is a grim book, everybody should read at some point. Some see it, like \\"Animal Farm\\", as a satire on the USSR - Big Brother does seem to look like Stalin, there are constant references to 'Three Year Plans' and people call each other 'Comrade'. However, it applies to any form of totalitarian government - or indeed, any government that has too much control over an individuals life."},{"Title":"1984","review":"... we do in fact live in a rather Orwellian world. In Orwell's dystopia, the state is all powerful; every aspect of life is controlled, down to --and especially-- the language itself. This is probably the book's greatest contribution to social theory --the idea that words and definitions have such a great influence on our thoughts. If we can't think of the word for something, we can't have a coherent thought about it. Orwell may not have invented these ideas, but he certainly dramatized them in an unprecedented manner. Another significant aspect of the novel is the perpetual warfare. The state is constantly at war, but allies and enemies constantly shift. The population is kept under complete surveillance by televisions that watch the viewer; and this was written years before internet cameras! The everyman hero, Winston Smith, gradually gets involved in a resistance movement that may or may not really exist. The paranoia of this scenario is total --no one can be trusted. In my opinion, many people have missed the point of this novel. ...I can't be sure of Orwell's purpose in writing the book, but to me it's not meant to be a realistic portrayal of any actual or even possible dictatorship. It's more of a theoretical model of a perfectly evil state --the antithesis, for example, of Plato's supposedly perfect society. ... To see the relevance of 1984, we have to focus on the techniques and mindset used by the state in that novel. Armies that are called peacekeeping forces; wars that are never declared against always changing enemies; a language of PC euphemisms and bureaucratic jargon -- these are facts of modern life. The fact that it hasn't gone to the extreme of 1984 and probably (and hopefully) never will does not in any way detract from Orwell's brilliant insights."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Our society and culture are shaped by ideas that have occurred decades, centuries, and even eons before we were conceived. Our perception of history affects the way we see our surroundings and that same perception contains much gravity in the way of our thoughts and actions. We tend to outwardly proclaim our love for idealogical freedom and take pride in our nation. But what if none of it was real? What if our perception of reality and all that has ever happened was controlled not for the sake of our own good, but for the sake of power.1984 was written during a time when communism was on the rise with an inherent fear that the ideologies of the said political point of reference would overcome the freedoms upheld by the American public. George Orwell, an English author born in India, fought against the armies and individuals who would push forth such ideologies. What he saw arising was a possible future in which governments controlled every detail of your life to the point of even telling you who you could marry and where you can eat. We can see the downfall of the utopian communist mindset now, but are we indifferent to the lessons learned through what Orwell has communicated?This is a great book when we open our minds to the understanding that, in my opinion, transcends the breadth of the book. What reality will you trust? When you look at who we think we are as Citizens of the United States of America (if you are as such), do you realize that a probable 2/3's of the world hates us? When we see history, can we see it through the eyes of the Vietnamese soldier, of whose land we invade? Are we able to peer through the thoughts of the Native American who remembers through oral tradition the first encounter with the Europeans as his people are being destroyed by the same people group? I'm not trying to increase a personal hatred or sentiment of discord with what our country is. What I am trying to relay here is that History is not always what it seems to us through first glance, I think that more than anything it is what Orwell wants us to understand. Is our freedom worth the investigation it takes to find the truth? I think so, and I think that reading this book can give us an insight as to why. Very entertaining. Very dark. Very thoughtful. I give it five stars because it's a well written book with a seeming purpose that goes beyond reading it."},{"Title":"1984","review":"George Orwell was always known for handling tough issues in his novels and non-fiction works. 1984 is a timeless example of Orwell's fearlessness, as the novel deftly broaches topics such as totalitarianism and free thought--topics that were eminently important in 1948 (when in the novel was written) and remain important to this day.The novel follows Winston Smith who is loyally employed in the Ministry of Truth within the futuristic nation of Oceania. However, in Orwell's futuristic world, nothing is as it seems, for the Ministry of Truth seeks actually to destroy historical truth in an effort to protect the unknown but seemingly omniscient &quot;Party&quot; which rules Oceania under the direction of the totalitarian leader known simply as &quot;Big Brother.&quot; What follows is a dramatic transformation of Winston as he questions his role in this perverse society, where spies are everywhere, privacy is non-existent and rebellious thoughts, let alone actions, are criminal offenses.This is a disturbing satire that stunningly dramatizes the perversities of totalitarian/fascist societies and ultimately makes an important statement about human freedom within society. Orwell is a talented writer who moves the story along brilliantly, keeping readers glued to the book and throwing in many unforeseen twists and turns. The conclusion of the novel, with its dramatic last sentence, is classic and troubling. This is an important book for all to read and most will enjoy doing so."},{"Title":"1984","review":"In &quot;1984&quot;, Winston, the main character, finds himself dissatisfied with a world he feels powerless to change. Cameras are everywhere, and no one knows when they are being monitored. Furthermore, government spies abound, and children are taught early on to snitch on someone who is being disloyal. Public records are constantly altered to ensure that &quot;Big Brother&quot; is seen as flawless and all-powerful. Unable to hide in the shadows any longer, Winston begins to search for others who are equally disatisfied. As the story unfolds, the uneasiness builds as Winston tries to find a way to thwart the seemingly unstoppable Big Brother.Privacy advocates often reference &quot;1984&quot; for its nightmarish vision of a world where one's every move is monitored. Equally unnerving are the descriptions of an all-powerful government that can hide the truth by altering documents and that &quot;reprograms&quot; those who disagree. If you're sleeping too well at night, this is a book for you. It should be read by everyone who's ever considered the importance of freedom."},{"Title":"1984","review":"To think that by 1984 we had begun to exhibit some of the ideas Orwell expressed in his novel, or that so many believed that none of it had come true?In 1984, Orwell paints the vision of a world layered with Marxist and Socialist philosophies, a place where individual freedom is being oppressed and forgotten. Told through the perspective of Winston Smith, a member of The Party, Orwell shows the struggles and consequences of a man daring to go against The System.It is a riveting tale injected with political and social philosophy. A timeless classic that will certainly be revisited by future generations and very likely passed off as &quot;incorrect predictions&quot; because the concepts Orwell covers are too frightful to entertain as reality. From Big Brother watching citizens through Telescreens to the past being rewritten from one moment to the next.I highly recommend this novel to not just science fiction fans but to all citizens of the present, as a reminder that freedom is only a reality as long as we do not take it for granted."},{"Title":"1984","review":"this is a powerful book and a must read for everybody. while some may say this book was written to criticize the corrupted Soviet empire, that is not true. Animal Farm was written for that purpose. this book was instead written to warn the free world of totalitarianism, something that could easily happen anywhere in the world, even in democracies like the US, or England, the setting of the book."},{"Title":"1984","review":"\\"1984\\" is a model of George Orwell's idea of Totalitarianism and in my opinion he wrote it to show people how a political system can suppress individual freedom. Orwell wants to warn people for the future by showing them what society could become if Totalitarianism became true.When I read this book it was very horrifying to me realizing that almost all people, except Winston Smith and Julia, are brainwashed by the Party. They believe everything the Party tells them for example Oceania is at war with Eurasia and in alliance with Eastasia. But one day the situation changes and Oceania is at war with Eastasia and Eurasia is their partner. The Party tells its people that they are always at war with Eastasia and people don't remember that this isn't true! This is incredible for me.To my mind Winston is a sort of hero because he is aware of the danger that he gets into trouble with the Party. He knows from the very beginning that his diary will be found and later will be used against him. He also knows that his love affair with Julia is an act of revolution because sex is just allowed to produce \\"new material\\" for the Party. But I also think Winston is some kind of naive because he opens his mind to O'Brien before he is sure that O'Brien is also against the Party.A very interesting character of the book, I think, is O'Brien because the reader only gets to know Winston's opinion about him and till the end the reader isn't sure if O'Brien is an enemy or a friend of Winston. For me O'Brien plays his \\"role\\" perfectly, with the result, that Winston is reintegrated into the Party.The Party invents a new official language of Oceania called Newspeak and by the year 2050 this language will superset Oldspeak (=common English). I think one reason of developing this language is to make old books, which are written before the era of the Party, unreadable. It's vocabulary is so constructed that it gives an exact and often very subtle expression to every meaning. This is done by the invention of new words but chiefly by eliminating undesirable words.Orwell also describes the bad living conditions under which people have to live at that time. The Party wants to make them concentrating on the Party and not on their own pleasure.The reader really sees how the life of a Party member is dictated from his birth to his death.I recognized that Orwell divides the Superstates in the book according to their division in the Cold War. Oceania stands for the United States of America, Eurasia for Russia and Eastasia for China. The \\"Golden Country\\" is another symbol which can be compared with the old European landscape.While reading the book I asked myself who Big Brother is and I came to the conclusion that Big Brother, whose picture is everywhere, stands for all dictators that have ever existed. Orwell has certainly been thinking of Russian leader Joseph Stalin, Nazi leader Adolf Hitler or the Spanish dictator Francisco Franco. But I think too that for Orwell Big Brother could be a religious figure like God who sees and knows everything but never appears in person. For members of the Inner Party Big Brother is a leader who they can use to scare people and to explain their doings.In my opinion George Orwell wants to show with the book \\"1984\\" that there exists no chance that all people can become equal. There are always some people who have more power than the others because those have for example to rule the country or to make laws. It's very important that people don't trust their leader blindly and forget to think with their own minds. Therefore they must surely get the right education and the historical knowledge to become aware of the parallels in the past and to notice if something goes into the wrong way.Even a person who has such a big personality as Winston Smith, can be manipulated and influenced easily by drugs and torture. For me the sentence \\"I love Big Brother\\" at the end of the book is very impressive and shocking because you feel that it isn't a sentence he says for fun, no, this is his new opinion after being brainwashed. The book shows to me clearly that nobody can resist such cruelty and that a society only needs one person to give violence and Totalitarianism a chance. There are always people who want to control every move and thought to get maximum power which lies unfortunately in the human nature.I also think that the actuality of Big Brother isn't to deny because today we have computers and the internet which give us the possibility of looking into the private life of each person. There are a lot of people who are interesting in watching such, in my opinion, boring films.For the future I can imagine that there will be cameras and microphones at a lot of places. So even if you want to go to the doctor or get a new job you will have to give detailed information about your person and nobody will be able to have secrets anymore.I liked reading this book very much because it is written very exciting. I couldn't stop reading because I wanted to know how the story would end. I was very surprised about the ending because I didn't think that Winston could be changed and reintegrated into the Party.I can recommend this novel and satire to everyone because I believe it's very important to become aware of what in our surroundings happens and how easily people can be manipulated and influenced without noticing it. For me it is possible that the story, told in this book, happens in real life again because there are many people who want to get power and look only after their personal benefit."},{"Title":"1984","review":"\\"1984\\", by George Orwell, is a harrowing tale of the dismal future. The year is 1984 and the government has taken over every aspect of Joe Anybody's life. Through the use of an advanced television, called a telescreen, the government keeps a close eye on each and every citizen of Oceania, one of three world powers. If anyone does something that makes them seem \\"unorthodox\\" or unique, the Thought Police quickly show up and capture that person, torturing him and then erasing his name from any record it may have been in, thereby erasing his existence. In this way the government controls all of history. Any record or document not in compliance with the government's philosophy or ideals quickly receives an alteration to rectify the \\"mistake.\\" The future is bleak and getting worse by the day.To call this book a \\"classic\\" would not do it justice. This is the best book I have ever read, for numerous reasons. First, George Orwell writes masterfully, with words that flow like water through your mind; his complete grasp of the written word creates a profound impact on the reader which makes the book exceptionally hard to put down. Second, the questions the book forces you to consider hit with the force of a sledgehammer: what is truth? Can it possibly be attained? These questions haunt your every moment in between reading sessions with this book. The final reason that this is the best book I have ever read is the messages the book conveys. The government should not rule people's lives, censorship is a thing more destructive than most people realize, and to be forgotten is a fate far worse than death. This book made me think more than any other book I have ever read.Although I may speak highly of it, this book may not be for everyone. It is for every person who believes the government should not have more control over people's lives than it now does, it is for every person who questions whether the information the government feeds us on a daily basis is true or not, and it is for every person who has the mental capacity to grasp the idea that the past may not exist the way you think it does. If you want to read an astounding book that makes you rethink what you now know about the world you live in, by all means read this book. If you want to remain complacent and ignorant about what the government could become, then don't read it. The choice is yours."},{"Title":"1984","review":"This is a very powerful novel of great meaning to today's society. One of Orwell&#8217;s most important points in his portrayal of society is how it fits the old adage that &#8220;Ignorance is bliss.&#8221; The citizens believe whatever the Inner Party members tell them because through ignorance they do not have to worry about the meaninglessness of their own lives. The choice between acting upon the truth and staying &#8220;blissfully&#8221; ignorant of it is one that Winston has to face, and he&#8212;-like the other millions of Outer Party members&#8212;-chooses to avoid the truth for a less physically painful life.This novel shows that the quest for individuality and freedom can often be a dangerous thing. By accepting the kind of euphoric idealism of modern society, one can quite ironically lose all meaningful freedom in the process.This book's prophecy is quite similar to that of Aldous Huxley's \\"Brave New World\\" (another excellent novel), in that they both try to point out that our increasing trend toward individual freedom, coupled with our materialistic attitudes and increasing lack of morality, are leading us down a path to a &#8220;Brave New World,&#8221; or a 1984 scenario. Of course, the feelies will most likely not become a part of our reality, and Thoughtcrime and memory holes are equally as unlikely. What is likely, however, is a new generation whose thought patterns could be very similar to that of Huxley&#8217;s Alphas: &#8220;Ending is better than mending.&#8221;The one question that remains unanswered in either of the two novels is whether it is worth trying to mend our rapidly conforming society, or to simply end all attempts at revealing the hideous face of ignorance that encumbers so many people today. Perhaps, as Orwell&#8217;s Inner Party slogan claims, ignorance really is strength, and those that believe themselves to be free truly are. However, as Huxley and Orwell agree, the &#8220;strength&#8221; of ignorance can never be compared to the power of truth.This is a novel that should be required reading in school. Everyone can benefit from Orwell's brilliant work, and every reader's life will be changed because of it."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Read this book! It's not only at once convincing and absorbing, but its also a reflection and an analogy to many things are in our society today. The novel it's hunting not only in the sense that the regime described could become reality (although it seems it would work I refuse to believe it) but because we can see a lot of it taking place today; in a much lessen degree off course. Things such as the lack of reasoning of the majority of people; the destruction of language by slang and the lack of reading; the dictatorship of ideas, dogmas and parameters of life by the \\"telescreen\\" (TV); the absent-mind of the people, where everyone is too absorbed in their day-to-day activities to know any better...The novel is also a lot of fun because we can virtually immerse ourselves in it, seeing it all to the least detail, to such an extent that we can breath the air, and feel in our skin even things that are not explicitly described in the book. Orwell's power is truly amazing, and this novel should be read by everyone, either for entertainment or deeper thoughts (ideally both). The only problem is you might have trouble sleeping at night, scared of having to wake up speaking \\"Newspeak!\\""},{"Title":"1984","review":"I'd recommend this book to anyone.

It does not just mean communism...it means US, too."},{"Title":"1984","review":"George Orwell's \\"Nineteen Eighty-Four,\\" is a hauntingly exceptional tale of a society gone wrong. Orwell has brought to light a situation that any society could potentially face if they aren't cautious. The main character Winston Smith lives in a totalitarian state to the \\"Party,\\" the dictators of the colony of Oceania. What makes this book so fascinating is the fact that is was published in 1948. Yet, the situations in this book still ring true today. Freedoms are constantly trying to be suppressed; privacy is a concern in today's society with the creation of the internet and cameras. It's remarkable to think that Orwell predicted a society that could potentially be an example for today's culture. Trying to imagine a world where every move you make is recorded and watched to control is not only terrifying because it sounds like it could happen, it's terrifying because one day it may eventually happen. I thoroughly enjoyed the book and would recommend it as a book that should be read in high school."},{"Title":"1984","review":"This is the sort of book that one should not read when feeling hopeless, or with cold, gloomy weather outside.

The points raised in the novel were horrifyingly believable, and were just the sort of thing to grind off unrealistic ideals in youngsters... and sharpen other ideals.No, I didn't enjoy this book at all - and I am very glad that I read it, and I recommend it to anyone who believes that \\"everything that a government desires is necessarily good.\\""},{"Title":"1984","review":"From the very first sentence to the last, this book held me on with wide eyes of horror and enthrallment, and a mouth drawn stupidly open at the books prophetic, almost clairvoyant vision of the future, at the magnificent power it holds within the text, the pages. When I finished, I closed the book, put it aside, and went to bed. It had such a profound, powerful, overwhelming effect on me, that I could not really think straight; it was overall depressing, and it left me spellbound. And I know, if you read it, it will leave you the same way too.The year is 1984.The world is now divided into only 3 main sections: Eurasia, Eastasia, and Oceania--the main setting of the story. There is no such thing as the U.S.A. or Canada or Australia or China anymore. It's all in those 3 divided places: Eurasia, Eastasia, and Oceania.The entire world is under the terrible, unbreakable grip of totalinarialism.Theres communism, of course...and theres totalinarialism...which is very much worse. While communists control most aspects of life for their people...totalinarialism controls ALL aspects of life for their people...and now in 1984, I don't know if it is sane or rational to call them 'people' anymore...it would be more fitting to call them, their 'slaves.'Everything is controlled by the Party or the main government system, with Big Brother, an ominous, mysterious creature being at the top of everything. Big Brother is eternal. Big Brother is invincible. Big Brother never dies. Big Brother will never die. Big Brother is watching you. Everywhere you look, every corner you possibly turn, everywhere you are, he is listening...and watching you...watching you to see if you make any mistakes, break any rules. If possibly, you are against the party, against Big Brother. To see if you commit any 'thought crimes', which are negative thoughts towards the party and Big Brother or thoughts of rebellion and rivalry towards them. They scan every possible inch of your face. From the emotion flickering in your eyes, from the gesture of your mouth and nose and skin contractions, from the actions of your throat...to see if there is any evil, any rebellion, any thoughts of hate toward the Party. For the party is invincible. Big Brother is invincible. They control you. You must obey them. Or else.But even if the thought police somehow don't catch you in the act of thought crime, there are always your sons or daughters, who will turn you in. There is no morality anymore in 1984. There is no sanity. There is no rationality. There is no freedom. That is all in the past...and the past is long gone forever.Now everything is based on these three rules of the Party:WAR IS PEACEFREEDOM IS SLAVERYIGNORANCE IS STRENGTHwhich are all examples of 'doublethink'(which I will explain a little later).It is the year 1984. And by then all Hell has broken loose...There is no such thing as 'plain English' anymore. That is known now in 1984, as 'Old Speak.' Now, there is something new and better and more efficient; something invented by the Party so that people will have less ways of speaking and writing and comprehending words; thus less thougths; thus again, less possibilities of negative, rebelling thoughts toward the Party. And that is Newspeak. Newspeak is the official language of Oceania, and to put it basically, is a deeply cut down and edited version of English or 'Old Speak.'For example, there are no adverbs anymore(quietly, peacefully, quickly, profoundly, words mostly ending in ly)and there are no synonyms of normal, everyday words, such as, 'splendin' or 'wonderful' or 'magnificent' all rooting back to the same thing; the same word; the same meaning, which is 'good.' Instead, to describe something 'very good' or as we call it, 'excelling' or 'exceptionally good', great in fact--they add a plus to the word good, to magnify it, if it needs it. Thus plusgood or very good, or doubleplusgood, meaning very very good, great, and so on.Every year more and more words are edited swifly and more and more words are 'vaporized' forever from the language--thus less words, less thoughts. In every way you could imagine, the Party, ultimately Big Brother is controlling all aspects of life, from the language, the way you talk, your thoughts, the way you think--with Doublethink(a mind technique where 2 contradictings thoughts come into one, and you accept both. For example, lets say you were a boy in actuality, but you used doublethink to think you are a girl, always have been a girl since you were born. You would need to have those 2 contradictings thoughts: \\"I am a girl\\" even though deep inside somewhere, you know \\"I am a boy\\", at once, accepting both. It even takes you to use doublethink in order to understand the concept, in the first place)where you live, always watching and listening what you are doing, and everything else in between. Life, humanity--mankind, as we know it--is going down the drain; blinded by pride, jealousy, selfishness. Trying to keep their audience as far from the truth of things, by keeping them afraid, paranoid, controlled; always with the sense of being watched and heard. Always.Now comes the protagonist of this horrific tale; Winston Smith. He is a middle-aged man, with a varicose ulcer on his ankle, and works for the Ministry of Truth. Or in actuality, since that is of course, an example of 'doublethink', it should be called, instead, 'The Ministry of Lies.' He is a reasonably normal, lonely, distraught man, with a secret. Which is a thought crime. He hates Big Brother. He hates the party. He wants to bring Big Brother down. He wants to bring down the party down. Down with Big Brother! he had written over and over in his diary. Down with Big Brother!When he meets O'Brien, one of his co-workers, his dream comes closer to actuality being commited to reality, and when he once again, meets the love of his life, Julia--the space from his dream and reality is magnified again, and so, he is one rung higher up the ladder from achieving what he wants. Which is, to throw down the party, to throw down Big Brother. Down with Big Brother!But the party is invincible...Big Brother is invisible...He is always watching...Always listening....no matter what........Big Brother is watching you.Although 1984, has long come and gone, Orwells nightmare vision of the future of man fate, under the terrible grip of totalinarialism and it's nasty results, stay as timely as ever, standing all by itself, as one of the greatest novels of all time.Like how it was quoted from the front flap of a hardcover edition of this book:\\"As timely as the label on a bottle of poison.\\""},{"Title":"1984","review":"Well I'm not going to waste time Kudo'ing on this douple-plus-genius classic. Suffice to say it was shattering to read over 25 years ago and mores' the pity if it not being taught at the High School level today.IF you want to gauge a person, simple draw a quote from the book and ask them: 'What is the definition of Power?'...State Orwells' answer as: 'The ability to make someone suffer'..and watch the person stiffen and change the subject..It is a piercing expose on the Human condition that could have been foiled with a single word as the protagonist 'Smith' was being interrogated: 'Do you believe in God'...he responds 'No.'. That answer, despite your religion/faith/higher-power beliefs resonates that the entire 'Negative Utopia' his tormentors, quite successfully present, could have been negated.

His hatred for Big Brother and his attempt at joining the rebelling Brotherhood ultimately ended in tragedy and he was captured, tortured and brainwashed. Orwell's gloomy depiction of life in Oceania (his future version of London) is realistic and convincing. The last section of the book is especially thought provoking and really sends chill to the spine. Overall, Orwell's vision of the future in 1984 is intense and highly disturbing. Although we all know by now that our 1984 (dominated by the MTV/big-hair/yuppie culture) has occurred very differently and that the end of the Cold War in the early 1990s marked the final triumph of liberal-democracy over socialism/Marxism, Orwell's \`1984' remains relevant today as a warning against a post-global age of resurging absolutism and religious fundamentalism. This book is highly recommended."},{"Title":"1984","review":"\\"1984\\" is the kind of novel that could possibly go unnoticed if given the choice to read it or another, more recent novel. However, after reading British novelist Eric Blair's (pseudonym \\"George Orwell\\") second novel, I am compelled to hail it as one of the best books that I have ever read.Orwell's infamous dystopia begins with the main protagonist, Winston Smith, climbing up a flight of stairs, his varicose ulcer hurting the whole way up. (Ironically, even his name is a readily apparent contradiction [one of many in \\"1984\\"]; his first name is that of the famed British prime minister and statesman Winston Churchill, but his last name is the most common last name in the English language. In that, he is both uncommon and common.) Smith works for the Ministry of Truth- which (can you sense the irony) produces most of the lies that the world of Oceania readily and blindly accepts as fact.His real problems begin when he receives a note from a coworker (or \\"comrade\\", as Inner Party members are required to refer to each other as), Julia (no last name, just Julia) saying just three words (which could automatically get her arrested by the horribly invasive Thought Police): \\"I Love You.\\" They meey many times throughout the novel and actually succeed in making love a few times. (Since the Party wants to destroy all vestiges of true love in its members' lives, Winston and Julia's overt acts of rebellion [i.e. the sex] are the ultimate blows against the society of Oceania.)But, like all things, their romance was not to last. Mr. Charrington, the person from whom Winston and Julia were renting their room (above his second-hand store), turns out to be a member of the Thought Police,and takes Winston off to be \\"healed\\". Through a brutal series of torture sessions from O'Brien, his supposed friend, he learns to \\"love Big Brother\\".Orwell's satire against the former Communist stranglehold on the nation of Russia is a clear reminder of what could happen if love and absolute truth are taken out of the picture and the government is given complete control over the lives of its citizens."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Oh my God, is all i could say as i read this.

So cruel and unhumane the treatment he recieved as he watched his decrepit body in the mirror. It was horrible, but also so powerful, i use that word alot becuase there is not another with the same sense that power leaves in our minds.I can only say that if you wish for truth you must read 1984and you will be left with the same impression,Oh My God"},{"Title":"1984","review":"I just re-read 1984. I had first read it some 40 years ago. It has lost none of its power and brilliance.The book is short by contemporary standards. You can get through it in one day. Notwithstanding its brevity, Orwell paints a rich and enrapturing picture of a bizarre and brutal world. You find yourself drawn into it - believing it. It is as if you are \\"there\\", trapped in a truly psychotic police state known as \\"Oceania\\". You find yourself fearing the things that the protagonists - \\"Winston\\" and \\"Julia\\" - fear as if you were experiencing their lives.The world that Orwell describes is strange to the point of being surreal. Nonetheless, he plays out the failings of the human condition with such brilliance, that you end up believing such a world could actually come to be. Even more importantly, you recognize elements of \\"1984\\" in ordinary day to day life. That is the reason why this book is such a masterpiece. Orwell - in truth - doesn't fantasize but rather hypothesizes a world where recognizable human weaknesses have synergized into mass insanity. He makes it believeable.In short, 1984 is one of the truly great accomplishments of twentieth century literature. It is the type of book that could affect a reader - as it did with me - for an entire lifetime."},{"Title":"1984","review":"+++++This novel by George Orwell (whose real name was Eric Arthur Blair, 1903 to 1950) is about the effects of totalitarianism. Totalitarianism is a characteristic of a government or state in which one political party maintains complete control under a dictatorship and bans all others.This story, which takes place in London in 1984, follows one man (named Winston Smith) and his love interest (Julia) as they struggle against this totalitarian party (\\"The Party\\") whose leader (actually dictator) is \\"Big Brother.\\" The Party political orthodoxy rules the giant country of \\"Oceania\\" (in which London is located).At the heart of this party's political orthodoxy is the process of controlling thought through the manipulation of language and information by the use of \\"Newspeak\\" which utilizes what is called \\"doublethink.\\"Newspeak is the official language of Oceania (but is not the only language spoken). It is a language that eliminates unnecessary words and is designed to diminish rather than help expressive thought. For example, Newspeak states that there is no good and bad but only good and \\"ungood.\\" Doublethink is the ability to simultaneously hold two opposing ideas in ones mind and believe in them both. The three Party slogans that title this review are examples of doublethink. Another good example is that (2+ 2 =4) and (2 + 2 = 5).The Party keeps everybody in line through Newspeak and doublethink. But they also have other methods. For example, they have the \\"Thought Police\\" that investigate \\"thoughtcrimes.\\" These are \\"crimes\\" of just having negative thoughts about The Party. Another example are telescreens that watch your every move even in bathroom stalls. Thus, \\"Big Brother is watching you\\" at all times.Winston and Julia are discovered to be guilty of thoughtcrimes by O'Brien (who is the personification of The Party). O'Brien also represents those leaders who use cruelty and torture as their primary method of control (like Hitler and Stalin did). He makes them pay for their \\"crimes.\\"This novel clearly shows how totalitarianism negatively affects the human spirit and how it's impossible to remain freethinking under such circumstances.This novel also contains an appendix written by Orwell. Here he explains various aspects of Newspeak and to my surprise he states that by the year 2050, Newspeak will be the only language that anyone will understand. Why does he state this? He wanted to keep the fear of totalitarianism alive in his readers well past the year 1984. (Thus, this novel is still quite relevant for today!)Finally, this novel in a word is fascinating! It is well written and is filled with symbolism and imagination. It begins slow but gradually picks up speed. And the story is very interesting.In conclusion, this novel is a masterpiece of political speculation that serves as a warning to us all. Read it for yourself to see why it brought Orwell world-wide fame!!(first published 1949; 3 parts or 24 chapters)+++++"},{"Title":"1984","review":"While many of the concepts in George Orwell's 1984 are complex to the point of being implausible, I believe there to be a sense of pragmatism in the text. It's as if Orwell is simply notating an absurd universe that he knows to be true, as if he were Nostradamus predicting the future. I definitely believe that there is a large degree of truth to the novel, just that our society today is much better than 1984's at masking the control factor. Amazon reviewer Daniel Hintzsche wrote, \\"George Orwell created a...chillingly credible dystopia. In our deeply anxious world, the seeds of unthinking conformity are everywhere in evidence; and Big Brother is always looking for his chance.\\" I absolutely agree with Hintzsche on this. I believe that there are many similarities between our seemingly perfect society and the totalitarian dystopia created in 1984.In another review, James P. Brett compares the book directly to today's government. He compares the \\"Two Minutes Hate\\" to the American reaction to Osama bin Laden. This comparison is eerily undeniable. In both instances, a political leader is revered almost to the point of idolatry, and an opposition to that leader is hated with a passion. It is far more obvious in 1984, but the similarity is indubitable.1984 does not, however, simply apply to today's society. The universal themes of the novel aren't restricted to the current decade. As reviewer Guy Tedesco states, \\"No matter what stage of life I am at the book reflects the times we live in. Politicians never change and always practice the art of deception.\\" If you were to have read this book when it was written, you would have compared it to communism, and Nazis. If you were to read this book in the seventies, you could have constructed detailed conspiracy theories. Or, you could even read it now, and compare it to the Bush administration, and the War on Terror. This novel is always relevant to the times, and will never cease to be.In conclusion, I think this book is very pertinent to our society, and should be read by everyone. It is a chilling dystopia that might just inspire us to go out and change the world for the better. Maybe...just maybe."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Orwell creates in writing for us, a world that we may, in fact, create for ourselves.

If you ever read only one book, &quot;2001&quot; must surely be it."},{"Title":"1984","review":"George Orwell's precient usage of potent imagery and insight have created one of the greatest books in the 20th century upon man's tragic destiny. Similiar to Huxley's view, the world of the future, even though set in the past, serves to remind us that not only we are the creators of our destiny, but the victims of it as well.

For those of you who haven't read the afterword by Erich Fromm, I highly recommend you do. He provides a much needed explanation for Orwell. This book offers a very important vision, one that needs due evaluation. If you read this account of the future, you must read Huxley's Brave New World, as he offers an alternative."},{"Title":"1984","review":"People who see this book as merely an attack on the farce that was Russian communism are missing the real point. 1984 is a warning about trends that can easily devlop in any political system, try the one we got here in the USA where we wage wars aganst virtually helpless nations in the name of 'humanitarianism'. (read: economic interests, yes kids, Vietnam taught the State Department to fear organized anti-war sentiment, which is why we need these elaborate and totally bogus rationalizations) Orwell always belived in social progress, he considered himself a socialist. 1984 was not meant to deny socialism (meaning a system that promotes soical equality) but to warn us of some prevalent inhumane political trends, among other things. (if you think socialism means absolute equality, you need to actually read some political theory)"},{"Title":"1984","review":"I've been doing a whole lot of reading since the end of school and 1984 by George Orwell is definitely the best book. 1984 is a classic I reckon, but it's as compelling a the best science fiction by Asimov or Crichton. I really enjoyed it. It's kind of disturbing at parts. I mean the way he accuses society in general, about how this society is sickly, and how all it does is separate people and suppress natural instincts. The best part of the whole book is the Vocabulary part. how the government was reducing the whole dictionary, eliminating words. It was amazing to realize what power words have. With words one can express his/her thoughts, that's why the government was abolishing words, to stop anything against the &quot;orthodoxy&quot; of the state. If you liked this book you may as well want to read Animal Farm by him, a satire of communism. Well enjoy.

As for comments made by another (American) reader, Orwell does not set out to somehow reveal a 'secret Communist agenda' and does not attempt to portray a Socialist government. Many references made throughout the novel actually highlight his opposition to fascism and the extreme right, after the devastation of World War II. While ultimately, Orwell successfully explores the impact of complete political control by a small elitist group over a general population, his work is deliberately politically non-specific. 1984 applies to a number of regimes based upon general terror, and not directly to Communism, which in many cases has arisen, and is sustained, through popular demand."},{"Title":"1984","review":"This was by far the best book i have ever read.

It was written in the late 40's and gives us view of what is to come in 1984(at least dealing witht the government). There are 3 main characters in this story,Winston Smith, Julia, and O'Brien. The story is about Big Brother(Government) watching over and listening to our thoughts at all times. Winston share his emotions with Julia. Winston finally dies in the end after excepting Big Brother. I wont tell you the whole story because you'll have to read it yourself."},{"Title":"1984","review":"There are two major types of morons in this world; Those who think 1984 is science-fiction and therefore should be full of action (It has no plot they say!)and those who believe that the entire premise of the novel is unfair because it denegrates poor old misunderstood communism.Firstly, Orwell's disturbing novel has an exceptional plot which is exquisitely crafted and gorgeously realised, it's just that most readers are too daft to comprehend it. Plot does not have to include massive progressions and a resolution which is life-affirming. Ultimately, fine plots are those which aren't obvious, which are overlooked by the lay reader who insists that reading should be as passive as the almighty television (bane of the stupid and spreader of more propaganda than any other device). Orwell's plot is in truth the major influence on this novel, followed by realistic characterisation.Secondly, Orwell's intention is quite obviously not to denegrate the theory of communism perse. In fact he was a member of the communist party as one other reviewer has already stated. Sadly however, that reviewer insisted (Probably because he/she is in his/her late teens or early twenties and attending university where the idea of communism is at the moment quite novel to him/her.)Orwell was soured by communism and didn't understand it as American communist's did not understand the party. To expect an intelligent person to believe that Orwell was incapable of understanding communism is remarkable in it's obscene stupidity. Furthermore to suggest an Englishman was incapable of understanding a theory which was developed in his own country is proposterous (Yes. Karl Marx lived for many years and died in England where he is buried.)While there are those who would suggest that Orwell is retaliating against communism, they are dreadfully inaccurate. Ultimately, what 1984 is about is a fear of all levels of politics and not merely communism.1984 is not about political propaganda but the human spirit. While the fascist power's of Big Brother are a lynchpin to the novel it is the squelching of the human spirit which is the over-riding theme. It's true, of course, that Orwell is satiring the communist Russia of the time but is this actually going to be considered an attack on the ideals of communism? Essentially, Orwell's point was that political powers could not possibly bring about utopia and that the communist ideal, while exceptionally dignified in theoretical terms, was subject to human nature and misuse. It is not communism but people who brought about the world of Oceania. Communism was just the political tool used along the way.The power in Orwell's novel can be missed by morons but never the informed reader. His vision is, today, as powerful as ever and a potent reminder of what any political system can achieve if misused, not just communism. 1984 is a study in human character and human frailty and it is only those who are disturbed by the stark truth of Orwell's vision that will not see both the power and the terror in his fictional world. Indeed the human spirit is infinitely malleable."},{"Title":"1984","review":"A case can certainly be made that 1984 is the greatest novel ever written. We know that the Modern Library infamously dubbed Ulysses the greatest novel of the last century even though most people find it completely unreadable. Too many critics and members of the intelligentsia equate impenetrability with greatness, probably thinking that the greatest novels must be aimed only at the gifted few.1984 lacks snob appeal and it is shockingly readable. I guess this is why it gets dissed with the #13 ranking on that list. Of course, my own criteria are different. In my opinion, the greatest novels should at the very least be great reads. Nothing is more audacious or ambitious than setting out to write a page turner that happens to carry a thought-provoking and devastating message. Or, put another way, what's the point of burying your message in a book that no one can read? I've never read Ulysses, but I think I can say that 1984 is simply a better novel because part of what a novel must do is thread its message through a plot that the reader actually can and wants to follow.1984 is a thriller. It is part sci-fi and part fantasy. But of course its is meant to convey the feel of an actual political system that dominated half the globe at the time of its writing. Unlike Animal Farm, which is kind of a roman a clef of the Russian Revolution, the events and characters of 1984 are not meant to correspond directly to events and persons in the Soviet Union in the late 40's. Big Brother is, of course, Stalin. But that comparison is easier to make in retrospect since no Soviet leader was nearly as Big Brother-like as Stalin. But I imagine that Big Brother is meant to evoke any totalitarian leader rather than a particular one. The fact that 1984 does not simply follow history is a major strength since it allows Orwell's imagination to run wild.As you read 1984, you experience the oppression that a citizen in a totalitarian state must feel every day. Orwell conveys many of the brutal tactics of such a state: the neverending assault of propaganda, the isolation of individuals, the destruction of truth and memory. And all in service of a great plot.Perhaps the reason that a book like Ulysses outranks 1984 is that 1984 is ultimately not about a big enough subject. Ulysses after all is about \\"consciousness,\\" or something like that. While 1984 is a perfect evocation of the central political story of the 20th Century, maybe that's just not ambitious enough. But I submit that 1984 is about something much larger. It is about the power of language and the power to control others through language. Central to the plot, of course, is the regime's creation of newspeak and the goal of constantly reducing the number of words available to the citizenry. Simply, the book equates words with freedom, which is a pretty big idea.Anyhow, when I first read 1984, I thought there were two flaws: First, I thought that the \\"reprinting\\" of Emmanuel Goldberg's manuscript was unecessary since it was really just a rehash of things Winston already knew and which were already confirmed to the reader. That part slows the pace of the novel. I still think that's a flaw. The other problem I had was that Orwell ultimately abandons the pitch-black humor that he injects throughout the first two thirds of the book. I no longer have a problem with that. Simply you can't have your cake and eat it. The ending is what it is and it works.Another interesting thought about the ending is this. In retrospect we know the actual fate of the Soviet Union. We know that if a totalitarian system develops a few cracks it must ultimately collapse. But in 1949, the Soviet Union probably looked as impregnable and invincible as Oceania. Which would make this book that much more chilling if read when it first came out.Finally, I'm not sure if 1984 is the greatest novel of all time. It may not even be my favorite. But certainly a case can be made for putting it at the top of the all-time list."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Orwell does something interesting with this book - more interesting even than Animal Farm, a truly wonderful allegory. While Animal Farm seems to do nothing more than colorfully reiterate history, 1984 provides some amazing thoughts on the nature of the nearly perfect totalitarian society (the exemplar form of such a society can be found in Huxley's Brave New World) and the people who control it.While the novel feels dated (the overalls, the proles, the characters), it doesn't hinder the book at all. Detailing an alternate society which began to back peddle after World War II, 1984 is meant to feel dated. With no advancements, an inhumane government, and persistent war, it is no wonder Oceania never pulled itself out of pre-war ideologies and modes. It is a poor representation of what we now think of as \\"the future\\": that shiny metallic world of Blade Runner or Star Wars (or Amazing Tales in Orwell's time). Orwell never meant to write a science fiction novel, but rather a warning in a world in which totalitarian states had yet to be squelched.The book progresses through four stages: first there is an introduction to Oceania and its ways of life, beginning just in the same way most science fiction book begins, with little plot development or action; next comes a long character study (I won't provide too many details) which steps away from the descriptions which make up the first stage; then Orwell gives us a nice solid plot which we believe will quickly take us to the end; and finally a finale which would have been difficult to top. The end is exciting, emotional, and thought-provoking, and ties up the earlier stages of the book nicely - something few books are capable of doing.Oh, and by the way: when reading this one, be sure to buy a cheap copy and to carry around a highlighter. This book is chocked full of great quotes (literally pages and pages). If you're interested in politics, government, and human nature, this very well may become your Bible. I didn't do this and I may just have to go over it one more time."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Somehow, 1984 strikes a nerve deeper than any other book I have ever had the pleasure of reading. Its ideas the ideas of its main character, Wilson, as well as its author, George Orwell, provide a deep perception into the organization of modern politics. All generations can enjoy this story, a story that will definitely never go out of date. It's characters are identifiable and its ending, one as shocking as any, provides a look at the life that Wilson must lead, and the life that many of the stroy's readers go through every day."},{"Title":"1984","review":"I find it funny that almost all of the reviews are 4-5 stars, or 1 star (with a few exceptions). Personally, 1984 is among my favorite books and is my favorite of the utopian/dystopian genre of books. No, I am not a paranoid McCarthyist nut--in fact I am an anarchist. However, I see a profound message in 1984 that is as relevant today as it was when it was first published in 1949. Among those who rated the book poorly, I found the following types of criticism:1. &quot;Oh, the book is too boring, too long, not enough action, too much description, hard to read, blah, blah, blah.&quot; To you I have one thing to say: Grow up. This book is less than 300 pages, significantly shorter than your average novel. Sure, it was longer than Animal Farm, Brave New World or any of the other books that fill the ranks of the genre, but only because it contained so much more.2. &quot;It was disgusting, the story was poor, Orwell is stupid/depraved, etc.&quot; I personally felt that the story was magnificent, and much more detailed than any similar book, but that is of course only my opinion. Every part of the story had intricate meaning. The sex scenes were vital, for they showed the importance of lust, and how they were defying the state by putting their lusts--not love, mind you--but sexual desires ahead of the will of the state. The torture scenes depict the degenerated position they forced him into--the only what they could break the will of someone so intent on either freedom or martyrdom.3. &quot;Orwell is just playing on Cold War paranoia to make a buck, he doesn't even know what communism is, he is plagerizing other people's work, the message isn't important anymore.&quot; I cannot see is how somebody could claim that he was working with a worn out subject or playing on Communist paranoia. It was published in 1949--the Cold War had only really been in existence for 2 years and very few people had any idea what was going on within the Soviet Union, much less the inspiration to writing about it. Furthermore, to those who think he was ignorant of the tenet of Communism, he was not. He was a member of the Communist party for a period of time in his life and he was neither stupid nor ignorant. He was both aware of what Communism was and was able to comprehend it and its implications. Furthermore, as he has said himself, he was NOT parodying Communism or socialism, but the totalitarian state that had arose in Russia and spread to its satellites, and which was masquerading as Communism (obviously what is depicted within the book is not Communism but a fascist society where the state controls commerce). Communism is a political system by which the state controls real estate and industry in order to ensure the rights of workers. Ideally, it isn't even totallitarian, but democratic, in political function. One reviewer I saw ignorantly proclaimed that Communism was an automated society where robots did all the work, right after claiming that Orwell was ignorant. Such hypocrits.In conclusion, all I can say is that, if you're, stupid, ignorant and close-minded, by all means don't get this book, for it is far beyond your comprehension. However, if you are a reasonably intelligent person that doesn't need car chase scenes to hold your attention so long as there is a good story and a strong message, then this book is for you!"},{"Title":"1984","review":"A number of reviews have stated that this work is dated and irrelevant today. It would be wise to realize how this is completely opposite of the truth. Doublespeak has dominated American life, such as the Gulf War in which war meant peace, and misery truly meant happiness. Power and money rule, and it could definitely be argued that we live under a totalitarian system of control in America. Beware of power.

In this time (2001), we have our &quot;Two Minutes Hate&quot; with Osama bin Laden.Many of the principles that Orwell writes about (e.g., thought control) are done in a quite blatant way in the book. In the real world of the 20th/21st century they're done, only much more subtly. That way, we don't know they being perpetrated on us.Here's how 1984 applies to current events:WAR IS PEACEThe new &quot;War on Terrorism&quot; is being sold as a guarantor or our safety. While this war is being waged, we're to accept permanent war as a fact of life. As the unavoidable slaughter of innocents unfolds overseas, we are told to go back to &quot;living our lives.&quot;FREEDOM IS SLAVERY&quot;Freedom itself was attacked,&quot; Bush said. He's right, though here's the twist: Americans are about to lose many of their most cherished freedoms in a frenzy of paranoid legislation. The government wants to tap our phones, read our email and seize our credit card records without court order. Further, it wants authority to detain and deport immigrants without cause or trial. To save freedom, we have to destroy it.IGNORANCE IS STRENGTHAmerica's &quot;new war&quot; against terrorism will be fought with unprecedented secrecy, including press restrictions not seen for years, the Pentagon has advised.When you read this book, you'll be better able to see the signs around you. The world portrayed by Orwell may well come to pass by the end of this century."},{"Title":"1984","review":"I'm glad I read this book. It was a fascinating read on the complexities of strict government control. But the story is really more than about government, and it's strict control over the populace. It's about the psychology of humans and living in a society with limited personal freedoms.What I struggled with was the persistent inner-monologue. This book is written like most 20th century literature and is loaded with the protagonist basically thinking/talking to himself for long periods of time, which, to me, can be quite boring and hard to read.Maybe it's because my generation and I'm not used to such writing styles. Most movies and books these days have more action, more conversation and less inner-monologue. Good or bad, that's the way it is.Otherwise, this lived up to hype and icon status that it is known for."},{"Title":"1984","review":"I read this book 30 years ago, and I couldn't believe a Government in total control of people's memories and opinions.

It's a real eye-opener for people living in the United States in 2012."},{"Title":"1984","review":"One of my favorite classics that I, even though it is very depressing, recommend anyone interested in reading to read this book.Set in a nightmarish London of 1984 &#8211; we see life in a totalitarian state through the eyes of a single character, Winston Smith, who dares to standup against the notorious &#8211; notorious in our world &#8211; Big Brother in his own ways, through little defiant acts, such as keeping a journal stating his disapproval with his world and the government, to sneaking off and having sex with a woman for pleasure which is looked down upon as sex is only seen as a necessary for procreation.In this world, Freedom was only attained through total obedience to the Party, and the love of Big Brother, who watched you at all times. Winston works as a functionary of the Ministry of Truth where history is rewritten to favor the Party&#8217;s line summed up beautifully by the Party&#8217;s slogan &#34;Who controls the past controls the future: who controls the present controls the past.&#34; A little at a time Winston begins to realize that things are not as they should be and that those things should be changed. This book is drowned in hopelessness, but it is something we all need to read and keep close to our hearts, because during these troubling times it is too easy to forget how easy it is to fall into the trap that leads to Socialism to Communism to Totalitarianism.With today&#8217;s technology, Big Brother is a real threat and with the Government growing larger and larger the world of 1984 can become our future &#8211; if we are not careful."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Orwell tells a story about Winston Smith, a man living in the utopian world of 1984!

(Big Brother) Orwell himself a socialist, offers intelligent and passionate reflections of his anxieties. Read this novel before grabbing a 'why the USSR broke' book written by some self rightous Political Science phd. who unwittingly butchers Orwells 'big brother' to fit his narrow understanding. Not that there aren't good books on Soviet and Russian History, which you may want to look for after reading 1984"},{"Title":"1984","review":"I'm glad I finally read this book. It was a bit of a depressing read because certain parts reminded me of our current political climate. But the concepts of doublethink, thoughtcrime, and so on are definitely food for thought. In the week or so since I finished reading it, I've found myself thinking about those concepts, in particular when I see an ad or something that says exactly the opposite of what it really is (the \\"Clear Skies Act\\" comes to mind right now)."},{"Title":"1984","review":"What a strange title for a review. I hated this book when I had to read it in High School (along with \\"A Brave New World\\" and \\"Animal Farm\\"). It wasn't I couldn't understand the story, but rather, the \\"Meaning\\" of the story was being thrust down our throats. I grew up in the time of fear of Communism overtaking the world, where people even feared their own government (it was during Vietnam and all the riots at universities; where anti-war people were voicing their opinions, etc) and every teacher I had was seeing this as some \\"sacred prophesy\\" of time to come. At University I had to study it, and write a lengthy discussion on its intended meanings. Interestingly, as I researched the novel I discovered that the date was not some \\"futuristic prophesy\\" but rather a reversal of the date 1948, and much of the things mentioned in the book were common practice at that time and even before it during the war.I was completely put off this book and all those other futuristic books because they viewed society as nothing but a group of mindless nothings doing what the government told them to do. And I considered how long I had to wait for that horrible year, that prophetic year to arrive. Surely someone would improve on society and not destroy it.As years passed, and the \\"inevitable date\\" arrived, the world didn't stop, the mind control wasn't happening, and well, we were able to think as we wanted to. Obviously the book was not prophesy. Communism fell so all the books decrying that \\"evil way of life\\" became empty and their content no longer important.So, what makes the book worth while now? It is not what it is saying was happening in Britain at that time (though it was telling us a bit of the truth), it is not its warning about Communism or even society in the future; it was it warning about what happens in life to us when we allow ourselves to give into the propoganda of governments, media, and whoever you may think of, even the super right wing, and allow them to tell us what to think, and control what we do.In order for us to do that, we have to actually pretend the truth around us is not so, we have to decide what we hear is more real than what we live, see, and experience. It is that sort of \\"pretending\\" that Windston, the main character, simply cannot do. That truth to self does get him in the end, for that sort of mental and emotional independence is seen as a threat to the society he is living in. What Orwell was telling his reader was simply, when we allow ourselves to accept the \\"pretty lie\\", to believe as we are told to believe, to conform when it means giving up our very ability to think and understand, we create the soil for such a society to exist. We create the world that lets in sterility of thought, that allows massive belief of whatever we are told (like what Hitler did regarding the Jews); we allow society to control us, to think for us, and to tell us what value we hold. All these things contribute to create a society devoid of creativity, conscience, direction, meaningful life, and of compassion and caring. Society becomes cold, calculating, and inhuman. His book is exploring what a society is really like when those \\"virtues\\" become its heart.Now that the book has been stripped of its \\"prophetic revelations\\" and all those other trappings that teachers thrust on it (that made it a real pain to enjoy to read), I have discovered a profound thought, one far deeper than the fear of \\"Big Brother\\" or of Communism; a society devoid of real thinking, self-determined people becomes no society at all, no matter how \\"perfect\\" it may seem on the surface.Orwell used what he knew, the experiences of his day, and they are just as applicable to our day as they were back then in war torn England. And we are being sold the same bill of goods. Sadly, though, we buy into them because of our fear of what could be. And so did the characters in the society Orwell described. They did as they were told because even that discomfort was better than the imagined threat life had to offer them. Are we not told we must endure the \\"never ending war on terror and through never-ending war we will be at peace?\\" Are we not told that by giving up our freedoms and our ability to think and openly express our views, even our opposition to government policy, we are helping protect our freedoms?\\" Are we not told what to think, including our \\"fat police\\" out there who want to regulate even what we eat (very 1984, I have to add)? What he described is, we are a society where we let and allow others to tell us what to think, how to act, and we gladly give up our agency to choose, because, if we can put the responsibility on someone else, we feel freed from any guilt when things fail. The exaggerated technical controlling of the people may not yet be a reality, but the ideological controlling of people is now our reality.I agree with many reviewers, this book is a book of our time, even if we have to strip it of all the past interpretations and fears to get to the substance of the message. The book increases in meaning with age."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Doublethink and Newspeak need no explanation to people growing up with a Patriot Act that takes away liberties. We don't need the brilliant economic explanation that Orwell provides for the state of perpetual war with constantly changing enemies...But it's amazing how \\"1984\\" keeps popping up on enigmatic posters at recent antiwar rallies with references to doubleplusgood wars and war equalling peace and freedom equalling slavery.

The slogan that &quot;freedom is slavery&quot; and &quot;war is peace&quot; is a constant theme within the story, and Orwell's explanation of war being a mere political and economic tool is exactly correct, as has been demonstrated by vietnam and the korean conflict, as well as other US military involvements. His description of the government being an all-powerful, all-knowing entity is not entirely too far off from the communistic governments of today. What is amazing is that Orwell wrote the book in 1949, projecting what life would be like 35 years later, and he was not very far off in his assessment. The amount of freedom that people have has drastically been reduced in society, as is the case in 1984. Telescreens which can see and listen to people's private lives are the norm in a world where nothing is secret and almost anything is a crime against the State. The main character, Winston Smith, spends the entire novel realizing that this is the case. Orwell's 1984 is truly a fairly accurate portrayal of the social and governmental conditions that are present in todays society"},{"Title":"1984","review":"Why do they make high school kids, whose lives are already fraught with uncertainty and uneasiness, read such depressing books? I suppose back in the 1950&#34;s this was a fresh new picture of totalitarianism, but today pick up any newspaper and you see this story all over our modern world. It's not that I think Orwell isn't relevant, it's just that I think high school English teachers could do a little research, find books that are well-written, expand horizons, but that lift people up, not depress them. Maybe books that would help kids, at their vulnerable age, to laugh, become wiser, and look at others with more compassion. &#34;Cold Sassy Tree&#34; comes to mind. Something with warmth, humor and wisdom, rather than bleakness."},{"Title":"1984","review":"While 1984 is now considered a cautionary tale about totalitarianism, it should be remembered that Orwell was an ardent socialist. Perhaps the most important (and least discussed) element of the story of 1984 is the doublethink of its author: Orwell's ability to condemn an outcome, while advocating its cause. Even as Orwell portrayed the corruption of socialist government in Animal Farm and the cruelty of totalitarian government in 1984, he insisted that these are perversions of socialism, rather than the inevitable fruit of socialism.This is the same foolish idea as Marx had; that human nature is malleable and can be forced to adapt to a socialist zeitgeist. Sadly, many people suffer the same delusion today; believing that government has the right to mold human nature rather than the responsibility to yield to human nature and respect our natural rights. Socialists do not like that human nature opposes slavery (i.e. socialism) and insist that with enough socialist indoctrination and through the force of socialist government, human nature can be remade to love subjugation.When we look to the troubling conclusion in which the rebellion is crushed and minds are retrained by imprisonment and indoctrination, it appears to be a break from the tradition of a successful resolution for the hero of the novel. Could it be that this was a successful conclusion in the mind of a socialist? Just as Brave New World ended with society purging its misfits from its midst, 1984 ends with the arrest and reeducation of its misfit.Could it be that socialists are so wedded to their ideology that they have lost the ability to sympathize with human rights to liberty and freedom of conscience and would rather sympathize with the State? What if the ending reveals that the hero of a socialist novel was never meant to be the individual; is the hero in fact the State?"},{"Title":"1984","review":"Orwell was dead-on in his vision of a possible future for the Western world.

In this dystopian future, Great Britain is part of an ideological superstate that maintains a totalitarian grip on society that is all-encompassing, with the population being monitored by round-the-clock surveillance, with government agencies that control all aspects of daily life, and with the very language manipulated to stifle un-approved thinking. It's the story of Winston Smith, who dreams that it might just be possible to oppose \\"the Party\\" and bring about change, and it's about the lessons he learns about the true nature of power in the modern world.I first read this book in 1988, and while I did find it interesting, I thought that it went too far in expanding the Communist system of oppression to the entire world. But, watching the world around me I am astounded to find that Mr. Orwell's dystopia is actually beginning to have its echoes in my reality. I reread the book, and was surprised at just how prescient the book really was. The government wishing to monitor people without search warrants, the limitless laws that seem to reach into every aspect of everyday life, and even the manipulation of language to remove certain words or ideas as \\"politically incorrect.\\"Just how much does this book reflect reality? For those who would lead us, is it true that, \\"power is not a means, it's an end\\"? Is it true that, \\"If you want a vision of the future...imagine a boot stamping on a human face forever\\"? Or perhaps it's a boot on a human neck?Whether this book is a prescient look at a future that is already being built, or a piece of doomsayer literature that goes too far, it is a classic of English literature that cannot be ignored. I find this to be one of the most interesting and disturbing books that I have ever read, and it is definitely one that I think should be read by EVERYONE."},{"Title":"1984","review":"This book was AWESOME. I had to read it over the summer for class, and I was totally bummed out because I had already spent half the summer reading other really old, lousy books for the same class, but I really liked this one!

The storyline was different, and though I was sort of expecting some of the events, they were still surprising and realistic. The end was also really interesting, and I wasn't expecting it to end how it did. Read it, it's a classic, and it's really good!"},{"Title":"1984","review":"Volumes have been written about this book, so it's hard to add something new to everything that has been said about it. So I'd like to emphasize one aspect of 1984 that in my opinion is often overlooked when people discuss this masterpiece. Quite often, this book is criticized for things like simplicity of its plot or flat dialog. Whether you agree or disagree with this kind of criticism (I personally disagree) I think reviews like this totally miss the point. Yes, there are books with more compelling characters, with much more sophisticated plots and with more complex relationships. But this is not the reason 1984 stays popular. What make this novel special is its masterful portrayal of totalitarianism.Majority of modern Western readers who open 1984 have no personal experience with totalitarianism and very vague idea of this kind of society actually means. Sure, we all read news about countries like North Korea, but we read on the same page that talks about Kim Kardashian's marriage. It takes a book like 1984 -- and there aren't many books like this -- to show true horrific nature of totalitarian society. When you read this book you can almost feel how suffocating a society like this is. You nearly experience the monstrosity of a place where even thinking about something forbidden is a crime and where the state completely owns its citizens. The book reminds us that societies like this have always existed and helps us appreciate the freedom we have a little more.This is what makes 1984 special and this is why this book stays relevant for decades."},{"Title":"1984","review":"In a society that has eliminated many imbalances, surplus goods, and even class struggle, there are bound to be deviates; Winston Smith is one of those.

I listened to this book during my deliveries via audiobook. It took me quite a few attempts to actually indulge myself into the story, but once I managed it, I found myself wishing to know more. The book is QUITE slow in the beginning. The whole point is to build up an understanding of why Big Brother is hated. The author puts so much time and words into this, that there is no way you can miss it. By the time it is apply, you are hooked. The climax hooks you in and makes you go page after page in a sitting.The ending.... oh my. You just don't see it coming. I give Orwell Kudos for daring to go there, but you just can't be prepared for it.The point of books like this... is to have you turn the back cover over, with a burning in your stomach and a feeling tingling through your nerves. This book accomplishes this. You leave the book feeling content, yet angry, yet sad, yet longing. You wish for more, but you have to be content with what you were given.A lesson you learn from Big Brother."},{"Title":"1984","review":"I read this book while living in South Korea, about an hour away from North Korea. The more I read the more I realized that this is what life is like for those living across the border. I don't normally read fiction books, but this was one that sucked me in. I couldn't put it down. I read Animal Farm in High School but for some reason never got round to reading any more of his work. Orwell's characters are 3 dimensional and very believable. Julia's character reminded me a lot of the Gen-Y youth of today.The book is depressing, but also has some underlying positive messages. Sadly, Winston loses his will and thus his capacity for emotions after being tortured for a prolonged period of time. As I read this part I found myself getting more and more angry with his captors. They methods were unjust, and they not only dehumanized Winston and the others, but also themselves. They became like animals. Reminded me of Dostoevsky \\"If God is dead all things are permissible.\\" The Party wins in the end, and turns Winston into their slave. But on the positive side, the Party had to expend an enormous amount of energy and time to convert just one person. I kept asking myself why the didn't kill him and just be done with it? Why all the effort. The best answer I came up with was that Winston was no use to them dead, and that if he died as a heretic they would have lost. They would not have had total power, hence the need to break him in the last frontier: His mind, his will and his emotions. This reminded me of the Christian martyrs in the first century AD, who refused to bow to Caesar and went to the deaths bowing to God alone. The Party would never have tolerated that of course.The book is depressing but an absolute must read. At the end I had more questions than answers and I was compelled to have them answered. I searched out the Spark-notes and other resources on the net. Any book that does that is doing what a good book should. One last thing, I don't know if Orwell intended this but throughout the course of the book I became more convinced that smaller governments with less power were better for society."},{"Title":"1984","review":"This is such a grim, frightening and scary book by George Orwell. Set in 1984, it depicts a horrible society where Big Brother (the government) is always watching and you can be punished for \\"thought crimes.\\" There is no freedom at all, and it is just a really punishing and strict society. Winston Smith tries to rebel against the government, and meets two people, Julia, a young woman who hands him a note reading, \\"I love you\\" and O'Brien, a mysterious man at his workplace. One of these people betrays him, and, against his own instincts, he betrays the other.This is a pretty engaging and suspenseful book, though like I said, it was quite grim, and I think I preferred Animal Farm, as it was more effective in terms of the point Orwell was trying to make and was not quite so grim.

Undoubtedly, when the reader finishes 1984, the last four words are going to draw a line for them; that line will be the one that demarcates whether the reader is a socialist (that the power of production in society lies in the hands of the state) or a capitalist (that the power of production in society should lie in individuals). The brief bio at the beginning of the novel states that Orwell himself was a socialist...this is a strange thing to have to hear because you get the feeling that the novel is not pulling for that side, nor the other.Because that is the strange greatness that is this novel- it pulls for nothing, gives no easy answers, and least of all holds back on the literary punch that it delivers. Some novels put forth a question then attempt to answer it (Dostoevsky's 'The Idiot' is one such attempt) and they are great for their own pattern. 1984 is of the other milieu, giving us only a large, unanswered question which is bound to divide us as much as it helps us to see the problems which we all face.I've not talked much about the plot of the book, nor the characters to this point. To this I must simply say: why should I? The plot and characters, the whole course of the book...they are all contained in what I've already said. This is not a book, it is a problem, a deep philosophical/sociological one which cannot be pinned down. The novel uses its characters and their situations to stake out the nature of its presentation, and then leaves the reader to wade through it on their own once it is finished. It is a disturbance in the mind, one that is significant more so today than ever before- What is the nature of government and its intrusion into life (the NSA situation)? What controls should be placed on the individual (abortion, censorship, euthanasia)? What form should punishment take (torture in the US run detention camps)?By the time you finish the book, you're going to be thinking about these questions and several more. Hopefully you will want to find answers, though doing so is no easy task; these are intentionally hard questions, aimed at all strata of society, ones that will stick with you the older you get, facing you every time you look at your pay stub and think about where your effort goes.And again, the cultural significance of this novel cannot be understated. It has already pervaded our daily lives in such a way that we might take for granted; from the lyrics in songs (who controls the past now, controls the future), to the shows on television (Big Brother), one cannot help but to see 1984 all around us, so ingrained into our lives that we might overlook the impact it has made.Bottom line: this is required reading in many schools for a reason. Every person should be made to read this book.-LP"},{"Title":"1984","review":"George Orwell wrote this novel in 1948 (reversing the last two digits for the title) as a foreshadowing of what the world will be in 1984 if totalitarian regimes are not kept in check. Orwell had written some other essays and books on similar lines, warning against the dangers of oligarchy, but 1984 is especially gloomy and frightening. Perhaps, as pointed out by some other reviewers, his illness at the time of writing had something to do with it.The new regime in Orwell's 1984 controls a part of the world called Oceania, and is not only at constant war with the two other powers - Eurasia and Eastasia (both with doctrines indistinguishable from Oceania) - but also exercises complete control over its individuals through four ministries: the ministry of truth, the ministry of peace, the ministry of plenty, and the ministry of love which are in reality responsible respectively for lies, war, starvation, and torture. For the party, the individuals do not exist, only the party - with its nominal head: the Big Brother - exists. History is altered on a regular basis to suit the current policies of the party one of whose slogans is: \\"Who controls the past controls the future: who controls the present controls the past.\\" The official language of the party is Newspeak whose vocabulary keeps on decreasing every year with the aim that fewer the number are words are, the easier it is to manipulate the minds of individuals.Fortunately, the dystopian society predicted by Orwell has not become a reality, but for the people living in 1940s and 50s, something like this must have seemed a frightening possibility in wake of German Nazism and Russian Communism. But, at the same time, Orwell's warning is still relevant to all the dogma and doctrines that call for the complete and total submission of individuals to some higher authority, and also to the advancement of technology, which if misused, can become powerful tools in the hands of a few to control the freedom of others."},{"Title":"1984","review":"George Orwell's classic novel, 1984, is set in a grim world where life is stripped down to its basis. Winston Smith, the main charachter, is just one of many Outer Party members, those who live under the support of the government, but also live under many government restrictions. The government controls everything, and Big Brother sits at the top of a totalitarian society. In the mind of Winston, Big Brother watches all. Winston differs from many of the Outer Party in the fact that he remembers the past. He can recall that years earlier, Oceania, the massive third of the world formed by the Americas, Australasia, and Airstrip One(Great Britain), was at war with Eastasia, another massive sect of the globe. Yet, in the year 1984, Oceania wars with Eurasia, and has always warred with Eurasia. The Government, enforced by the Thought Police, controls even the past. Any history is changed in accordance with current events. If Oceania is at war with Eurasia, it has always been at war with Eurasia. Any evidence that suggests otherwise is destroyed at once.Winston slowly becomes aware of the wrongdoings of the Party, and seeks out ways to defy it. He first purchases a diary and begins writing in it, which, although not directly forbidden, is an act of thoughtcrime. He even subconsciously writes pages of the phrase \\"DOWN WITH BIG BROTHER\\". As his awareness progresses, he takes increasing risks. He returns to the store where he purchased the diary, and buys a piecce of coral encased in glass. This makes him feel connected to the beauty of the past. The largest of these risks is his secret love affair with another Party member. He is later contacted by a man by the name of O'Brian, and inner party member. Winston and his lover meet with this cryptic figure and discuss a secret rebellion called the Brotherhood. Winston and Julia immediately join in the hope of bringing the Party to its knees.All in all, this book expresses Orwells deep fear of what the world is becoming. In this grim novel, war is constant, and neverending. I would imagine that is what the outcome of World War II would seem like. It also expresses the fear of a totalitarian rule that strips life down to its bare essentials. The Party tries to make this seem like a benefit for the entire society, but in reality, all the Party wants is the power to stay in power. It is almost a grim prediction of the rise of communism. The government, in essence, is almost similar to that of the Soviet Union. This everlasting war can easily be compared to the Cold War.

Winston Smith works on changing past newspapers and other documents to make them doctrinally consistent with the short term needs of the party running Oceania, INGSOC. Thus documents are changed to make it seem that Oceania has always been at war with one of the two other nations of the world, Eurasia and in an alliance with EastAsia, the other nation; similarly is the construction when Oceania goes to war with EastaAsia. Similarly documents will be changed that have some INGSOC official uttering an inaccurate prediction about economic performance so that the official will have originally made an accurate prediction.. Documents are changed to eliminate mention of former favored party members after they fall out of favor and are sent to a forced labor camp or are \\"vaporized.\\" Winston and other bureaucrats throw doctrinally inaccurate documents into the \\"memory hole\\", a chute, attached to his cubicle where they are sent down to the inner recesses of the government building to be burned.Party members have in their homes and offices \\"telescreens\\" where they receive propaganda, are led in mandatory morning exercises but through which are also watched by officials for suspicious facial expressions, or any activity that might indicate independence of mind or feelings of love, enthusiasm or any other human emotion that are not directed at Big Brother, the possibly non-existent ruler of Oceania. People who exhibit such tendencies towards \\"thought crimes\\" are immediately arrested, executed or released back into society brainwashed and then rearrested and shot or sometimes sent to a forced labor camp.INGSOC indoctrination ensures that its party members will not be able to not think logically and instead be completely subordinated to their emotions, which are completely engrossed in worshipping Big Brother. \\"Doublethink\\" is what is called the ability of the INGSOC party member to somewhat recognize the logical fallacies and outright falsehoods the party propagates as truth. At the same time such fallacies and falsehoods are accepted as the truth because one's emotions are trained to accept the party's pronouncements as truth whatever common sense says. Thus, it is easy to accept that two plus two equals five when logic says two plus two equals four. Or to not see anything wrong in the Ministry of Torture being officially called \\"The Ministry of Love,\\" The ministry of truth management/propaganda, etc, where Winston works, as \\"The Ministry of Truth, and so on. Or to have the party denounce the original ideals of socialism while declaring itself to be a repository of socialist purity. Logic seems to be only tolerated when examining the crimes of official enemies of Oceania.The bigger one's vocabulary is, of course, the more one can utilize it to articulate opposition to the party; so INGSOC wants to keep Newspeak-the language it is developing--and the remaining use of \\"Oldspeak\\"-old standard English-- as small as possible. In Newspeak there is no bad to good. Instead bad is called \\"ungood,\\" \\"very good\\" in oldspeak is called \\"doubleplusgood.\\" INGSOC indoctrination and throwing old documents and dictionaries down the \\"memory hole\\" has made \\"freedom\\" have no political connotations but only is defined as in the sentence \\"She was now free from the illness.\\" Most documents before 1960 are sent down the memory hole or like the Declaration of Independence, altered to express doctrines of INGSOC.Orwell is not just talking about Stalinism in this book. He sort of touches on elements of our own society. The bottom eighty five percent of Oceanic society, the non-party members are called \\"Proles\\", for Proletarian. The Proles are far less constrained by party discipline than INGSOC members produces for them and encourages them to consume dumb popular songs, pornography, trashy novels, play lotteries.. They are encouraged to jingoist frenzies where they attack foreigners and watch parades where they can jeer at foreign POW's and so on. All this distracts them from organizing to seize economic and political justice for themselves. They are still economically enslaved as they were under capitalism.The sort of Trotsky of the story, Goldstein, notes that Oceania's rulers want to keep throwing resources into war-making so as not to have to divert them to making an equitable standard of living for the masses. Erich Fromm notes in his 1961 Afterward notes a few examples of how we in the U.S. practice \\"doublethink.\\" He gives the example of the person who works for Corporation A and defends its products and everything about it as perfect regardless of what one's common sense might say. However the person will attack his employer's rival corporation B, trying logically to look for flaws in the latter's products and so on. Then the person might switch to employment in corporation B., thus switching loyalty to the latter, and attack the flaws of Corporation A., its former employer. Fromm also notes how American propagandists described U.S. allies as part of the Free World even though it contained viscous Latin American military dictatorships, apartheid South Africa, Salazar's Portugal, Franco's Spain, and so on.As a piece of literature, this book is excellent. The structure, the parts of the story, are well put together and flow together well. Winston's struggle to maintain his intelligence and impendence is very realistic and well told. I liked the views of life among the Proles as seen by Winston. How Winston and Julia make contact and their first meeting where they end up fornicating are all a little unreal.. But despite this the Winston-Julia love story is very charming, full of real feeling. Winston's experiences in the last part of the book are described vividly, if being slightly incredible."},{"Title":"1984","review":"I read 1984 in high school, probably around 1987 or so. I had wanted to read 1984 for several years, because in the actual year of 1984 (I was 13 at the time), there was a lot of media coverage about how Orwell's &quot;prediction&quot; had not come true. (This of course is a coy oversimplification of the book.)It was very strange to me at the time; I found their repeated, incessant insistence that 1984 was pure fiction suspicious. I could not help but think: Why the hell are these people so defensive?When I read 1984 it did not strike me as particularly &quot;true,&quot; metaphorically or otherwise. I was young and had less than five years of political study. While I could see parallels between our society and Orwell's, those parallels seemed few.However, over the last 20 years, 1984 has seemed more and more truthful. A lot of my perception of this book's truthfulness stems not simply from politics, but from watching how people behave. From high school &quot;cliques&quot; to office politics to the motions of the biggest political players today, Orwell depicted how people act. He depicted the way people twist the truth and abuse power, the way they manipulate words and ideas in order to portray guilt, or innocence. And he depicted just how horribly people in large groups are capable of being. Just because he used exaggerated, fantastic metaphors does not change the simple essence of human behaviors in his stories.1984 is not a book about Communists, Capitalists or any other political system. It was not even written, at the time, to be a book about &quot;the future.&quot; 1984 is a book about people. Not &quot;Capitalist People&quot; or &quot;Socialist People.&quot; All people, and human nature, and the corruption and darkness and manipulation all people are capable of. It is specifically about how people behave in industrial / post industrial / media saturated / disinformation age culture. It is about how people - of any political party, whether democrat, republican, socialist or libertarian - manipulate facts, words, ideas, and ultimately, each other. It is, in this sense, the best kind of book. Because what 1984 is about was true when it was written, has been true since, and apparently will be true for decades to come. It is not just true in the United States, or China, or Russia. It's true everywhere. In this sense the story remains a relevant and important read.If you reduce the book to nothing more than a fable about YOUR political enemies and how bad THEIR system is, you are precisely the sort of manipulator - or dupe - that Orwell wrote about. And if you deny that your culture, your political party, or your agenda is part of this process, you blind yourself precisely as Orwell's characters did.And in doing so, you emphasize Orwell's points very well."},{"Title":"1984","review":"The 20th Century has brought forth dystopia, and a plethora of dystopia literature. Some of the books, such as The Giver, are very good. Others, like Fahrenheit 451, are excellent. Of them, two are genius - A Brave New World (Huxley) - A Clockwork Orange (Burgess) - and one is supreme: 1984 (Orwell).1984 is comprehensive. Not in explaining the machinery and origin of the nightmare state, but in the experience of the individual within. Huxley is much more scientifically aware than Orwell, and his replacement of the party structure with a caste structure is profound and dark. Burgess, better than both these, understands the dependence of creativity upon destruction and destruction upon creativity, within the individual and the state. Neither Orwell nor Huxley offers their hero the alternative of \`coming alive' through violence, which Alex so beautifully illustrates.Also, I believe Burgess, of the three, to be the best storyteller. His prose is high art; musical, rhythmic, and perfect in its strangeness and familiarity. Huxley's book is somewhat like a puzzle with 8 big pieces, which fit exactly and predictably. His strength is not the flow of his story, but the brilliance of his images. Orwell is much too engrossed in his political message to be purely an artist. He is, of course, an artist, but firstly he is a political theorist.Still, it may seem unfair to compare these three; they are written for different purposes and theorize from different experience. This is indubitably true. But it is also true for us to want to organize, sort, and place books into a logical whole. And placement, for most of us, is related to importance.These three books are of the 20 most beautiful written in English in the last century - it is only my opinion that 1984 is the best. The knowledge and medium of 1984 is diverse. In part it is a theory on the meaning of history - it offers definitions of impersonal experience - it is an account of the individual, his will, passion, and perspective - it is about love and sex and their relation to the state - it is an attack upon intellectuals - it is about the nature of fear and courage - but, first of all, it is literature, written as a story...because it belongs to the individual, the private reader, not to academics or institutions."},{"Title":"1984","review":"You can't always read a book merely because it's a &quot;classic&quot; and expect it to be &quot;that good.&quot; Yet 1984 IS &quot;that good.&quot; The first half of the book is a bit slow and stagnant, yet the end section of this book is absolutely frightening and marvelous. What happens to Julia and Winston is so incredibly sad that I cried. Yes, this is just a book. Yet, when you think in a broader perspective... if you rise above the &quot;plot&quot; and think of Orwell's message, you can't help but be in awe. Think about it, Orwell's three principles in the book:WAR IS PEACEFREEDOM IS SLAVERYIGNORANCE IS STRENGTHHow relevant is that to today?! When you answer that question, you realize WHY this is novel, written in 1949, is a &quot;future&quot; novel...yet you realize how the eerie future Orwell presents in his novel relates to modern times.A must-read...but don't just read it. It's more important to try to grasp Orwell's message in the book.Marvelous, wonderful, frightening, and more importantly, it makes you think."},{"Title":"1984","review":"I really enjoyed reading this. It's a shame I didn't get the more expensive hardcover because I plan to keep this book and read it as many times as I possibly can in my life time. It's a brilliantly written satire of what our world would be like without the free will that some people take for granted. This book was so good that I would say that there should be a law that everyone read this, but that would kind of contradict what the book is about. I'm pretty confident that after you've finished, you'll be glad you bought this book."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Just finished 1984 by George Orwell. Truly, this is the best novel in the entire dystopian genre. Orwell eschews the lighthearted writing style of Aldous Huxley for an atmosphere suffused with fear and paranoia. In terms of creativity, 1984 is one of the most refreshing books I've ever read: the ideas of Newspeak and doublethink, the use of the past as a means of controlling the present; all are amazing ideas that should ring true today. Orwell's thoughts on \\"continuous warfare\\" should be especially cogent in light of the current \\"war on terror\\".The best part of the book is Winston's stay at the Ministry of Love.The only problem with this book is that it puts its ideas before its plot. An example: at a critical juncture in the exposition, when Winston & Julia have started working for the mysterious Brotherhood, Winston sits down and reads a book for about 25-30 pages. The ideas conveyed in the book are fascinating, to be sure, but it brings the narrative to a dead halt."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Winston Smith knows something is wrong with his world. Smith spends his days re-writing history. He lives in a society where everything, even \\"facts\\" are tenuous. His movements, and the movements of his fellow citizens, are monitored by The Party. Big Brother is always watching. Freedom is an antiquated idea that no longer exists. One isn't even free inside one's own head. The Thought Police always find out.George Orwell's famous dystopian novel is an excellent and timely read. People often crack jokes about this novel and our present society, but how far off the mark are those comments? An absolutely engaging and frightening read about a forbidden love affair and a corrupt society, I highly recommend this novel."},{"Title":"1984","review":"1984 is one of those books you're supposed to read in school, the kind that all the weird, geeky kids with Chuck Taylor All Stars and too much acne read while ranting about The Man. It's a well-known manifesto of those playing at anti-government, anti-establishment, brandishing about their membership cards for the Society for Creative Anarchy. This isn't for the kids that read trashy romances or pulp novels: it's not for the Collins, Grisham, Crichton, or Clancy fans out there, and it's definitely not something a Harry Potter kid is going to pick up in a few years. 1984 is depressing, it's dark, and as most devotes will tell you, it's happening right now. After all, this is the book that defines what \\"Orwellian\\" means-a word so specific in its meaning, even a spin doctor being interviewed on The Daily Show couldn't put it in a positive light.Considering my choices of literature, it probably comes as some surprise that this is only the second time I've read this book, and really I wouldn't have even been motivated to do so if I hadn't picked up a copy of the movie version of 1984 on DVD. I read the book back when I was a senior in high school-this and Metamorphosis were two works that the teachers at my otherwise fine high school just couldn't be assed having us read. I protested after reading both books myself between Junior and Senior year, and in the end talked the English literature teacher into allowing me to teach \\"The Hunger Artist\\" but it was a rather one-sided compromise, especially when you look at recent statistics. According to one report, the majority of students do not understand or value the first amendment, think that freedom of speech is too unrestricted, that the press has too much say, and that in effect, Americans are too free.It is in this environment that 1984 is more relevant than ever. Look at the National ID cards passed last week without the main media outlets blinking an eye or raising a voice. (Dan Rather, oh distrustful ally of the anti-Bush liberals and libertarians, where are you now!?) In a world where we can go from being at war with Afghanistan to Iraq in the blink of an eye (Er, I mean, we were never at war with Afghanistan. We've always been at war with Iraq. We were never not at war with Iraq. Big Brother Bush says so) and where September 11th is brandished about like a giant banner to take away every freedom known to man, the only difference between the Republicans and Ingsoc is the extent of power and religiosity. While Bush follows a god only he can hear (and really, isn't that signs of a mental disorder, having an imaginary friend that only you can hear that tells you to do things and then acting on that friend's word?) he has yet to understand that to captivate all power, he needs to be God.Of course, the United States isn't the only country with gross miscarriages of justice and invasion of privacy. In addition to China's censorship of the internet, the uniting of England with the US against the unifying European Union (read: Eurasia), there's the almost-but-not-quite-telescreen announcement system in Japan known as \\"The Box\\" to some residents and \\"Off Box\\" to others. Technology was meant to make our lives easier, but as Orwell predicted, it is only being used to impose class systems more rigid than they were fifty-years ago.On the way home from work on Wednesday, David and I were walking past Hyde town hall when we heard the bell begin to chime. He mentioned to me that the bell was given to the town by Joshua Bradley, an Industrialist and self-made man who worked his way up from a mill worker to owner. Rags to riches, the kind of JP Morgan and Andrew Carnegie American dream where hard work pays off if you pull yourself up by the bootstraps and put your axe to the grindstone-it doesn't exist in twenty-first century America. Michael Dell, Bill Gates, Richard Branson: they were born into the world they've simply modified. There was never a chance they'd be a factory worker somewhere, watching over robots as computers were assembled or working as a flight or train attendant. Donald Trump was never going to be a bartender in a casino. They were born into their class and remained there, entrenched in their wealth.In the past, this would have sent up a cry through the students and middle classes, charging the revolutionary-minded among us to action, to take our piece of the pie, to work harder. Instead, we see lawsuit after lawsuit as people who feel they deserve something for nothing become litigious instead of industrious while the rest go on with the drudgery of the world in which they live. We've become sedated by our technology, dependant on mass media and the Internet for our information. How many Americans first believed we were going to war with Iraq because of Weapons of Mass Destruction? How many people still believe that? More importantly, how many of those Americans still believe Saddam Hussain was responsible for 9/11? How many media outlets bother pointing this out?In the end, we have to look back at Orwell and realize that he knew this. He saw it all happening, saw where we were going, and gave us a picture of a world in the not-to-distant future that is depressing, bleak, and immanent. His book is more important than ever, and if you cannot believe it, take a look at the film version of the book. Admittedly, it was four years after reading the book for the first time that I happened upon the movie, so my memory of the book was foggy at best. So I picked it up and watched it with some skepticism. Surely, so much of that was changed to meet modern standards. Surely, as it is with Hollywood, the only thing it had in common with the book was the title and characters. It was for this reason I put 1984 on my list of books to read-to see how much had been changed. And to my surprise, not much is different at all, to the point that I could see scenes in my mind not because the movie colored my perception (as the film version of One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest did, so that reading the book is nearly impossible) but because it was so accurate.In the end, there was no need for them to change, modernize, or update 1984 because it was spot-on. This is a book that is too important to change, and far to relevant to be relegated to dusty bookshelves in the unused school libraries of the United States, or anywhere else in the world for that matter. It is a book that needs to be read, not banned as it has been in some places. If you didn't read this in school, I urge-no, implore-you to read it now. Even if you did read it in school, a good re-read is always enjoyable and considering the way technology and government are evolving, there's no better or more pertinent time than now."},{"Title":"1984","review":"I'm always struck by the dichotomous reactions to 1984. Some will claim it's brilliantly written, others that it's horribly written. Some paint it as an attack on socialism, others as a brilliant satire of modern republican democracy. I find it utterly terrifying if only because its ideas run further into the fabric of our society than most people know; that because there are no posters for Ingsoc on the walls they assume there is not one stamped indelibly in their mind.Or, to put the point lucidly, the horror of 1984 isn't the telescreens and rocket bombs, nor is it even the Thought Police. The horror is the idea, and the idea is still being fought against even today.I suppose first of all I should consider the writing. It's fantastic. It's subtle. It's appropriate. From the very first sentence 'the clock struck thirteen' the reader is informed something is very *wrong* here. Clocks do not strike thirteen; they strike twelve. It's as common as green lights meaning go. From the very beginning an undercurrent of wrongness is present. Orwell also maintains the difficult proposition of keeping his writing limited to the point of view of Winston while at the same time trying to explain enough of his dystopia to make it plausible and whole.Second, its 'point'. Well, despite the unfortunate name given, Ingsoc (or 'English Socialism') is no more proper socialism than it is facism, or republicanism. All three rely on a precariously perched ruling class and a shortage of the necessities of life. Unfortunately too many were influenced by the satire of 'Animal Farm' and its seemingly obvious parallels to the Soviet Union (try this fun game; the old pig is not Lenin but Franklin. Snowball, rather than Trotsky, is Jefferson and his ideological children. Napoleon is not Stalin but Alexander Hamilton. Insert names as needed. The true genius of 'Animal Farm' is that its archetypes can be filled by the proper people/ideologies of almost any modern government.) This book isn't about the Soviet Union. The SU is, if anything, infinitely preferable.Orwell is attempting to make the point (further explained in his essay 'Homage to Catalonia') that all government has that awful potential, and each is as likely to slide into totalitarianism as another. Those who say the book is an attack on communism area) woefully misinformed; the society depicted in 1984 bears little or no relation to communism or socialism beyond the communal obligation, and this obligation is not to one's fellow man as in proper socialism but to the state, and is then fascism or republican democracy if it is anything, andb) naive if they believe that the fall of the Soviet Union makes the book's ideas irrelevant. Orwell observed more than once that no government is inherently 'better' than any other. Anyone who says of communism \\"Well, it failed in the Soviet Union, didn't it? That proves it didn't work!\\" might well look towards Athens, Rome, France, Germany, and countless other countries where democracy failed even more spectacularly. Any government can fail at any time in any place given the proper conditions. Democracy can collapse. Monarchs can be overthrown. Fascists can be defeated. Communists can be glasnosted out of existence. Orwell observes the Marxist idea that a distribution of wealth, even if still geared towards the wealthiest one percent, would still proportionately increase the standard of living of the average person to the point where they would realize the Highs are superflous appendages, the appendices and vestigial lower ribs of the social body.Totalitarianism, Orwell argues, exists at the core of all governments and, despite the best intentions of its rulers, a government is almost a living entity in and of itself, and will naturally seek to aggregate as much power to itself as possible. Whether one is ruled by an absolute monarch or a representative body this tendency remains.Perhaps the most terrifying moment occurs within the reader: when we realize that Winston Smith is a journalist, and moreso clearly a writer in the purest sense. In the world of 1984, he is what the writer has become. This is what our noble dreamers, our Shakespeares and our Platos, have been reduced to. This is what all of the words come to.Nevertheless, Winston *is* a writer. We see this in his utterly irrational need to keep his journal, to write down his thoughts, in the face of certain punishment. Perhaps a projection of Orwell himself, Winston is a writer who exemplifies all of those other doomed souls who died impoverished, unnoticed, unable to break their addiction to putting the inside of their heads down on paper. We see the horrible things 1984 has done to the writer, and the journalist, made him a heretic, a newspaperman who fabricates lies and destroys the truth.Seen in this light, Newspeak becomes all the more horrific: by destroying the very tools a writer might use, Orwell sees the death of revolution.To those who were forced to read this book for school: god forbid. I'm sorry you were forced into something which is the solemn obligation of any citizen, that to be informed and as educated as possible. It is the implicit guarantee of any democracy or socialist state that one's fellow man (or woman) is dedicated to making the most of themselves, not vegging out wringing their hands over American Idol. If it is painful or sophomoric to you it is because you are painfully sophomoric yourself, and have as little right to your freedom as the air you breathe (which is what brings about dystopia more surely than anything, the willful, arrogant ignorance of the people.) Not only do you not know, you don't care you don't know. Ignorance is worn like a badge of honor, and if totalitarianism comes I can hardly say you do not deserve every agony of it.It is a book not only of but about ideas, and its only optimism is given in Orwell's comments on human nature; that a human naturally rebels against such a state, and it may take a thousand years to destroy it, even if it is only to repeat the mistake again for another thousand. But in those moments between the terrible millenia are the small spaces allowed for such things as simple human kindness and decency, which is the surest remedy to totalitarianism as anything. When humans cease to be competitors for the material they find an almost limitless capacity for mutual understanding.Anyone interested in other dystopia would be advised to read Zamyatin's 'We', Miller's 'A Canticle for Leibowitz', and perhaps the best of all if only for its brutal insight and simplicity, Platonov's 'The Foundation Pit'."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Think about a world where thinking unorthodox thoughts about the government is a crime, punishable by torture and death. Everywhere you go you are in the presence of a telescreen, or a two way television, where people can see you, instead of you just seeing them. Microphones are placed everywhere, catching every single word you speak.This is the world of 1984. A novel by George Orwell, a novel not about what life might be, but of what it is becoming. Published in 1949, the book offers political satirist George Orwell's nightmare vision of a totalitarian, bureaucratic world and one man's attempt to find himself. A communist government, called Oceania are at constant war with two other similar governments, Eastasia, and Eurasia. Eternal warfare is the price of bleak prosperity.The story is about a man named Winston Smith. He lives in a time when the love of somebody is illegal, not just the act, but the feelings and nature toward one another. When Winston meets Julia, a romance sparks. But they can only see each other secretly, away from the telescreens and microphones. They soon join the underground opposition of the party, called the brotherhood. One day, the Thought Police(Some police that can read your thoughts and stuff if you have bad thoughts, they catch you) catch them in their hideout, an upper story room on top of an old antique shop.In my opinion, this novel is a very scary and timely book. The fact that this book can be non-fiction can scare the living daylights out of you. The book is fairly complicated, and the beginning is quite slow. This book is not necessarily meant to create a scare, but to warn people about what might happen in one. The last four words can create a very serious case of depression or it may leave you something to think about afterwards. I know it happened to me. Most definitely I would recommend this book, but I have to warn you that it cannot be treated like an old rag, something that you can just toss aside when you don't want it. It will take you really close to psychosis, and then toss you into a suffocating kind of depression. This is not a novel you will neglect, and it is not a book you can read without wondering about everything you think and do. You'll never hear the phrase &quot;Big Brother is watching you&quot; again without chills going all over you body, giving you shivers, and fear filling every little space of your body.This book can also be quite confusing to some, and boring at the same time. I am only in the 8th grade, and many of the government aspects of the book were quite hard to catch. The last 45 pages or so of this book though, was very interesting. It reminded me of a parent hitting a child if they were bad. They keep on hitting them until they learn what is right in the parent's point of view. If you are looking for a book in which you can sit down and relax, then don't try this book."},{"Title":"1984","review":"The scariest, deepest, most intesting, and undoubtedly the best book I've ever read. When I started it, I couldn't put it down. When I finished it, I couldn't pick it up for fear of paranoia. Even now, after I've finnaly somewhat gotten over it, there are still some nights I can't sleep thinking about this unbelievably incredible book. It's ten times scarier than any Stephen King novel, and it's at least as deep, if not deeper, than anything written by Poe or Shakespeare. This book should undoubtedly be a requirement for anyone in the entire world living under any form of government. The story takes place in 1984, but it could be set in 2084 and not much would change. There is absolutely nothing I've ever read which even comes close to projecting the kind of heavy, depressing, absolute fear which uterly consumes the reader and stays with them forever. Of course I would recommend this book, but I must warn that it can't be treated lightly. It will send you to the edge of paranoia, and throw you into a smothering kind of depression. This is not a book you will soon forget, and it's not a book you can read without questioning everything you think and believe.

I understood its freightening warning much better when I read it as an older more mature person.I just saw a show on MSNBC the other night about real &quot;Big Brother&quot; technology that is in use today. Some cities in England are using stratigicly placed surveillance cameras that can actually automatically focus in on suspicious looking characters and run a picture of their face against a database of known criminals. Another example of &quot;Big Brother&quot; technology is electronic toll collection systems that allow the &quot;authorities&quot; to track your whereabouts.Certainly, doublespeak is often used in politics and to shape public opinion today. Bombing innocent civilians and causing widespread destruction is now the meaningless term &quot;collateral damage&quot;. The &quot;Defense Department&quot; is more of an offensive international policing agency that is ready, willing, and able to wreak havoc on any country which is diagreeable to the United States. Nuclear missles are dubiously named &quot;peacekeepers&quot;.IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH is America today. How many people in America actually educate themselves about the issues of the day and about the real nature of the politicians running for office? It's pretty obvious to anyone who has bothered to educate themselves that many politicians often don't practice what they preach. People are too quick to just accept sound bites as facts, and don't bother to educate themselves regarding the issues of the day.The only way we can prevent a totalitarian regime like George Orwell described in 1984 from becomming a reality is for every person to be vigilant about protecting their rights and the rights of others, and for people to constantly question things and educate themselves. Unfortantely, I don't have much hope that people will actually prevent George Orwell's nightmare vision from becoming a reality.

It is a shocking message to society that will change the reader forever.

It's more than a story, you must read on a higher level and imagine yourself as Winston himself. The theme of hoplessness is quite appropriate, I'd say, since a society without emotion or means of revolution is indeed hopeless. I would recomend this to anyone. YOU MUST READ THIS BOOK!!!"},{"Title":"1984","review":"I will never read this book again. It broke me to pieces. I was bed-bound for days.

The novel can be read as a warning against the malign personalization that could be possible with a systematic technological attack on privacy. \`The worst thing in the world,' says the hero's torturer, \`varies from individual to individual.' The evil state in 1984 sought to control mindspace and to dictate identity to its subjects. \`\`The command of the old despotisms was \`\`thou shalt not''.

But the Party is not a masterpiece society. For example, if the mythological, immortal Emmanuel Goldstein(get it?) , the face to be forever stamped on, is said to be a traitor, once a member of the Party. What problem should BB have with thoguht criminals walking to the stake proclaiming their heresy? Also, within years of the story, all Inner Party members would be dead. But the Party would still continue, the old world abolished? No, as was seen with Julia, even those raised from birth by the party still occasioanlly break free from the rule. Also, there is hope int he proles. A thought-criminal might have no more to dot han get some possessions of the Inner Party to the hands of the proles, enough to make them realize they are oppressed. This novel is, however, horribly accurate in its prediction of dehumanization by technological advancement.

One need look only to the Russian Revolution and Russia under the rule of Stalin to see that such events are possible. There are very close parallels between Stalinist Russia and 1984. Josef Stalin is much like Big Brother. Once he has sighted opposition to him or intellect, he erases that person from existence. This happened thousands upon thousands of times in Russia while Stalin was in control. The people in 1984 live life much like the peasants in Russia. They get meager rations of tasteless food, if they get any at all. One more parallel between the two is that the torture chambers of Big Brother are much like that of the Gulags of Stalin. Society should take examples from history to prevent the world from turning into the one in 1984. It seems to me that this book is a warning to society. Examine the past, learn from it, and control the future. It is fortunate that Stalinist Russia came to and end when he died. Next time, the world may not be so lucky."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Nineteen-Eighty Four is by far one of the best novels I have ever read.

Anyone who reads this novel will begin to realize a type of &quot;Big Brother&quot; in their own life."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Many of the reviewers on this page are part of the pre-millenium paranoia that seems to have gripped our country in a solid grasp in the last few years. What many of the people who have joined this movement fail to realize is that they have done just what Orwell warned against, becoming part of a faceless movement. All that need be given to form a mindless mob is a galant cause, and the destruction of the evil &quot;new world government&quot; fits that bill perfectly. What these people fail to realize is that the individuals trying to violate our homes, and ultimately our brains, are the pervayors of capitalism itself; that is the owners of huge corporate conglomerates , private individuals that have a larger motivation than world domination . . . greed. So, go ahead and buy this book on a computer built by a huge monopolizing business, over an &quot;internet&quot; that has exposed your personal knowledge to thousands of people (a service wich you pay for), using a credit card which holds you constantly in debt to a group of people which you have never even seen.

It is the story of a man's total loss of himself, and the story of the nature of the society that took his very soul. Smith's fight against Big Brother proves more than just futile. His fight is the direct cause of his undoing both in his loss of &quot;freedom&quot; to move within his restricted society and in his loss of any concept of self.In many respects this is the ultimate horror story because after all the tyrany, torture, hate, and deceit, the greatest horror still remains inside the human psyche. Smith who could no longer believe in his lover Julia, who could no longer believe in his neighbors, who could no longer believe in the resistance &amp; Emmanuel Goldstein, who never believed in &quot;God,&quot; finally failed to believe any aspect of himself.

Almost every little thing in Winston and Julia's world is clearly described.

One must wonder how accurate he is about this, society's future. He shows how a gov't can alter the past just as quickly as the present occurs and still maintain full power over it's people. Today is the world going in the direction that this book depicts, to the exact destination, or are we going the opposite way. One can only think and worry about this situation, but it does appear society is heading towards what Orwell wrote so many years ago. The people of Oceania in this book were governed by telescreens monitoring everybody's moves and giving them rules to abide by. This book depicts a communist gov't and a guess at how the future will be. I personally really enjoyed this book. It was one of the few books that kept my attention on every page.

While I found the world that Julia and Winston lived in scary, what was even scarier is that some day this could actually come true! While I'm only 14, anyone who is 13 or above should be able to grasp the main concepts of this book. You are very compassionate when you realize the vain struggle of Winston and Julia. This book also shows that human emotion while difficult can be altered and controlled. Your only hope in totalitrain society is mass rebelion or death. And the song, &quot;Under the spreading chestnut tree, I sold you and you sold me.&quot; When that played at the end my heart dropped cause it makes you realize that when humans are dissected to the core all they care for are themselves. If you think you are liberal enough to get a new view on life, read this book for it will change your outlook on life, love, and politics.

At 13 years old, I didn't understand every aspect of it, but in a whole, everything made perfect, clear sense.I'm very interested in socialist governments(no, I don't like communist views; I'm a die-hard patriot at 13!), and I consider myself well-informed on up-to-date politics and such. And so, upon reading this book which was recommended to me by one of my teachers, I was horrified at the resemblances that Oceania and the direction our government is headed shared. The foresight of Orwell was shocking, and he kept the book very interesting.But a good portion of the middle was....awkward. Like, mature-content awkward (most teachers gave me girl-are-you-crazy? looks when they saw I was reading it. Later, I realized why). I almost didn't finish the book, but knowing its importance to my knowledge, I finished it.

The government has you entrenched in a conspiracy so deep, where a national tragedy gave leadership the opportunity to seize all of your rights in the name of your personal protection. No, this isn't the Patriot Act- it's \\"1984,\\" a dystopian Science Fiction novel by George Orwell, the author of \\"Animal Farm.\\" Written in 1949, \\"1984\\" hardly seems as dated as its title might imply. Really, nothing could be farther from the truth. The world set up by Orwell, over seen by Big Brother and his invisible band of Thought Police, has people political prisoners within their own country. Winston, a worker in the Record Department of one of the three ministries (The Ministry of Truth, or Minitrue), finds his mind resisting the world he's given, not completely accepting the \\"news\\" he's given, as well as doubting his contentment. He enters into a relationship, finds himself contacted by an underground resistance, and comes to discover some of the more dangerous traits of the Party. Orwell's \\"1984\\" is an extremely well written political masterpiece, which traces societal trends in an innovative and pessimistic sort of way.From the beginning, Orwell introduces new touches of technology made from innovations in his time. Things such as telescreens (basically televisions with the capability to communicate with and spy on members of the outer party) and speakwrites (a microphone that transcribes dictations) give a modern sense to the novel, while keeping it somewhat futuristic, even in modern times. No extravagant inventions like space ships or teleporters are touched on, so there isn't a feeling of inaccuracy or over-optimism that seems to be common in more ambitious science fiction media. Honestly, I found myself wishing that something such as a speakwrite existed for homework assignments, or even writing this very review; however, I didn't get that overwhelming sense of \\"Yeah right, nothing like THAT existed in 1984\\" from the position of being here in 2007.Orwell brings out the political message of the novel most obviously by using the supposed revolutionary Goldstein's book. The chapters from Goldstein's book are inserted into 1984 as Winston reads them. Although these excerpts read something like stereo instructions or college dissertations, it really affirms the politics behind Orwell's writing. The three political bodies, or countries, in this novel consist of Oceania, Eurasia and East Asia. Oceania includes the United Kingdom, Eurasia includes the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, and East Asia includes China and Japan. The fact that Orwell had the foresight to predict a lot of specific traits of world politics (such as the takeover of one party regimes in China) and the escalation of current world politics (such as the arms race and the containment policy against the Soviet Union) absolutely floored me. There were times when I was reading through sections of Goldstein's history where I simply had to put it down, because some of the events supposedly taking place in the fifties and sixties I had just learned about in my history class as taking place around then. That in and of itself is not only brilliant, but very powerful; just knowing that the book predicted some of the things that happened gives more credibility to the more radical things Orwell predicted. That's what's so strong about \\"1984;\\" there's this sense of \\"It could happen.\\"SPOILER WARNINGS!Another strength of the novel was the relationship between Winston and Julia. Although I personally didn't like Julia - (she struck me as a very odd sort of a rebel who didn't even seem to know what she wanted) - her character was perfect for the novel. Her quirky unpredictability and her complete disregard for authority showed how even the most seemingly active Party members harbored deep reservations about the life they were living. Also, her somewhat shallow and lukewarm interest in politics was a good portrayal of the way people would begin to act after living under an oppressively totalitarian regime. It was admittedly strange to me how Winston was impressed by how many men Julia had managed to sleep with, but their relationship was still believable. Both of them had the fundamental desire to rebel against the system, and they channeled that towards sex. Fortunately, I couldn't personally relate to that, but it did represent a form of rebellion on Orwell's part against people who want to turn sex into a utility and take all of the pleasure out of it.The ending, however, was the most potent part of the novel. When Julia and Winston are caught and tortured, and Orwell describes the nightmarish ordeal Winston is put through, the reader really comes to understand how Winston develops. Throughout the entire novel, Winston's progression from a nervous rebel, to a carefree rebel, to a penitent traitor was perfectly delineated by Orwell. After Winston suffers through his torture and decries everything- his distaste for Big Brother, his suspicion of changing information, his mental rejection of double speak- he becomes just another guy. Another drone under Big Brother, a man who loves and follows Big Brother and works for Big Brother. At first, I admit I was disappointed. I kind of hoped for some sort of upset, a little sense of rebellion or even a feeling that something might have changed because of what Winston did. That lack of closure in that sense, however, was actually really good for the book though. It just shows how hopeless, how drone-like, how terrible an existence under a complete ruler can be, and how there really isn't any hope of the dystopian society changing after it has come in full swing. It really drove home that people should actively keep their most basic rights, and never let them slip away.\\"1984\\" was one of the most contemporary feeling books I have ever read that was written before the 80's. It's well written, engaging, exciting and interesting, and provides intellectual fodder as well as personal enjoyment. There is suspense, love, and introspective thought, and the entire novel is building up towards the big twists on the end. Personally, I think \\"1984\\" is one of the best of its kind, and was a better political metaphor than Alduous Huxley's \\"Brave New World\\" or even Orwell's own \\"Animal Farm.\\" However, you'll never be able to look at your government the same again- Big Brother is watching you."},{"Title":"1984","review":"You've probably already read the other reviews on this site, so i'll just concentrate on my opinion on the relevance of this book in our contemporary society1984 is a stark warning against totalitarianism. Written in 1948, Orwell's depiction of a government-controlled society seemed absurd when published, contrasting the imnumerable amount of people that've said how real it seems now than it did then in western societyOne interesting factor is the geography of the planet. We are told very little and all we're told is that there're three 'super-states', Oceania, Eastasia and Eurasia. Oceania is constantly at war with a vague and distant enemy, and is always switching between being allies and enemies with Eurasia and Eastasia. Comparing it to today, just what is this 'war on terrorism, and how threatened do you really feel about it (disregarding media opinion)?. America and Britian, both independantly throughout the years and in allegiance with each other recently, are constantly at war with an enemy. WWI, WWII, Cold war, Korean war, Vietnam war, Falklands War, Gulf war I and more recently Gulf war II. Societal opinions + perceptions are influenced by media, but who are we at war with? The \\"War on Terror\\" clearly highlights the fact that there is no tangible enemy anymore. Explained more clearly in Goldstein's passage in the book, we are constantly at war because it keeps us united, and stops us fighting one another, stops us fighting the government.Another interesting factor in book is the issue of government surveillance. 'Telescreen' in homes, Cameras everywhere you walk, Microphones even in the countryside to detect rebellious behaviour. Although key issues stated in the book aren't as extreme, the power the government now has to keep tabs on people and spy on them has reached limits it has never reached before. The 'Party' explain that this surveillance is for the benefit of the people (note: animal farm) and they constantly reassure the citizens, or 'comrades', that life was worst off before they came along. Similarly, our governments are constantly re-assuring us how much better our lives are because of them. I.D cards are being proposed under the pretence that they will 'eliminate terrorism and benefit fraud', which are something the people are 'persuaded they want' because they media tells them they do.The third, conclusively and i think most importantly, is the way this book challenges the fact we (society in 1948) take our freedom for granted. One passage in the book which sticks out in my mind specifically is when the main charactor walks through a lower-class area, and is terrified that the police patrols might stop him and ask him questions; 'what are you doing in this part of town? is this your usual way home'? etc. Similarly, if someone was walking down the street at 2am in a dangerous part of town for no particular reason, it would be deemed socially strange, thus encouraging this person not to do so, and do what everyone else does. If someone dresses in clothes that you do not usually see, he/she would be regarded as a weirdo, a social outcast\\".My point is, how free do we really think we are as a society these days? How easily are we opinionated by the media?Our society is edging closer and closer to the reality that is 1984, and i recommend that you read it, it will change the way you perceive news articles, and you'll question all these erosions of civil liberties that have been happening.By the way, Orwell didn't intend for this vision to be reality in the year 1984. He wrote it in 1948, so he just switched the last 2 letters around."},{"Title":"1984","review":"As gripping and wrenching now as it was on my first reading in 1972.

But hit Animal Farm before you leave Orwell:)"},{"Title":"1984","review":"George Orwell's book 1984, published in 1949, was an excellent book. I thought it was amazing that he used such imagination to come up with all aspects of this book. The fact that he wrote this book in the 40's and projected what life might be like in 1984 was very interesting. It makes you think. We think of 1984 as a punk era that is well in our past, Orwell thought of 1984 as the future, the far off future. Just as we thought that the year 2000 was going to be filled with flying cars and people living on the moon and mars, he thought of 1984 in a very different way than it turned out. Or did he. He didn't have any way to perceive all of the technological advances we would make, but he did make some very good guesses. He talks about a machine that is in every room and on every street corner. This machine is called a \\"Telescreen.\\" This machine watches and listens to every word and every movement you make. The local government watches this and will arrest you if you are caught going against the government. Saying anything bad will get you in jail. In the year 1984, according to Orwell, the world has been split up into three superstates Eastasia, Eurasia, and Oceania. Oceania is were Winston Smith (the main character) lives. All of these superstates are run the same. They have a very strong central government that controls everything. These three states are constantly at war with each other and they have all created their own languages. The government in Oceania is called \\"Big Brother.\\" This is where the phrase \\"Big brother is watching you\\" came from. In these states no one is free and everyone is an enemy. People are raised on false beliefs that the government has told them. The goverment would even take it to the extreme and collect all the newspapers and rewrite them and burn the old ones if the papers stated beleifs that the goverment doesn't have anymore. That is what Winston Smith did. He was a a rewriter of documents. The government of Oceania was one based totally upon mind manipulation. They used a term that they called \\"Doublethink\\" this was the power of holding two contradictory ideas in someones head and having them fully accept both. Big Brother raised all the people to be loyal to their government and be the government's slaves. The people saw this as being the way of things so they went along with it, having every second of their lives planned out and watched. Even people's children were more loyal to the government than their parents. Their was a scene in the book were a kid turned his parents in for speaking slander against the government. Even the language was cleansed and regulated. The government created a language called \\"Newspeak.\\" \\"Newspeak\\" contained only words that were cleansed in thought. For example the word bad would be translated to \\"ungood.\\" All in all, this book talks about the government and all the ways it is composed. But it does have a story line as well. The storyline is about Winston and this girl he meets named Julia. They both have the same strong feelings against the government and they often meet in very crowded places where it would be hard for them to be caught talking. They finally decide to join an underground group against the government. They meet with this guy O'Brien who claims to be in charge. The story starts to unfold after that meeting. This was very good book. It was very deep and intense. I loved hearing all about the Totalitarian ideas the government practiced. Plus it was cool to hear what a man in the 40's perceived 1984 to be like. In a way he was right, we are constantly monitored by satellites and surveillance camera's. GPS systems and even cell phones. \\"Big Brother\\" does exist just in a different way than Orwell perceived him. But we also do have our freedom to think and speak. These are two things that the citizens of Orwell's 1984 did not have. But keep this in mind \\"Big Brother\\" could be watching you right now."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Simply one of the greatest novels ever put to print.

I recall the anxiety that tormented my family during the preceding months that led to the collapse of the Soviet Union. I was seven and lived in my own universe, but I was sort of aware that the Soviet Empire was seeing its last days. Karl Marx must have been doing somersaults in his grave.I don't remember much about living under communism - except that daily life was \\"by the book\\" - but I've talked plenty about it to my parents and grandparents. When Stalin went six feet under, it became a bit more tolerable, but it remained totalitarianism nonetheless. Orwell did an exceptional job at depicting the essential aspects of that kind of state, more precisely Soviet regime. The detail that he told is fascinating; as if Stalin or Beria had let him in on the juicy stuff. Some of it he exaggerated, some he understated, but fundamentally he was accurate. Also, it is imperative that the reader keeps in mind that it was published in 1949. A vast majority of people in Russia and Europe were isolated from this kind of knowledge - the government made sure of that through an intricate system of secret police - so this book was a revelation. Of course we now know that, aside from the fictitious names, he essentially portrayed reality. The indoctrination that is described in the book still lingered when I attended school in Ukraine in the \`80s. Soviet propaganda machine was thorough indeed.The history of totalitarian states is complex and enormous amount of time and literature has been dedicated to it. This book, however, is a good substitute if one cannot wrestle with a lengthy 700-page tome. It won't make you a political scholar, but it'll educate you on what Soviet Russia was. It's written in a lucid manner; however, one has to read it as nonfiction to truly appreciate the author's vision.

George Orwell constantly had me on the edge of my seat never knowing whether the Thought Police would catch Winston expressing his opinion. I really liked the way Orwell writes this book as if 1984 was such a distant future. It makes me think if our forms of government worldwide are getting to that point. This novel really made me think about how corrupt our government is and how they can do just about anything they want as in the story. Orwell also constantly uses great description. This line in particular I really enjoyed, \\"Outside, even through the shut window pane, the world looked cold. Down in the street little eddies of wind were whirling dust and torn paper into spirals, and though the sun was shining and the sky a harsh blue, there seemed to be no color in anything except the posters that were plastered everywhere.\\" I loved the way Orwell gave this description of London, it makes me see such a colorless world with no sign of any emotion. There were certain aspects that had me confused however. Orwell's use of huge vocabulary had me confused at times and I would read many paragraphs over to get the full understanding. However it is good for yound readers such as myself to learn many new words. Orwell gave his knowledge about how our government today, isn't that far off as in the government in the story to millions of readers.

Are we starting to live in Orwell's world?"},{"Title":"1984","review":"This is a spellbinding book. George Orwell has created in this book a society that could very well the most horrific situation any human being could ever find itself in. I loved every aspect of the book: the plot, the characterizations, the future shock, the political and religious allegories and the appropriate bleakness and gloominess that eventually wears you down towards absolute fear of the future.Though I loved the relationship between Winston Smith and O'Brien and their encounters in Part III of the novel, it was the affair of Winston and Julia that was central to the novel. With these two characters, Orwell gave us two completely identifiable and realistic characters that we like immediately. It was as though the two of them were thrown into a maze of oppression and tried to free themselves, just like any of us today would do. It is here that Orwell gives us the sense of hope that all humans have that good will of course triumph over evil and freedom will come from their slavery. Though it is obvious that they probably won't be succesful in their rebellion of Big Brother, we admire them for being human: to fall in love and to be distinct humans and to have regular thoughts, feelings and memories. In the end, when they are captured by the thought police, seperated, tortured like animals, brainwashed and released back into the collective, it is all the more heartbreaking that they, like human nature, has fallen prey to them enemy: communism. Their final meeting at the end is more heartbreaking in how they know they betrayed each other and have been conformed, resulting in the loss of their love for each other. I don't believe that this was a love story but I thought this relationship served as the means by which the reader would identify their rebellion of the Party and their failure.To those who felt cheated by this ending, it would have underminded and ruined every theme that Orwell made throughout the book about totaltarianism: a man cannot break free of the state and overcome it if the state can succeed in taking away his individuality and place the state within him. To give the book a pleasing ending would take away the message that communism should be feared; for if Winston could beat the Party, everyone after him can as well. To give him that victory would cheat the audience more.Above all, 1984 succeeds in how it will always be relevant in todays society. The U.S. now wants to monitor all activity over the mail and internet for security reasons because of Sept. 11. We are at the starting point of a war which may conduct itself over a long period of time. Security cameras are stationed at every corner in downtown london to monitor the activity of the citizens. We have experienced the serious threats and wide spread fears and panics of communism of the 1950s and 1960s and a cold war between captialism and communism which was very close to being an Orwellian Revolution of sorts. It is a great book in not only being entertaining but being insightful. It surpasses horrific masterpiece, it is a warning."},{"Title":"1984","review":"1984 by George Orwell is the frightening classic about the loss of freedom of thought in a totalitarian society. Judging from the luminous exposition of the world of 1984's structure, found in latter bit of part 2, Orwell scholarlily traced the history of organized society to date and decided upon a strictly terrifying and inhumane future. The author's vision of 1984 (conceived in 1949) is a cold, shocking and quite believable one. The Americas and England are united under the banter of Oceania. Big Brother is the godlike icon that leads Oceania. The Party is its governmental body. Anything the party says, any moral it promotes, any record of the past (including who has died or who has ever been born) it keeps is correct. One is monitored by the Party at all times and should not find that uncomfortable. If one shows any sign of unorthodoxy, anything but love and obedience to Big Brother and the Party, he or she must doublethink it, let it submerge into the unconscious and be replaced by more appropriate feelings or else he or she has committed thoughtcrime. With the almost omnipotent Party's stringent regulation of thoughts, 1984's protagonist, Winston Smith, feels like a dead man before the narration even begins. Orwell takes readers along Smith's gloomy, hopeless path of deviation, from scribbling of \\"Down with Big Brother\\" in a furtive diary to his falling in love with the spirited, young rebel, Julia to his active mutiny to finally his inevitable detainment and terrifying rehabilitation, a process which takes readers to the black heart of the Party. Not only is 1984 a well paced, masterfully executed narrative, the concepts and principles it explores are awfully universal and still utterly relevant. One could apply Orwell's hypothesis's to both the adulation of figures from the American Revolution and how unquestionable we consider their policies and current events in the U.S. as explained by the exceptional review posted by Jim Brett on October third. 1984 is more than just a superb novel. It is a warning."},{"Title":"1984","review":"&quot;1984&quot; is a wonderfuly written book, but I woudn't recomend it as a before bed read. I ended up reading the last chapters while laying in bed. Big mistake! I would also not recomend this book to people under 13, or even 14. I'm 13, and I almost wish I had waited a couple years before reading it. In the climax of the story, I started crying from fear, and I'm constanly having to reasure myself that the world is not like that, and never will be. Don't get me wrong, I loved the book, and I encourage anyone who doesn't mind aquiring a slight sense of paranoia, to read it."},{"Title":"1984","review":"To see some rather disturbing indications that Orwell should be shelved somewhere between fiction and non-fiction, have a look at &quot;When Corporations Rule the World&quot; and &quot;Four Arguments for the Elimination of Television&quot;.Most people dwell on the political aspects of 1984, naturally enough, but I'd like to reiterate the perhaps obvious point that Orwell is a really fine writer. Many of his wry descriptions had me laughing aloud. Mark Twain's classic definition of a classic is &quot;a book that everyone wants to have read, but no one wants to read.&quot; 1984 is a counterexample, a classic that is both eminently readable and well worth reading (unless you completely trust giant interlocking bureaucracies to look after your personal interests)."},{"Title":"1984","review":"It is perfect and brilliant in all areas. 1984 is also one of the most misunderstood books of all time. It wasn't simply a Stalinist bash or a sequel to Animal Farm (philosophically, not literally). It was both those things, but it was, and is so much more. In a nightmarish future, Winston Smith is just an average citizen of Airstrip One. He works at the Ministry of Truth, he spends his evenings at the community center, he even helps his neighbor when the plumbing goes bad. Yet there is turmoil in Winston's mind. He hates Big Brother, he hates Oceania and Airstrip One, and he wants simply to be human. But in his society, these thoughts are a crime. Now Big Brother is a TV show, but here it is no entertainment: it demands your thinking. 1984 has been liberally borrowed from (the Command and Conquer video game series, The Matrix, that TV series, etc.) and is more than a political novel: to call it that narrows its scope. It is an inflection on humanity and the human spirit, and a look at that age-old dissenting philosophy. Yet the way O'Brien just attacks everything Smith believes in late in the book just makes you wonder about what you believe in. Truly monumental, and I can't write a review on a great work and stay coherent. Enjoy."},{"Title":"1984","review":"The first time I read this book I could not help but think of all the forms of voyuerism in the world today. After only a few pages I was wondering how close to Orwell's nightmerish vision of the future we are. When will such privacy invading programs such as &quot;Big Brother&quot; (which takes its name from a central figure in this book) and &quot;Survivor&quot; evolve to the point that everyone is watched all the time. Will paranoia push privacy out the door? The Telescreen wasn't the only ominous foreshadowing in the novel. The fliud way The Party wipes out intellectualism is reminiscant of the constant &quot;dumbing down&quot; of entertainmenty today. Am I the only one who has noticed the decreased standards of quality in movies? Overall I highly reccomend 1984. Not only is it an excellent book, it is almost an essential read. In order to avoid the atrocities of Orwell's imagined world, we must learn how to avoid them. I will admit,though, this is not for the faint of heart. This is a moody and cynical book throughout."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Orwell does such a great job expressing his point in this novel. 1984 had a very interesting and thoughtful plot which made the book hard to put down. The first 30 pages were hard to get into but after that it was easy reading. The ending of the novel was a little disturbing but it was so keenly written that the author deserves so much credit for it. If u like thoughtful haunting books read it!"},{"Title":"1984","review":"This book is a story on George Orwell's vision of 1984 whilst living in the year 1989. Instead of the beautiful visions some of us have for future and technology right now, George Orwell writes about the nightmarish vision of 1984 and it's &quot;Negative Utopia&quot;.The year is 1984. You fall into a world containing our main character, Winston Smith. Winston lives in a world of control and brilliance. He lives under the power of Big Brother who is practically treated like a god of mankind. Big Brother created the history you read now, Big Brother is everything, you will serve Big Brother.WAR IS PEACE, FREEDOM IS SLAVERY, IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH.You must use Newspeak and you must not use Oldspeak but Newspeak is being updating so much that you could find yourself half illiterate the very next day. There are telescreens in rooms and on the streets to watch your ever move and if you think anything that is not righteous of Big Brother then the &quot;Thought Police&quot; come after you in the night. You are told that you are not living but that you are serving Big Brother and that Big Brother is the only person living. You aren't even sure that anything is real, but you are worried of thinking these thoughts in case you are caught. Once a person is caught and taken away to the Ministry of Love (maintains law and order)-they do not return. This is the world that Winston lives in.There is to be said a society called The Brotherhood. But you can never be sure of it because everything is so secretive. And one day Winston gets hold of a diary. It is not right to write in a diary or express your thoughts but he does so anyway. Half sure that he will be killed and half sure that it's something that he must do. And from the start of opening his mind to reality he realises that most of the things he 'thinks' he knows aren't really facts at all. It was true, Big Brother made the past, was the past, is the future too-because Big Brother erased everything else and corrected history at his own will.And then he meets a person who thinks with the same thoughts he has...and then another..and then another...and slowly he finds out that there really IS a Brotherhood to maybe let out the truth.The book is a very worthwhile read. It's also similar to Ayn Rand's ANTHEM. The end is surprising and yet imaginable and interesting to think about and discuss."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Not all doom and gloom from page 1, 1984 is still one of the most intense, dark and thought provoking books I have ever come across. What makes it compelling is the way in which it not only examines the human condition but also bludgeons it to a bloody pulp. So why have so many people enjoyed reading such a depressing story, ever since it's release in the late 1940's? I believe it to be the manner in which the novel blurs your \\"in-built\\" judgement of what is right and wrong, good and evil, in respect to civil liberties and the power of governing authorities. The way it inspires you to look behind the diplomacy and see the agenda. And the way it forces you to examine your own rationale for your assumptions and actions. The more I think about it, the more I like this novel and how it manages to look at the big picture and yet still remain personally affecting."},{"Title":"1984","review":"This book is extremely powerful. That isn't a secret. The power of this book is that this is now happening in the freeworld as it had been happening in radical dictatorships. First it was western europe in the 70's and 80's. Then it began in the US in the 90's during the Clinton's reign and the rise of the NSA and ATF. Now it is spreading because of Terrorism. The bottom line is that many in the governments in these free countries mean well but don't comprehend what is coming. The current Bush administration is just answering the call because of the power that technology has given our governments and global terrorist. We must either accept that we are always at risk or give up some of our freedoms. We just have to hope that when this risk dissapates, if ever, we can get them back. Lucky for us FDR died before he became king... If you think this is about facism you are thinking too liberal-1984 can occur in a pure democracy."},{"Title":"1984","review":"I was shell-shocked when I read \\"Queenie\\"'s review. How can you live life not knowing that THE BOOK IS FICTIONAL!!!! It was a metaphor for what the Soviet Union would be like in the 20th century. Notice I said \\"would be like\\" because it was written decades before 1984. I cannot belive something so simple has to be spelled out like this, but there you have it. I thought it was a fantastic book. Depressing, but a must-read."},{"Title":"1984","review":"In this book everyone is watched by Big Brother. History is written and re-written on a daily basis to fit the government's propaganda needs. Words are slowly taken away as the government seeks to stifle creativity and speech. Children are indoctrinated from very early on and every one is a member of some pro-government committee.One man seeks to defy the government by thinking for himself thereby committing \\"thought-crimes\\". He also keeps a journal and seeks out a lover.This book is too hard to adequately explain. It is well written and is a must read for everyone. Whether you are liberal or conservative, democrat or republican I am sure you have heard quotes used from this book attacking either side of the fence. From the Patriot act to Hillary Care opponents have vocally cited this book to justify their fears. I suggest you read it for yourself and draw your own conclusions as to which more closely portrays Big Brother. My feeling is that they all portray this book very well in one way or another."},{"Title":"1984","review":"I first read 1984 as a teen; and it's imagery and parameters of political analysis have stayed with me, and grown ever since. It is one of the most important works of the 20th century.Orwell crafted a brilliant picture of how a totalitarian oligarchy can exist and thrive. There isn't a single element in the book that cannot be found in the history of the world of the past 50 years; in all nations, all places, all times, all peoples.We have all seen how doublethink works; and, if we were really honest, we've experienced it in our own lives and performed it - doubtless to perfection. Human beings have a genius for lying to themselves and believing every word of it.There are two flaws in the book. One is that Orwell's vison tackled only half of the danger facing us. True, in, for example, present day USA under the domination of the Bush-led Neocon Regime, we see many of the Orwellian principles in action. But I belive that Aldous Huxley's \\"Brave New World\\" lent eloquent imagery to the other half of the equation. Combine a balance of the Orwellian (oligarcy established and sustained by brutality, torture, brainwashing, and oppression) and Huxlian elements (oligarcy established and sustained by diversion through drug abuse, sexual amorality, and mind-numbing entertainment) and you will have a picture of the world in which we live.The other is that he completly ignored the element of economics and how manipulation of, and indeed, application of the Orwellian and Huxlian principles upon, economics and finance are essential to the establishment of a world dictatorship. The reader is advised to examine the workings and infrastructure of, for example, the IMF, the World Bank, and the SWIFT network.And make no mistake, we do live there. Human beings are ceasing to be human. I could write for hours listing evidence of this: and so could you.Having said that, I believe this book to possess a valuable weapon against tyrrany and dehumanization for all people. The whole of humanity is richer for having such a warning in place. Perhaps someone will listen."},{"Title":"1984","review":"For a fascinating read, pick your favorite (yeah, right) business theory book about corporate culture and read it side-by-side with Orwell's masterpiece. The shifting truths, shameless propaganda and mindless work that drones like Winston Smith are subjected to illustrate the dark underside of corporate America that have resulted in the scandals of the early 21st centruy, including the likes of Enron, Tyco and others.Hell, if they served gin at work, the similarities would be complete for many workers.While Orwell is a pessimist, and sees nothing but a bottomless abyss, the careful reader can see glimmers of hope in the tired institutions of freedom of speech, and the press.Orwell's 1984 is as fascinating to read in the 21st century as it was when I read it for the first time in 1984."},{"Title":"1984","review":"If you haven't read this book, get it. What are you waiting for?Almost every book or movie in the genre since this book has in some way been influenced by it.It still manages to inform our discussions about privacy to this day."},{"Title":"1984","review":"This book is absolutely amazing. I finshed reading it for the first time about amonth ago, and it really, truly caused me to actually think. Few books nowadays even can claim that. Orwell was a true visionary when he wrote this book. Don't get me wrong, I'm not a socialist, it just wouldn't surprise me if within the next 300 years it ends up like what Orwell said."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Possibly the worst thing to say about this overwhelming book is that it is...science fiction. It is promoted as such in the schools where the kids \\"have\\" to read it because it is a \\"classic\\" (we all know what that means, and if you dont then consider how many books you remember from that time and consider what effect they would have on you had you read them 10 or 15 years later).Orwell constructs and describes a nightmarish totalitarian dictatorship where the system controls literally everything. And that includes your thoughts. If you deviate you will be \\"corrected\\".It's a society where the past has been wiped out because the system controls all forms of information. It is impossible to know what has happened before and one is forced to accept the constant lies from the government at face value while going through intense brainwashing of other forms as well.Winston (the main character) is a man who still has traces of the past in his brain, in other words he commits the ultimate crime (thoughtcrime) as he questions the official version of things. As he desperately looks for signs from others hoping that they feel the same way he enters an underground conspiracy that aims to overthrow Big Brother (the invisible but everpresent power that represents a faceless system). And just as a flame of hope lights up inside him the nightmare transforms into an endless journey to hell.There is no point of giving away the plot because it happens to be one of great twists as Winston finds out in the most scary way imaginable the sheer controlling power that Big Brother enjoys over everyone.There are so many myths about 1984. One is that the book implies the horrors of communism (stalinism to be exact). While it is true that Orwell was inspired by the \\"feats\\" of Big Daddy (that would be Joseph Stalin) to write his book he was equally inspired by the unspeakable crimes of the Nazi dictatorship in Germany as well. Orwell does not imply any one specific form of dictatorship but he simply tries to see forward, he tries to warn and predict the forms that the dictatorships of the future will have and he puts no political color on it. The dictatorship he describes could happen in a society near you, no matter where you live and no matter how safe you think your \\"democracy\\" might seem to you.Allthough (and especially) the last part of the book is the most intimidating and overbearing one, i found that what actually scared me the most was how accurate the author is in what he sees for the future. Remember he wrote this way over half a century ago. And what does he see?He foresees thought control. Check. In case you think you arent thought-controlled then the system is functioning perfectly thank you. He foresees the manipulation of history in order to make the system more powerful. Check again. It used to happen in a smaller degree now it happens in a scientific degree. Take for example the \\"People's history of the United States\\" by Howard Zinn, read it, and compare what you read with what you \\"learned\\" in school, and you will see my point. And that's just one of the 1000s of examples that could be brought up.He foresees a a dictatorship where people do not realise they live in a dictatorship (and the few who do are \\"put away\\"). Well, guess what, check again. Regardless of where you live chances are you do not realise how the system controls you, and not only that, but chances are again, you call this a democracy because that is what you are told (brainwashed) to call it.And on and on and on..All this is just paving the way for the Orwellian nightmare.Some have said that life itself proved that Orwell was just a hardcore pessimist as the \\"future\\" didnt prove to be that horrible. Wrong. The genius of George Orwell has actually seen the process through which what he describes WILL happen. It is in fact happening right now. There are many who see it and sense it but many times more who dont.There is no point to be silly and promote this stunning future-diagnosis of a book as a \\"classic\\" or to suggest to you that you \\"must\\" read it or all that.Things are very simple. If you care about yourself before all else then do read it. If there is still hope for you then this book will change you. If this book has no effect on you then you do not understand the problem to begin with. But that's a good thing. Because in that case you will never have to see some future \\"Room 101\\". What is \\"Room 101\\"? It's a place in Orwell's \\"future nightmare\\" that very few have been in but everybody knows that that's where you are corrected from bad thoughts.But go on. Treat yourself to some bad thoughts. Such rooms dont exist anyway."},{"Title":"1984","review":"A stunning book, that's really all I can say. Just make sure you read the chapter on the language, which is usually the last part of the book, first. If I were stuck on an island and could only bring two things I would bring the BIBLE (how things were and will be) and 1984 (how things must not be)."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Although I have generally found Orwell to be a politically confused thinker, 1984 stands out as one of the best and most forward thinking works I have ever read. The amount of relevance this book has today is overwhelming, considering modern government propaganda techniques and the double edged sword of technology. This story serves as a warning to all who trust the government, especially in regards to privacy issues.Winston Smith, while not the ideal romantic protagonist, is still compelling in his own right with his inspiring (and finally tragic) fight against Big Brother. The struggle that takes place between Winston and the government in 1984 is psychologically thrilling and intense, and it is still difficult for me to put the book down each time I read it. I am particularly drawn to the character of O'Brien, who represents to me the culmination of a path that all seasoned politicians and government officials travel down.The year 1984 has come and past, but an extreme statist government similar to the one portrayed in the novel still may haunt us in the future."},{"Title":"1984","review":"1984, by George Orwell, is the story of the reality of a society stuck in a nightmare of Negative Utopia. The author's influencial views of the haunting novel transport you into a world where individuality is loss and the sense of Big Brother comes into play. Winston Smith, the main character of the novel, is stuck between the encasement of the Thought Police, to the overseeing of the Party. Winston is faced with the turmoil of going against the government, which puts his life in danger. The part I like about this book is that with every page, there is always a new scene of interest which keeps you reading until the very last sentence. The struggle of one man--in world where all is against him.But then again, this book makes us wonder, when is it &quot;too far&quot; in regards to Big Brother, and how close is are society becoming to it today? 1984, is a thought provoking book which ponders many questions about the involvement in citizens person lives, and how much should they know about you personally. -I only hope that the world never comes to such a reality, because once it does, all individuality becomes completely lost."},{"Title":"1984","review":"This book creeps. The work took on a life of its own and conveyed more than Orwell intended. The mood betrayed Orwell's own confrontation with the inevitable. He endured to finish the work before his death. His analysis of a world left to authoritarian control reached that point of no return where sequential logic becomes prophetic. In that unexpected place his gaze was able to penetrate even the iron curtain and the atrocities happening in Russia. He also presented an organic scene where new technology could potentially be used for control and surveillance. That state of innovation and our responsibility to administer it will always resonate.Orwell allows us to plod along with Winston, who despite the desperation of his situation, manages to convey hope through education to his audience. The cautionary message: it could happen to us. The threats may now be wearing different masks, but the dangers will always be present.This well established literary work presents a bold fight against relativism and is an equalizer of all political systems because it is the result of any one taken to the point of perversion."},{"Title":"1984","review":"George Orwell's 1984, which was written in 1949, is a frightening vision of what the world could turn into in just three and a half decades. This addicting novel takes place in the city of London, in the territory of Oceania, which contains Africa, the Americas, and much of Europe. It is the story of Winston Smith, one of the last non-believers in the principles of \\"the party.\\" This party is a governing body of startling proportions and power. The party has the influence to erase the past, and change it to better suit their needs. Anything they say goes, and those who oppose them are tortured and killed. In a world of fear and absolute control, Winston is one of the last believers that the party can eventually be overthrown. Winston believes that \\"If there is hope... it lies in the proles.\\" Winston's hope is that eventually these proles, or members of the working class, will ultimately rise up and cause the downfall of the party.I highly recommend this book to anyone who is ready for something to read that will make him or her think. This is a book that is not for the squeamish reader. If you are looking for a charming tale to lift your spirits, you are looking in the wrong place. 1984 is a thought provoking piece that force you to question the world around you and think about the possibilities that the quite possibly come to pass in the not-so-distant future."},{"Title":"1984","review":"This book is by far one of the best books I've read in a long time. It is in short the creepiest books I've ever read. 1984 is filled with all sorts of disturbing images and ideas that make you winder how stable the world really is and how easily it could fall apart. Although it does follow the story of one mans sufferings it is almost more interesting to think about the world that he lives in. This world full of riddles and lies is disturbing to say the least and what is even scarier fascinating.What is even more interesting is all of the symbols and ideas that run through the book. Such as doublethink and that if you control the past you control the future. But doublethink is by far my favorite. I thought it was fascinating how the concept of proving a lie with a lie was evident even in the characters themselves. Like how Winston is a lover and a hater of the Party. These ideas make the book even more amazing. This book is a MUST read."},{"Title":"1984","review":"George Orwell's classic novel, 1984 is one of the most thought-provoking books I have ever read. It deals with a totalitarian government that has complete control over the populace, right down to their thoughts! The government even has the Thought Police, which make sure everyone is doing everything solely for the benefit of the government. Telescreens constantly monitor them to make sure they are doing everything for the good of the \\"Party.\\"Orwell's novel illustrates the basic human need for freedom through the main character, Winston Smith who begins the dangerous practice of questioning the government and trying to find one of the main rebels of the government, Goldstein. The book tells of his struggle to overthrow the government and how he tries to rebel against it.Orwell dives deep into the logic of how to control a populace under wartime conditions by constantly keeping them active for the cause of having their country win the war and not being able to think of any ulterior motives. He also shows how perpetually being at war helps to waste resources, so people have just enough to survive and won't become too comfortable. If they became too comfortable they might start thinking and thinking is dangerous to a totalitarian government. An example of how resources are wasted is any extra metal is used for ships or any extra rubber for raincoats, therefore making luxury obsolete.He also writes about different totalitarian governments like Nazi Germany and Stalinist Russia and where their mistakes were in attaining absolute power. He points out that both these regimes started off tough, but as time went on got laxer and laxer until the people revolted. Orwell also dives deep into government propaganda and how that shapes the attitude of humans by constantly bombarding them with one thing over and over until it becomes fact or reality. Through exploring the propaganda in 1984, he shows us the need to trust our government, but verify what it says in order that we won't get taken advantage of.He also explores how, in his book, humans can be taught one thing, but when the government says so, switch to believing something totally opposite. He does this under a principle called doublethink. Two examples of this from the book are that people are taught 2+2=4 but then can switch to knowing 2+2=5, completely denying that it ever equaled 4. He also shows the importance of keeping accurate and undoctored records so that if an event occurred, the facts cannot be changed to hide blame or recognition or tossed down the memory hole, simply to be forgotten. This is done often in 1984 so that the government will always look right and infallible and people will always believe that they are.In conclusion, this novel will profoundly change how you view government and will also make you realize how important your civil rights are. I would not recommend this book to anyone under 13 or 14 because it has some sexual content."},{"Title":"1984","review":"1984 is just one of those books I've always wanted to read. Although I had never heard anybody talk about it for long, or anything other than the phraes &quot;Big Brother is Watching You,&quot; the fact that I heard it referred to everywhere as a good book. While browsing at Barnes &amp; Noble, I saw it and decided to pick it up and, suffice to say, I'm glad I did.Orwell's use of character development in 1984 is on par with the astounding work done in Animal Farm. In a sense, you aren't just reading about Winston Smith, you ARE Winston Smith. Every thought, every nuance of his mind, is so clearly conveyed that you can't help but feel like you're there right along with him.The negative utopia dreamed up by Orwell is astounding in both its shocking nature and it's beleivability. It's a world where everybody either has a government job or is an outcast. A world of a vast caste system that is all too beleivable. A world where the all-pervasive government can, for all intents and purposes, alter the past, the present, and reality itself. Their control over the minds of the citizens of Oceania is so great that they have no choice but to accept without question what the aprt says, or be eliminated.Let me get one thing straight: This book is not a happy one. It displays a party who can and does shred every remain of human dignity. You will leave this book not with a sense of happiness, but with a sense of awe. The shocking tale held within the pages of this book is one of the finest peices of modern literature ever written. I'll leave it at that."},{"Title":"1984","review":"The epitome of fiction about totalitarian states. Orwell was a socialist, however 1984 is a warning about what happens when the government, not the people, have absolute control over everything. The year is 1984 and Winston Smith is a citizen of a country called &quot;Oceania&quot; which occupies a third of the Earth's landmasses. He lives in what is called Airstrip One in a place that used to be called Great Britain. The government ominously titled &quot;Big Brother&quot; attempts (and quite successfully too) to control everything in the population right down to their very thoughts. Winston hans't fallen into this trap yet and is an outsider but only in his mind. He knows what Big Brother enforces and while he plays along with it he condemns it in his thoughts. Thus, he has committed what is called &quot;Thought Crime&quot; something punishable by death. WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD. Big Brother forges the population into a 'machine', one that will elevate the party (the controlling members of the government) into almost all-powerful status. The government can control the very thoughts of it's citizens it blatantly changes past events to it's own will, which is what Winston's job is. He re-writes history for the government. History has become so muddled that it is impossible for Winston to know the real truth beyond what Big Brother says is true. He knows of at least one instance which although he can never prove, where the government was wrong, he is exposed to every single instance when Big Brother changes the past. Big Brother knows that a population must have an outlet for it's negetive emotions, for that Big Brother points to an enigmatic man named Emmanuel Goldstein, a person who supposedly was once on par with Big Brother himself then betrayed the party and is leading an active rebellion. Whether Goldstein even exists is questioned. Winston decides to join Goldstein's rebellion. 1984 is in someways prophetic even. At one point Winston meets someone in jail who was turned in for thoughtcrime by his own daughter. The ability of children to get their parents in trouble for abuse occurs today. 1984 is a must read for anyone concerned about current politics. It is also highly recommended."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Though it was published in 1949, George Orwell created an insightful look into a possible future with his writing of 1984. The story takes place in London, England in a \\"super-state\\" called Oceania that is perpetually at war with one of two other \\"super-states\\", Eurasia or Eastasia. The government, run by a figurehead party leader called Big Brother, monitors all actions, facial expressions (thus, thoughts), and conversations via \\"telescreens\\". Any potential threat to the government that is caught by these screens is punishable by death, and Spies or Thought Police carry out the sentence.I thoroughly enjoyed this book because of the rising and falling suspense throughout it. I expected this novel to be a dry political book, but it seemed to be one of personal change and survival in a world of conformity and unrealized oppression. The love story sub-plot running through 1984 is one of companionship and unity instead of lust and personal gain. The removal of liberty, freedom, and individuality disturbed me, but these restrictions were the driving force behind the actions taken by the two main characters.The circumstances in this novel seem to have become commonplace occurrences to some degree, and that is what seems scary in the novel. Now that there are cameras monitoring every public place, Orwell's \\"future\\" doesn't seem so far-fetched. The events in the story inspire deep thought and moral reflection; I thought about this book for days after I finished it. I recommend this book to anyone. There are elements of action, drama, romance, and mystery in this novel, and it's easy to see why it is talked about after 1984 has come and gone."},{"Title":"1984","review":"I think anyone who creates a language (even if it's only been partially created) for his/her writing, is an absolute genius. George Orwell is no exception. The vision and ideas that he brought forth in 1984 is something that can never be copied without disastrous results. This is one of the most enjoyable books that I've ever had to read for English class.While reading this story, I have to keep telling myself that the book was written in the 1940's. It's amazing what Orwell predicted for our future and how our much better, and how much worse, the present really is. The creation of Newspeak is a message to the deterioration of the English language, which is not so far fetched. Orwell wasn't so successful in his other predictions, but the book is fiction right? Every page of new developments and plot lines engrossed me more and more. It's a great book that can evoke so much emotion in its reader. That's what happened to me. It's wasn't happiness, either, mind you. I put so much confidence and hope into Winston, that I was crying for his failure and my disappointment, by the end of the book. Truly a must read book. Even if you hate the book after reading it, it's still a book that should be read by everybody. It's sheds light on corruption, power, and rebellion. The only part I didn't enjoy was select portions of Goldstein's &quot;book&quot;, such as the repeated chapters. If Orwell lost any readers of 1984, it was probably during that part of the book."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Ok, Ok, I know . . . 1984 came and went and we are living in the 21st century. Orwell's book is certainly dated and that does affect the reading. However, any good work of literature does not rise and fall on the culture of the day, but on the inner struggle. This book is well written and the dangers printed are always on the horizon for us all. This book is still powerful enough to make your insides twist and cause you to watch the news in a new way."},{"Title":"1984","review":"1984 is a scary, dark, and depressing book. What makes it scarier is that it could happen...Anyone who likes novels, politics, and/or government must read this book. It is, of course, about the totalitarian society of Big Brother and the Thought Police. What makes the novel scary are the parallels that can be drawn between the novel and the U.S. government (and those of other Western countries). For instance, how war is used in the media by the government. This is why it is a required read, read it for yourself and draw the parallels where realistic- they are there.Besides that, the story is excellent; fast paced, well written, and entertaining. The characters are believable and vividly drawn. Overall, an absolutely essential book."},{"Title":"1984","review":"1984 is a study of the human psyche, both at individual and group level. Written in the setting of a Nazi and Communist style dictatorship, the book examines the struggle between the individual and the masses as well as providing a brutally frank answer to the question of why does history repeat itself. Orwell's profound insight takes the reader on a rewarding journey of discovery. But let the reader beware: once you read 1984 and comprehend its message, there is no going back. This book is not for the squeamish."},{"Title":"1984","review":"In today's technologically oriented world, people still seem shocked when movies come out that portray governmental security that seemingly invades on the public's privacy, which makes George Orwell's 1984 even more of a masterpiece. This thought-provoking novel, written in 1949, well before computers, surveillance cameras and hidden microphones, depicts a world in which the government controls everything, knows everything and has no feasible opposition.Winston Smith, our connection to Airstrip One, lives under the oppressive leader Big Brother. Big Brother has set up an undefeatable party that monitors its citizens with telescreens, Thought Police, Newspeak, and Doublethink. Newspeak is a language that the party has created, eliminating all words that might bringnegative feelings toward the party, and doublethink is the party's control over its citizens' minds that makes them believe anything (ex: 2 + 2 = 5). Winston strives toward defeating the party, but is constantly met with another layer of Big Brother control. Orwell constructed the book to have a gloomy feel over it, one that creates &quot;negative utopia&quot; for which it is famous. The reader will never get fully emotionally involved with any characters, yet will be engrossed in the plot. This book is one that leaves readers thinking 'What If?' days later, and exercises the mind in the meantime. Orwell crafted the book precisely, evoking certain feelings and certain times, which I think makes this book a must-read for anyone interested in expanding their imagination while reading a classic. But remember, once you pick this book up, don't stop before the end. Big Brother might be watching, and youcertainly don't want to be on his bad side."},{"Title":"1984","review":"To sum it up, this book scared me to death. No, there are no monsters, serial killers, or anything else like that. 1984 is about an extreme communist society and how one man tries to break free from it. The book may seem like a bit of a love story, but that's not the point. The frightening thing about this book is that our hero fails. With most books, the hero is triumphant at the end, or at least there is a glimmer of hope. Not with this book. Our hero, Winston, falls in love with Julia and together they want to break free from the hell they live in. But they are caught, tortured, and eventually betray each other. Since they have betrayed each other (something they thought they would never do), they no longer love each other. The idea that a society can make you stop loving somebody and change who you are in a realistic manner is frightening. This book had me paranoid for about a week. Even still, not all lessons are happy and this book is well worth the paranoia you might feel because of the lesson it gives you. Although this book was written in the 1940's, it is still hauntingly relevant today."},{"Title":"1984","review":"I consider this one of the top 3 Dystopian works, along with Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451 and Huxley's Brave New World. But I think this is the most philosophical - and the most grim - of the three. All the ingredients are here -- we get the grim, joyless, totalitarian nation that is such a nightmare to the Western ideas of individuality and basic rights. Like in Fahrenheit, we get an obsessive control over language - though here it goes much farther, to the destruction of words. Like BNW, we get government controlled social structure and recreation time, even sexuality. Seems the main point of all of them is how shallow life can become if one obeys the authorities. What's different here - and I hope I'm not giving too much away-is that the rebel doesn't win. That seriously disturbed me at first, but the more I think about it, the more I feel it makes this work stand above the others as a Dystopian picture and a call to fight Power in government and protect individualism and free thought. For if the rebel can beat the Man, then the Man's power is limited, and we need not worry too much about the Man - the rebel can always win, if he wants. But if Big Brother can become powerful enough that no rebel can survive, as is the case in 1984, then we must truly fear and fight the Man-now, before He has that kind of power.In the end, I think I find this Dystopian work more well thought out, more complete, and scarier than Brave New World of Fahrenheit 451. Yet it still remains incredibly readable, and a disturbingly good time."},{"Title":"1984","review":"If you only read one more book, read George Orwell's \\"1984.\\"Other reviewers including the ... reviewer, has captured the essence of this incredible, disturbing, poignant, an accurate view into the mind of the totalitarians - and yes, folks, they live among us even today.I'll only add this: the \\"book-within-a-book\\" by Orwell's fictional author, Emmanual Goldstein, should be required study by every single high school and college student in the world. Don't know what I'm talking about? Read \\"1984\\" and look for Emmanual Goldstein within this book's pages. Then ask yourself the questions you dared not ask yourself before.Then go read \\"Brave New World\\" and \\"The Probability Broach.\\" The first is a different, altogether more pleasant version of Hell. The second holds out the real promise of freedom-loving people (\\"Broach\\"). Then tell others what you have learned."},{"Title":"1984","review":"When i first picked up a copy of this book, i thought it would be about new kids on the block or something else 80's. Little did i know i was about to read a literary classic. 1984 is an amazing book, and somewhat terrifying. Though some of the themes are a bit radical, i immediatly came to a realization that the world could be like it is written. The main charactor, Winstin, is a common man, who can easily be related to someone you know. The book depicts the horrid possibility of the world being ruled by communism, and big brother, and what happens to a man that is against it all. I definetly recommend this book!!"},{"Title":"1984","review":"I don't think I could say anything about this book that hasn't already been said! This is probably my favourite novel of all time! This has unbelivable power, the atmosphere is incredible. It still grips and absorbs me every time I read it! I love the ambiguity of the ending. If you haven't read this novel and are wondering if you should, don't think about it any more, get a copy as soon as you can and get reading. It'll be one the most rewarding reading experiences you'll ever have!A totally exceptional novel!"},{"Title":"1984","review":"I was forced to read this in school when I was younger and I didn't really &quot;get it&quot; nor was I even interested in &quot;getting it&quot;. I think if you are over 20, you want to re-read this classic novel. It was much better, the second time around."},{"Title":"1984","review":"It would be hyperbolic to say the world of Nineteen Eighty Four has arrived. But there are too many elements of today's society that evoke parts of the book. We hear a lot today about &quot;Hate Crimes&quot;. A more accurate term for that concept is the one coined by Orwell -- &quot;Thought Crimes&quot;. In fact, calling Thought Crimes by a different name in order to make the idea more palatable is simply a creative use of Newspeak/DoubleThink. I don't think I have to give examples of Big Brother -- you can supply your own. My point is that we may yet be a long way from a totalitarian state, but we have at least taken small steps in that direction -- and perhaps we should be concerned at how little we are resisting that movement."},{"Title":"1984","review":"I highly recomend this book because its interesting and it relates to real life. I find that interesting that the government is always watching, I always felt like someone somewhere always knows what you are up to 24 hours a day. Hopefully the terminator doesn't see everything like when we go to the bathroom or that would just be mest up.This book changed me a little bit, now i think twice before doing stupid stuff because I know someone out there might be watching and I might get in trouble. It doesn't have to be the government, the popo can be watching you from far away and you think he is probably not watching and 5 minutes later after you did the dumb thing, your screwed and you will get in trouble with the law.I highly recommend this book because it will change your view on the goverment, and on the world we live in now."},{"Title":"1984","review":"I never read Orwell in school for some reason and I am glad I waited. I can't believe this was written in the late 40's. O'Brien's descriptions of seeking power for power's sake and the mutability of truth and history have never been more applicable to current events. Reading this book now, you really start to feel like this must be on Karl Rove's desk."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Unlike a lot of people who were told to read this in High School, I didn't learn of it until a few brief years ago. I'd heard of it, but didn't really \\"get\\" why so many people were blown away by it. Then I read it and have since made it a point to get my hands on everything this man had ever written! George Orwell was no doubt a genius, visionary, prophet and a definite priceless gift to all of humanity. 1984 written in the late 1940's, (I see 1949 in my book, but I don't want to nail down a date as there have been reprints), someone else here has stated 1948 which if so, is still incredibly beyond remarkable because what he describes is something that sounds so much like the world we currently live in today, and the potential for it to be this world which he describes? Well, unfortunately the means are in fact all present now. We can be observed pretty much around the clock from when we leave our homes until we arrive. With what can be done with cell phones, GPS etc but I won't go into what should already be quite obvious to all. The fact of the matter is he foretold with pin point accuracy just how things could be and the frightening thing is many of these things are in my opinion in affect. New Speak, Thought Police, War is Peace, Freedom is Slavery, Ignorance is Strength, Big Brother and countless other things he writes about ring with such an eery realness one has to wonder if he time traveled into our present day and perhaps slightly beyond and then returned to his time to write about it to truly warn us what was at stake. I won't tell the story, as George does that exceptionally well to the point where you feel as if you are seeing this \\"World\\" he paints through the eyes of the main character \\"Winston\\".So much so that even though it was written years ago, it reads as if in many cases it could have been written today, or yesterday. Like Gene Rodenbury's Star Trek, George Orwell's 1984 is definitely light years ahead of its time. I don't think this book can be recommended highly enough to those who have not yet read it. Nor do five stars even remotely come close to giving this Master Piece it's due credit.

Soon, every phone will incorporate GPS location technology.Are we prepared for the inevitable?In a time when the pace of technology continues to accelerate, Orwell's classic has never been more relevant."},{"Title":"1984","review":"This is one of those rare books that isn't necessarily a pleasure to read but is definitely worth reading. Orwell's novel manages to affect you long after you've read it - possibly even haunt you. It's a bleak novel (some might say downright depressing) - but it's also powerful and uncompromising.Over 50 years have passed since 1984 was published (the year itself came and went over 20 years ago) yet this novel is still relevant today. 1984 is a remarkably ambitious work; unflinching and perceptive. Orwell isn't just telling a story though; he is using this novel as a soap box to warn us all of the dangers of totalitarian governments.1984 is a novel about big ideas; about the machinery of totalitarian governments and how people can be manipulated and controlled by those in power. I did find however that the characters weren't as developed as I would have liked, as if Orwell felt they were a secondary consideration. As a result, I found the novel lacked a personal quality that I think would have made it all the more compelling. Winston Smith is not an especially sympathetic character (or for that matter, all that memorable a character). What is memorable about 1984 is the world Orwell creates - a world of contradiction, oppression, and betrayal.This is not a book that will bring a smile to your face. Its message is delivered with a heavy hand but 1984 will make you think. If it doesn't make you paranoid, it should at least make you cynical."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Orwell writes a wonderfully disturbing story about totalitarianism. The characters were interesting and the story is a little creepy, but it is a fascinating read. And Orwell has a wonderful grasp of language. On the downside, the middle does drag on because it's more of a political treatise or arguement instead of a story."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Even read now--many years after 1984--some of the revaltions of this book hold scarily true. Big Brother vs personal freedom--a scary topic."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Yes, technology can be the new hand maiden to Totalitarian government. Or we can choose to be free. To speak out. To allow different viewpoints. We can choose NOT to shout down others when they speak. Thomas Jefferson knew that \\"the price of freedom is eternal vigilance\\" and so did the author of \\"1984\\".We can choose to read our history books and great novels. This is a great novel about a possible dystopia. Eric Blair was a great British journalist and the story he tells here rings more true than ever before."},{"Title":"1984","review":"\\"1984\\" is one of the defining works of fiction from the 20th Century. Written by George Orwell (the pen name of Eric Arthur Blair) in 1949, it has become the work referenced in other literature, film, and music for a future government which controls all of its citizens, and uses them to maintain its own position of power. Of course, it was not the first novel to present this idea, but it is perhaps one that presents the future that is the most bleak and without hope.Other authors have created sterile futures built on technological advancements that have drained humanity from its citizens. Instead, Orwell's future has technology held in check or even regressing, while political power and control are the forces that imprison humanity in his future. It is easy to read fascism and communism into the government of \`Big Brother', but one can see elements from \\"1984\\" in any type of government, they simply are more obvious in a totalitarian one.This novel has been recognized many times by readers. In 1952 it ranked 17th on the Astounding/Analog All-Time Poll, and in 1956 it tied for 9th on the same poll. In 1975 it tied for 41st on the Locus Poll for All-Time novels, in 1975 it was 34th on the Locus Poll for All-Time SF Novels, and in 1998 it was 21st on the Locus Poll for SF Novels from before 1990. The most fitting recognition though, must be the Prometheus Hall of Fame award which it won in 1984."},{"Title":"1984","review":"1984 is a story about Winston Smith, a member of the totalitarian communist party of the country Oceania. 1984 was written by George Orwell describing the consequences of a communist government taking hold. Winston Smith works at a government office that publishes propaganda and changes historical records on a daily basis. It operates under the idea that \\"Who controls the past controls the future: who controls the present controls the past\\". This is central to the government and revolves around the realization that history is only made of human memory and records, because it can not be made of matter. In 1984, records are constantly destroyed and rewritten, to the point that no one is actually sure that it is 1984. In order to control human memory, citizens are taught to deny past memories consciously while simultaneously denying that they are denying anything. Winston goes on to rebel and then suffers a fait similar to that of those determined \\"counter-revolutionary\\" by the Russian socialists. In the end, Winston experience an almost religious change to becoming a devoted follower of the Party.I found 1984 entertaining and challenging, but it not the most exciting or gripping read. Compared to similar books like A Brave New World and Orwell's own Animal Farm, 1984 fell short. The general pessimistic darkness became boring and trite instead of disturbing because there was never a hint of contrast. Oppressive despair as the general mood is fine, but obsessively mulling it over and over is worse than beating the reader over the head with it.I think that 1984 was centered around an idea rather than an emotion, set of characters or plot, and because of this I think that many elements of the story, dominantly the characters, suffered. Instead of the actions being caused by what the characters personalities were, the characters were designed around the actions. The only traits shown were the ones that were necessary to make the actions reasonable. Because of this, even the most important characters were often extremely developed in on area and flat and dull in another. On the other hand, a nice touch was that throughout the story, Winston mentally accepts that he will be caught, but when it actually happens, he is emotionally unprepared. I thought that this made him more realistic and human.As stated before, 1984 prizes an idea above all else, and Orwell seems willing to sacrifice anything and everything to nock it into the reader's head. Newspeak, the language of Oceania, is a good idea to show another aspect of this atrocious government that Orwell wants to illustrate, but did nothing for the plot or the characters. It was supposed to enhance the sense of absolute orthodoxy, but in the end it just seemed bothersome and distracting.While 1984 is a great intellectual triumph, it lacks in everything but mental capacities. It was stilted, stiff and insipid compared to Orwell's other stories."},{"Title":"1984","review":"When I read this book at first it was very dense and a little complicated. But as I got farther into the book I realized I had actually started becoming part of the book. I realized that I knew what would happen before it happened. Oddly enough this mad the book even more interesting instead of boring. As I finished the book I tried to do what I always do; look for what the author was trying to tell me. Now it's obvious that he was warning against the effect of communism. Yet he was also exposing a human need that most of us don't recognize. Orwell was trying to tell us that all of us have a deep need for something to be under. The Party in this book was looking for someone to have them under control and to tell them what to believe in. They were looking for something material to represent to them the power they believed in. An example of this in actual life would be when people look to the priest's to tell them how to live their lives instead of looking straight to God. The reason they do this is because they cannot see, hear, touch, taste, or smell God. So they take a human being and idolize them as if they were the only link they had towards God. This is the human need that Orwell was trying to relate to us."},{"Title":"1984","review":"What is most impressive about 1984 is not the quality of writing or the appeal of the storyline, though both are excellent. What is most impressive about 1984 is that so many of the concepts discussed, either implicitly or explicity are still applicable and relevant in today's modern politics. Doublethink as a concept is not far off from the lies today's politicians ask you to believe as they continue to become embroiled in one controversial moral or ethical crisis after another. One has to wonder, after reading this book, if we are not in fact on our way to catastrophe ourselves in the 21st century. Though the threat is not perhaps militant in nature, it is still real nonetheless in the form of moral decay. This book is emminently comparable to Huxley's Brave New World and if you enjoyed one, you'll enjoy the other."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Yeah right. That is what we would all like to think in our safe, secure little world. When written, no one would pubish this astounding fantastic reality. Mr. Orwell had to wait several years and suffer many dissapointments for anyone to accept and believe in his story. Today, what once seemed 'science-fiction' is an all too true and fast becoming reality. This book will make you question your reality, understand accpetance, empathize with institutionalism and wonder at how individualistic you really are - despite your noblee attempts!Although, at first intimidating, Orwell's style and nature soon becomes free and clear, and though it drags on at some parts; You won't stop reading untill you are done. What seems hard to comprehend and language a few chapters to get used to.. you too will soon think in terms of newspeak and realize how easily it can happen to you too!"},{"Title":"1984","review":"From cover to cover 1984 captivates the reader with its insightful, intriguing, and disturbing look at human nature. Winston, the hero of the novel, lives in a totalitarian government that has control over every aspect of his life. The government has made privacy obsolete and love a sin; therefore, making life for many people unlivable.But with the slogan \\"Big Brother Is Watching You\\" reigning over every wall and building, many people are far to afraid to speak out against this so called \\"perfect\\" government, in fears of loosing their life. Winston however, feels that as long as he is living under the rule on INGSOC (the official name of the government) he might as well be dead. So he looses his fears and slowly takes action against INGSOC. He falls in love and for the first time in his life he is truly happy. But everything that he is doing is against the law. The government views love as something that is dangerous to the party; therefore it must be destroyed. Ultimately the government turns out to be far more complex and powerful than anyone imagined.I am assuming that many people are reading this before they have actually read 1984. I will not reveal more because I do not want to ruin the plot for you. AlI can say is that it has a surprise ending that you would have never expected.1984 was written by George Orwell in 1949, yet its theme and ideas still holds true in many ways to today's world. That is one, out of many reasons, as to why 1984 will forever be a classic. Set in 1984, Orwell's depiction, of what was then considered the future, is both horrific and in some ways accurate to the governments of today.There is great deal of symbolism in this novel. I believe that Orwell's intention, as Goldings had been in Lord of the Flies, was to reveal the evil that drives people and to show how that evil is apparent even in today's modern societies. Orwell worded this book so eloquently that it is easy for almost anyone to pick up the symbolism.1984 was so eye opening for me, that after I read it I walked morbidly around the house just thinking about what ultimately happened to Winston. This book pulls everyone in because it has all the elements - drama, action, suspense, and romance. I only recommend this book to people that are at least in 6 grade. The reading isn't challenging, it is just the actual concepts about the goal of governments and human spirit that might be confusing. If you are the type of person that likes to get absorbed in a book, not just have a quick read, then this is the book for you. If you enjoy books such as Fahrenheit 451, Brave New World, or The Giver, then 1984 will undoubtedly become a favorite."},{"Title":"1984","review":"More chilling now than when I first read it over 25 years ago. Not necessarily because of increased understanding but because of increased intrusion by the state. I am nagged by the realization that had Orwell lived longer, his work would have been closer to current events than fiction."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Orwell describes a Negative Utopia, one which Big Brother watches your every move, any inkling of dislike towards the party can get you killed, and even confessions of one's own children can send you to labor camps.The first half paints a scary picture as one man tries to cope with everyday life in this suffocating hell. There are telescreens constantly watching you, people totally dedicated to revising the past to suit the Party, spies out to snitch on you. The main character, through his mundane everyday ordeal, breaks the mold and does something dangerous - buys and writes into a diary. The overall feeling is a common but classic one - one man tries to break out of a confining society. He describes the mood of the world that any man can relate to, being an individual in a world where individuality is not welcome.The second half is the weaker half. It turns from a subtle message to an openly overt message. Instead of the concentrating on one man's perspective, Orwell bombards the reader with mock history and rhetoric, and a last minute confession by the Party itself. That last minute confessions reminds me of how in any badly written movie, the villain suddenly explains his motives and his actions to the hero before he's about to kill him. And like those movies, the motivation is overblown and totally unreal.This book was enjoyable, and the writing was smooth and fluid. The lack of dialogue and action sort of took away from the enjoyment, but not too much. I would recommend this book, but I still think Animal Farm is far superior."},{"Title":"1984","review":"I feel 1984 is a great book. One of the best books I have ever read. A constant mind game that toyed with my senses. I loved the book start to finish, except for the excerpt from Emanuel Goldstein's book. I felt the passage was long winded and demeaned the excitement of the book dramatically. 1984 is a great book for people interested in politics, world domination, and totalitarian &quot;negative utopias.&quot; Winston, the main character, is a wonderful figurehead for the hoplessness of freedom in the INGSOC reality. I personally loved this book, and I think many others will find it equally enjoyable and satisfying. 1984 was a fairly graphic book, not as graphic as others, but graphic still. Some parts of the novel were silly, others very serious, it is a roller coaster of emotions, events, and politics. Julia, a great supporting character who really moved the story along and forced Winston to take chances, without which the story would not be possible. INGSOC is a lot like the Russian communists and the German Nazis in their beliefs, but not in their actions. INGSOC plays a sinister role as a world super power that stomps out competition, except for its fellow super powers. In this colossal struggle of power and espionage, one thing stands true...Love, but in the end even that dies."},{"Title":"1984","review":"The book 1984 by George Orwell was in a way funny. It was somewhat odd and mysterious, but it was funny. It was funny because of how George Orwell viewed the future. He described secret organizations. I believe that this book was very good literature, but it gave a weird outlook on the year 1984. As an example George Orwell writes,&quot;Winston feared for his life that the thought police would track him down if he dared keep writing in the diary.&quot; Even so for a person who loves reading about what could have been and the odd ways history could have happened, this George Orwell classic is all for you, and I recommend it. For those that prefer a more realistic novel, like me, aim for another author and book of your choice."},{"Title":"1984","review":"This is one of the most depressing books I've ever read, but it does present an excellent discussion about conspiracy and power.

The most striking feature of this book is that for some countries this type of totalitarian state is not to far into the future, which left a small, but apparent truth with me. Orwell was not trying to show what life in 1984 would be, but as a projection and exaggeration of tendencies and changes over the years. It would be a shame to miss out on this book no matter what."},{"Title":"1984","review":"1984 by George Orwell is definetly a great book that I really liked. It starts out kinda boring, going more than at least 10-20 pages without any dialogue. However, the story soon started to pick up, detailing Winston Smith's challenges in his world. In this world, which to call &quot;unique&quot; would be an understatement, the characters are faced with restrictions that we fortunately never have to deal with. Even though I think the book would've been more exciting to read in the years before 1984, as there was more excitement and horror to imagine the prospect of the book's story coming true, this book still reminds us of what could be."},{"Title":"1984","review":"&quot;Does Big Brother exist?&quot; &quot;Yes.&quot; &quot;In the same way I exist?&quot; &quot;You do not exist, Winston.&quot;Beauty can sometimes take strange forms. Beneath the decaying architecture and verminous rats of Ninteen Eighty-For's gangrenous surface there is a glorious centre, one which screams out profoundly that it is a master of all it says and that George Orwell is the master of his cxreation.The book was completed, ironically, in Ninteen Fourty-Eight when Orwell had seen the future. He had fought in the Spanish Civil War and had lived through the Second World War. The future, as he saw it, was a brutal labrynth of pain and torture, where the only way to escape the pain of everyday life was to become oblivious to it: to succumb without reervation.Orwell casts us into a paralell universe where events post 1945 turned out quite differently. Among the shambolic ruins of the ninteenth-century buildings there exists the Party: a totalitarian entity which monitors its citizens with greater zeal than it fights its wars. The Party controls the vast super state of Oceania, permanently at war with its corresponding entities, Eastasia or alternately Eurasia. Winston Smith is the fragile everyman, a man who has somehow kept his sanity and some degree of individuality. He rebels against the regime by falling in love with a woman who thinks along similar lines. His rebellion is touching yet we know what it ultimately entails.But there is an underlying sense of poetry to the great book as those who read Lord of The Rings will testify to feeling a sense of history. The novel makes no excuses for its treatment of the charcters. People are brutalised, subverted, their minds twisted into bizzare forms of life and then ultimately destroyed. Yet through all the turns it takes, Ninteen Eighty-Four leaves a deep impression on us and its message echoes throughout our society.Beauty is such a strange thing.&quot;There can be no love, except love for the party. If you want an image of the future, imagine a boot stamping on a human face...forever.&quot;"},{"Title":"1984","review":"This book has been on my shelf for years. It was required reading for many students when I was in high school in the early 1960s. My Father read it in college in the early 1950s. It's required in many courses at Universities today. And, I discovered that eighth graders were reading it in a local school just this last year! The book, contrary to the opinions of those earlier reviewers who gave it a poor rating, is still a major classic. It is not only studied in literature courses, but also in classes in political science, history, semantics, and even advertising. It is an extrapolation of the grim world predicted by Orwell if totalitarianism and the perfect police state gain true power. This is an important work to read. Abuse and manipulation of power is a timeless topic. In the world of this novel, power is the only thing that counts. [Note that there is another book that readers might be interested in. Orwell used it as a &quot;stepping stone.&quot; The book is &quot;We&quot; by Yevgeny Zamiatin (or, Zamyatin) first published in 1924.] Personally, I also find the whole subject on how language is used to alter people's thoughts (and even the direction of their thoughts) is fascinating. The presentation provides considerable insight into journalism, political speeches, political correctness, and advertising. (Newspeak: &quot;The purpose of Newspeak was not only to provide a medium of expression for the world-view and mental habits proper to devotees of Ingsoc, but to make all other modes of thought impossible.&quot;) Many of the words coined by Orwell have become quite common (for example, doublespeak, crimethink, newspeak, etc.) Winston Smith is a worker in the Ministry of Truth whose job requires him to &quot;alter&quot; the past by rewriting history (\\"who controls the past, controls the future\\"). In his world there is no privacy (\\"Big Brother\\" is always watching), individuals with unorthodox ideas are executed, and perpetual warfare exists between three global powers (who keep the war going to keep their populations controlled). The Thought Police attempt to control people's minds by what they see, hear, and experience. When Winston falls in love (a crime) with Julia, the Party tries to destroy this &quot;crimethink.&quot; Smith's \\"reeducation\\" destroys his individuality and spirituality. The &quot;place where there is no darkness&quot; is not the light of Truth. It is the light in the torture room in the Ministry of Love."},{"Title":"1984","review":"An unforgettable book. A wonderful respite and a refreshing alternaive from all the modern every-day reads, I would say. What makes this book so good is the character development and the sudden events which are totally unexpected. The book is unpredictable and there are always new twists and turns to explore. George Orwell created a virtual city and his own political parties and ideas perfectly and they seamlessly bind together to make this the most substantial book I have ever read. Possibly the best as well.Big Brother is watching you so read the book!"},{"Title":"1984","review":"I don't know how Orwell could know what would happen 36 years later but he could. In my country the book couldn't be published until 1989, because the communists feared that it made too many people turn against them. Life wasn't much better in those days as written in 1984. Disinformation, getting the 'untrue' people out of the way and of course lots of phonies. The only shocking thing is that people really believed in that. And I may say that they some of them still believe in it in 1998!Thank God Big Brother is gone forever. But 1984 remains and warns us. We shouldn't ever have another Big Brother! So read this book and open your mind! You won't be happy in fact you'll be very sad but it's worth."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Perhaps the description will seem turgid and tiresome as you read 1984, but in retrospect it will have been to your great advantage to have read of this negative utopia. Regarding the one reviewer who gave this book one star -- please, actually pay attention before you write another review, and get your facts straight. Julia wasn't in the Thought Police. Why don't you go back to English class, and after you've mastered &quot;Green Eggs &amp; Ham&quot; try Orwell again. Thank you."},{"Title":"1984","review":"1984 does not live up to it's reputation. I'll grant that Orwell had a point (that _western_ societies, as well as soviet society were headed toward his future). However, Orwell is not a great novelist -- excellent essays, poor novels. Almost the entire plot is stolen from an earlier russian work (We, by Yevgeny Zamyatin), which is far superior. If you're interested in Orwell's political thinking (yes, he's a socialist), check out his essays. If you're looking for a good allegory, DON'T get 1984..."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Orwell's 1984 is the best reason for people to read. It demonstrates clearly and horrifically what can happen to an uneducated society that allows itself to be controlled due to it's own fear of initiative. Anyone who asks me why I read is automatically referred to this book, which is as important now as it was when it was written."},{"Title":"1984","review":"I feel that Orwell tried to warn not just the people of his time, but future generations of the atrocities a form of government such as totalitarianism would create.Yeah, it (facism and nazism) was very rampant in '48, but as '98 approaches, many of the things mentioned in the book are seemingly apparent in today's society.I read this novel my senior year in high school, and I honestly have to say that no other book has ever gotten to me... not even Slaughterhouse 5. Now that I am in my first year in college I have to write a paper on this arbitrary fanatical form of government,I understand where Orwell was coming from when he said that &quot; BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING YOU!&quot; Our government, which has sworn to protect the public, says that we the people have our constitutional rights as americans to have privacy and freedoms, yet our lovely government harasses law abiding citizens by invading thier privacies and shutting them up when trying to express their opinions. Don't get me wrong... I like this country, but it is gradually reducing itself into this sadist form of government that Orwell had desperately tried to warn us about. I guess this is about all I have to say about this."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Before I review the book, I must get this off my chest: ORWELL WAS BRITISH! He was NOT writing a warning about the government to future generations of Americans, he was NOT trying to warn us about black helicopters or the cameras on the street corner or anything like that. And in a time when a woman can be raped in public in broad daylight and get no help because people are too scared (this has really happened), perhaps a LITTLE surveillance is a good idea. It will never reach the horrific magnitude in 1984 because Americans are too paranoid (if hypocritical) too let that happen. Does anyone out there seriously think that a culture that fights to legalise automatic weapons because of &quot;Constitutional Rights&quot; would ever let Big Brother show his face?Now the book:1984 is undeniably a masterpiece. It skillfully and pointedly demonstrates the evils of Stalinist communism. It is not a prediction of what the American government would turn into; that is a ridiculously ethnocentric supposition. Rather it is a then-timely warning about Joseph Stalin written during the height of the Red Scare in America. Big Brother IS Stalin. He even looks like Stalin. The war that was the origin of the three governments in 1984 was the nuclear war that America and Russia were poised to fight all throughout the Cold War. Perhaps more to the point, 1984 is a fairly accurate representation of the prevailing atmosphere of communist Russia. People actually lived like this. Children as spies? Yes. Hate week? Under different titles, yes. Thought police? Without the technolgy in 1984 (though nearly so), yes. As a warning for today, 1984 admonishes against war, senseless hate, and extreme concentration of power. In America the concentration of power is pretty much impossible (watch Clinton try to pass a bill), but the other two seem to be the latest fashions.1984 was not meant to create paranoia; it was about the dangers of paranoia. This book needs to be read and taught, but it needs to be taught accurately."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Take a deep futuristic look into the mind of author George Orwell in his intense novel, 1984. Orwell's ideas of what our world will be like in his future, is a pessimistic outlook on his new world. The \\"Big Brother\\" controls all, and the civilians of Oceania are powerless. People lack many of the simple freedoms that we are associated with today, and the government runs everything. Oceania is one of the three main super states that are battling for power. The city has a system of monitoring that will keep all residents from rebelling or from even thinking about it. The plot includes all the things that many great books do, including: love, lust, crime, and deception. This great novel shows how the creative mind of Orwell can bring us to the world he thought was to become in the year, 1984As the story begins we meet our main character Winston Smith walking through the corridors of a large building. We quickly learn of the many new things to his world including the \\"Big Brother.\\" Seeing sings posted and messages spread across the walls, Winston can not escape the watchful eye of the \\"Big Brother.\\" Telescreens are everywhere and he is unable to escape their watchful eye. Winston eventually buys a journal and writes in it. From the first stroke of his pen, he is overwhelmed with the fear that he is going to be caught and go to jail. As he writes the words, \\"DOWN WITH BIG BROTHER\\" he knows that even if he had only thought it, it would be just as much of a crime. In fact, the thought crimes were known as the worst.Winston works in the Ministry of Truth, here he alters historical records to fit the needs of the party. He meets a beautiful woman at work, with dark hair, Julia. He is worried that she is an informant who will turn him in for his thought crimes; however she turns out to be an admirer and is in love with him. They are in the same thought the party, and become lovers. They begin a covert affair to see if anyone is monitoring them, and eventually move into the second floor of the store where he purchased the journal. They continue on together for a long time, and Winston is sure that they will be caught and punished, while Julia is much more optimistic.Winston becomes fixated with a party member named O'Brien, who Winston believes is a secret member of the Brotherhood (a mysterious group trying to overthrow the party.) Finally one day, Winston's dream comes true, and he is called on by O'Brien. This is what the couple thinks is the beginnings of something great. At O'Brien's luxurious apartment, he reveals that he is also against the party and all that it stands for. Then he asks for Winston to join the Brotherhood and help to stop the party and hands him the manifesto of the Brotherhood to read to Julia. Then something goes wrong, and our characters are caught up in a tricky web of lies and deception.The way the Orwell is able to set up the characters makes you read faster and deeper into the story. He is able to draw you in using a very simple technique of being instinctively vague. My mind would race as I read the pages of this spell binding novel, and I know how Orwell was able to turn such an ordinary event like the birth of a new year, into what would seem like a hellish nightmare. The \\"Big Brother\\" makes you think how a totalitarian government would be run. What if the world had turned into this place, what if there were people watching us and recording our every move thought, it makes me glad that I am a citizen here in the free country of the United States of America."},{"Title":"1984","review":"My name is Sean and I chose this book as a lit circle book in Mrs. Matau's class at Walla Walla High School.

In Orwell's fictional world, communism rules the people in all aspects. People are not allowed to form their own ideas and even think for themselves. The story is raw and does not try to sugar up anything but rather show the horrors of living in this negative utopia. While reading this novel Orwell makes it very clear what he is trying to say. He is warning the world never to fall into hands of a communist state. This book should be read by all because it is an easy read and shows how novels can be instrumental in exposing the truth about important global issues."},{"Title":"1984","review":"I read this book last year, in 8th grade, and it was one of the hardest books I have ever had to read. It was so long and dragged on and on. I did think this book was pretty good but it took me forever to read because of the vocab and there were so many scenes that could have been cut to make this book shorter. I am going to read this book again someday when I am a little older and will understand it a bit better because I did think it was good. I do recommend this to people but beware if you are young that it is a hard read. I recommend this to people in high school or above."},{"Title":"1984","review":"This is my favorite book of all time!

Reading it was like torture, but when I was done, I did appreciate Orwell's message &amp; underlying theme.I enjoyed analyzing the book &amp; discussing it with my peers. . (however, I'll stand by my statement that it is 294 pages of UN-EXCITEMENT).MY ADVICE: listen to other's interpretatin of it &amp; possibly read the cliffnotes -- THEN read the novel. You'll appreciate it more."},{"Title":"1984","review":"thanks to right wing Republicans and Christians in this country.Great book! He was truly a visionary, how he predicted this coming.Good bye civil liberties!"},{"Title":"1984","review":"This 1949 classic has lost none of its punch. With his descriptive depiction of the future, Orwell really puts the fear into the reader's heart. With his description of a totalitarian socialist regime, Orwell's masterpiece stimulates a fear that is reminiscent and matched only by The Red Scare of the late 1950s.The most amazing feature of this book is that it still holds relevance today. With America's War on Terrorism, the Bush Administration has started restricting American's basic civil liberties, such as a right to trial. This action almost seems to be a precursor to the restricted socialist atmosphere described so well by Orwell. Still if this book has one message, it is that the individual mind is stronger than any government and that humanity and freewill are things to cherish, not taken for granted. This book is a crystal ball into our country's future and deserves to be read. The founders of our Constitution would be appalled at the current state of the USA and what the Bush cabal is doing to it/us.The ideas in this book are ones that are as appropriate now as when Orwell first wrote them. In this time (2001), we have our &quot;Two Minutes Hate&quot; with Osama bin Laden. Newspeak, the language created by the ruling party in 1984, is amazingly detailed and seems feasible in light of our dyslexic Bushisms.It is based on the English language, and its vocabulary grows smaller instead of larger every year. An appendix, included in the book, enumerates some of the terminology and syntax of the language, and explains how the language is designed to control the thoughts of those who utilize it. To bad it can't be updated with all the words our low IQ president has created.Many of the principles that Orwell writes about (e.g., thought control) are done in a quite blatant way in the book. In the real world of the 20th/21st century they're done, only much more subtly. That way, we don't know they being perpetrated on us. But with the Patriot Act, the boldness is destroying our Constitution.Here's how 1984 applies to current events:WAR IS PEACEThe new &quot;War on Terrorism&quot; is being sold as a guarantor or our safety. While this war is being waged, we're to accept permanent war as a fact of life. As the unavoidable slaughter of innocents unfolds overseas, we are told to go back to &quot;living our lives.&quot;FREEDOM IS SLAVERY&quot;Freedom itself was attacked,&quot; Bush said. He's right, though here's the twist: Americans are losing many of their most cherished freedoms in a frenzy of paranoid legislation. The government wants to tap our phones, read our email and seize our credit card records without court order. Further, it wants authority to detain and deport immigrants without cause or trial. To save freedom, we have to destroy it.IGNORANCE IS STRENGTHAmerica's &quot;new war&quot; against terrorism will be fought with unprecedented secrecy, including press restrictions not seen for years, the Pentagon has advised.When you read this book, you'll be better able to see the signs around you. The world portrayed by Orwell is \`HERE AND NOW.\\"If you think it's all a conspiracy... then check out these books also: I just read a copy of Edgar Fouche's 'Alien Rapture,' which also blew me away. Fouche was a Top Secret Black Program \`insider', whose credibility has been verified over and over. Want to be shocked, check out Dr. Paul Hill's 'Unconventional Flying Objects' which NASA tried to ban, and always read the Amazon reviews."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Mr. Orwell's book is, rightfully, a must-read classic. The daily grind of existing in such an oppressive state piles onto the reader. There is not one iota of levity in this entire work. Mr. Orwell's book is not simply a condemnation of communism, but a trenchant example of the concentration of power and the willingness of those overseers to do whatever it takes to stay in control. Democracy is not immune to this sort of heavy-handedness. The people in power attempt to subjugate the populace by controlling or falsifying information and using torture or at least the threat of force for political purposes. This is also about stripping individuals of their humanity. Mr. Orwell's book is a cautionary tale about the dark side of the human condition. A wonderful learning tool."},{"Title":"1984","review":"1984 by George Orwell deals with a future society where the government (known as the Party) controls people with doublethink, the ability to accept anything \\"Big Brother\\" tells them is true. The Party has changed history to suit them well, saying that they are out to help people, even though they really are just taking over people. In this negative Utopia, humans are arrested by the Thought Police for thoughtcrime, or in other words turning against the Party and Big Brother. There are little telescreens in each room that spy on the civilians, making sure they are not committing thoughtcrimes. Young children are raised to be Thought Policemen and are trained to arrest anyone, even their own parents. People accused of thougtcrimes may be subject to cruel and unusual punishment. Thus, in this novel Orwell makes the point that humans will give up freedom in order to avoid pain, that our own nervous system and our comfort is more important to us than our freedom.The main characters in 1984 are Winston and Julia, both of whom rebel against the Party. 1984 follows Winston who believes that he is the only person who constantly commits thoughtcrime. His neighbors, the Parsons, have two children who are part of the Thought Police. Winston is constantly reminded that Big Brother is always watching him and that he lives in a totalitarian state. He believes that he can rebel without being caught. A dark-haired girl is mentioned in the story. Winston finds that she also rebelling against the government. They fall in love and vow to be at each other's side and fight the evil Party. Although Julia is rebelling against the Party, unlike Winston she is not concerned with future generations, Julia only concerned about her and Winston.I liked George Orwell's warning that the government and popular media can take over us and can give us false messages that corrupt our minds. It seems a fair warning but it also seems to be discredited with the fact that it is now over twenty years past 1984, and Orwell's ideas seem a little outdated. This is not to say that we could never be taken over by the government, but it seems a little strange reading about a future that has allegedly happened in the past. I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in George Orwell's ideals."},{"Title":"1984","review":"This book if my favorite of the classics. It's another that is ahead of it's time in terms of the relation of today. \\"Big brother is watching you\\" has become more and more true to the US. Knowing that this book has been banned in many countries due to it's politcal points and \\"references\\" makes it even more appealing. Winston, (the main character), lives in a totalitarian society and basically comes to realise that He wants to change his way of life and wants to be able to control his own destiny. By doing so he risks all that he is just to live a \\"normal\\" life. Without saying too much, please read this book."},{"Title":"1984","review":"I enjoyed this book back in 1984 when I 'HAD' to read it for a class project. I enjoyed the book then more as a work of science fiction. I just got a kindle and decided to re-read some older books that I had not purchased due to limited shelf space.Now that I read this book, I am struck by the warnings of what can come out of too much control in the hands of the few. One passage that really had me floored was...\\"...in the general hardening of outlook that set in about ...practices that had been long abandoned... imprisonment without trial...the use of torture to extract confessions... not only became common again, but were tolerated and even defended by people who considered themselves enlighted and progressive.\\"This written almost 60 years ago!

It shows the reader the consequences of having an authorative government going to the extremes in controlling the thoughts and actions of its citizens. 1984 also brings up in interesting idea about the reasons for wars. According to Orwell, wars are fought not to gain territory but to get rid of the excess of material and wealth the citizens create. Another way to look at the book is to take our contempary setting of today and see what would happen if people didnt stand up for their rights and beliefs and laid all their trusts and fears upon their government."},{"Title":"1984","review":"As hard as it is to say what the single best of most anything is, George Orwell's 1984 comes as close to that title as any I can think of. The vision he presents is so engrossing that one is left haunted. He gives the world he envisions such texture and reality that it almost becomes real. There is a reason this book is referred to so often: it represents many of our worst possible fears. The complete control over every facet of existence wielded by Big Brother over Winston and the rest of the polity is so frightening that the images conjured by this book are used even in contemporary politics."},{"Title":"1984","review":"George Orwell's, \\"1984\\", is a classic and detailed adventure that will leave you asking for more. The story is set in London where Winston, the main character, works for big brother.

But when Winston starts to remember his childhood, he begins to question Big Brother. Winston soon finds himself wondering what life was like before big brother. But unless he takes a real chance, he has no way of changing anything.One flaw I found with the book was its detail. I like a lot of detail, but this book overdid it. I would soon found myself thinking about other things and not the book."},{"Title":"1984","review":"George Orwell's depressing look into the future is more possible today than it has ever been. Winston Smith, the book's main character, is continually watched by Big Brother, the face of the government he despises. War is continuous, love is outlawed, and Big Brother is religion.Winston Smith, a worker for the Ministry of Truth (or Minitruth in newspeak), goes to work everyday and falsifies records to make it look like Big Brother is always right. There are other ministries with names that contradict what they do. The Ministry of Peace (Minipax) deals with war. The Ministry of Love (Miniluv) deals with hate. Citizens are brainwashed not to notice what is going on. If they do, the government of Oceania wipes them out. Cameras are everywhere, microphones are everywhere, and spies are everywhere. George Orwell tells his tale in a way that makes it seem real, and in a while it very well may be.1984 not only gives an insight on what the government could be like, but the book is full of deceptive and interesting characters. Winston acts like Big Brother is god, but he really loathes him. Julia wears a belt that symbolizes chastity, but she sleeps with members of the Party. O'Brien is a member of the elite Inner Party, the group that controls Oceania, but he acts as though he is in cahoots with Goldstein, the enemy of Oceania. There are also plot twists and symbols in this book that make it even more interesting. This book is a must-read for anyone that cares about the future."},{"Title":"1984","review":"This is an inexpensive classic and a great read.

The people behind the curtains- the banking families in particular make the people in high positions subject to their own mercy.If you do some research you will find that high tech criminals count the USA's votes, and that as long as we retain a \\"democracy\\" where one man is on top and a select group of people are pulling his strings, anything you see on the news will follow the same model- governments within governments, and intercompetition between them. The philosophies of 1984 are more relevant now than never. Objective reality is governed by the media, and indifference is bred in people's minds to suit the avoidance of a possible utopia where every man is equal. \\"War is Peace\\" \\"Ignorance is Strength\\"Read this book or you may never know how powerful you/they are."},{"Title":"1984","review":"This book relates the experiences of one Winston Smith in a world where all people belong to one of three totalitarian superpowers. In this dystopian novel, the state requires nothing less than the complete submission of individuals' inner thoughts. \\"The Party is not interested in the overt act: the thought is all we care about.\\" There is no escape (\\"Nobody ever escaped detection, and nobody ever failed to confess.\\") and no practical hope for a free future where human rights would exist once more.The story is beautiful in parts--such as in the places where it deals with a forbidden love and an individual's struggle to maintain his identity--and incredibly hopeless in others. Orwell is an amazing writer and I spent a lot of time underlining different phrases and sentences. This book is frightening. As Erich Fromm writes in the afterword, \\"...it would be most unfortunate if the reader smugly interpreted 1984 as another description of Stalinist barbarism, and if he does not see that it means us, too.\\" I recommend this book to all."},{"Title":"1984","review":"My coworker was telling me about the movie, and the book.

The term he coined is \\"double-speak\\" whereby words are combined to express simpler thoughts, an effective method to wipe out entire concepts that could before be expressed in their full beauty.It ends with the electro-shock treatment of our \\"hero\\" who is inextricably trapped in the web of the government-machine. Not very uplifting but very thought-provoking."},{"Title":"1984","review":"A timelees classic. One of those books you keep forever on your bookshelf and take down every couple of years to read again, with just as much enthusiasm as the first time you read it. It shows that no matter how dark things get, there is always that spark of human endurance which finds some light, even if only for a limited time."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Imagine... a world completely controlled by government. Nothing is kept private, and emotions are almost nonexistent. If you are considered different, you are killed. Sadly, Earth will soon come to this unavoidable fate, and George Orwell predicted this in 1949. Written from the perspective of a middle aged man who lives in the near future, \\"1984\\" by George Orwell is a compelling novel that describes what will become of the world. The story takes place in what is assumed to be future America, and the story is told by a character named Winston Smith. Smith works in a modern office building, and has a quiet life that he lives by himself. But one trait of Winston does make him unique from his peers. He secretly despises \\"Big Brother\\", the government figure that controls the world he knows. He dare not say anything of his feelings towards this subject, for if he shows any emotion, the Thought Police will erase his existence forever, making it seem like Winston Smith never existed. Yes, Smith is the type of man to never show what he is thinking, and the only emotion he displays is his fabricated love for \\"Big Brother\\", who is always watching. All of this changes as soon as Winston finds out a young girl named Julia is in love with him. Their love for each other is so dangerous and unheard of, that it fuels their hate for the government even more. The themes of this book are rebellion, sacrifice, and honestly, and I recommend \\"1984\\" for anyone looking for a good read. I believe it should be required in school curriculum, for it contains realistic, yet nightmarish visions of America's possible future. On a scale of 1-10, I would rate Orwell's work at a 8."},{"Title":"1984","review":"This book is a must-read classic. It is kind of scary to think that Orwell wrote this in the 1940s. It's a must-read for anyone, not just sci-fi lovers!"},{"Title":"1984","review":"Just imagine a world in which the government controlled EVERY aspect of our lives. In George Orwell's 1984, the government does that and more. Not only are activities and living conditions controlled, but people's thoughts and even reality itself is under the control of the governmental party. The characters in this novel are very well created; from the mysterious and overwhelming Big Brother, to the main character - Winston - who is a simple office worker with a very complicated job. There is even a steamy romance thrown in there! This spooky tale of a negative utopia will have you deep in philosophical thought, as well as on the edge of your seat from suspense. I highly recommend it, definitely worth the purchase."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Something like that could never happen in my country I'm happy in communist China"},{"Title":"1984","review":"I say the book is unrealistic, but that's not what I mean. It's not that his characters couldn't exist. It's more a problem of verisimilitude -- that is, he states the problem, and THEN HE DEVIATES FROM IT! The populace in 1984 -- they're supposed to be much like his &quot;modern people&quot; of '48. But it's just too darn blatant to make it seem real. And why is good ol' &quot;common man&quot; Winston disbelieving? It's thoroughly improbable. I realize he was talking about communism, but communism was a great deal subtler than that. It's nowhere near the realistic depictions of the future by science-fiction writers, but because the science-fiction writers weren't respected, and Orwell was a Prominent Social Critic, look what we're stuck with -- the paranoid fevered dream of a madman masquerading as a prophet."},{"Title":"1984","review":"I did not really enjoy this book, it was way to far feched. I give it a three because George Orwell has a great emajination&lt;(spell?).This is a good book if you want to read about a guy and his mission for un protected sex.That is all, I guess it just wasnt my cup o' tea."},{"Title":"1984","review":"1984,by Georgee Orwell,is not fun to eat although cheese is. The book itself is uninterestring and the text is plain like water. Some parts of the book are ok but the rest is lame. The things it talks about can be related to the events that are going on today and events that have happened. It shows how totalitarianism works and how it feels to always be watched. So in some sense it is educational but I would certainly not choose this book to read if i wasn't forced like in this situation. All of my friends that read this book said the same thing, \\"Boring!\\" Students that are into more action and adventure will not enjoy this book."},{"Title":"1984","review":"This book's reputation as a classic reveals less about the book than it does about the shallowness and mediocrity of many book critics. It is crude, heavy-handed, superficial propaganda."},{"Title":"1984","review":"At first I did like the book. Then it just started to suck right around the time when Winston was getting sexually involved with his girl friend. I hated the book so much that I forgot her name. The first hundred or so pages i liked, then it just got really boring. So II highly reccomend that you DO NOT READ THIS BOOK. And please for the love of God don't read that &quot;Brave New World&quot; book by Hoxley. It is twice as worse as 1984. To put it bluntly, DON'T READ ANY GEORGE ORWELL. Your just waisting your time."},{"Title":"1984","review":"Unlike Mr Orwell apparently, I can actually remember 1984 and believe you me some of his recollections of the era are well off the mark. There were no such things as Memory Holes, was no such country as Eurasia and Big Brother did not hit our screens until 1999. I also find it staggering that there was no mention of Rubiks Cubes or the film Spies Like Us. On the other hand I did approve of some of the stricter measures bought in to promote sensible behaviour in the office which were advocated in this book."},{"Title":"1984","review":"This book had a good warning about futur totalitarian government but it was way too wordy. I had too much description and was really boring at the beginging that it took me a while to get through it.
