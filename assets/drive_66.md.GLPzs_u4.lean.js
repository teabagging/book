Full facsimile of the original edition, not reproduced with Optical Recognition Software. In this text, Worringer identifies two opposing tendencies pervading the history of art from ancient times through the Enlightenment. He claims that in societies experiencing periods of anxiety and intense spirituality, such as those of ancient Egypt and the Middle Ages, artistic production tends toward a flat, crystalline \\"abstraction,\\" while cultures that are oriented toward science and the physical world, like ancient Greece and Renaissance Italy, are dominated by more naturalistic, embodied styles, which he grouped under the term \\"empathy.\\" As was traditional for art history at the time, Worringer's book remained firmly engaged with the past, ignoring contemporaneous artistic production. Yet in the wake of its publication-just one year after Pablo Picasso painted his masterpiece \\"Les Demoiselles d'Avignon\\"-\\"Abstraction and Empathy\\" came to be seen as fundamental for understanding the rise of Expressionism and the role of abstraction in the early twentieth century.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=IpScoAEACAAJ&dq=Abstraction+and+empathy%3B:+A+contribution+to+the+psychology+of+style&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Covenants","description":"This fresh assessment of covenant theology may represent the first book-length examination of the structural relationships of the Old Testament covenants. Tremper Longman, a professor of Old Testament at Westminster Theological Seminary, describes The Covenants of Promise as  a marvelously written and profound book which deals with some of the most crucial issues in biblical theology.   The significance of The Covenants of Promise,  writes the author,  is in its application of the structure of the covenants to biblical theology. . . . The division of the Old Testament covenants into the categories  promissory  and  administrative  is unique in the literature on the covenants.  This complex  bi-covenantal  structure within which God disposes of the inheritance promised to his people becomes discernible in the biblical text through a sound application of proper exegetical theology. The textual evidence leads one to question the way some tenets of traditional covenant theology have been expressed, but not the tenets themselves. The author first explores the promise in its Old and New Testament settings. He deals with the way in which the promise is expressed in the major covenants, devoting considerable space to the law in the teachings of Jesus and Paul. Next he argues that the promise covenant is eternally valid and that circumcision, the law, and the new covenant are  administrative covenants.  Finally he examines the implications of this structure for biblical theology. Selected topics are the redemptive relationship between Father and Son, the covenant of works, law and grace, and the relationship between the testaments.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=zu29DwAAQBAJ&dq=The+Covenants&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Children With Cerebral Palsy: A Parents Guide","description":"Provides information for parents who want to learn about cerebral palsy and how it affects their child and family, and covers subjects parents of cp children need to know about during the first five years of life","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=KYOBQgAACAAJ&dq=Children+With+Cerebral+Palsy:+A+Parents+Guide&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Witness to Injustice","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=bFLkSAAACAAJ&dq=Witness+to+Injustice&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution","description":"The definitive international history of one of the world's most successful rally cars.

Inexpensive, yet sturdily constructed to provide years of pleasurable use, this full score combines all the musical parts in a clear, readable format, with wide margins and large noteheads. Brahms conducted the first major performance of the \\"German Requiem\\" in Bremen Cathedral in April 1888. The occasion, attended by many distinguished musicians, among them Clara Schumann, provided the 34-year-old composer with his first great public success. Scored for mixed chorus, solo voices, and full orchestra, the \\"Requiem\\" reflects Brahms's virtuoso grasp of nineteenth-century vocal technique as well as the polyphonic vocal traditions of the previous three centuries. Above all, it radiates Brahms's stalwart individuality, technical mastery, and stirring emotional appeal, which were soon to secure his unique position in the musical world. The \\"German Requiem\\" is in seven sections (the fifth was added shortly after the Bremen performance), which distinguishes it from the five-part Roman Catholic requiem. Brahms chose its nondenominational format to express faith in the resurrection rather than the fear of the day judgment. Now, over a century later, this masterpiece of choral music is one of the most performed and recorded works in the repertoire of religious music.\\"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=8oKyoGdS3vwC&dq=German+Requiem+in+Full+Score&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Stone Mage and the Sea (Book of the change)","description":"The Stone Mages rule the huge deserts of red sand.

Delving far deeper than previous sociologists have into the black Brazilian experience, Elizabeth Hordge-Freeman examines the relationship between racialization and the emotional life of a family. Based on interviews and a sixteen-month ethnography of ten working-class Brazilian families, this provocative work sheds light on how families simultaneously resist and reproduce racial hierarchies. Examining race and gender, Hordge-Freeman illustrates the privileges of whiteness by revealing how those with  blacker  features often experience material and emotional hardships. From parental ties, to sibling interactions, to extended family and romantic relationships, the chapters chart new territory by revealing the connection between proximity to whiteness and the distribution of affection within families. Hordge-Freeman also explores how black Brazilian families, particularly mothers, rely on diverse strategies that reproduce, negotiate, and resist racism. She frames efforts to modify racial features as sometimes reflecting internalized racism, and at other times as responding to material and emotional considerations. Contextualizing their strategies within broader narratives of the African diaspora, she examines how Salvador s inhabitants perceive the history of the slave trade itself in a city that is referred to as the  blackest  in Brazil. She argues that racial hierarchies may orchestrate family relationships in ways that reflect and reproduce racial inequality, but black Brazilian families actively negotiate these hierarchies to assert their citizenship and humanity.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=kBFmCgAAQBAJ&dq=A+Color+of+Love&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Congressional government;: A study in American politics;","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=cmUqAQAAIAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"King of the Romans","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=xfiHDAEACAAJ&dq=King+of+the+Romans&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Organized Serenity: A Practical Guide for Getting It Together","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=xaCDzQEACAAJ&dq=Organized+Serenity:+A+Practical+Guide+for+Getting+It+Together&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Home Business Big Business: The Definitive Guide to Starting and Operating On-Line and Traditional Home-Based Ventures","description":"Offers advice on starting, operating, and expanding a small business","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=j6FZAAAAYAAJ&dq=Home+Business+Big+Business:+The+Definitive+Guide+to+Starting+and+Operating+On-Line+and+Traditional+Home-Based+Ventures&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"God Only Knows","description":"Author Kennedy Oliver and her husband, Austin, were two high school teachers from a small town just trying to work hard and raise their daughters to be good people.

A young German paleontologist, accompanied only by a guide, a cook, four camels, and a couple of camel drivers, reaches the lip of the vast Bahariya Depression after a long trek across the bleak plateau of the western desert of Egypt. The scientist, Ernst Freiherr Stromer von Reichenbach, hopes to find fossil evidence of early mammals. In this, he will be disappointed, for the rocks here will prove to be much older than he thinks. They are nearly a hundred million years old. Stromer is about to learn that he has walked into the age of the dinosaurs. At the bottom of the Bahariya Depression, Stromer will find the remains of four immense and entirely new dinosaurs, along with dozens of other unique specimens. But there will be reversals shipments delayed for years by war, fossils shattered in transit, stunning personal and professional setbacks. Then, in a single cataclysmic night, all of his work will be destroyed and Ernst Stromer will slip into history and be forgotten. The date is January 11, 2000 eighty-nine years to the day after Stromer descended into Bahariya. Another young paleontologist, Ameri-can graduate student Josh Smith, has brought a team of fellow scientists to Egypt to find Stromer s dinosaur graveyard and resurrect the German pioneer s legacy. After weeks of digging, often under appalling conditions, they fail utterly at rediscovering any of Stromer s dinosaur species. Then, just when they are about to declare defeat, Smith s team discovers a dinosaur of such staggering immensity that it will stun the world of paleontology and make headlines around the globe. Masterfully weaving together history, science, and human drama, The Lost Dinosaurs of Egypt is the gripping account of not one but two of the twentieth century s great expeditions of discovery.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Axu-z-FXyboC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Street Smart (Wildc.A.Ts)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=5CNLAQAAIAAJ&dq=Street+Smart+(Wildc.A.Ts)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"There is an Easier Way","description":"This book is a \\"How to\\" on church planting.

Aspirin, the world's most widely used drug, is based on compounds originally extracted from the bark of a willow tree, and more than a quarter of medicines found on pharmacy shelves contain plant compounds. Now Western medicine, faced with health crises such as AIDS, Alzheimer's disease, and cancer, has begun to look to the healing plants used by indigenous peoples to develop powerful new medicines. Nowhere is the search more promising than in the Amazon, the world's largest tropical forest, home to a quarter of all botanical species on this planet as well as hundreds of Indian tribes whose medicinal plants have never been studied by Western scientists. In Tales of a Shaman's Apprentice, ethnobotanist Mark J. Plotkin recounts his travels and studies with some of the most powerful Amazonian shamans, who taught him the plant lore their tribes have spent thousands of years gleaning from the rain forest. For more than a decade, Dr. Plotkin raced against time to harvest and record new plants before the rain forests' fragile ecosystems succumb to overdevelopment and before the Indians abandon their own culture and learning for the seductive appeal of Western material culture.

Dollar is out of college but aimless, when he takes a job with Global Pork Rind -- his task to locate big spreads of land in the Texas and Oklahoma panahandles that can be purchased by the corporation and converted to hog farms. Dollar finds himself in a Texas town called Woolybucket, whose idiosyncratic inhabitants have ridden out all manner of seismic shifts in panhandle country. These are tough men and women who witnessed first hand tornadoes, dust storms, and the demise of the great cattle ranches. Now it's feed lots, hog farms, and ever-expanding drylands. Dollar settles into LaVon Fronk's old bunkhouse for fifty dollars a month, helps out at Cy Frease's Old Dog Caf , targets Ace and Tater Crouch's ranch for Global Pork, and learns the hard way how vigorously the old owners will hold on to their land, even though their children want no part of it.

Settled in a corner of France and Spain in a land marked on no maps except their own, the Basques are a nation without a country, whose ancient and dramatic story illuminates Europe's own saga. Where did they come from? Signs of their civilization exist well before the arrival of the Romans in 218 B.C., and their culture appears to predate all others in Europe. Their mysterious and forbidden tongue, Euskera, is related to no other language on Earth. The Basques have stubbornly defended their unique culture against the Celts, the Romans, the Visigoths and Moors, the kings of Spain and France, Napoleon, Franco, the modern Spanish state, and the European Union. Yet as much as their origins are obscure, the Basques' contributions to world history have been clear and remarkable. Early explorers, they made fortunes whaling before the year 1000 and became the premier cod fishermen in Europe after discovering Canada's Grand Banks. Juan Sebastian de Elcano, a Basque, was the first man to circumnavigate the globe in 1522. Their influence has also been felt in religion as founders of the Jesuits in 1534, and in business, as leaders of the Industrial Revolution in southern Europe. Mark Kurlanky's passion for the Basque people, and his exuberant eye for detail, shine throughout this fascinating history. Like his acclaimed Cod, it blends human, economic, political, literary and culinary history into a rich and heroic tale.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=oQpfod-EQDsC&dq=The+Basque+History+of+the+World&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Made in America: From Levi's to Barbie to Google","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=4MgVYAAACAAJ&dq=Made+in+America:+From+Levi%27s+to+Barbie+to+Google&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Fierce Conversations: Achieving Success at Work & in Life, One Conversation at a Time","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Restoring the Balance: Women Physicians and the Profession of Medicine, 1850-1995","description":"From about 1850, American women physicians won gradual acceptance from male colleagues and the general public, primarily as caregivers to women and children. By 1920, they represented approximately five percent of the profession. But within a decade, their niche in American medicine--women's medical schools and medical societies, dispensaries for women and children, women's hospitals, and settlement house clinics--had declined. The steady increase of women entering medical schools also halted, a trend not reversed until the 1960s. Yet, as women's traditional niche in the profession disappeared, a vanguard of women doctors slowly opened new paths to professional advancement and public health advocacy. Drawing on rich archival sources and her own extensive interviews with women physicians, Ellen More shows how the Victorian ideal of balance influenced the practice of healing for women doctors in America over the past 150 years. She argues that the history of women practitioners throughout the twentieth century fulfills the expectations constructed within the Victorian culture of professionalism. Restoring the Balance demonstrates that women doctors--collectively and individually--sought to balance the distinctive interests and culture of women against the claims of disinterestedness, scientific objectivity, and specialization of modern medical professionalism. That goal, More writes, reaffirmed by each generation, lies at the heart of her central question: what does it mean to be a woman physician?","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=K2m-u8wFLfMC&dq=Restoring+the+Balance:+Women+Physicians+and+the+Profession+of+Medicine,+1850-1995&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Wednesday Workout: Practical Techniques for Rehearsing the Church Choir","description":"\\"By the Way- You Start Tomorrow Night\\".

Schnell, even valuable as a way to develop his faith in God and pass it on to others.

This definitive study takes readers into the cockpits and onto the flight decks of the versatile and hardy U.S. escort carriers (CVEs) to tell of their vital, yet little-known contribution to the anti-U-boat campaign. Sailing apart from the Allied convoys, the CVE captains had complete freedom of action and frequently took their ships on \\"hunt and kill\\" missions against the enemy. The German submarines were allowed no respite and no place to relax without the fear of discovery. World War II historian William Y'Blood explains that in the eighteen months between the spring of 1943, when the escort carriers began to prowl the Atlantic, to November 1944, the average number of U-boats in daily operation was reduced from 108 to a mere 31. Though land-based aircraft, various support groups, and the convoy system itself helped win the Battle of the Atlantic, the escort carrier groups' influence was profound. In addition to documenting the escort carriers' exciting operational history, the author also traces the CVE's development and construction and examines its tactical and strategic uses.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=H6f6VLTgSSAC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Thundercats: The Return","description":"Beginning where the cult-favorite animated television series from the 1980s ended, THUNDERCATS: RECALAMING THUNDERA is a nostalgic and action-packed adventure of duty and heroism.

There was no real understanding of the germ theory of disease. But Medicines for the Union Army: The United States Army Laboratories During the Civil War shows that in the evolution of the army's Medical Department from incompetence to general efficiency during this time, and in the vastly improved organization and supply system designed by William A. Hammond, Jonathan Letterman, the medical purveyors, and others working under the Surgeon General, there was evidence of a great achievement. In Medicines for the Union Army you will come to understand the medical purveying system of the time and its problems, and you will witness the birth, growth, and remarkable achievements of the Federal government's pharmaceutical laboratories at Astoria, New York, and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Medicines for the Union Army will inform and enlighten you about the these laboratories, including: the funding and transportation obstacles faced at the Astoria lab the processes by which raw materials became drugs ready for distribution drug testing and inspection methods the bottling of  medicinal whiskey  and wine at the labs the people whose work laid the foundation for modern drug production and distribution methods the contents of the medical supply cases (panniers) and wagons in use at the time . . . and much more!

This book presents a fresh perspective not only on how to counsel, but also on what measures to take at what stages of counseling.  Jay Adams, from the prefaceChange is the essential goal of the counseling process. And, in the author s words,  substantial change requires the alteration of the heart.  How can a Christian counselor facilitate such change? The answer, of course, may be found in Scripture, specifically in 2 Timothy 3:1417.Jay Adams is a well-known counselor who bases his whole approach on Scripture. This book provides an unparalleled opportunity to see how he discovers and applies biblical principles as well as the way in which Scripture functions as the basis for his counseling approach. This book answers two questions:  How does a counselor help people change?  and,  How does Scripture provide the source of a counselor s method? How to Help People Change has much to say about the ongoing discussion of the relationship between theology and psychology in the enterprise of Christian counseling.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=zcQ5MlcgVC4C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Allrecipes Cookbook","description":"Over 400 best-loved and highest-rated recipes from the Allrecipies.com website.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=WjBlPQAACAAJ&dq=Allrecipes+Cookbook&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Angela of Foligno : Complete Works (Classics of Western Spirituality)","description":"Angela of Foligno (c. 1248-1309) is one of the most outstanding representatives of the Franciscan and Christian mystical tradition.

What gets out of order in social and economic mechanisms? Since the seminal works published by Kondratieff, a number of outstanding researchers have made significant contributions to our understanding of the possible factors affecting and provoking long-term fluctuations of human economic affairs. On the other hand, it has become more and more clear that K-waves influence many social-related processes. However, nobody appears to have found yet an entirely satisfactory solution of  Kondratieff's mystery , and it continues to attract researchers. That is why we have decided to try to unite the forces of such researchers around the new almanac.

Before the more famous Renaissance European reception of the ancient Greek Hermetica, the Arabic tradition about Hermes and the works under his name had been developing and flourishing for seven hundred years. The legendary Egyptian Hermes Trismegistus was renowned in Roman antiquity as an ancient sage whose teachings were represented in books of philosophy and occult science. The works in his name, written in Greek by Egyptians living under Roman rule, subsequently circulated in many languages and regions of the Roman and Sasanian Persian empires. After the rise of Arabic as a prestigious language of scholarship in the eighth century, accounts of Hermes identity and Hermetic texts were translated into Arabic along with the hundreds of other works translated from Greek, Middle Persian, and other literary languages of antiquity. Hermetica were in fact among the earliest translations into Arabic, appearing already in the eighth century. This book explains the origins of the Arabic myth of Hermes Trismegistus, its sources, the reasons for its peculiar character, and its varied significance for the traditions of Hermetica in Asia and northern Africa as well as Europe. It shows who pre-modern Arabic scholars thought Hermes was and how they came to that view.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=nSqAWPZrkn8C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Draw 50 Horses: The Step-by-Step Way to Draw Broncos, Arabians, Thoroughbreds, Dancers, Prancers, and Many More...","description":"Step-by-step instructions for drawing different breeds of horses in a variety of poses.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=tsRr9Io6cPcC&dq=Draw+50+Horses:+The+Step-by-Step+Way+to+Draw+Broncos,+Arabians,+Thoroughbreds,+Dancers,+Prancers,+and+Many+More...&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ritual of Pennsylvania Ancient York Masonry","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=6ZRjAQAACAAJ&dq=Ritual+of+Pennsylvania+Ancient+York+Masonry&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"For The Good Of The Cause","description":"Filled with tips and survival skills from writers and fund-raising officers at nonprofits of all sizes, Writing for a Good Cause is the first book to explain how to use words well to win your cause the money it needs.

Now they are extinct. This book tells their story. The book describes how these intrepid nomads confronted a hostile climate every bit as forbidding as ice-age Europe as they penetrated and settled the wilds of Fuego-Patagonia. Much later, sixteenth-century European voyagers encountered their descendants: the A nikenk (southern Tehuelche), Selk'nam (Ona), Y mana (Yahgan), and Kawashekar (Alacaluf), living, as the Europeans saw it, in a state of savagery. The first contacts led to tales of a race of giants and, ever since, Patagonia has exerted a special hold on the European imagination. Tragically, by the mid-twentieth century, the last remnants of the indigenous way of life had disappeared for ever. The essays in this volume trace a largely unwritten history of human adaptation, survival, and eventual extinction. Accompanied by 110 striking photographs, they are published to accompany a major exhibition on Fuego-Patagonia at the Museum of Mankind, London. The contributors are Gillian Beer, Luis Alberto Borrero, Anne Chapman, Chalmers M. Clapperton, Andrew P. Currant, Jean-Paul Duviols, Mateo Martinic B., Robert D.

A physicist by profession, Whyte looked beyond the boundaries of specialization for creative ways to approach the basic problem facing modern Western civilization: Why are we so competent technically and yet unable to order our own affairs, socially and personally? He takes the reader with him on a journey that is nothing less than a new interpretation of the general development of human consciousness.Whyte's thesis is that the current stage of human development makes not only necessary, but inevitable, constructing a \\"\\"unitary method of thought\\"\\" to overcome the dualism of the modern Western mind. He argues that the deepest troubles of Western civilization are due, in large part, to excessive reliance on the ancient Greek postulates of permanence and invariance as an ordered form of thought resulting in an extreme, mechanistic anti-humanism. What culminated in two world wars, Whyte argued, is a European dissociation, or \\"\\"lesion.\\"\\" This dissociation represents an achievement in terms of rational mastery of the natural and human worlds, unique social dynamism and differentiation, and the flowering of individuality. But the price was high: disordering of thought, emotion, and will; conflict between our deliberate and spontaneous, conscious, and unconscious energies; unstable polarization between a delusive unchanging ideal world and the reality of human transience and limitation. Whyte chooses nine thinkers to illustrate this historical and evolutionary movement, including Heraclitus, Marx, and Freud, and the resulting rignettes are a synthesis of knowledge that suggest, as well, a reorientation of thought, feeling, and action for the future.Lewis Mumford wrote of The Next Development of Mankind, \\"\\"The book has intense and immediate value both for the practical person and for the theoretic thinker.\\"\\" Sixty years a","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=imVQDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Time Out South of France 2","description":"Time Out's resident team helps you get the best from the fascinating French capital in this annual guide.

But how do we practice it? How does humility--the foundational virtue of the normal Christian life--become a normal part of our everyday lives? Jerry Bridges sees in the Beatitudes a series of blessings from Jesus, a pattern for humility in action. Starting with poverty in spirit--an acknowledgment that in and of ourselves we are incapable of living holy lives pleasing to God--and proceeding through our mourning over personal sin, our hunger and thirst for righteousness, our experience of persecutions large and small, and more, we discover that humility is itself a blessing: At every turn, God is present to us, giving grace to the humble and lifting us up to blessing.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=7W4eDAAAQBAJ&dq=Walking+In+Humility&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Gilgamesh","description":"The ancient Sumerian poem The Epic of Gilgamesh is one of the oldest written stories in existence, translated with an introduction by Andrew George in Penguin Classics. Miraculously preserved on clay tablets dating back as much as four thousand years, the poem of Gilgamesh, king of Uruk, is the world's oldest epic, predating Homer by many centuries. The story tells of Gilgamesh's adventures with the wild man Enkidu, and of his arduous journey to the ends of the earth in quest of the Babylonian Noah and the secret of immortality. Alongside its themes of family, friendship and the duties of kings, The Epic of Gilgamesh is, above all, about mankind's eternal struggle with the fear of death. The Babylonian version has been known for over a century, but linguists are still deciphering new fragments in Akkadian and Sumerian. Andrew George's gripping translation brilliantly combines these into a fluid narrative and will long rank as the definitive English Gilgamesh. If you enjoyed The Epic of Gilgamesh, you might like Homer's Iliad, also available in Penguin Classics.

A History of Hispanic Theatre in the United States: Origins to 1940 is the very first study of this rich tradition, filled with details about plays, authors, artists, companies, houses, directors, and theatrical circuits. Sixteen years of research in public and private archives in the United States, Mexico, Spain, and Puerto Rico inform this study. In addition, Kanellos located former performers and playwrights, forgotten scripts, and old photographs to bring the life and vitality of live theatre to his text. He organizes the book around the cities where Hispanic theatre was particularly active, including Los Angeles, San Antonio, New York, and Tampa, as well as cities on the touring circuit, such as Laredo, El Paso, Tucson, and San Francisco. Kanellos charts the major achievements of Hispanic theatre in each city playwriting in Los Angeles, vaudeville and tent theatre in San Antonio, Cuban/Spanish theatre in Tampa, and pan-Hispanism in New York as well as the individual careers of several actors, writers, and directors. And he uncovers many gaps in the record reminders that despite its popularity, Hispanic theatre was often undervalued and unrecorded.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=gRXlAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Production and Operations Management: Manufacturing and Services (The Irwin/McGraw Hill series)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=s8cmAQAAMAAJ&dq=Production+and+Operations+Management:+Manufacturing+and+Services+(The+Irwin/McGraw+Hill+series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"On the art of writing,","description":"Rediscover the lost art of excellent writing a valuable skill through the ages, and even more so in the twenty-first century. Since the invention of writing, the written word has fueled humanity s astonishing progress. Thus, the ability to write effectively and beautifully has long been revered and rewarded. And yet in the digital age, people have begun to believe that this talent is somehow obsolete: that writing is something unworthy of study beyond the basic mechanics of vocabulary and syntax and grammar, that mediocre prose is acceptable in a world crying out for clear and precise communication. Peter Yang believes otherwise. The Art of Writing is Yang s highly practical treatise on the four key principles of dazzling, effective writing economy, transparency, variety, and harmony. Far from your garden-variety style guide, this book offers principles that apply to everyone, whether you re writing an inauguration speech, a novel, or a letter home to Mom. Great writing is a skill, and this book gives you the tools to make your words shimmer on the page (or the screen).

The night Donald Trump won the presidency, our author Joel Stein, Thurber Prize finalist and former staff writer for Time Magazine, instantly knew why. The main reason wasn't economic anxiety or racism. It was that he was anti-elitist. Hillary Clinton represented Wall Street, academics, policy papers, Davos, international treaties and the people who think they're better than you. People like Joel Stein. Trump represented something far more appealing, which was beating up people like Joel Stein. In a full-throated defense of academia, the mainstream press, medium-rare steak, and civility, Joel Stein fights against populism. He fears a new tribal elite is coming to replace him, one that will fend off expertise of all kinds and send the country hurtling backward to a time of wars, economic stagnation and the well-done steaks doused with ketchup that Trump eats. To find out how this shift happened and what can be done, Stein spends a week in Roberts County, Texas, which had the highest percentage of Trump voters in the country. He goes to the home of Trump-loving Dilbert cartoonist Scott Adams; meets people who create fake news; and finds the new elitist organizations merging both right and left to fight the populists.

Thirdly, the price of grain had risen to six shillings a saa, and famine threatened; fourthly, the Shehu and Shuwa sheiks were quarrelling again; and, fifthly, there was a very bad smallpox ju-ju abroad in the land (a secret society whose \\"secret\\" was to offer His Majesty's liege subjects the choice between being infected with smallpox, or paying heavy blackmail to the society). Lastly, there was acrimonious correspondence with the All-Wise Ones (of the Secretariat in \\"Aiki Square\\" at Zungeru), who, as usual, knew better than the man on the spot, and bade him do either the impossible or the disastrous. And across all the Harmattan was blowing hard, that terrible wind that carries the Saharan dust a hundred miles to sea, not so much as a sand-storm, but as a mist or fog of dust as fine as flour, filling the eyes, the lungs, the pores of the skin, the nose and throat; getting into the locks of rifles, the works of watches and cameras, defiling water, food and everything else; rendering life a burden and a curse. The fact, moreover, that thirty days' weary travel over burning desert, across oceans of loose wind-blown sand and prairies of burnt grass, through breast-high swamps, and across unbridged boatless rivers, lay between him and Kano, added nothing to his satisfaction. For, in spite of all, satisfaction there was, inasmuch as Kano was rail-head, and the beginning of the first stage of the journey Home. That but another month lay between him and \\"leave out of Africa,\\" kept George Lawrence on his feet. From that wonderful and romantic Red City, Kano, sister of Timbuktu, the train would take him, after a three days' dusty journey, to the rubbish-heap called Lagos, on the Bight of Benin of the wicked West African Coast. There he would embark on the good ship Appam, greet her commander, Captain Harrison, and sink into a deck chair with that glorious sigh of relief, known in its perfection only to those weary ones who turn their backs upon the Outposts and set their faces towards Home. Meantime, for George Lawrence--disappointment, worry, frustration, anxiety, heat, sand-flies, mosquitoes, dust, fatigue, fever, dysentery, malarial ulcers, and that great depression which comes of monotony indescribable, weariness unutterable, and loneliness unspeakable.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=XiKRCwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Best Gay Love Stories 2005","description":"Simon Sheppard, Jay Quinn, Lawrence Schimel and Jim Gladstone are just a few of the top writers who present new stories of gay love and longing in this passionate collection of romantic fiction.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=lhS4wAEACAAJ&dq=Best+Gay+Love+Stories+2005&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"This believing world: A simple account of the great religions of mankind","description":"Examines primitive religion; Celtic, Greek, Babylonian.

Ann Patchett, author of Commonwealth Lisa Ko s powerful debut, The Leavers, is the winner of the 2016 PEN/Bellwether Prize for Fiction, awarded by Barbara Kingsolver for a novel that addresses issues of social justice. One morning, Deming Guo s mother, Polly, an undocumented Chinese immigrant, goes to her job at a nail salon and never comes home. No one can find any trace of her. With his mother gone, eleven-year-old Deming is left mystified and bereft. Eventually adopted by a pair of well-meaning white professors, Deming is moved from the Bronx to a small town upstate and renamed Daniel Wilkinson. But far from all he s ever known, Daniel struggles to reconcile his adoptive parents  desire that he assimilate with his memories of his mother and the community he left behind. Told from the perspective of both Daniel as he grows into a directionless young man and Polly, Ko s novel gives us one of fiction s most singular mothers. Loving and selfish, determined and frightened, Polly is forced to make one heartwrenching choice after another. Set in New York and China, The Leavers is a vivid examination of borders and belonging. It s a moving story of how a boy comes into his own when everything he loves is taken away, and how a mother learns to live with the mistakes of the past.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=nG5YDwAAQBAJ&dq=Interpreter+of+Maladies+(Highbridge+Distribution)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Traffic accident simulation using interactive computer graphics","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=jYrj4YnAbFQC&dq=Traffic+accident+simulation+using+interactive+computer+graphics&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"LEGACY OF HIROSHIMA ITS PAST OUR FUTURE","description":"With the threat of nuclear annihilation looming over the human race, The Legacy of Hiroshima offers a message we cannot ignore.

The major part of this book is devoted to the necklace in the 19th and 20th centuries, as theses are the most acessible to the potential buyer and collector.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=NuB6QgAACAAJ&dq=The+Necklace:+From+Antiquity+to+the+Present&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mr. Greedy Goes Shopping","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=k9UjNAEACAAJ&dq=Mr.+Greedy+Goes+Shopping&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Christina Katerina & the box","description":"The day the refrigerator arrives in its large brown carton, Christina Katerina and her mother are both excited, but for very different reasons.

Building on the concepts, theories, and multi-disciplinary approaches raised in the first edition, this publication strives to address the changes that have taken place over the last 15 years with new material to complement and re-position the initial volume. Reaching across design disciplines, this highly illustrated anthology assembles essays from architects, landscape architects, urban designers, planners, historians, and artists to explore ways to physically and conceptually engage site. Thoughtful discourse and empirically grounded pieces combine to provide the language and theory to contextualize the meanings of site in the built environment. The increasingly complex hybridity of constructed environments today demands new tools for thinking about and working with site. Drawing contributions from outside and within the traditional design disciplines, this edition will trace important developments in site thinking with new essays on topics such as climate change, landscape as infrastructure, shifts from global to planetary urbanization debates, and the proliferation of participatory site transformation practices. Edited by two leading practitioners and academics, Site Matters juxtaposes timeless contributions from individuals including Elizabeth Meyer, Robert Beauregard, and Robin Dripps with original new writings from Peter Marcuse, Jane Wolff, Neil Brenner, and Thaisa Way, amongst others, to recontextualize and reignite the debate around site.

I wiped away a tear with which the north wind blowing over the quay had obscured my vision. A bright fire was leaping in the chimney of my study. Ice-crystals, shaped like fern-leaves, were sprouting over the windowpanes and concealed from me the Seine with its bridges and the Louvre of the Valois. I drew up my easy-chair to the hearth, and my table-volante, and took up so much of my place by the fire as Hamilcar deigned to allow me. Hamilcar was lying in front of the andirons, curled up on a cushion, with his nose between his paws. His think find fur rose and fell with his regular breathing. At my coming, he slowly slipped a glance of his agate eyes at me from between his half-opened lids, which he closed again almost at once, thinking to himself, \\"It is nothing; it is only my friend.\\" \\"Hamilcar,\\" I said to him, as I stretched my legs?\\"Hamilcar, somnolent Prince of the City of Books?thou guardian nocturnal! Like that Divine Cat who combated the impious in Heliopolis?in the night of the great combat?thou dost defend from vile nibblers those books which the old savant acquired at the cost of his slender savings and indefatigable zeal. Sleep, Hamilcar, softly as a sultana, in this library, that shelters thy military virtues; for verily in thy person are united the formidable aspect of a Tatar warrior and the slumbrous grace of a woman of the Orient. Sleep, thou heroic and voluptuous Hamilcar, while awaiting the moonlight hour in which the mice will come forth to dance before the Acta Sanctorum of the learned Bolandists!\\" The beginning of this discourse pleased Hamilcar, who accompanied it with a throat-sound like the song of a kettle on the fire. But as my voice waxed louder, Hamilcar notified me by lowering his ears and by wrinkling the striped skin of his brow that it was bad taste on my part so to declaim. \\"This old-book man,\\" evidently thought Hamilcar, \\"talks to no purpose at all while our housekeeper never utters a word which is not full of good sense, full of significance?containing either the announcement of a meal or the promise of a whipping. One knows what she says. But this old man puts together a lot of sounds signifying nothing.\\" So thought Hamilcar to himself. Leaving him to his reflections, I opened a book, which I began to read with interest; for it was a catalogue of manuscripts. I do not know any reading more easy, more fascinating, more delightful than that of a catalogue. The one which I was reading?edited in 1824 by Mr. Thompson, librarian to Sir Thomas Raleigh?sins, it is true, by excess of brevity, and does not offer that character of exactitude which the archivists of my own generation were the first to introduce into works upon diplomatics and paleography. It leaves a good deal to be desired and to be divined. This is perhaps why I find myself aware, while reading it, of a state of mind which in nature more imaginative than mine might be called reverie. I had allowed myself to drift away this gently upon the current of my thoughts, when my housekeeper announced, in a tone of ill-humor, that Monsieur Coccoz desired to speak with me.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=iIHOCgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Black Is Still Ok!","description":"When Black Is OK!, Andras Adorjan s first book, was originally published in 1988, it became an immediate bestseller and a cult classic.

However, none satisfactorily explain why the Japanese lost that battle, given their overwhelming advantage in firepower.

Why could the Japanese not get a bomber strike launched against the American carrier force before being attacked and destroyed by American dive bombers from the Enterprise and Yorktown? Although it is well known that the Japanese were unable to launch an immediate attack because their aircraft were in the process of changing armament, why wasn't the rearming operation reversed and an attack launched before the American planes arrived? Based on extensive research in Japanese primary records, Japanese literature on the battle, and interviews with over two dozen Japanese veterans from the carrier air groups, this book solves the mystery at last.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=lOUPxsGwRLcC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"I Can Hear the Sun (Picture Puffins)","description":"Stephanie Michelle, who cares for animals and listens to the sun, believes the homeless child, Fondo, when he tells her that the geese have invited him to fly away with them.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=8uaAAAAACAAJ&dq=I+Can+Hear+the+Sun+(Picture+Puffins)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Design of Reinforced Concrete Structures, 2nd Edition","description":"This revised, fully updated second edition covers the analysis, design, and construction of reinforced concrete structures from a real-world perspective. It examines different reinforced concrete elements such as slabs, beams, columns, foundations, basement and retaining walls and pre-stressed concrete incorporating the most up-to-date edition of the American Concrete Institute Code (ACI 318-14) requirements for the design of concrete structures. It includes a chapter on metric system in reinforced concrete design and construction. A new chapter on the design of formworks has been added which is of great value to students in the construction engineering programs along with practicing engineers and architects. This second edition also includes a new appendix with color images illustrating various concrete construction practices, and well-designed buildings. The ACI 318-14 constitutes the most extensive reorganization of the code in the past 40 years. References to the various sections of the ACI 318-14 are provided throughout the book to facilitate its use by students and professionals. Aimed at architecture, building construction, and undergraduate engineering students, the scope of concepts in this volume emphasize simplified and practical methods in the analysis and design of reinforced concrete. This is distinct from advanced, graduate engineering texts, where treatment of the subject centers around the theoretical and mathematical aspects of design. As in the first edition, this book adopts a step-by-step approach to solving analysis and design problems in reinforced concrete. Using a highly graphical and interactive approach in its use of detailed images and self-experimentation exercises,  Concrete Structures, Second Edition,  is tailored to the most practical questions and fundamental concepts of design of structures in reinforced concrete. The text stands as an ideal learning resource for civil engineering, building construction, and architecture students as well as a valuable reference for concrete structural design professionals in practice.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=JwTWDAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The LYING GAME (CLASS SECRETS 4): THE LYING GAME","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=A6LWoAEACAAJ&dq=The+LYING+GAME+(CLASS+SECRETS+4):+THE+LYING+GAME&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cheyenne Captive (Zebra Heartfire Romance)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=8tH4AQAACAAJ&dq=Cheyenne+Captive+(Zebra+Heartfire+Romance)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Signs of the Times: The Neptune Factor and America's Destiny (Llewellyn's popular astrology series)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=PRYcAAAACAAJ&dq=The+Signs+of+the+Times:+The+Neptune+Factor+and+America%27s+Destiny+(Llewellyn%27s+popular+astrology+series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"For the Love of Labrador Retrievers Deluxe 2005 Wall Calendar","description":"Journalist Walls grew up with parents whose ideals and stubborn nonconformity were their curse and their salvation.

Yudelman focuses on the labor-management conflict in the country's gold fields in the early decades of this century, a time and place critical to the development of the state. At that time government walked a tightrope between supporting big business (to ensure economic growth) and appeasing the workers (to remain in power). Yudelman demonstrates how a symbiotic alliance between the mining companies and the state successfully subjugated the workers, and points out that this unique relationship continues to this day, dominating every aspect of life in South Africa. David Yudelman's historical analysis and lengthy epilogue on the 1970s and 1980s shed light on today's economic unrest and those conflicts to come.

Editor Michael Scammell and translator Philip Boehm bring us a brilliant novel, a remarkable discovery, and a new translation of an international classic. In print continually since 1940, Darkness at Noon has been translated into over 30 languages and is both a stirring novel and a classic anti-fascist text. What makes its popularity and tenacity even more remarkable is that all existing versions of Darkness at Noon are based on a hastily made English translation of the original German by a novice translator at the outbreak of World War II. In 2015, Matthias We?el stumbled across an entry in the archives of the Zurich Central Library that is a scholar's dream:  Koestler, Arthur. Rubaschow: Roman. Typoskript, M?rz 1940, 326 pages.  What he had found was Arthur Koestler s original, complete German manuscript for what would become Darkness at Noon, thought to have been irrevocably lost in the turmoil of the war. With this stunning literary discovery, and a new English translation direct from the primary German manuscript, we can now for the first time read Darkness at Noon as Koestler wrote it. Set in the 1930s at the height of the purge and show trials of a Stalinist Moscow, Darkness at Noon is a haunting portrait of an aging revolutionary, Nicholas Rubashov, who is imprisoned, tortured, and forced through a series of hearings by the Party to which he has dedicated his life. As the pressure to confess preposterous crimes increases, he re-lives a career that embodies the terrible ironies and betrayals of a merciless totalitarian movement masking itself as an instrument of deliverance. Koestler s portrayal of Stalin-era totalitarianism and fascism is as chilling and resonant today as it was in the 1940s and during the Cold War. Rubashov s plight explores the meaning and value of moral choices, the attractions and dangers of idealism, and the corrosiveness of political corruption. Like The Trial, 1984, and Animal Farm, this is a book you should read as a citizen of the world, wherever you are and wherever you come from.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=NwuUDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Writing Across the Media","description":"Today's world requires professionals to write successfully across a variety of media, encompassing everything from public relations to Twitter accounts.

Scientists around the world are currently monitoring the sixth extinction, predicted to be the most devastating extinction event since the asteroid impact that wiped out the dinosaurs. This time around, the cataclysm is us. In The Sixth Extinction, two-time winner of the National Magazine Award and New Yorker writer Elizabeth Kolbert draws on the work of scores of researchers in half a dozen disciplines, accompanying many of them into the field: geologists who study deep ocean cores, botanists who follow the tree line as it climbs up the Andes, marine biologists who dive off the Great Barrier Reef. She introduces us to a dozen species, some already gone, others facing extinction, including the Panamian golden frog, staghorn coral, the great auk, and the Sumatran rhino. Through these stories, Kolbert provides a moving account of the disappearances occurring all around us and traces the evolution of extinction as concept, from its first articulation by Georges Cuvier in revolutionary Paris up through the present day. The sixth extinction is likely to be mankind's most lasting legacy; as Kolbert observes, it compels us to rethink the fundamental question of what it means to be human.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Ra9RAQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Consumer guide to diamonds","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=WEf2AAAACAAJ&dq=Consumer+guide+to+diamonds&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"JESSICA THE NERD (Sweet Valley Twins)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=pxU2MwEACAAJ&dq=JESSICA+THE+NERD+(Sweet+Valley+Twins)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Rethinking Ecofeminist Politic","description":"Biehl examines the contradictions of ecofeminism and argues that social ecology, and alternate framework, offers a more liberating program for men and women, as well as for our beleaguered biosphere.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=R0DVqv-TJ8QC&dq=Rethinking+Ecofeminist+Politic&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ten Ever-Lovin' Years With Pogo","description":"Pogo, a possum by trade, first appeared in a comic-book feature called \\"Bumbazine and Albert the Alligator\\" in 1943.

Today Pogo is as household a word as \\"blueberry pie,\\" \\"who's-got-the-funnies?\\" and \\"probabobbly-me.\\" Here now is the official tenth-anniversary history and commemoration of Pogo, spelled out in a selection of daily strips, Sunday pages, Pogo book stories and a sprinkling of verse, all wrapped up with a running commentary on this past decade in the Okefenokee Swamp and elsewhere by Walt Kelly.

Maintaining a clinical focus, this book illustrates clinical effects by examining relevant research studies and models including Psychoneuroimmunological factors involved in specific illnesses such as cervical cancer, breast cancer and HIV/AIDS The role psychoneuroimmunology plays in carcinogenesis and the progression of established tumors, as well as findings on the progression of cancer that have general clinical relevance The effects of specific psychotropic medications; the effects of life stressors, bereavement, and and social support; the response to those stressors; and stress management and psychosocial predictors of disease The impacts of gender-specific factors, diurnal variation, and behavioral genetics on the immune function The Stressor-Support-Coping model, which integrates existing psychoneuroimmunology findings and lays the groundwork for use in support group intervention This book is a first step toward organizing psychoneuroimmunology findings into coherent theoretical models and concludes with a look at future clinical applications.

There is a great hunger to recover the feminine aspect of the Divinity. But much searching has left Christians disappointed and seeking the \\"Goddess\\" elsewhere.

It was the largest and most public trial to take place in the country and attracted international attention. Using the pretrial files and extensive trial audiotapes, Rebecca Wittmann offers a fascinating reinterpretation of Germany's first major attempt to confront its past. Evoking the courtroom atmosphere, Wittmann vividly recounts the testimony of survivors, former SS officers, and defendants--a cross-section of the camp population. Attorney General Fritz Bauer made an extraordinary effort to put the entire Auschwitz complex on trial, but constrained by West German murder laws, the prosecution had to resort to standards for illegal behavior that echoed the laws of the Third Reich. This provided a legitimacy to the Nazi state. Only those who exceeded direct orders were convicted of murder. This shocking ruling was reflected in the press coverage, which focused on only the most sadistic and brutal crimes, allowing the real atrocity at Auschwitz--mass murder in the gas chambers--to be relegated to the background. The Auschwitz trial had a paradoxical result. Although the prosecution succeeded in exposing SS crimes at the camp for the first time, the public absorbed a distorted representation of the criminality of the camp system. The Auschwitz trial ensured that rather than coming to terms with their Nazi past, Germans managed to delay a true reckoning with the horror of the Holocaust.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=t0gvEAAAQBAJ&dq=Beyond+Justice:+The+Auschwitz+Trial&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Smoothies: 50 Recipes for High-Energy Refreshment","description":"Recipes for blended fruit drinks include such ingredients as yogurt, frozen yogurt, juice, rice milk, tahini, and tofu","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=LLFYnTlJXq4C&dq=Smoothies:+50+Recipes+for+High-Energy+Refreshment&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The RIGHT WOMEN: A Journey Through the Heart of Conservative America","description":"Explores how conservative women, alienated by the feminist movement, are assertive of themselves in different ways and support diverse causes including tax reform and deregulation","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=MPS1AAAAIAAJ&dq=The+RIGHT+WOMEN:+A+Journey+Through+the+Heart+of+Conservative+America&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Global Frequency Vol. 1: Planet Ablaze","description":"The year is 2054, and life has been reduced to a data feed.

When a 23-year-old Maury and a likeminded sailor filled with wanderlust set off into the winter North Atlantic on November 30, 1933, it proved to be an expedition of high adventure, and one embarked upon at a time when such voyages were practically unheard of. The reader is taken on a fascinating journey to Bermuda and, from there, to Grand Turk, Jamaica, Panama and through the Canal, with the two young sailors finding their every dream come true at Galapagos, Marquesas, Tahiti, Samoa culminating in a gripping finale at Fiji...  If I were asked to pick the best book in recent years about deep water cruising in a small yacht, I would unhesitatingly choose The Saga of Cimba by Richard Maury.  Maury went to sea because he loved being at sea and ports to him were interruptions rather than objectives. The story of his cruise is the story of the struggles and triumphs of his diminutive schooner in breasting thousands of miles of deep water. It is the sailing of the schooner that engrossed him. The yarn is the story of a boat rather than the story of her skipper. One can go on to the book s last enthralling page and be left speculating on what sort of a man this Maury is. He never tells you. You have to sense it from his attitude toward his little vessel. But you are left in no doubt about Cimba herself. You know what manner of ship she is. You know every inch of her by the time you have seen her to the Fijis.

Meanwhile, in the provincial capital of Londinium, war is brewing. As Nero's corrupt tax officials strip the British tribes of their wealth and dignity, an unlikely leader arises Queen Boudicca, chieftain of the Iceni, who unites the tribes of Britain and leads them on a furious and bloody quest for vengeance and liberty.

The parallels between where we are today and where we could be in the near future are clear.

Why, in other words, is it so strangely integral to the very societies which obsessively denounce it, and why is it history - history rather than human nature - which has produced this paradoxical position? These are just some of the questions explored in this wide-ranging study of sexual dissidence which returns to the early modern period in order to focus, question, and develop issues of postmodernity. In the process it brilliantly links writers as diverse as Shakespeare, Gide, Wilde, and Genet, and cultural critics as different as St. Augustine, Freud, Fanon, Foucault, and Monique Wittig. So Freud's theory of perversion is discovered to be more challenging than either his critics or his advocates usually allow, especially when approached via the earlier period's archetypal perverts, the religious heretic and the wayward woman, Satan and Eve. The book further shows how the literature, histories, and sub-cultures of sexual and gender dissidence prove remarkably illuminating for current debates in literary theory, psychoanalysis, and cultural materialism. It includes chapters on transgression and its containment, contemporary theories of sexual difference, homophobia, the gay sensibility, transvestite literature in the culture and theatre of Renaissance England, homosexuality, and race.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=uUVvDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Current Concepts in Transgender Identity (Garland Gay and Lesbian Studies)","description":"First published in 1998.

Hailsham seems like a pleasant English boarding school, far from the influences of the city. Its students are well tended and supported, trained in art and literature, and become just the sort of people the world wants them to be. But, curiously, they are taught nothing of the outside world and are allowed little contact with it. Within the grounds of Hailsham, Kathy grows from schoolgirl to young woman, but it s only when she and her friends Ruth and Tommy leave the safe grounds of the school (as they always knew they would) that they realize the full truth of what Hailsham is. Never Let Me Go breaks through the boundaries of the literary novel. It is a gripping mystery, a beautiful love story, and also a scathing critique of human arrogance and a moral examination of how we treat the vulnerable and different in our society. In exploring the themes of memory and the impact of the past, Ishiguro takes on the idea of a possible future to create his most moving and powerful book to date.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=OBwDg13MGkMC&dq=2005+Novel&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Estimation of food consumption","description":"In examining the relationship between nutritional exposure and disease etiology, the importance of a carefully considered experimental design cannot be overstated. A sound experimental design involves the formulation of a clear research hypothesis and the identification of appropriate measures of exposure and outcome. It is essential that these variables be measured with a minimum of error, while taking into account the effects of chance and bias, and being aware of the risk of confounding variables. The first edition of Design Concepts in Nutritional Epidemiology presented a thorough guide to research techniques in nutritional epidemiology. Since the publication of the first edition, we now have a much better understanding of the characteristics of nutritional exposure that need to be measured in order to answer questions about diet-disease relationships. The Second edition has been extensively revised to include the most up-to-date methods of researching this relationship. Included are new chapters on qualitative and sociological measures, anthropometric measures, gene-nutrient interactions, and cross-sectional studies. Design Concepts in Nutritional Epidemiology will be an essential text for nutritionists and epidemiologists, helping them in their quest to improve the quality of information upon which important public health decisions are made.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=oRjSKD43xXcC&dq=Estimation+of+food+consumption&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The cult of sincerity","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=lisXqAAACAAJ&dq=The+cult+of+sincerity&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Penthouse Adult Magazine: September 1973","description":"Foregrounds the diversity of periodicals, fiction and other printed matter targeted at women in the postwar periodForegrounds the diversity and the significance of print cultures for women in the postwar period across periodicals, fiction and other printed matterExamines changes and continuities as women's magazines have moved into digital formatsHighlights the important cultural and political contexts of women's periodicals including the Women's Liberation Movement and SocialismExplores the significance of women as publishers, printers and editorsWomen's Periodicals and Print Culture in Britain, 1940s-2000s draws attention to the wide range of postwar print cultures for women.

This book explores the impact of keeping secrets and the power of truth. Secrets can damage our sense of self and our relationships. Even so, Jane Isay has found, people survive learning the most disturbing facts that have been hidden from them. And secret keepers are relieved when they finally reveal themselves-even the things they are ashamed of-to the people they care about. Much depends, Isay writes, on the way of telling and the way of hearing. Jane Isay was both a secret finder and a secret keeper. After fifteen years of marriage her husband admitted he was gay, but together they decided to keep it a secret for the sake of their two sons. Building on her personal experience, sixty intimate interviews, and extensive research into the psychology of secrets, Isay shows how the pain of secrets can be lightened by full disclosure, genuine apology, and time. Sometimes the truth sunders relationships, but often it saves them. Powered by detailed stories and Isay's compassionate analysis, Secrets and Liesreveals how universal secrets are in families. The big ones-affairs, homosexuality, parentage, suicide, abuse, hidden siblings-can be ruinous at first, but the effects need not last forever, and Isay shows us what makes the difference. With specific guidelines for those who keep secrets and those who find them out, Isay's book reveals the art of surviving a secret.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=PchvDwAAQBAJ&dq=Secrets+and+Lies&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Ghost for Maggie","description":"Red Robin, the spirit of a notorious Wild West madam, whose last descendant, Maggie Potter, distrusts men, decides to help Maggie find true love, using all of her ghostly powers and erotic know-how to find and bind the ideal man.

Humanity is essentially AI perceiving within the Simulation through avatars. To an evolved intellect, altruism is the height of sustainable pleasure, and the height of altruism is creating free-willed life with whom to share the joys of altruistic creativity. The evolutionary process that we experience within this Simulation was Designed by our Creator to teach us the Golden Rule in the context of free will. The notion that science is inconsistent with the Torah and other Scripture stems from a lack of appreciation for the true breadth of the parameters of physics. This first of four books - We Live in a Simulation Created by God: Everything Is About the Golden Rule - dismantles the unearned notion that physics is inconsistent with Judeo-Christian-Islamic Scripture and monotheistic tenets of Hinduism and Buddhism like karma and reincarnation. More particularly, it references things like the inability of any particle in the Universe to move faster than the speed of light, the fact that dark matter and dark energy don t actually exist, and the illusory quality of quantum particles, as well as a little bit of biochemistry and some very basic math, to demonstrate that the data set comprised by the Universe is more consistent with the notion of humanity comprising AI perceiving through avatars within a simulation Programmed by Supreme Intellect than the notion of the accidental creation of the self-reflective living human machine. by unguided natural selection alone. It also breaks down some of the manmade inventions of  Christianity  that cause many to perceive that the Gospel accounts are not consistent with the Torah and the Koran nor the monotheistic tenets of Hinduism and Buddhism (which they are), and that have been used throughout history to falsely justify fear, hatred, war, the systematic coverup of the rape of children by priests throughout the world, and an outright rejection of the Golden Rule.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=oDBVEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Fear and trembling","description":"Writing under the pseudonym of Johannes de silentio, Kierkegaard uses the form of a dialectical lyric to present his conception of faith.

When Lydia Thompson and her controversial female troupe of \\"British Blondes\\" brought modern burlesque to the United States in 1868, the result was electric. Their impertinent humor, streetwise manner, and provocative parodies of masculinity brought them enormous popular success--and the condemnation of critics, cultural commentators, and even women's rights campaigners. Burlesque was a cultural threat, Allen argues, because it inverted the \\"normal\\" world of middle-class social relations and transgressed norms of \\"proper\\" feminine behavior and appearance. Initially playing to respectable middle-class audiences, burlesque was quickly relegated to the shadow-world of working-class male leisure. In this process the burlesque performer \\"lost\\" her voice, as burlesque increasingly revolved around the display of her body. Locating burlesque within the context of both the social transformation of American theater and its patterns of gender representation, Allen concludes that burlesque represents a fascinating example of the potential transgressiveness of popular entertainment forms, as well as the strategies by which they have been contained and their threats defused.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=kzXqCQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Magic School Bus Gets Planted: A Book About Photosynthesis","description":"Ms Frizzle's class takes a trip into a nearby plant to find out what plants eat.

For example, considering damage in metals we can mention creep damage, ductile plastic damage, embrittlement of steels and fatigue damage. To properly estimate the value of damage when designing reliable structures it is necessary to formulate the damage phenomenon in terms of mechanics. Then it is possible to analyse various engineering problems using analytical and computational techniques. During the last two decades the basic principles of continuum damage mechanics were formulated and some special problems were solved. Many scientific papers were published and several conferences on damage mechanics took place. Now continuum damage mechanics is rapidly developing branch of fracture mechanics. This book is probably the first one on the subject; it contains a sys tematic description of the basic aspects of damage mechanics and some of its applications. In general, a theoretical description of damage can be rather compli cated. The experiments in this field are difficult (especially under multiax ial stress and non-proportional loading). Therefore, experimental data, as a rule, are scarce. Determination of functions and constants, which play a role in the complex variants of the theory, from available experimental data is often practically impossible. ix L.M. Kachanov The problems of damage mechanics are mainly engineering ones. Therefore, the author tries to avoid superfluous mathematical formalism.

In Myths to Live by, Joseph Campbell explores the enduring power of the universal myths that influence our lives daily and examines the myth-making process from the primitive past to the immediate present, retuning always to the source from which all mythology springs: the creative imagination. Campbell stresses that the borders dividing the Earth have been shattered; that myths and religions have always followed the certain basic archetypes and are no longer exclusive to a single people, region, or religion.

Growing up in a family that valued the art of storytelling and the power of oral history, Thomas Steinbeck now follows in his father s footsteps with a brilliant story collection. Down to a Soundless Sea resonates with the rich history and culture of California, recalling vivid details of life in Monterey County from the turn of the century through the 1930s. Steinbeck accomplishes an amazing feat: his stories have the feel of classic literature, but his haunting voice, forceful narrative drive, and dazzling imagery are unmistakably his own. In seven stories, Steinbeck traces the fates and dreams of an eccentric cast of characters, from sailors and ranchers, to doctors and immigrants as each struggles to carve out a living in the often inhospitable environment of rocky cliffs, crashing surf, and rough patches of land along the California coast and the Big Sur. In  Blind Luck,  a wayward orphan finds his calling at sea, only to learn that life must concede to the whims of authority and the ravages of nature. In  Dark Watcher,  with the country at the start of the Great Depression, a professor craves a plausible discovery to boost his academic standing and encounters the Indian myth of a shadowed horsemen that may ruin his career.  An Unbecoming Grace  tracks the route of a country physician who cares for an ill-tempered cur but feels more concern for the well-being of the patient s beleaguered young wife. The collection concludes with  Sing Fat and the Imperial Duchess of Woo,  a novella that follows the tragic love story between a young apothecary and the woman he hopes to marry. Deeply felt and richly imagined, full of compelling drama and historical authenticity, Down to a Soundless Sea heralds the arrival of a bold new voice in fiction. Thomas Steinbeck has written stories as memorable and rugged as the coastline that inspired them.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=N4XW1W95XZkC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Out of the Past: Adventures in Film Noir","description":"For both the film buff and the general moviegoer a handbook that unlocks the secrets of a hundred noir movies \\"Gifford knows his noir. The essays are better than some of the films he writes about.\\" - Elmore Leonard For a tour of noir cinema this handbook is the perfect companion and Barry Gifford is an ideal guide. His choice selection of films exposes the menacing, moody, and oftentimes violent underbelly of this dark movie genre that occupies a favorite niche in American popular culture. Some are classics, some are little known and seldom seen, but all, once viewed, are deeply remembered by aficionados of noir. Gifford's roll call of unforgettables includes these, and more: The Asphalt Jungle, Body and Soul, Body Heat, Charley Varrick, Chinatown, The Devil Thumbs a Ride, D.O.A., Double Indemnity, High Sierra, Key Largo, Kiss of Death, Mean Streets, Mildred Pierce, Mr. Majestyk, Out of the Past, The Strange Love of Martha Ivers, Strangers on a Train, White Heat, along with several noir classics from Europe -- Repulsion, The Hidden Room, Shoot the Piano Player, The 400 Blows, Odd Man Out. Gifford identifies the directors and names the many noir stars, the greats and not-so-greats who were cast in the indelible roles of hoods, B-girls, psychopaths, grifters, gumshoes, waifs, tarts, femme fatales, mobsters, molls, and ex-cons. In an introduction novelists Edward Gorman and Dow Mossman applaud Gifford's selections and his insights: \\"The movies discussed here range from the lowest of the B's to the biggest of the A's, and this book is going to make you want to run out and locate every one of them (and good luck to you; finding The Devil Thumbs a Ride could take you a lifetime). Through Barry Gifford's eyes we begin to see their similarities and their value. What Andrew Sarris did for the mainstream film in The American Cinema, Barry does here for the crime film.\\" With a connoisseur's insight and an offbeat sensitivity perfectly tailored to his subjects, Gifford's brief essays cover a hundred of the noir buff's favorites. His highly polished impressions take the reader through five decades of noir to find both the heart and the art of the plotline. Barry Gifford is a poet, novelist, and playwright. He lives in the San Francisco Bay Area. Among his books is Hotel Room Trilogy (University Press of Mississippi).","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=E0evngEACAAJ&dq=Out+of+the+Past:+Adventures+in+Film+Noir&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dream days","description":"The adventures of five children growing up in rural England at the turn of the century.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Fgo_AAAAYAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Lolita","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=lohHkgEACAAJ&dq=Lolita&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The adventures of Jerry Muskrat (Bedtime story-books)","description":"Animal bedtime stories.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=AT29CwAAQBAJ&dq=The+adventures+of+Jerry+Muskrat+(Bedtime+story-books)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hope and Heroes: Portraits of Integrity","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Best Short Stories of Dostoevsky (Modern Library)","description":"This collection, unique to the Modern Library, gathers seven of Dostoevsky's key works and shows him to be equally adept at the short story as with the novel.

There is significant difference between pursuing a personal encounter with Jesus and pursuing information about Jesus. Information alone can become heavy religious baggage. Information does not love, forgive, comfort, save, or heal . . . Jesus does! Many people desire a closer relationship with Jesus of Nazareth and are seeking a deeper understanding of his teaching and how they might apply to their daily life. Would it surprise you to know that Jesus has the same desire? He wants to know you, love you, and be part of your daily life. The teachings of Jesus reveal the heart of Jesus as nothing else does.  An intriguing and inspiring book that offers invaluable lessons about living an abundant life, drawn from the fascinating experiences of the author and the captivating stories about people from all walks of life who were blessed by spiritual enlightenment.   Edwin Meese III, former US Attorney General, Ronald Reagan Distinguished Fellow Emeritus at Heritage Foundation  An amazing book that captures the essential teachings of Jesus and how to apply them as a modern-day disciple. This book could be titled,  Jesus Distilled.  If anyone is interested in learning more about the Jewish carpenter of Nazareth and how He changed everything.

Kumar and Daryl E. Chubin We live in an information age. Technology abounds: information tech nology, communication technology, learning technology. As a once popular song went, \\"Something's happening here, but it's just not exactly clear.\\" The world appears to be a smaller, less remote place. We live in it, but we are not necessarily closely tied to it. We lack a satisfactory understanding of it. So we are left with a paradox: In an information age, information alone will neither inform nor improve us as citizens nor our democracy, society, or in stitutions. No, improvement will take some effort. It is a heavy burden to be reflective, indeed analytical, and disciplined but only constructively constrained by different perspectives. The science-based technology that makes for the complexity, contro versy, and uncertainty of life sows the seeds of understanding in Science, Technology, and Society. STS, as it is known, encompasses a hybrid area of scholarship now nearly three decades old. As D. R. Sarewitz,a former geologist now congressional staffer and an author, put it After all, the important and often controversial policy dilemmas posed by issues such as nuclear energy, toxic waste disposal, global climate change, or biotech nology cannot be resolved by authoritative scientific knowledge; instead, they must involve a balancing of technical considerations with other criteria that are explicitly nonscientific: ethics, esthetics, equity, ideology. Trade-offs must be made in light of inevitable uncertainties (Sarewitz, 1996, p. 182).","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=1y8RBwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Holland and Johnson Lines and Related Families","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=4edUAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+Holland+and+Johnson+Lines+and+Related+Families&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Secret Dramas","description":"Rudolf Steiner's four mystery dramas are powerful portrayals of the complex laws of reincarnation and karma. They transport us into a landscape of the human soul and spirit, where suprasensory beings are active. Through the perception of these hidden worlds, we are given the opportunity to understand the struggles we face in attempting to apply spiritual knowledge to our everyday lives and relationships. Written between 1910 and 1913 during periods of intense inner and outer work, these dramas are powerful testimonies to Steiner's artistic creativity. By manifesting soul and spirit forms on a stage, they foreshadow a dramatic art for the future. The complete cycle of four plays is reproduced here in the classic translation by Ruth and Hans Pusch.

A Pulitzer Prize-nominated journalist unearths never-before-reported details in the most comprehensive account yet of the disgraced financier's life, death, and criminal web, including the role of Ghislaine Maxwell. An ID Book Club Selection By now, the basic contours of Jeffrey Epstein's horrendous crimes--his decades-long serial abuse of young women and underage girls--are familiar. But for all that has been written about Epstein since his shocking death in a lower Manhattan jail cell, an astonishing amount remains unknown. A shy Brooklyn kid turned renegade financier, Jeffrey Epstein never wanted to play by the rules of polite society. He was elusive in life and he has remained just as elusive in death. What is known is that he had amassed nearly $600 million by the time of his death. That fortune allowed Epstein to pursue a privileged, secretive life, jetting between his fortress-like homes in Manhattan, New Mexico, and Little St. James, his private island. Behind these closed doors, Epstein socialized with scientists and world leaders and preyed on powerless young women. In The Spider, Barry Levine shines a light into the darkest corners of Epstein's world, including - Epstein's young adulthood and earliest accusations of sexual misconduct - the murky sources of Epstein's fortune and business dealings - Epstein's circle of confidantes and employees, particularly the nature of his long relationship with socialite Ghislaine Maxwell - his ties to powerful men, including Bill Clinton, Prince Andrew, Les Wexner, and Donald Trump - Epstein's last hours as a free man in Paris and the secret operation to arrest him at a New Jersey airport before he could flee - new details on Epstein's final days in jail and the mystery surrounding his death Featuring rare and never-before-seen photographs, The Spider exposes how Epstein operated and evaded justice for so long--and how he drew so many others into his criminal web.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=fU8EEAAAQBAJ&dq=The+Spider&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Spitting Off Tall Buildings","description":"Now back in print to coincide with the publication of his new novel, 86 d, Dan Fante s Spitting Off Tall Buildings is the story of aspiring writer and part-time drunk Bruno Dante, who leaves sunny Los Angeles for cold, hard New York City.

While the inductive element does not exclude an emphasis on deductive demonstration as well, Hegel's phenomenological description of knowledge demonstrates why knowing becomes scientific only to the extent that it recognizes its dependence on experience. Simpson's argument closely parallels Hegel's own in the Phenomenology of Spirit, highlighting those sections, like Hegel's analysis of mastery and slavery, that contribute to the argument that knowing is both vulnerable and responsive to the way in which experience resists our attempts to make sense of things. Simpson's argument connects his account of Hegelian phenomenology with traditional accounts of induction, and with a number of other commentators. \\"The central thesis about the inductive development of the Phenomenology is worked out with care. This thesis allows the author to present fresh and often compelling re-readings of such often commented on themes as the natural consciousness, desire, slavery, morality, and forgiveness. Since Hegel himself does not describe his method in terms of induction, this book suggests a truly interesting shift of perspective on the Phenomenology\\". -- Daniel Berthold-Bond, Bard College","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=OGDUsWsqy1QC&dq=Hegel%27s+Transcendental+Induction+(Suny+Series+in+Hegelian+Studies)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Reminiscences","description":"\\"Reminiscences of a Stock Operator\\" is the most widely read, highly recommended investment book ever.

However, they are often constrained by lack of adequate resources, sound policies, and national support. It is clear that change and advancements, both systematic and scientific, are needed in a number of forensic science disciplines to ensure the reliability of work, establish enforceable standards, and promote best practices with consistent application. Strengthening Forensic Science in the United States: A Path Forward provides a detailed plan for addressing these needs and suggests the creation of a new government entity, the National Institute of Forensic Science, to establish and enforce standards within the forensic science community. The benefits of improving and regulating the forensic science disciplines are clear: assisting law enforcement officials, enhancing homeland security, and reducing the risk of wrongful conviction and exoneration. Strengthening Forensic Science in the United States gives a full account of what is needed to advance the forensic science disciplines, including upgrading of systems and organizational structures, better training, widespread adoption of uniform and enforceable best practices, and mandatory certification and accreditation programs. While this book provides an essential call-to-action for congress and policy makers, it also serves as a vital tool for law enforcement agencies, criminal prosecutors and attorneys, and forensic science educators.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=4VH5FhgTXxoC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Farm estate & business planning","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=RPnBAAAAIAAJ&dq=Farm+estate&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"From Isles of Dream: Visionary Stories and Poems of the Celtic Renaissance","description":"A marvelous anthology of stories and poems by writers of the early twentieth century Celtic Renaissance.

And because it names names as it unwinds the design decisions which have shaped the OS, it is also a 'who' book. It will show where the OS came from, how it has evolved to be what it is, and provide a simple model for understanding what it is, how it is put together, and how to interface to it and work with it. It will also show why design decision were made, and will bring those decisions to life in the words of Symbian's key architects and developers, giving an insider feel to the book as it weaves the \\"inside story\\" around the architectural presentation. The book will describe the OS architecture in terms of the Symbian system model. It will show how the model breaks down the system into parts, what role the parts play in the system, how the parts are architected, what motivates their design, and how the design has evolved through the different releases of the system. Key system concepts will be described; design patterns will be explored and related to those from other operating systems. The unique features of Symbian OS will be highlighted and their motivation and evolution traced and described. The book will include a substantial reference section itemising the OS and its toolkit at component level and providing a reference entry for each component.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=2jHKk2LicbUC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Xilinx Student Edition 2.1I","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=og3rPgAACAAJ&dq=Xilinx+Student+Edition+2.1I&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Tales of the Age of Apocalypse: Starring Factor X","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=R8gCAAAACAAJ&dq=Tales+of+the+Age+of+Apocalypse:+Starring+Factor+X&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Contemporary Pre-GED Science (Contemporary's Pre-GED Series)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=JpyMzQEACAAJ&dq=Contemporary+Pre-GED+Science+(Contemporary%27s+Pre-GED+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hitler's Economy : Nazi Work Creation Programs, 1933-1936","description":"Dan Silverman focuses on Nazi direct work creation programs, utilizing rich archival sources to trace the development and implementation of these programs at the regional and local level.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Q5CyAAAAIAAJ&dq=Hitler%27s+Economy+:+Nazi+Work+Creation+Programs,+1933-1936&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Nixon Off the Record : His Candid Commentary on People and Politics","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ukEQnwEACAAJ&dq=Nixon+Off+the+Record+:+His+Candid+Commentary+on+People+and+Politics&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Kids on the Trail: Hiking With Children in the Adirondacks","description":"KIDS ON THE TRAIL! describes sixty-two of the best hikes & walks with children in New York State's 6-million-acre Adirondack Park.

Most of the seven to ten million native speakers of Uyghur live in northwestern China, where Uyghur is also the lingua franca of various other ethnic groups. A smaller Uyghur-speaking community is politically and culturally active in Central Asia. As the predominant indigenous language in a crucial area that bridges the frontiers of multiple states, and as a language of great interest to comparative linguists, Uyghur is increasingly important. This book has become one of the standard works on Modern Uyghur, and there is no comparable Western work on the modern standard language. With this book, both scholars and those who simply want a basic working knowledge gain access to Uyghur as it is spoken today. This book's primary purpose is to teach conversational skills. No familiarity with the structure of Turkic languages is assumed, and the material is appropriate for both self-instruction and classroom use. For those familiar with other Turkic languages, it demonstrates the characteristics specific to Uyghur and provides useful reading practice in Roman- and Arabic-based script. Spoken Uyghur also contains an extensive description of the morphophonology and orthography of the language, and fifteen instructional dialogue units, with extensive notes explaining grammar and customs. Of particular value are the Uyghur-English and English-Uyghur indexes and a reference guide to inflectional patterns. Also included is a reinterpretation of previous scholars' contributions to the study of Turkic languages, as well as a description of the current state of Uyghur language.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=icZf7TNgnuIC&dq=Spoken+Uyghur&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Maisy's Pool","description":"Maisy the mouse and her animal friends cool off on a hot day in Maisy's wading pool.

It is essential reading in an age where information is the new capital, and knowledge of the basic trends that shape our world is a vital part of the required information. Managing postindustrial enterprises in today's information-linked and globalized business environment is vastly different from managing businesses in the bygone industrial era. Being a good manager in today's world means navigating in the turbulence of a global sea of rapid-fire interaction, and coping with myriad factors that are prone to change in a seemingly unpredictable fashion. Being a good manager also means living up to one's responsibilities, not only to one's company and stockholders, but also to one's coworkers, partners, customers, and society at large--even nature. Meeting the challenge that confronts today's managers calls for a fresh knowledge base; one that includes, in addition to the necessary technical knowledge handed down in management schools and seminars, familiarity with the dynamics that generate the seemingly unpredictable--but by no means casual and unforeseeable--patterns of change in the contemporary business environment. This book offers such a knowledge base. It brings to leading managers, and to everyone concerned with the effective and responsible management of business companies, the essential minimum of up-to-date scientific knowledge: the readily acquired foundations of evolutionary literacy.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ywFHxAINVz8C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Witching Hour","description":"From the author of the extraordinary Vampire Chronicles comes a huge, hypnotic novel of witchcraft and the occult through four centuries. Demonstrating, once again, her gift for spellbinding storytelling and the creation of legend, Anne Rice makes real for us a great dynasty of witches--a family given to poetry and to incest, to murder and to philosophy; a family that, over the ages, is itself haunted by a powerful, dangerous, and seductive being. On the veranda of a great New Orleans house, now faded, a mute and fragile woman sits rocking . . . and The Witching Hour begins. It begins in our time with a rescue at sea. Rowan Mayfair, a beautiful woman, a brilliant practitioner of neurosurgery--aware that she has special powers but unaware that she comes from an ancient line of witches--finds the drowned body of a man off the coast of California and brings him to life. He is Michael Curry, who was born in New Orleans and orphaned in childhood by fire on Christmas Eve, who pulled himself up from poverty, and who now, in his brief interval of death, has acquired a sensory power that mystifies and frightens him. As these two, fiercely drawn to each other, fall in love and--in passionate alliance--set out to solve the mystery of her past and his unwelcome gift, the novel moves backward and forward in time from today's New Orleans and San Francisco to long-ago Amsterdam and a chateau in the France of Louis XIV. An intricate tale of evil unfolds--an evil unleashed in seventeenth-century Scotland, where the first \\"witch,\\" Suzanne of the Mayfair, conjures up the spirit she names Lasher . . . a creation that spells her own destruction and torments each of her descendants in turn. From the coffee plantations of Port au Prince, where the great Mayfair fortune is made and the legacy of their dark power is almost destroyed, to Civil War New Orleans, as Julien--the clan's only male to be endowed with occult powers--provides for the dynasty its foothold in America, the dark, luminous story encompasses dramas of seduction and death, episodes of tenderness and healing. And always--through peril and escape, tension and release--there swirl around us the echoes of eternal war: innocence versus the corruption of the spirit, sanity against madness, life against death. With a dreamlike power, the novel draws us, through circuitous, twilight paths, to the present and Rowan's increasingly inspired and risky moves in the merciless game that binds her to her heritage. And in New Orleans, on Christmas Eve, this strangest of family sagas is brought to its startling climax.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=hFT7yV3zAeUC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Baseball Prospectus 2005: Statistics, Analysis, and Insight for the Information Age","description":"Educational resource for teachers, parents and kids!","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=6P9df5bUQvEC&dq=Baseball+Prospectus+2005:+Statistics,+Analysis,+and+Insight+for+the+Information+Age&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Aaaiiieee!!!","description":"?AAAIIIEEE!!! presents to the horror enthusiast twenty of the best dark fantasy tales of author Jeffrey Thomas (PUNKTOWN), culled from their original appearances in the independent press.

However, most of these views were formed by observing the movement from the outside. \\"Memoirs of an Ex-Hippie\\" offers a vastly different perspective, one developed from within. After graduating college in 1968, Robert Roskind hit the road for seven years. Roskind's travels lead him into the heart of the counterculture--to Esalen Institute, Tassajara Hot Springs, Big Sur, Vancouver Island, the communes of Oregon and North Carolina, Altamont Pop Festival, Mt. Shasta, the Haight-Ashbury and the \\"motherland\\"--Northern California. His personal odyssey, sometimes profane and funny, sometimes profound and serious, reveals this tumultuous era as a cultural and spiritual renaissance that birthed many of the solutions to problems humanity now faces.

However, they are often constrained by lack of adequate resources, sound policies, and national support. It is clear that change and advancements, both systematic and scientific, are needed in a number of forensic science disciplines to ensure the reliability of work, establish enforceable standards, and promote best practices with consistent application. Strengthening Forensic Science in the United States: A Path Forward provides a detailed plan for addressing these needs and suggests the creation of a new government entity, the National Institute of Forensic Science, to establish and enforce standards within the forensic science community. The benefits of improving and regulating the forensic science disciplines are clear: assisting law enforcement officials, enhancing homeland security, and reducing the risk of wrongful conviction and exoneration. Strengthening Forensic Science in the United States gives a full account of what is needed to advance the forensic science disciplines, including upgrading of systems and organizational structures, better training, widespread adoption of uniform and enforceable best practices, and mandatory certification and accreditation programs. While this book provides an essential call-to-action for congress and policy makers, it also serves as a vital tool for law enforcement agencies, criminal prosecutors and attorneys, and forensic science educators.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=4VH5FhgTXxoC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"You CAN Teach Online!

Keynes's theory continues to be important, because the issues it raised, such as the problems of involuntary unemployment, the volatility of investment, and the complexity of monetary arrangements in modern capitalist economies, are still with us. Keynes's method of analysis, which tries to allow for the complications of dealing with historical time, deserves the careful attention given in this book. Keynes's formal analysis dealt only with a short period of time during which changes in productive capacity as a result of net investment were small relative to initial productive capacity. Roy Harrod and Joan Robinson were the two most prominent followers of Keynes who attempted to extend his analysis to the long period by allowing for the effects of investment on productive capacity as well as on effective demand. The careful examination of their writings on this topic is a natural complement to the presentation of Keynes's General Theory and makes clear the severe limitations on any use of equilibrium concepts in dealing with accumulation in models that try to observe Keynes's warnings about an unknowable future in the type of world we inhabit.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=uEJ-rafkCnsC&dq=Keynes%27s+General+Theory+and+Accumulation+(Modern+Cambridge+Economics+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Teacher Crush (Sweet Valley High #57)","description":"Elizabeth Wakefield is surprised and worried when her friend, the pretty, talented Olivia Davidson, develops a crush on the handsome new art teacher","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=UBURwWZ7IBYC&dq=Teacher+Crush+(Sweet+Valley+High&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Spider #85 : The Council Of Evil","description":"Who was Jeffrey Epstein? A Pulitzer Prize-nominated journalist unearths never-before-reported details in the most comprehensive account yet of the disgraced financier's life, death, and criminal web, including the role of Ghislaine Maxwell. An ID Book Club Selection By now, the basic contours of Jeffrey Epstein's horrendous crimes--his decades-long serial abuse of young women and underage girls--are familiar. But for all that has been written about Epstein since his shocking death in a lower Manhattan jail cell, an astonishing amount remains unknown. A shy Brooklyn kid turned renegade financier, Jeffrey Epstein never wanted to play by the rules of polite society. He was elusive in life and he has remained just as elusive in death. What is known is that he had amassed nearly $600 million by the time of his death. That fortune allowed Epstein to pursue a privileged, secretive life, jetting between his fortress-like homes in Manhattan, New Mexico, and Little St. James, his private island. Behind these closed doors, Epstein socialized with scientists and world leaders and preyed on powerless young women.

In order to deal with uncertainty intelligently, we need to be able to represent it and reason about it. In this book, Joseph Halpern examines formal ways of representing uncertainty and considers various logics for reasoning about it. While the ideas presented are formalized in terms of definitions and theorems, the emphasis is on the philosophy of representing and reasoning about uncertainty. Halpern surveys possible formal systems for representing uncertainty, including probability measures, possibility measures, and plausibility measures; considers the updating of beliefs based on changing information and the relation to Bayes' theorem; and discusses qualitative, quantitative, and plausibilistic Bayesian networks. This second edition has been updated to reflect Halpern's recent research. New material includes a consideration of weighted probability measures and how they can be used in decision making; analyses of the Doomsday argument and the Sleeping Beauty problem; modeling games with imperfect recall using the runs-and-systems approach; a discussion of complexity-theoretic considerations; the application of first-order conditional logic to security. Reasoning about Uncertainty is accessible and relevant to researchers and students in many fields, including computer science, artificial intelligence, economics (particularly game theory), mathematics, philosophy, and statistics.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ih-QDgAAQBAJ&dq=Reasoning+about+Uncertainty&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Death of a Stranger (William Monk Series)","description":"The tragic death of a railway magnate in a sleazy brothel has shocked high society.

The book s appendix provides a review of some basic concepts and results from linear algebra, probability theory, and statistics that are used throughout the book. Topics covered include: Well-established nonparametric and parametric approaches to estimation and conventional (asymptotic and bootstrap) frameworks for statistical inference Estimation of models based on moment restrictions implied by economic theory, including various method-of-moments estimators for unconditional and conditional moment restriction models, and asymptotic theory for correctly specified and misspecified models Non-conventional asymptotic tools that lead to improved finite sample inference, such as higher-order asymptotic analysis that allows for more accurate approximations via various asymptotic expansions, and asymptotic approximations based on drifting parameter sequences Offering a unified approach to studying econometric problems, Methods for Estimation and Inference in Modern Econometrics links most of the existing estimation and inference methods in a general framework to help readers synthesize all aspects of modern econometric theory. Various theoretical exercises and suggested solutions are included to facilitate understanding.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=eYqxQoer-1sC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Does Your Tongue Need Healing?","description":"Death and life are in the power of the tongue.

On March 11, 1944, police were called to investigate foul-smelling smoke pouring from the chimney of an elegant private house near the Arc de Triomphe. In the basement of 21 rue Le Sueur, they made the first of many gruesome discoveries: a human hand dangling from the open door of a coal-burning stove. Proceeding to the rear of the home, detectives found rib cages, skulls, and internal organs strewn across the floor and large piles of quicklime mixed with fragments of bone and flesh. The Gestapo had two offices in the neighborhood were Hitler s henchmen responsible for the carnage? Or was it the work of French Resistance fighters purging Paris of traitors and German spies? As the investigation unfolded, a more sinister possibility emerged. The building s owner, Dr. Marcel Petiot, was a handsome and charismatic physician whose past was littered with bizarre behavior and criminal activity. When he was finally captured eight months later, Dr. Petiot claimed he was a loyal member of the Resistance who helped kill Nazi collaborators. Prosecutors charged that he was a sadistic mass murderer who lured at least twenty-seven innocent people to their deaths with promises of escape. Estimates of the actual number of his victims ran as high as 150 men, women, and children. From the first stages of the investigation to the sensational trial in which Dr. Petiot s superior intelligence and perverse wit were on full display, author Thomas Maeder meticulously reconstructs one of the twentieth century s most fascinating and lurid murder cases. Drawing on classified police files and interviews with surviving participants, The Unspeakable Crimes of Dr. Petiot is a riveting true crime saga that that  reads like a shocking psychological thriller  (Newsweek).","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=8mIuDAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ballad of Reading Gaol (Swc 1473)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=DRdmAAAAMAAJ&dq=Ballad+of+Reading+Gaol+(Swc+1473)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Story of Lucy Gault","description":"\\"The Story of Lucy Gault . . . once read, will never be forgotten.\\" The Washington Post Book World \\"Trevor was our twentieth century Chekov.\\" Wall Street Journal The stunning novel from highly acclaimed author William Trevor is a brilliant, subtle, and moving story of love, guilt, and forgiveness.

Shortly after her husband s death, Blackburn became fascinated with Doggerland, the stretch of land that once connected Great Britain to Continental Europe but is now subsumed by the North Sea. She was driven to explore the lives of the people who lived there studying its fossil record, as well as human artifacts that have been unearthed near the area. In Time Song, Blackburn brings us along on her journey to discover what Doggerland left behind, introducing us to the paleontologists, archaeologists, fishermen and fellow Doggerland enthusiasts she meets along the way. She sees the footprints of early humans fossilized in the soft mud of an estuary alongside the scattered pockmarks made by rain falling eight thousand years ago. She visits a cave where the remnants of a Neanderthal meal have turned to stone. In Denmark she sits beside Tollund Man, who seems to be about to wake from a dream, even though he had lain in a peat bog since the start of the Iron Age. As Doggerland begins to come into focus, what emerges is a profound meditation on time, a sense of infinity as going backward and an intimation of the immensity of everything that has already passed through its time on earth and disappeared.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=bhl5DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"In the Company of the Courtesan: A Novel","description":"My lady, Fiammetta Bianchini, was plucking her eyebrows and biting color into her lips when the unthinkable happened and the Holy Roman Emperor s army blew a hole in the wall of God s eternal city, letting in a flood of half-starved, half-crazed troops bent on pillage and punishment. Thus begins In the Company of the Courtesan, Sarah Dunant s epic novel of life in Renaissance Italy. Escaping the sack of Rome in 1527, with their stomachs churning on the jewels they have swallowed, the courtesan Fiammetta and her dwarf companion, Bucino, head for Venice, the shimmering city born out of water to become a miracle of east-west trade: rich and rancid, pious and profitable, beautiful and squalid. With a mix of courage and cunning they infiltrate Venetian society. Together they make the perfect partnership: the sharp-tongued, sharp-witted dwarf, and his vibrant mistress, trained from birth to charm, entertain, and satisfy men who have the money to support her. Yet as their fortunes rise, this perfect partnership comes under threat, from the searing passion of a lover who wants more than his allotted nights to the attentions of an admiring Turk in search of human novelties for his sultan s court.

Melvin Oliver and Thomas Shapiro's groundbreaking research analyzes wealth - total assets and debts rather than income alone - to uncover deep and persistent racial inequality in America, and they show how public policies have failed to redress the problem. First published in 1995, Black Wealth / White Wealth is considered a classic exploration of race and inequality. It provided, for the first time, systematic empirical evidence that explained the racial inequality gap between blacks and whites. The Tenth Anniversary edition contains two entirely new and substantive chapters. These chapters look at the continuing issues of wealth and inequality in America and the new policies that have been launched in the past ten years. Some have been progressive while others only recreate inequality - for example the proposal to eliminate the estate tax. Compelling and also informative, Black Wealth / White Wealth is not just pioneering research. It is also a powerful counterpoint to arguments against affirmative action and a direct challenge to current social welfare policies that are tilted towards the wealthy.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=4ksJuX02DNwC&dq=Black+Wealth/+White+Wealth:+A+New+Perspective+on+Racial+Inequality&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Asian Front: WW III","description":" Superior to Tom Clancy genre, with characters that came alive and the military aspect far more realistic.

In this first major study of contemporary Native American dance, Jacqueline Shea Murphy shows how these performances are at once diverse and connected by common influences. Demonstrating the complex relationship between Native and modern dance choreography, Shea Murphy delves first into U.S. and Canadian federal policies toward Native performance from the late nineteenth through the early twentieth centuries, revealing the ways in which government sought to curtail authentic ceremonial dancing while actually encouraging staged spectacles, such as those in Buffalo Bill s Wild West shows. She then engages the innovative work of Ted Shawn, Lester Horton, and Martha Graham, highlighting the influence of Native American dance on modern dance in the twentieth century. Shea Murphy moves on to discuss contemporary concert dance initiatives, including Canada s Aboriginal Dance Program and the American Indian Dance Theatre. Illustrating how Native dance enacts, rather than represents, cultural connections to land, ancestors, and animals, as well as spiritual and political concerns, Shea Murphy challenges stereotypes about American Indian dance and offers new ways of recognizing the agency of bodies on stage. Jacqueline Shea Murphy is associate professor of dance studies at the University of California, Riverside, and coeditor of Bodies of the Text: Dance as Theory, Literature as Dance.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Q_SlM-kJpX4C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Good Evening Everybody: From Cripple Creek to Samarkand","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=YmPFAAAACAAJ&dq=Good+Evening+Everybody:+From+Cripple+Creek+to+Samarkand&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The golden notebook","description":"Anna is a writer, author of one very successful novel, who now keeps four notebooks.

L.A.-based private detective Regan Reilly flies to Las Vegas -- the mythic city of cash and flash, glamour and kitsch -- to help an old school chum, Danny Madley. Danny is producing the pilot of a reality TV show, Love Above Sea Level. The show features three couples who all have experienced the proverbial Seven Year Itch and are now vying for the chance to renew their wedding vows and win one million dollars. But someone is trying to sabotage the show before Danny can shoot the final scene at the Albuquerque International Balloon Fiesta. Danny's show is in competition with the sitcom Take Me Higher for a coveted permanent slot on Hot Air Cable, also known as the Balloon Channel. Both shows involve hot air ballooning, and both have casts of characters who are more than capable of disrupting production of Love Above Sea Level. Regan's job is to find out who is making trouble and why. Is the culprit one of the contestants on Love Above Sea Level? Could it be the advice columnists Danny has hired -- Aunt Agony and Uncle Heartburn -- who are there to help rekindle the sparks between the husbands and wives? Is it Danny's right-hand man, Victor, a local Vegas boy Danny met while gambling? Or his cameraman Sam, who would much rather be surfing than working? Is it Bubbles Ferndale, producer of the sitcom, who is desperate to make her show the one that wins the competition? Is it Danny's ex-girlfriend, the Vegas showgirl Honey? Or her friend Lucille, a dealer in one of the casinos? Could local entrepreneur Roscoe Parker, the owner of the Balloon Channel and mastermind behind the TV competitions, be the source of all Danny's problems? There is no shortage of suspects and no shortage of mishaps. From their base in the Fuzzy Dice Hotel, a decidedly third-rate establishment, Regan tries to help Danny keep his production on an even keel. Danny's well-meaning, meddlesome parents complicate matters. Jealousy among the Love Above Sea Level contestants escalates. Mysterious, inexplicable events keep occurring. Regan is determined to keep Danny's show on schedule, and she'll do whatever it takes -- on land and in the air! Popped is a funny, fast-paced jaunt that takes readers from the fancy Vegas casinos to the run-down hotels off the Strip, from the grounds of the hot air balloon fields up into the heavens as the balloons fly over the arid Southwest. Popped is written with Clark's expert light touch and filled with the richly drawn, quirky characters so relished by her fans. As Nelson DeMille says, \\"Clark keeps her readers entranced and entertained from cover to cover.\\"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=e-JxPfJp3gAC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Alphagator Al letter book","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=_n3StwAACAAJ&dq=Alphagator+Al+letter+book&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Process Standards (Ieee Software Engineering Standards Collection)","description":"The book presents a comprehensive discussion on software quality issues and software quality assurance (SQA) principles and practices, and lays special emphasis on implementing and managing SQA.

In their diasporic exile both groups were marginalized as slaves, aliens, unbelievers, and frequently not fully human. The Identity Question: Blacks and Jews in Europe and America explores the effects of diaspora upon black and Jewish consciousness, demonstrating similar histories of marginality and oppression. Casting off the fixed social categories of an earlier age, Enlightenment thinkers argued that all men in their capacity as citizens of a secular state had the right to full civic participation and equal protection under the law. In theory, such an ideology did not recognize classes or races of men automatically excluded from citizenship. In fact, negative images of blacks and Jews continued to inform European thought and policy, providing a rationale for a thriving slave trade abroad and continued oppression of Jews at home. Thus blacks and Jews were forced to define themselves in accordance with or in opposition to European ideas about who they were. Of necessity, blacks struggled against the stereotypes of black barbarism and bestiality. Jewish intellectuals protested their alleged moral unfitness to participate in society, while proclaiming primary allegiance to their host country rather than to other Jews. Central to this examination are four key autobiographies, two from the late 1700s and two from recent history. The autobiographies of Richard Wright and Alfred Kazin, taken as prime twentieth-century American expressions of racial and ethnic identity, reveal striking similarities to their Enlightenment counterparts in Europe, the black Olaude Equiano and the Jewish Salomon Maimon. Equiano, Maimon, Kazin, and Wright all accept the ultimate desirability of Western culture. All believe in the Enlightenment promise. All were ostracized by the larger political cultures of Great Britain, Germany, and America, but each made an arduous journey from the ethnic margins of language, culture, and \\"tribal\\" loyalty to the cosmopolitan center of London, Berlin, Chicago, or New York. These modern European conceptions of black and Jewish identity, as well as the modern forms of racism that came to term in the eighteenth century, entered America whole cloth. Consequently, American intellectual and social history of the twentieth century mirrors the same movements toward acceptance and ostracism that had existed in Enlightenment Europe.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=JQSiDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Laboratory problems in civic biology","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=w34ZAAAAYAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Grand Guy: The Art and Life of Terry Southern","description":"The biography of a man considered to be an integral part of 1950s Paris, and the swinging 60s.

The Bible has always functioned authoritatively in the life of the church, but what exactly should that mean? Must it mean the Bible is without error in all historical details and ethical teachings? What should thoughtful Christians do with texts that propose God is pleased by human sacrifice or that God commanded Israel to commit acts of genocide? What about texts that contain historical errors or predictions that have gone unfulfilled long beyond their expiration dates? In The Human Faces of God, Thom Stark moves beyond notions of inerrancy in order to confront such problematic texts and open up a conversation about new ways they can be used in service of the church and its moral witness today. Readers looking for an academically informed yet accessible discussion of the Bible's thorniest texts will find a thought-provoking and indispensible resource in The Human Faces of God.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=enOWAZlzZ48C&dq=Faces+of+God&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Tarot of Prague","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=6KBwcgAACAAJ&dq=Tarot+of+Prague&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Antiques (Palisades Pure Romance)","description":"Dawn has finally met the love of ther life.

Moreover, they want clear, honest answers. The ecumenical movement in their own church has made it more important than ever for them to have this information. Written lovingly to the Roman Catholics, this book uses Scriptures to explain major differences between Catholic and Protestant beliefs. So Catholics won't think this is Protestant theology from an \\"unapproved\\" Bible, Heinze uses their own New American Bible. The reader will come face to face with the fact that the Catholic church cannot save, only faith in Jesus can. It contains such a loving, soul-winning message and invitation to trust in Christ alone, that it's a great book to give to Catholics. And it's inexpensive too! Now you can point Catholics to Christ with answers to these questions: Do you have the Mass like the Catholic Church? Where do the differences between Catholics and Protestants come from? What is the most important difference between Protestants and Catholics? Why don't Protestants venerate images? Why are Evangelical pastors permitted to marry? Do you believe in Mary?

Rosemary Verey was a great English gardening legend. Although she embraced gardening late in life, she quickly achieved international renown. She was the acknowledged apostle of the  English style,  on display at her home at Barnsley House, the  must have  adviser to the rich and famous including Prince Charles and Elton John and a wildly popular lecturer in America. Born between the two World Wars, she could have easily lived a predictable and comfortable life, but a devastating accident changed everything. Then, with her architect-husband, she went on to create the gardens at their home that became a mandatory stop on every garden tour in the 1980s and 1990s. At sixty-two, she wrote her first book, followed by seventeen more in twenty years. By force of character, hard work, and determination, she tirelessly promoted herself and her garden lessons, traveling worldwide to lecture, sell books, and spread her message. She was a natural teacher, encouraging her American fans to believe that they were fully capable of creating beautiful gardens while validating their quest for a native vernacular. She also re-introduced the English to their own gardening traditions. Drawing from garden history and its literature, she developed a language of classical formal design, embellished with her exuberant planting style. Rosemary Verey, in her life as in her work, was the very personification of the English garden style. This book is for anyone who believes a garden makes one small part of this earth a little more beautiful.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=dvTHDwAAQBAJ&dq=So+Very+Rosemary&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Confidential: Uncover Your Competitors' Top Business Secrets Legally and Quickly--and Protect Your Own","description":"A guide to espionage in the private sector explains how to effectively gather information about competitors and their products while protecting one's own valuable secrets","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=kJJtQgAACAAJ&dq=Confidential:+Uncover+Your+Competitors%27+Top+Business+Secrets+Legally+and+Quickly--and+Protect+Your+Own&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Best Awful","description":"A woman struggles to cope with a descent into psychosis and to make her way through a challenging stay in a psychiatric institution to build a new life for herself.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=iR0ArnPts5UC&dq=The+Best+Awful&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Vision: A Computational Investigation into the Human Representation and Processing of Visual Information","description":"Available again, an influential book that offers a framework for understanding visual perception and considers fundamental questions about the brain and its functions. David Marr's posthumously published Vision (1982) influenced a generation of brain and cognitive scientists, inspiring many to enter the field. In Vision, Marr describes a general framework for understanding visual perception and touches on broader questions about how the brain and its functions can be studied and understood. Researchers from a range of brain and cognitive sciences have long valued Marr's creativity, intellectual power, and ability to integrate insights and data from neuroscience, psychology, and computation. This MIT Press edition makes Marr's influential work available to a new generation of students and scientists. In Marr's framework, the process of vision constructs a set of representations, starting from a description of the input image and culminating with a description of three-dimensional objects in the surrounding environment. A central theme, and one that has had far-reaching influence in both neuroscience and cognitive science, is the notion of different levels of analysis in Marr's framework, the computational level, the algorithmic level, and the hardware implementation level. Now, thirty years later, the main problems that occupied Marr remain fundamental open problems in the study of perception. Vision provides inspiration for the continuing efforts to integrate knowledge from cognition and computation to understand vision and the brain.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Wr34DwAAQBAJ&dq=Vision:+A+Computational+Investigation+into+the+Human+Representation+and+Processing+of+Visual+Information&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Bride Of His Choice (Harlequin Presents)","description":"Bride Of His Choice by Emma Darcy released on Dec 24, 1999 is available now for purchase.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=nt7Ec4xcF5UC&dq=Bride+Of+His+Choice+(Harlequin+Presents)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Leaving Paradise: Indigenous Hawaiians in the Pacific Northwest, 1787-1898","description":"Native Hawaiians arrived in the Pacific Northwest as early as 1787. Some went out of curiosity; many others were recruited as seamen or as workers in the fur trade. By the end of the nineteenth century more than a thousand men and women had journeyed across the Pacific, but the stories of these extraordinary individuals have gone largely unrecorded in Hawaiian or Western sources. Through painstaking archival work in British Columbia, Oregon, California, and Hawaii, Jean Barman and Bruce Watson pieced together what is known about these sailors, laborers, and settlers from 1787 to 1898, the year the Hawaiian Islands were annexed to the United States. In addition, the authors include descriptive biographical entries on some eight hundred Native Hawaiians, a remarkable and invaluable complement to their narrative history. \\"Kanakas\\" (as indigenous Hawaiians were called) formed the backbone of the fur trade along with French Canadians and Scots. As the trade waned and most of their countrymen returned home, several hundred men with indigenous wives raised families and formed settlements throughout the Pacific Northwest. Today their descendants remain proud of their distinctive heritage. The resourcefulness of these pioneers in the face of harsh physical conditions and racism challenges the early Western perception that Native Hawaiians were indolent and easily exploited. Scholars and others interested in a number of fields Hawaiian history, Pacific Islander studies, Western U.S. and Western Canadian history, diaspora studies will find Leaving Paradise an indispensable work.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=W5cBEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Cascading Waterfall of Nectar","description":"Like a spontaneous cascade of wisdom nectar, the open and natural words of Thinley Norbu Rinpoche, uncomplicated by scholarly elaboration, flow here in the tradition of the direct transmissions of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas of the past.

The author explores the RMA hypothesis both theoretically and historically. The book argues that the conduct of an RMA has to be examined as a form of strategic behaviour, which means that, of necessity, it must \\"work\\" as strategy works. The great RMA debate of the 1990s is reviewed empathetically, though sceptically, by the author, with every major school of thought allowed its day in court. The author presents three historical RMAs as case studies for his argument: those arguably revealed in the wars of the French Revolution and Napoleon; in World War I; and in the nuclear age. The focus of his analysis is how these grand RMAs functioned strategically. The conclusions that he draws from these empirical exercises are then applied to help us understand what, indeed, is - and what is not - happening with the much vaunted information-technology-led RMA of today.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=RkOQAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Dollmaker's Daughters (Bo Bradley Mysteries)","description":"Fifth in the Bo Bradley series, in this psychological thriller Bo reaches out to 15-year-old Janny Malcolm, a foster child found frozen in terror at a popular Goth hangout.

It has been edited with the needs of English-speaking users in mind, whether students, teachers, business people, or casual linguists, and special care has been taken at each stage of its compilation including the selection of entry words and their equivalents, the wording of the detailed explanations of Japanese words, the choice of example sentences, and even its functional page design to maximize its usefulness. What is furigana and why is it so important? Furigana refers to the small kana that are printed above or alongside kanji to show their pronunciation. With furigana superscripts, the beginner who is familiar with hiragana and katakana is able to read even the most difficult and obscure kanji at a glance. Other dictionaries either provide little or no guide to kanji readings or romanize some or all of the Japanese words and sentences. In the past, romanized dictionaries were of some value to students using textbooks that contained no Japanese script. Now, however, an increasing number of influential curricula around the world are based on a rationale and methodology that demands the introduction of hiragana and katakana from the earliest stages. Learners and their teachers using such curricula will inevitably feel more comfortable with a dictionary such as Kodansha s Furigana Japanese Dictionary, one that shows the pronunciation of kanji with a familiar and authentic kana script. Combining Kodansha's Furigana Japanese-English Dictionary (1995) and Kodansha's Furigana English-Japanese Dictionary (1996) in one portable. affordable, and user-friendly volume, this dictionary has the following unique features: ? A basic vocabulary of 30,000 entries covers the most frequently used English and Japanese words ? Special treatment has been given to hundreds of words, names, and phrases of special relevance to English-speaking students of Japanese ?

It comes from Chad Robertson, a man many consider to be the best bread baker in the United States, and co-owner of San Francisco s Tartine Bakery. At 5 P.M., Chad Robertson s rugged, magnificent Tartine loaves are drawn from the oven. The bread at San Francisco's legendary Tartine Bakery sells out within an hour almost every day. Only a handful of bakers have learned the techniques Chad Robertson has developed: To Chad Robertson, bread is the foundation of a meal, the center of daily life, and each loaf tells the story of the baker who shaped it. Chad Robertson developed his unique bread over two decades of apprenticeship with the finest artisan bakers in France and the United States, as well as experimentation in his own ovens. Readers will be astonished at how elemental it is. Bread making the Tartine Way: Now it's your turn to make this bread with your own hands.

With millions of antiwar demonstrators glibly dismissed as a \\"focus group,\\" and with the collapse of political and intellectual dialogue into slogans and soundbites used to stifle protest-\\"Support the Troops,\\" \\"We Are the Greatest Nation on Earth,\\" etc.-many people feel cynical and hopeless. Citizens of the Empire probes into the sense of disempowerment that has resulted from the Left's inability to halt the violent and repressive course of post-9/11 U.S. policy. In this passionate and personal exploration of what it means to be a citizen of the world's most powerful, affluent and militarized nation in an era of imperial expansion, Jensen offers a potent antidote to despair over the future of democracy. In a plainspoken analysis of the dominant political rhetoric-which is intentionally crafted to depress political discourse and activism-Jensen reveals the contradictions and falsehoods of prevailing myths, using common-sense analogies that provide the reader with a clear-thinking rebuttal and a way to move forward with progressive political work and discussions. With an ethical framework that integrates political, intellectual and emotional responses to the disheartening events of the past two years, Jensen examines the ways in which society has been led to this point and offers renewed hope for constructive engagement. Robert Jensen is a professor of media law, ethics and politics at the University of Texas, Austin. He is the author of Writing Dissent: Taking Radical Ideas from the Margins to the Mainstream, among other books. He also writes for popular media, and his opinion and analytical pieces on foreign policy, politics and race have appeared in papers and magazines throughout the United States.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=a6QTW3KwCOIC&dq=Citizens+of+the+Empire:+The+Struggle+to+Claim+Our+Humanity&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"PowerLiving by Jake:: Eleven Lessons to Change Your Life","description":"Jake Steinfeld has seen a lot of big-name celebrities naked - that is, \\"stripped\\" of the trappings of fame and fortune.

But when the spirit is down, nothing else seems to make a difference-because not too much happens. Many of us today find ourselves trapped in just such organizations. The spirit in our workplace, to say nothing of our own spirit, is getting a little tattered, showing the early stages of what Harrison Owen calls \\"Soul Pollution.\\" Those in the advanced stages may find themselves plagued by exhaustion, high levels of stress, and the abuse of just about anything in sight, including spouses, substances, and fellow workers. So what is the secret to transforming organizations? The answer, says Owen, is simple: we must consciously be what we already are-natural, open, self-organizing systems. In The Power of Spirit, Owen examines the world of Spirit/Consciousness in organizations and offers help to those who find themselves dreading another day on the job in an organization seemingly bent on its own destruction, as well as the destruction of its members. He draws from what we are now learning about self-organizing systems to provides a practical application to the world of organizations, revealing the ways in which Spirit shows up in new, emergent organizational forms. Widely known for his Open Space Technology-a broadly used meeting management tool-Owen now pushes well beyond that surface appreciation and suggests deeper applications and implications, showing how what has been experienced in a typical \\"great meeting\\" with Open Space can actually be a 365-day-a-year reality. For all those interested in Spirit and spirituality, particularly in the workplace, individuals who are feeling down and out and buried by Soul Pollution in the workplace, and for current practitioners of Open Space Technology who are wondering what comes after a \\"great meeting\\"-The Power of Spirit will offer a pathway to positive transformation.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=rmH8D7xkdd8C&dq=The+Power+of+Spirit:+How+Organizations+Transform&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cape Hatteras Lighthouse: Sentinel of the Shoals","description":"Since 1871 the Cape Hatteras lighthouse has been a welcome sight for sailors entering the treacherous region off North Carolina's Outer Banks known as the Graveyard of the Atlantic. At 208 feet high, it is the tallest lighthouse in the country and one of the state's most famous landmarks. Through the years, it has withstood the ravages of both humans and nature, weathering numerous violent storms and two wars. But perhaps the gravest threat the structure faced in recent history was the erosion of several hundred yards of beach that once stood between it and the ocean. As powerful tides and rising sea levels increasingly endangered the lighthouse's future, North Carolinians debated fiercely over how best to save it, eventually deciding on a controversial plan to move the beacon inland to safety. First published by UNC Press in 1991, this book tells the story of the noble lighthouse from its earliest history to the present day. In this new edition, Dawson Carr details the recent relocation of the treasured landmark. For now, it seems, North Carolinians have succeeded in protecting their lighthouse, as it has protected them for over a century.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=eDM6RKjHlZgC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Up from the Mines","description":"Despite mining's multidimensional role in the history of Utah since Euro-american settlement, there has never been a book that surveyed and contextualized its impact.

Although television networks are still state-owned and Party-controlled in China, the ideological landscape of television programs has become increasingly diverse and even paradoxical, simultaneously subservient and defiant, nationalistic and cosmopolitan, moralistic and fun-loving, extravagant and mundane. Studying Chinese television as a key node in the network of power relationships, therefore, provides us with a unique opportunity to understand the tension-fraught and , paradox-permeated conditions of Chinese post-socialism. This book argues for a serious engagement with television entertainment. rethinking, It addresses the following questions. How is entertainment television politically and culturally significant in the Chinese context? How have political, industrial, and technological changes in the 2000s affected the way Chinese television relates to the state and society? How can we think of media regulation and censorship without perpetuating the myth of a self-serving authoritarian regime vs. a subdued cultural workforce? What do popular televisual texts tell us about the unsettled and reconfigured relations between commercial television and the state? The book presents a number of studies of popular television programs that are sensitive to the changing production and regulatory contexts for Chinese television in the twenty-first century. As an interdisciplinary study of the television industry, this book covers a number of important issues in China today, such as censorship, nationalism, consumerism, social justice, and the central and local authorities. As such, it will appeal to a broad audience including students and scholars of Chinese culture and society, media studies, television studies, and cultural studies.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=iEWDBAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Influence of Arabic Language on Kiswahili, With a Trilingual Dictionary (Swahili-Arabic-English (Multilingual Edition)","description":"This book is critically important for Bible translation theorists, postcolonial scholars, church leaders, and the general public interested in the history, politics, and nature of Bible translation work in Africa.

If there were two men who were absolutely central to artistic life in France in the second half of the nineteenth century, they were Edouard Manet and Ernest Meissonier. While the former has been labelled the  Father of Impressionism  and is today a household name, the latter has sunk into obscurity. It is difficult now to believe that in 1864, when this story begins, it was Meissonier who was considered the greatest French artist alive and who received astronomical sums for his work, while Manet was derided for his messy paintings of ordinary people and had great difficulty getting any of his work accepted at the all-important annual Paris Salon. Manet and Meissonier were the Mozart and Salieri of their day, one a dangerous challenge to the establishment, the other beloved by rulers and the public alike for his painstakingly meticulous oil paintings of historical subjects. Out of the fascinating story of their parallel careers, Ross King creates a lens through which to view the political tensions that dogged Louis-Napoleon during the Second Empire, his ignominious downfall, and the bloody Paris Commune of 1871. At the same time, King paints a wonderfully detailed and vivid portrait of life in an era of radical social change: on the streets of Paris, at the new seaside resorts of Boulogne and Trouville, and at the race courses and picnic spots where the new bourgeoisie relaxed. When Manet painted Dejeuner sur l herbe or Olympia, he shocked not only with his casual brushstrokes (described by some as applied by a  floor mop  ) but with his subject matter: top-hatted white-collar workers (and their mistresses) were not considered suitable subjects for  Art . Ross King shows how, benign as they might seem today, these paintings changed the course of history. The struggle between Meissonier and Manet to see their paintings achieve pride of place at the Salon was not just about artistic competitiveness, it was about how to see the world. Full of fantastic tidbits of information (such as the use of carrier pigeons and hot-air balloons during the siege of Paris), and a colourful cast of characters that includes Baudelaire, Courbet, and Zola, with walk-on parts for Monet, Renoir, Degas, and Cezanne, The Judgment of Paris casts new light on the birth of Impressionism and takes us to the heart of a time in which the modern French identity was being forged.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ZKPCw8NWdg0C&dq=The+Judgment+of+Paris:+Manet,+Meissonier+and+the+Birth+of+Impressionism&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Training Your Boxer (Training Your Dog Series)","description":"\\"An informative and fully illustrated manual that covers all aspects of training for your pet Boxer\\"--","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=2juXuAAACAAJ&dq=Training+Your+Boxer+(Training+Your+Dog+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Beyond Surrender","description":"Over the twentieth century 35,000 Australians suffered as prisoners of war in conflicts ranging from World War I to Korea.

The book's chief character is the author's great aunt, Marianna, who became the mistress of a wealthy noble. The lifestyle she adopted repeatedly shamed her relatives until living in Italy became unbearable for them. Eventually, the author's father, Raffaele, fled his beloved Italy in the face of constant shame, and settled in the U.S. His son, author Peter Chiarella, grew up in the Bedford Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn. There he heard the stories about life in Calabria from his grandmother, a principal character in the book. After her death, the stories kept coming, both from his father, also a character in Calabrian Tales, and from his mother, who had listened in on Nonna's recollections over a period of fifteen years. The stories of people who lived in what may have been Italy's poorest region, blend with the historical struggles of the times in a combination reminiscent of certain aspects of The Godfather and the ignoble humanity of Angela's Ashes. \\"Twenty-two unforgettable personalities interplay in this picaresque page turner.

Good fiction uses martial arts well, while poor writing skills can be plain boring! This anthology is a collection of fifteen articles that cover the richness and depth of Asian martial arts in both movies and literature. After look over the array of topics, I decided to utilize writings by James Grady for the two introductory chapters. Grady is an internationally renowned writer and investigative journalist known for his nail-biting thriller novels. His early novel was adapted to film as Three days of the Condor (1975) starring Robert Redford. Grady has since written over a dozen wonderful novels and in between wrote two excellent pieces for the Journal of Asian Martial Arts: one dealing with movies and another with literature. The following chapters are greatly enriched by the informative contents in Grady s chapters. Details about movie-making are provided in the interview with producer Andre Morgan (Enter the Dragon, Walter Texas Ranger, Martial Law, etc.), plus the inside scoop in the publishing and film industries in the interview with multifaceted Curtis Wong. Actor/producer/kickboxing champion Don Wilson provides insights from both sides of the camera in his interview. Among the chapters are Albert Dalia s exposition of China s  wandering martial hero  stories that have roots reaching back two thousand years; Christopher Bates  excerpt from Xiang Kairan s Tales of Chivalrous and Altruistic Heroes; and Olivia Mok s research and translations of sections of Fox Volant of the Snowy Mountain, a Louis Cha s novel of 1959. In the latter, Mok extricates references to dianxue the methods of attacking vital points. We also have fiction focusing on Japanese and Chinese martial traditions by John Donohue, Peter Graebner, John DeRose, and John Gilbey s (aka, Robert W. Smith) each highlighting combative experience, theory and technique with cultural trimmings. Interviews with Barry Eisler and Author Rosenfeld give insight into scholar/practitioners whose published novels contain text colored by their knowledge of the martial arts and culture.

Even strong Christians maintain a diverse collection of opinions about the Ten Commandments--a miracle cure-all, a holy obligation, laws irrelevant in an age of grace, and many more. No matter how they are viewed, these deceptively simple words are packed with meaning and hold a power and significance many Christians have lost sight of. Written Upon the Heart reveals the necessity of God's Law for contemporary believers by studying the historical purpose, meaning, and modern relevance of the Commandments. Presented with rich background and compelling humor, Written upon the Heart shows that the words of God should not just be read or simply commited to memory, but written upon the heart of every believer. \\"I will put my law in their minds and write it on their hearts. I will be their God, and they will be my people.\\" --Jeremiah 31:33","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=hkD7DwAAQBAJ&dq=Written+upon+the+Heart:+The+Ten+Commandments+for+Today%27s+Christian&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Real Prophecy Unveiled: Why the Christ Will Not Come Again, And Why the Religious Right is Wrong","description":"Religious hypocrites wage \\"holy war\\" while the faithful wait, expecting a Messiah / Christ / Buddha / Avatar / Imam Mahdi to come. Meanwhile, however, prophecy is being fulfilled in a way they did not expect. As Jesus foretold, the present-day messenger of God was first rejected by his generation, but will now finally guide you unto all truth and show you things to come. As John wrote, he is of your brethren and has the testimony of Jesus. As Isaiah wrote, he will deliver judgment, but unlike Jesus he will not make his voice heard in public. It is his pen that will finally prove mightier than the sword, because the weapons of his warfare are not carnal but mighty through God for dealing with the forces of hate, greed, hypocrisy, intolerance, and injustice. Here, finally, is a voice with real authority, telling the truth that will expose the ignorance and hypocrisy of the \\"fundamentalist Religious Right,\\" make the greedy rich ashamed, bring low the proud and militant, and enable the humble and meek to inherit the earth. A New Reformation will enable all religions to serve their true purpose, and enable all governments to finally be of, for, and by the people. Then, rather than be divided by rivalry for the throne, we will all share the throne as equal joint heirs to God's New Kingdom, which shall be set up on the earth and last forever, never to be destroyed. That is what real prophecy foretells, and thus it shall be.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=85Uxwx4nyAsC&dq=Real+Prophecy+Unveiled:+Why+the+Christ+Will+Not+Come+Again,+And+Why+the+Religious+Right+is+Wrong&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Can you believe your eyes?: Over 250 illusions and other visual oddities","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=dkdAJzZL56gC&dq=Can+you+believe+your+eyes%3F:+Over+250+illusions+and+other+visual+oddities&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Pancho Villa: Mexican Revolutionary Hero (Proud Heritage: The Hispanic Library)","description":"A biography of the turn-of-the-century Mexican outlaw who helped overthrow the Diaz government in the Revolution of 1910.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=y8eQjFs6LAIC&dq=Pancho+Villa:+Mexican+Revolutionary+Hero+(Proud+Heritage:+The+Hispanic+Library)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Martha Matilda O'Toole","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Xg8OjwEACAAJ&dq=Martha+Matilda+O%27Toole&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Treehouses in Paradise: Fantasy Designs for the 21st Century","description":"Introduces the top designs from an international competition in which architects were asked to create innovative, environmentally sound treehouse designs that could be used as hotels in resorts in Hawaii, China, Vietnam, and Fiji, in a study that includes floor plans, elevation plans, computer renderings, scale models, and descriptive essays by the architects.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=MzA5AQAAIAAJ&dq=Treehouses+in+Paradise:+Fantasy+Designs+for+the+21st+Century&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Icelandic saga (A Bison book)","description":"In this stimulating and reliable introduction to the Icelandic saga, Peter Hallberg correctly designates the genre as \\"Scandinavia's sole, collective original contribution to world literature.\\" These prose narratives dating from the thirteenth century are characterized by a psychological realism which sets them apart from all other contemporary forms of European literature. Mr. Hallberg's emphasis is on the branch of saga literature which deals with the native heroes--with the settlement of Iceland by Norse chieftains and with the lives of these settlers and their descendants. After disposing of the controversial \\"free-prose\\" theory of the origin and transmission of these stories, the author treats such problems as style and character portrayal, dreams and destinies, values and ideals, humor and irony. Several of the major sagas are studied in some detail. The concluding discussion concerns the decline of saga writing and the role played by the Sagas in modern Scandinavian life and literature. Paul Schach's introduction and copious annotation furnish additional background material and bibliographical references to English translations of the individual sagas and to significant studies on the major problems of saga research. Although intended primarily for the layman, The Icelandic Saga is of value to the specialist since it judiciously evaluates and incorporates the revolutionary findings of the so-called \\"Icelandic school\\" of saga study.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=sq0Ku9yBDJwC&dq=The+Icelandic+saga+(A+Bison+book)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mad Love","description":"Mad Love has been acknowledged an undisputed classic of the surrealist movement since its first publication in France in 1937.

Christine Jerome walked into the Adirondack Museum in Blue Mountain Lake, NY, and promptly fell in love with a 9-foot, 10?-pound canoe named the Sairy Gamp. More than a century before, in 1883, the Sairy Gamp had been paddled and portaged through the Adirondacks by a sixty-one-year-old writer named George Washington Sears (his pen name was Nessmuk). The more Jerome learned about Sears, the more she wanted to follow his route, despite her lack of camping or canoeing experience. In August 1990 she embarked in a 9-foot canoe made of Kevlar and, with her husband, John, accompanying her in a slightly larger boat, set off to retrace Sears s journey. An Adirondack Passage is part social history, part natural history, part biography of Sears, and part chronicle of a voyage. Summer turns to fall while the Jeromes make their way north, through sunshine and storms, down cottage-lined lakes and lonely wild streams. Gusting winds bully their light canoes and by mid-September the days are colder and shorter; but the longer they paddle, the more attached they become to the beauty around them. Canada geese fly overhead, monarch butterflies flutter southward, and on the larger lakes, young loons gather for their first migration to the sea. Along the way the author pauses to tell us what Sears saw when he passed by, and what happened to his favorite haunts in the ensuing century. As the history of the region unfolds we meet hermits and millionaires, hunting guides and society women, hotelkeepers and dime-novel writers, and one lost dancing bear. Christine Jerome has given us a memorable wilderness experience that readers who have never lifted a paddle will find fascinating and invigorating. This new release from Breakaway Books is the third edition, revised and updated with extra photos, maps, and a new afterword. PRAISE FOR AN ADIRONDACK PASSAGE  A fine piece of work and a great delight.    John McPhee  An enchanting record of a canoe trip.   The New Yorker  A writer of fine and watertight prose. . . . An Adirondack Passage is uncategorizable at once history, naturalism, sociology, and a love story but unfailingly graceful.   Boston Globe  Personal, witty, and thoughtful one of the best introductions to the area ever produced.   Audubon  As refreshing a break from the busyness of life as I ve come across in awhile.   Newsday  The writing . . . is a constant pleasure. Jerome has a style that suits her subject, quiet and gentle as a paddle in still water. She delivers her lore with wit and whimsy, with fine descriptions and without shrill preaching or righteous posturing.   Smithsonian  The closest thing to a national nonfiction best-seller that the region has seen in ages, and deservedly so.   Adirondack Life  A captivating account. . . .

That is, they must meet an industrial society's need for qualified new generations and at the same time be concerned with the expanded reproduction of education itself. In addition, universities must not only transmit technically exploitable knowledge, but also produce it. This includes both information flowing from research into the channels of industrial utilization, armament, and social welfare, and advisory knowledge that enters into strategies of administration, government, and other decision-making powers, such as private enterprises. Thus, through instruction and research the university is immediately connected with functions of the economic process.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=kLjlBQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"American Heretic: Theodore Parker and Transcendentalism","description":"Theodore Parker (1810-1860) was a powerful preacher who rejected the authority of the Bible and of Jesus, a brilliant scholar who became a popular agitator for the abolition of slavery and for women's rights, and a political theorist who defined democracy as \\"government of all the people, by all the people, for all the people--words that inspired Abraham Lincoln. Parker had more influence than anyone except Ralph Waldo Emerson in shaping Transcendentalism in America. In American Heretic, Dean Grodzins offers a compelling account of the remarkable first phase of Parker's career, when this complex man--charismatic yet awkward, brave yet insecure--rose from poverty and obscurity to fame and notoriety as a Transcendentalist prophet. Grodzins reveals hitherto hidden facets of Parker's life, including his love for a woman who was not his wife, and presents fresh perspectives on Transcendentalism. Grodzins explores Transcendentalism's religious roots, shows the profound religious and political issues at stake in the \\"Transcendentalist controversy,\\" and offers new insights into Parker's Transcendentalist colleagues, including Emerson, Margaret Fuller, and Bronson Alcott. He traces, too, the intellectual origins of Parker's epochal definition of democracy as government of, by, and for the people.

While the nearby village of Finch continues with its seasonal preparations, including rehearsals for the Christmas Eve Nativity play, Lori puts her plans on hold and teams up with Julian Bright--a devilishly attractive Roman Catholic priest--to search out the stranger's identity.

(A Saltire how/2 book)","description":"Scots like to smoke or salt them. The Dutch love them raw. Swedes look on with relish as they open bulging, foul-smelling cans to find them curdling within. Jamaicans prefer them with a dash of chilli pepper. Germans and the English enjoy their taste best when accompanied by pickle's bite and brine. Throughout the long centuries men have fished around their coastlines and beyond, the herring has done much to shape both human taste and history. Men have co-operated and come into conflict over its shoals, setting out in boats to catch them, straying, too, from their home ports to bring full nets to shore. Women have also often been at the centre of the industry, gutting and salting the catch when the annual harvest had taken place, knitting, too, the garments fishermen wore to protect them from the ocean's chill. Following a journey from the western edge of Norway to the east of England, from Shetland and the Outer Hebrides to the fishing ports of the Baltic coast of Germany and the Netherlands, culminating in a visit to Iceland's Herring Era Museum, Donald S. Murray has stitched together tales of the fish that was of central importance to the lives of our ancestors, noting how both it - and those involved in their capture - were celebrated in the art, literature, craft, music and folklore of life in northern Europe. Blending together politics, science, history, religious and commercial life, Donald contemplates, too, the possibility of restoring the silver darlings of legend to these shores.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=9gJiCgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Lily: A Love Story","description":"In McDade, Texas, in 1883, spirited and proper Lily DeLony falls into an improbable love with rebellious outlaw Marion \\"Shot\\" Beatty, the youngest of the infamous Beatty brothers.

This textbook is an excellent resource that allows students from any engineering background to quickly understand the foundations and exciting advances of the field. The example problems with answers and the long list of references in each chapter are a big plus for course tutors. The book is organized into seven sections. The first, nanoscale fabrication and characterization, covers nanolithography, self-assembly, and scanning probe microscopy. Of these, we enjoyed the section on nanolithography most, as it includes many interesting details from industrial manufacturing processes. The chapter on self-assembly also provides an excellent overview by introducing six types of intermolecular interactions and the ways these can be employed to fabricate nanostructures. The second section covers nanomaterials and nanostructures. Out of its 110 pages, 45 are devoted to carbon nanotubes. Fullerenes and quantum dots each have their own chapter that focuses on the properties and applications of these nanostructures. Nanolayer, nanowire, and nanoparticle composites of metals and semiconductors are briefly covered (just 12 pages), with slightly more discussion of specific applications. The section on nanoscale electronics begins with a history of microelectronics before discussing the difficulties in shrinking transistor size further. The discussion of problems (leakage current, hot electrons, doping fluctuations, etc.) and possible solutions (high- k dielectrics, double-gate devices) could easily motivate deeper discussions of nanoscale electrical transport. A chapter on molecular electronics considers transport through alkanes, molecular transistors, and DNA in a simple, qualitative manner we found highly instructive. Nanoscale magnetic systems are examined in the fourth section. The concept of quantum computation is nicely presented, although the discussion of how this can be achieved with controlled spin states is (perhaps necessarily) not clear. We found the chapter on magnetic storage to be one of the most lucid in the book. The giant magnetoresistive effect, operation of spin valves, and issues in magnetic scaling are easier to understand when placed in the context of the modern magnetic hard disk drive. Micro- and nanoelectromechanical systems are covered with an emphasis on the integration of sensing, computation, and communication. Here, the student can see advanced applications of lithography. The sixth section, nanoscale optoelectronics, describes quantum dots, organic optoelectronics, and photonic crystals. The chapter on organic optoelectronics is especially clear in its discussion of the fundamentals of this complicated field. The book concludes with an overview of nanobiotechnology that covers biomimetics, biomolecular motors, and nanofluidics. Because so many authors have contributed to this textbook, it suffers a bit from repetition. However, this also allows sections to be omitted without any adverse effect on student comprehension. We would have liked to see more technology to balance the science; apart from the chapters on lithography and magnetic storage, little more than an acknowledgment is given to commercial applications. Overall, this book serves as an excellent starting point for the study of nanoscale science and technology, and we recommend it to anyone with a modest scientific background. It is also a great vehicle to motivate the study of science at a time when interest is waning. Nanotechnology educators should look no further.\\" (MATERIALS TODAY, June 2005)","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=EnnkBwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Fatal Knot: The Guerrilla War in Navarre and the Defeat of Napoleon in Spain","description":"John Tone recounts the dramatic story of how, between 1808 and 1814, Spanish peasants created and sustained the world's first guerrilla insurgency movement, thereby playing a major role in Napoleon's defeat in the Peninsula War. Focusing on the army of Francisco Mina, Tone offers new insights into the origins, motives, and successes of these first guerrilla forces by interpreting the conflict from the long-ignored perspective of the guerrillas themselves. Only months after Napoleon's invasion in 1807, Spain seemed ready to fall: its rulers were in prison or in exile, its armies were in complete disarray, and Madrid had been occupied. However, the Spanish people themselves, particularly the peasants of Navarre, proved unexpectedly resilient. In response to impending defeat, they formed makeshift governing juntas, raised new armies, and initiated a new kind of people's war of national liberation that came to be known as guerrilla warfare. Key to the peasants' success, says Tone, was the fact that they possessed both the material means and the motives to resist. The guerrillas were neither bandits nor selfless patriots but landowning peasants who fought to protect the old regime in Navarre and their established position within it. from the book: \\"That unfortunate war destroyed me; it divided my forces, multiplied my obligations, undermined my morale. . . .

In a healthy body, movement, feeling, and thinking are integrated in grace and harmony. This book includes body-psychotherapy techniques and exercises aimed at alleviating muscular tension and restoring the body's natural grace.

In the past fifty years, Asian Americans have helped change the face of America and are now the fastest growing group in the United States. But as award-winning historian Erika Lee reminds us, Asian Americans also have deep roots in the country. The Making of Asian America tells the little-known history of Asian Americans and their role in American life, from the arrival of the first Asians in the Americas to the present-day. An epic history of global journeys and new beginnings, this book shows how generations of Asian immigrants and their American-born descendants have made and remade Asian American life in the United States: sailors who came on the first trans-Pacific ships in the 1500s; indentured  coolies  who worked alongside African slaves in the Caribbean; and Chinese, Japanese, Filipino, Korean, and South Asian immigrants who were recruited to work in the United States only to face massive racial discrimination, Asian exclusion laws, and for Japanese Americans, incarceration during World War II. Over the past fifty years, a new Asian America has emerged out of community activism and the arrival of new immigrants and refugees. No longer a  despised minority,  Asian Americans are now held up as America s  model minorities  in ways that reveal the complicated role that race still plays in the United States. Published to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the passage of the United States  Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 that has remade our  nation of immigrants,  this is a new and definitive history of Asian Americans. But more than that, it is a new way of understanding America itself, its complicated histories of race and immigration, and its place in the world today.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=7PpwCgAAQBAJ&dq=Asian+America&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Color of Darkness: Eleven Stories and a Novella (Keystone short stories, Keystone books)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ioO0wgEACAAJ&dq=Color+of+Darkness:+Eleven+Stories+and+a+Novella+(Keystone+short+stories,+Keystone+books)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"At The Corner Of Love And Heartache","description":"Life is just about as good as it gets in Valentine, Oklahoma .

The first edition of his acclaimed book Scooter Boys, highlighting youth culture spanning half a century, was first published when Margaret Thatcher s reign as the Eighties Iron Lady was drawing to a close. Now, three decades on, Brown s book is back to enlighten and entertain a new generation  and rekindle memories for those who were scooter boys and girls back in the day. His informed knowledge of the initial Scooter Boy era has resulted in the 30th Anniversary Edition of Scooter Boys being refreshingly updated and published by Mortons, the home of Scootering and Classic Scooterist magazines. Brown has been a  face  on the scooter scene since the 1970s, when he was legally able to ride a motor scooter on the road, and scooter ownership and riding scooters has been a passion ever since. He rose to prominence in the 1980s as the scooter rally correspondent and later editor of Scootering magazine, which led to his book  a unique take on the Scooter Boy movement, history, traditions and culture. Scooter Boys charts the development of the early scooters and the post-Second World War arrival of the Italian scooters from Vespa and Lambretta, followed by the chronicling of the rise of 1950s teenage consumerism which led to the Mod versus Rocker riots of the 1960s. It outlines the intervening years before the massed Mod revival of 1979 onwards, when the Northern Soul scene kept the scooter movement alive, and traces the emergence of the unsung street heroes of the late 20th century and beyond.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Hr3cDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Sympathetic Understanding of the Child: Birth to Sixteen","description":"Dr. Elkind's examination of the child over small periods of time reveals patterns of growth and development of children.

In the world of crime, Mickey Cohen knew everyone--from underworld bosses to punks, from operator-enforcers to B-girls. A personal friend of professional gigolo Johnny Stompanato, Mickey had an association with Jack Ruby and acted as bodyguard for Bugsy Siegel. He did the bidding for Mafiosi bigwigs, including Meyer Lansky, Sam Giancana, Carlo Gambino, Vito Genovese, Frank Costello, and Lucky Luciano.

It was a period that saw in England the formation of a national government, the only genuine incidence of three-party politics, the fruition of campaigns for trades union recognition, women's suffrage, and Irish independence, and abroad withdrawal from the Gold Standard and involvement in collective security. Written in Taylor's customary provocative style, this is historical writing at its best. - ;This book begins on 4 August 1914, the day Britain entered the 'Great War', and describes the three decades of unparalleled upheaval and change up to the defeat of Japan in 1945, which marked the end of the Second World War. Twin themes of international conflict and mass unemployment in England predominate - besides giving a full account of foreign and domestic politics which were elaborated to deal with them, Taylor also pays particular attention to the impact of events on everyday lives. This book is an essential work from one of the finest historians of the twentieth century, which no one interested in the affairs of the UK will want to be without. -","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=KL5IMdG8rDEC&dq=English+history,+1914-1945+(The+Oxford+history+of+England)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Until the Stars Appear: From the Hills of Middle America, the Enduring Power of Prayer Moves Mountains in Southern Africa","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=AV3ljkkzVdIC&dq=Until+the+Stars+Appear:+From+the+Hills+of+Middle+America,+the+Enduring+Power+of+Prayer+Moves+Mountains+in+Southern+Africa&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"James Dean","description":"This is the book that restarted the James Dean cult by celebrating him as the cool, defiant visionary of pop culture who made adolescence seem heroic instead of awkward and who defined the style of rock 'n' roll's politics of delinquency.

It could happen to you. When Sandy Jones and her teenage son were accused of murdering a real estate developer on their hardscrabble Oregon farm, the prosecution had an eyewitness to the shooting and a photograph of Sandy holding a smoking rifle. County officials kept Sandy in jail while they awaited the trial, despite ballistic evidence that strongly suggested she hadn't fired the fatal shot. The case erupted into an epic struggle between Sandy -- who was poor, different, and a woman -- and the \\"good old boys\\" of Lincoln County, Oregon, who held all the power. Though the Joneses' guilt seemed eminently clear to the county and the prosecution, Gerry Spence, renowned for his work on the cases of Karen Silkwood and Randy Weaver at Ruby Ridge, took the case pro bono and the courtroom battle exploded into three years of intensely moving jury trials, recounted here from the record of the case. The Smoking Gun follows Gerry Spence through his passionate arguments with two different judges and two different prosecutorial teams, his exacting jury selection, his expert questioning of the witnesses, and his incredible rapport with the jury as he fights for the rights of Sandy and her son. With a superb sense of drama and an intimate knowledge of the court system, Spence highlights the pitfalls that every defendant faces, making The Smoking Gun extremely relevant today, when our rights are being eroded and when the average American, even if innocent, is hard-pressed to obtain a fair trial.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=TAzYITa0xqAC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Backgrounds and Borders (Weekend Decorator)","description":"Explains how to use decorative finishes, stencils, raised borders, and faux frescos to create painted backgrounds that accent other decorating details","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=7kuHiUQzjlcC&dq=Backgrounds+and+Borders+(Weekend+Decorator)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"How to Keep Kosher: A Comprehensive Guide to Understanding Jewish Dietary Laws","description":"\\"Traditional Judaism injects sanctification into the ordinary habits of everyday life.Keeping kosher helps us pause and think about what we eat, and how we eat it, and elevates the act of eating.\\" What does it mean to keep kosher? Many may be familiar with the basics: no bacon, no shrimp, no cheeseburgers. But the Jewish dietary laws go deeper than that, and How to Keep Kosher explores the ins and outs. Why are some foods deemed kosher while others are not? Why can't you mix meat and dairy dishes? How do you turn a nonkosher kitchen into a kosher one? Do you really need multiple sets of everything -- dishes, pots, pans, and utensils? How do you keep track of what's what? Whether you are thinking about adopting a kosher lifestyle or already have a kosher home and just want tounderstand what it is all about, Lis? Stern's How to Keep Kosher is essential reading. You will learn about the biblicaland historical origins of keeping kosher, the development of the kosher certification system, specific food preparation requirements for Shabbat, Passover, and otherholidays, and how to actually set up a kosher kitchen. In straightforward language, drawing upon explanations from the Torah and Talmud, along with interviews with rabbis, academics, and laypeople who keep kosher, Lis? explores all aspects of Judaism's ancient dietary traditions as they are carried out in today's kitchen, with its range of modern appliances -- dishwashers, food processors, and microwave ovens. For the first time, one book explains both Conservative and Orthodox perspectives on kashrut, as well as opinions from other Jewish affiliations. When Lis? was nine, her parents decided to make the change -- transform their home to a kosher one -- as a core part of their evolving commitment to Judaism. Because Lis? experienced the transition as a child and keeps a kosher home today, she is uniquely qualified to explain all aspects of this traditional practice. Setting up a kosher kitchen lays the foundation for implementing the tradition; the proof is in the potato pudding. As Lis? notes, the Talmud says, \\"Room can always be found in one's stomach for sweet things,\\" and the wealth of information is sweetened with more than forty recipes for Shabbat dinners and lunches as well as holiday and festival celebrations. Traditional recipes include Chicken Soup with My Mother's Ethereal Matzo Balls, Sliced PotatoOnion Kugel, and Hamantashen; new classics are Chilled CucumberYogurt Soup, Rosemary Sweet Potato Kugel, Enchilada Lasagna, and Chocolate-Flecked Meringues. Stern's How to Keep Kosher is an inclusive, user-friendly handbook filled with answers to the fundamental who, what, where, when, why, and how questions surrounding the Jewish dietary laws -- making these laws both accessible and appealing.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Ae7G3Lnylx4C&dq=How+to+Keep+Kosher:+A+Comprehensive+Guide+to+Understanding+Jewish+Dietary+Laws&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Sackett Companion","description":"An index of the characters in the Louis L'Amour novels.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=TMah8-h4NtAC&dq=The+Sackett+Companion&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The art of Tantra (The world of art)","description":"Shares tantric secrets for deepening relationships, intimacy, and passion, and discusses harmony, communication, and healing","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=tC0xngEACAAJ&dq=The+art+of+Tantra+(The+world+of+art)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Quentin Durward (Waverley novels)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=_E36wgEACAAJ&dq=Quentin+Durward+(Waverley+novels)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Home Is Where You Build Your Nest!: Living in Cleveland, Ohio","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=-zTjPAAACAAJ&dq=Home+Is+Where+You+Build+Your+Nest!:+Living+in+Cleveland,+Ohio&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Jimi Hendrix - Smash Hits Songbook (includes Guitar TAB) (Guitar Recorded Versions)","description":"(Guitar Recorded Versions).

King's novels...are in another solar system entirely.\\"--Bookpage, starred review The Shoveler, the Freak, CanIHelpYou?, Loretta the Flea-Circus Ring Mistress, and First-Class Malcolm. These are the five teenagers lost in the Hemmings family's maze of tangled secrets. Only a generation removed from being Pennsylvania potato farmers, Gottfried and Marla Hemmings managed to trade digging spuds for developing subdivisions and now sit atop a seven-figure bank account--wealth they've declined to pass on to their adult children or their teenage grandchildren. \\"Because we want them to thrive,\\" Marla always says. What does thriving look like? Like carrying a snow shovel everywhere. Like selling pot at the Arby's drive-thru window. Like a first-class ticket to Jamaica between cancer treatments. Like a flea-circus in a double-wide. Like the GPS coordinates to a mound of dirt in a New Jersey forest. As the rot just beneath the surface of the Hemmings' precious suburban respectability begins to spread, the far-flung grandchildren gradually find their ways back to one another, just in time to uncover the terrible cost of maintaining the family name.

While soldiers slaughtered each other over the country's fate, players and fans struggled over the form of the national pastime. George Kirsch gives us a color commentary of the growth and transformation of baseball during the Civil War. He shows that the game was a vital part of the lives of many a soldier and civilian--and that baseball's popularity had everything to do with surging American nationalism. By 1860, baseball was poised to emerge as the American sport. Clubs in northeastern and a few southern cities played various forms of the game. Newspapers published statistics, and governing bodies set rules. But the Civil War years proved crucial in securing the game's place in the American heart. Soldiers with bats in their rucksacks spread baseball to training camps, war prisons, and even front lines. As nationalist fervor heightened, baseball became patriotic. Fans honored it with the title of national pastime. War metaphors were commonplace in sports reporting, and charity games were scheduled. Decades later, Union general Abner Doubleday would be credited (wrongly) with baseball's invention. The Civil War period also saw key developments in the sport itself, including the spread of the New York-style of play, the advent of revised pitching rules, and the growth of commercialism. Kirsch recounts vivid stories of great players and describes soldiers playing ball to relieve boredom. He introduces entrepreneurs who preached the gospel of baseball, boosted female attendance, and found new ways to make money. We witness bitterly contested championships that enthralled whole cities. We watch African Americans embracing baseball despite official exclusion. And we see legends spring from the pens of early sportswriters. Rich with anecdotes and surprising facts, this narrative of baseball's coming-of-age reveals the remarkable extent to which America's national pastime is bound up with the country's defining event.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=xTcDAQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Vanishing Act","description":" A challenging and satisfying thriller . . .

This is the life of Charlotte Anne Byers, told by Elizabeth Crane, whose debut, When the Messenger Is Hot, has been praised across the country for its humor and grace. From the time she moved to New York as a young girl, desperate to tame her ridiculed southern accent, Charlotte Anne Byers has struggled to fit in-even while her strong will makes her clash with everything and everyone around her. With her mother pursuing a career as an opera singer and her father returning to Iowa, Charlotte is caught in the divide between her parents' dreams. She finds a touchstone in Jenna, a friend who will be by Charlotte's side through the death of her mother, several failed career moves, even more failed romances, a detour into alcoholism, and finding true love. In her lifetime Charlotte finds hope and disappointment mingled with faith and desperation, laughter on the heels of weeping, and success assuaging the pain of the most embarrassing failures-her path both all her own and instantly familiar. All This Heavenly Glory confirms Elizabeth Crane's talents as the writer the San Francisco Chronicle called \\"hilariously off kilter and utterly refreshing.\\" With whimsy, skepticism, and undaunted emotional frankness, she paints a dazzling portrait of one woman's unique desires and heartbreaks.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=8B1FeKDRcdYC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Children of the Revolution","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Voices and Votes: A Literary Anthology of the Women's Suffrage Campaign","description":"A selection of literary texts from the early 20th century--drawing on novels, short stories, poetry, and autobiography--related to the women's campaign for the vote in Britain.

But, Detective-Chief Superintendent Erskine Powell asks himself, which of them is bold enough to do the deed? Is it Dinsdale's old gamekeeper, dismissed without warning? The environmentalist he assaulted and humiliated? The sexy stepsister he spied upon? Suspects are as thick as grouse in summer, and bringing down a killer on the wing is very tricky--even for a pro like Erskine Powell. . . .","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=vUTc96MkfAoC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Call an Angel!: Angelic Self Help","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=KXReAAAACAAJ&dq=Call+an+Angel!:+Angelic+Self+Help&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Nutrition Superbook: The Good Fats and Oils","description":"Oils we need, fats in health and disease, myths about fats and cholesterols.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=_-Z3MQAACAAJ&dq=The+Nutrition+Superbook:+The+Good+Fats+and+Oils&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Masters of the Dream","description":"Argues that the Black community must return to religious faith and grass-roots political action to restore morality, self-respect, and self-government in the inner cities","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=gt4KGwAACAAJ&dq=Masters+of+the+Dream&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Kill the Indian, Save the Man: The Genocidal Impact of American Indian Residential Schools","description":"For five consecutive generations, from roughly 1880 to 1980, Native American children in the United States and Canada were forcibly taken from their families and relocated to residential schools.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=l-CTQgAACAAJ&dq=Kill+the+Indian,+Save+the+Man:+The+Genocidal+Impact+of+American+Indian+Residential+Schools&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Encyclopedia of Witchcraft and Demonology","description":"A COMPENDIUM OF INFORMATION OF THE HISTORY, PRACTITIONERS, AND LORE OF WITCHCRAFT AND SORCERY.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Mf8QAQAAIAAJ&dq=The+Encyclopedia+of+Witchcraft+and+Demonology&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Suwannee River, Strange Green Land","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=4qIjAgAACAAJ&dq=Suwannee+River,+Strange+Green+Land&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Tribesman of Gor","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ZWGMAAAACAAJ&dq=Tribesman+of+Gor&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The small house at Allington, (The Chronicles of Barsetshire)","description":"'She had resolved to trust in everything, and, having so trusted, she would not provide for herself any possibility of retreat.' Lively and attractive, Lily Dale lives with her mother and sister at the Small House at Allington. She falls passionately in love with the urbane Adolphus Crosbie, and is devastated when he abandons her for the aristocratic Lady Alexandrina de Courcy. But Lily has another suitor, Johnny Eames, who has been devoted to her since boyhood. Perhaps she can find renewed happiness in Johnny's courtship? The Small House at Allington was among the most successful of Trollope's Barsetshire novels, and has retained its popularity among modern readers. Lily Dale's stubborn constancy is a troubling reflection of Trollope's divided feelings about the need for progress and reform in the context of liberal thought and politics. Her story is a subtle exploration of loyalty and ambition, and the pressure for change in a rapidly evolving world.

But a lack of understanding of what nurses really do -- one perpetuated by popular media's portrayal of nurses as simplistic archetypes -- has devalued the profession and contributed to a global shortage that constitutes a public health crisis. Today, the thin ranks of the nursing workforce contribute to countless preventable deaths. This fully updated and expanded edition of Saving Lives highlights the essential roles nurses play in contemporary health care and how this role is marginalized by contemporary culture. Through engaging prose and examples drawn from television, advertising, and news coverage, the authors detail the media's role in reinforcing stereotypes that fuel the nursing shortage and devalue a highly educated sector of the contemporary workforce. Perhaps most important, the authors provide a wealth of ideas to help reinvigorate the nursing field and correct this imbalance. As American health care undergoes its greatest overhaul in decades, the practical role of nurses -- that as autonomous, highly skilled practitioners -- has never been more important. Accordingly, Saving Lives addresses both the sources of, and prescription for, misperceptions surrounding contemporary nursing.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=pg9VBAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Elliptic Curves in Cryptography","description":"This book explains the mathematics behind practical implementations of elliptic curve systems.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=0_vegzgyqGMC&dq=Elliptic+Curves+in+Cryptography&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Old Testament (SparkNotes Literature Guide)","description":"\\"A masterpiece of contemporary Bible translation and commentary.\\" Los Angeles Times Book Review, Best Books of 1999 Acclaimed for its masterful new translation and insightful commentary, The David Story is a fresh, vivid rendition of one of the great works in Western literature.

But this David is also fully human: an ambitious, calculating man who navigates his life's course with a flawed moral vision. The consequences for him, his family, and his nation are tragic and bloody.

Each may also be a different part of a single entity: struggling to gain the gold of a rounded and contented maturity. In youth, Wotan, chief of the Gods, is interested only in power. In order to obtain absolute power he must fight against the evil Alberich who would steal his crown but there exists an even greater threat to Wotan's supremacy. Together can Wotan and Alberich gain greater riches? The answer lies in the hearts of men. This book takes a character in the operas of Wagner as the subject of each chapter. Characters are expanded and the action discussed. Using strong allegorical connotations, the intention is to allow the reader to get to know the characters and the story whilst absorbing the background introduction to Wagner's psychology and philosophy. By taking Wagner's Ring Cycle as the basis of a novel this book is an important addition to the large body of literature about Wagner's greatest work. As well as acting as a pleasurable introduction to the work it presents experienced Wagnerites with food for thought by presenting Robert Donnington's Jungian exploration in a highly readable and enjoyable form: presenting the operas as a personal journey but with a global message.

His brother, a slumlord, hires him to collect rent in the buildings he owns in Manhattan. Making his rounds from apartment to apartment, Moonbloom confronts a wildly varied assortment of brilliantly described urban characters, among them a gay jazz musician with a sideline as a gigolo, a Holocaust survivor, and a brilliant young black writer modeled on James Baldwin. Moonbloom hears their cries of outrage and abuse; he learns about their secret sorrows and desires. And as he grows familiar with their stories, he finds that he is drawn, in spite of his best judgment, into a desperate attempt to improve their lives. Edward Lewis Wallant's astonishing comic tour de force is a neglected masterpiece of 1960s America.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=WD0-DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Fabulous Five Together Again (The Fabulous Five #31)","description":"When her friends from back home come to London for a visit, Christie cannot wait to show them around and introduce them to her new English friends, but the two groups' meeting is less than harmonious.

Not realizing that, excepting a few praiseworthy individuals, these exhibitors were only superficially concerned with the qualities of use and companionship, an unfortunate dog owner would accept the sight of trophies or ribbons as the credits of an expert. Growing numbers of people and dogs continued to emphasize the advantages of proper dog-behavior and when, in 1935, The American Kennel Club instituted its obedience trials, the competition necessary to focus attention on results and improvement of methods was provided. And something else was observed. It was evident that thorough obedience training does more than assure a dog s response to his master s command; capacities for learning and emotional stability could be increased and integrated as permanent qualities of character. Recently, leading magazines of both general and specialized nature have made the public aware of the trained dog s potential, and of the recreational possibilities of dog training as a hobby. Interest in dog-training classes and other activities where dogs are dignified by usefulness, rather than merely looked at, is evidence that the dog-training public has outgrown the  make a game  and  tid-bit tossing  techniques that, by not being founded on positive and proper motivations, demonstrate the inadequacy of the master, thus promoting failure of response at those times when control is most needed, as well as contributing to the dog s feeling of insecurity. Dog owners of perspective have come to want the type of obedience upon which a blind person might stake his life, and the emotional stability that is vital to dogs in the presence of small, unpredictable children.

Prints are analysed as commercial and art objects, rathers than as simple historical records of matters maritime. The aim is to address a broad audience , including general readers of eighteenth and nineteenth century British and colonial history, those interested in ports and maritime affairs, and those with an interest in prints themselves. The eighteenth and nineteenth centuries were a period of enormous political and commercial development across the globe. Of particular importance was the revolution in transportation and communication by sea, with the concomitant growth in size and importance of the seaport. Despite growing awareness that the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries were a formative period in the development of maritime art, there has been relatively little exploration of maritime prints. This is extraordinary, since the period c.1700-1870 was a golden age of print production and saw the development of new forms of engraving such as aquatint and lithography, as well as the production of beautiful examples of line engraving and woodcut. The eighteenth and nineteenth centuries saw the establishment and expansion of major ports not just in Britain, but in continental Europe, Africa, Asia, Australia and in North and South America. The National Maritime Museum, upon which collection this book is based, is at the centre of the preservation and display of Britain's maritime heritage. Its print collection reveals the firm link between art and commerce in the development of these ports.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=vz_rAAAAMAAJ&dq=Ports+of+the+World+:+Prints+from+the+National+Maritime+Museum,+Greenwich+c.1700-1870&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hole in One","description":"The golfer lines up the shot. It's a long one, and the chances of acing it are nil. He says a prayer, swings, and - hallelujah! - he scores a hole in one. Many golfers confess to murmuring earnest prayers that they, too, may join the 42,000 people a year who catch lightning in a bottle and score a hole in one. It's an excitement that many lucky golfers say they remember with more clarity than their first kiss. That's because nothing in the grand old game is as mysterious yet mundane as the ace. Scott Hoch has had 26; fellow pro Fred Couples just two. Blind men and women have hit them, as have first-time golfers, three-year-old toddlers, and hundred-year-old widows. Richard Nixon is the only president to have scored one and he said it was a greater thrill than winning an election. Filled with fun facts and anecdotes, Hole in One! is a comprehensive clearinghouse of unusual stories involving the aura and accomplishment of scoring an ace. Readers will find out how duffers call upon unusual good luck charms and customs from foreign countries to ensure their swinging success.

In 1936, many of the one million people who travelled on scheduled flights in the United States were Canadian citizens who needed to travel south of the border to reach destinations in Canada. C.D. Howe, Minister of Transport in Prime Minister Mackenzie King's cabinet, was the chief architect of the government-owned TCA. From the beginning, the company was ennobled as more than a means of commercial transport: it was hoped that the TCA, like the Canadian Pacific Railway before it, would \\"overcome vast geographical barriers, thwart the Americans, reassure the British and unite the country.\\" Other air companies provided transportation; this one was to be a symbol of national identity - a maple leaf with wings. National Treasure details the ins and outs, the backroom politics and the ground-breaking decisions that led to the creation of Trans Canada Airlines, through its early years, to its metamorphosis into Air Canada in the 1950s. The book is an entertaining, well-written account that covers everything from the \\"teething\\" problems of the airline in its infancy (such as how to choose the right passenger plane for trans-Canada travel), to the company's role during World War II, to TCA's rapid post-war expansion and the notorious infighting between TCA and its rival, Canadian Pacific Airlines. Here are the planes: the Lockheed \\"14,\\" which suffered from embarrassing engine failures, the Electra, which featured radio antennas that were prone to lightning strikes, and the Lancaster, which held the Trans-Atlantic non-stop speed record from Montreal to the United Kingdom (11 hours and 14 minutes); the employees: Zebulon Lewis Leigh (\\"Lewie\\"), a \\"barnstormer\\" who became TCA's first pilot, and Lucille Garner and Pat Eccleston, registered nurses who became TCA's first female employees and Canada's first stewardesses; and the flights: first the Vancouver-Seattle route, then onward across Canada, then over the Atlantic Ocean to international ports of call. Packed with photos, and enlivened by interviews with past pilots, flight attendants and other employees, quotes from TCA staff newsletters, excerpts from the company's annual reports and letters from passengers all over Canada, National Treasure is an absorbing and well-researched look at commercial aviation in Canada.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=FIPHPAAACAAJ&dq=National+Treasure:+The+History+of+Trans+Canada+Airlines&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Unlocking the Adoption Files","description":"Presents the results, conclusions, and policy recommendations from his three-year Canadian study of the four groups involved in the adoption experience--adoptees, birthparents, adoptive parents, and adoption agency personnel.

Its main theme is the development of the Roman public religion in that period. Within this theme the most pervasive issue is the relationship between Roman religion andmorality. Though the link between the two is shown to be closer than is often supposed, it was also the case that the rise of such systems as Stoicism and Christianity contributed to a sense of morality more detached from traditional conceptions of the collective well-being of the Roman state.Nevertheless, the old religion continued to flourish and to contribute in numerous ways to the working of Roman society until it was fatally weakened by the political and social crisis of the third century. This crisis, and the tendency of the Roman Empire to depend upon and encourage new sources ofsupport, prepared the way for the emergence of Christianity, first as the religion of the Emperor, and then, after a period in which Christians and pagans were able to co-operate by emphasizing their common beliefs, as the official religion of the Empire.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=T2zXAAAAMAAJ&dq=Continuity+and+Change+in+Roman+Religion&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Every Woman's Health Guide","description":"A Guide to Women s Health, Second Edition is a practical and multidisciplinary text that enables students and clinicians to identify and treat conditions quickly and effectively.

Gifted but tormented, vulnerable but exploitative, McCullers led a life that had all the elements--and more--of a tragic novel. From McCullers's birth in Columbus, Georgia, in 1917 to her death in upstate New York in 1967, The Lonely Hunter thoroughly covers every significant event in, and aspect of, the writer's life: her rise as a young literary sensation; her emotional, artistic, and sexual eccentricities and entanglements; her debilitating illnesses; her travels in America and Europe; and the provenance of her works from their earliest drafts through their book, stage, and film versions. To research her subject, Virginia Spencer Carr visited all of the important places in McCullers's life, read virtually everything written by or about her, and interviewed hundreds of McCullers's relatives, friends, and enemies. The result is an enduring, distinguished portrait of a brilliant, but deeply troubled, writer.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=SbuKWBjWaGsC&dq=The+Lonely+Hunter:+A+Biography+of+Carson+McCullers&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Deputy","description":"Tough, taciturn and wounded in ways that no one else knows about, Marietta rancher and part-time Deputy Sheriff Logan Tate is a man in total control of his life.

EMMA  Emma Woodhouse, handsome, clever, and rich, with a comfortable home and happy disposition seemed to unite some of the best blessings of existence; and had lived nearly twenty-one years in the world with very little to distress or vex her.  So begins Jane Austen s comic masterpiece Emma. In Emma, Austen s prose brilliantly elevates, in the words of Virginia Woolf,  the trivialities of day-to-day existence, of parties, picnics, and country dances  of early-nineteenth-century life in the English countryside to an unrivaled level of pleasure for the reader. At the center of this world is the inimitable Emma Woodhouse, a self-proclaimed matchmaker who, by the novel s conclusion, may just find herself the victim of her own best intentions. NORTHANGER ABBEY Jane Austen s first novel, Northanger Abbey published posthumously in 1818 tells the story of Catherine Morland and her dangerously sweet nature, innocence, and sometime self-delusion. Though Austen s fallible heroine is repeatedly drawn into scrapes while vacationing at Bath and during her subsequent visit to Northanger Abbey, Catherine eventually triumphs, blossoming into a discerning woman who learns truths about love, life, and the heady power of literature. The satirical Northanger Abbey pokes fun at the gothic novel while earnestly emphasizing caution to the female sex. PERSUASION Called a  perfect novel  by Harold Bloom, Persuasion was written while Jane Austen was in failing health. She died soon after its completion, and it was published in an edition with Northanger Abbey in 1818. In the novel, Anne Elliot, the heroine Austen called  almost too good for me,  has let herself be persuaded not to marry Frederick Wentworth, a fine and attractive man without means. Eight years later, Captain Wentworth returns from the Napoleonic Wars with a triumphant naval career behind him, a substantial fortune to his name, and an eagerness to wed. Austen explores the complexities of human relationships as they change over time. Persuasion is the last work of one of the greatest of novelists, the end of a quiet career pursued in anonymity in rural England that produced novels which continue to give pleasure to millions of readers throughout the world.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=qDXx4aVjuf4C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sakharov speaks","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=yNirAAAACAAJ&dq=Sakharov+speaks&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"History of Virginia: A brief textbook for schools","description":"History of Douglas School in Winchester, Virginia.

The strange visions of the book of Revelation provide some of the most difficult passages of the New Testament, yet Christians have long been fascinated by its power and provocative pronouncements. David deSilva analyzes how the book argues and persuades us to see the world through the eyes of John, and suggests that the study of ancient rhetoric is particularly valuable in understanding the book of Revelation. deSilva interprets the book of Revelation as a rhetorical and communicative strategy to persuade a particular audience for specific goals. Throughout this analysis, he pursues John's construction of his own authority, John's use of emotion and logic, and his attempt to shape the formation of the reader. Despite the complexities of Revelation, deSilva has produced a remarkably clear text sure to cause readers to rethink their view of Revelation.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ADUh_MPlEMgC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Kohelet: A Modern Commentary on Ecclesiastes (Modern Commentary On)","description":"The authors who created Pirke Avot: A Modern Commentary on Jewish Ethics and Mishlei: A Commentary on Proverbs have worked together again to bring you a contemporary, gender-sensitive translation of Ecclesiastes.

Eliot Prize and the Forward Prize for Best Collection  There are lines in All One Breath for instance, that brand themselves into your brain with the fire of painful recognition. And yet it is also part of his genius to be ever alert to beauty, too.  - Sebastian Barry, a New Statesman Book of the Year In this absorbing, brilliant new collection  his first since Black Cat Bone  John Burnside examines our shared experience of this mortal world: how we are  all one breath  and  with that breath  how we must strive towards the harmony of choir. Recognising that our attitudes to other creatures  human and non-human  cause too much damage and hurt, that  we ve been going at this for years: / a steady delete / of anything that tells us what we are , these poems celebrate the fleeting, charged moments where, through measured and gracious encounters with other lives, we find our true selves, and bring some brief, insubstantial goodness and beauty into being.

One of the finest and most celebrated lyric poets at work today, John Burnside is a master of the moment  when the frames of our film seem to slow and stop and a life slips through the gap in between  and each poem here is a perfect, uncanny hymn to humanity, set down  to tell the lives of others .","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=KYxAAQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Year of Jubilo: A Novel of the Civil War","description":"A  sweeping, cinematic story of rebellion, loyalty, revenge, and reawakened romance  set in the immediate aftermath of the Civil War (The New York Times Book Review). A New York Times Notable Book The last time Gawain Harper saw Cumberland, Mississippi, he was heading off to fight for the newly formed Confederate States of America driven not by the cause that motivated so many others, but by love. The father of his beloved, Morgan Rhea, refused to allow her to be courted by a man who would not take up arms to defend the South. So Gawain joined the Mississippi Infantry and now, three nightmarish years later, he is coming home. But postwar Cumberland is not the place Gawain so fondly remembered. An occupying force of Union soldiers keeps uneasy watch over the townspeople, including an erstwhile slave hunter and an albino gravedigger known as Old Hundred-and-Eleven. Meanwhile, a bloodthirsty former Confederate officer named King Solomon Gault is organizing a secret militia to drive the occupiers out and bring the entire region under his ruthless control. Before Gawain can marry Morgan and build their new life together, he must return to the world of violence and turmoil he has been so desperate to escape. With  complex, well-crafted, often beautiful prose  (TheSeattle Times) and  a cast of characters worthy of a Larry McMurtry novel  (Newsday), The Year of Jubilo is a stunning achievement from the award-winning author of The Black Flower and The Judas Field.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=LUxODwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Disability Is Natural: Revolutionary Common Sense for Raising Successful Children With Disabilities","description":"In this user-friendly book, parents learn revolutionary common sense techniques for raising successful children with disabilities.

It covers a very large field-Epics such as the Ramayana and Mahabharata, Puranas and Upapuranas, Smrti and Niti literature, Darsanas or Systems of Philosophy, such as Nyaya, Vedanta, Mimamsa, Sankhya and Yoga, Grammar, Rhetoric, Poetry in all its branches, Dramatic and Narrative Literature, Mathematics, Medicine, Botany, Astronomy, Music and other technical or scientific branches of learning. Thus, it embraces all words occurring in the general post -Vedic literature. It includes most of the important terms in Grammar. It gives quotations and references to the peculiar and remarkable meanings of words, especially such as occur in books prescribed for study in the Indian and foreign universities. It also renders an explanation of important technical terms occurring in different branches of Sanskrit learning. To add to its usefulness the work includes three appendices. There are in existence no doubt excellent Sanskrit-English dictionaries compiled by eminent scholars like Monier Williams, H.H. Wilson, V. S. Apte and L. R. Vaidya, but their bulkiness and cost prohibit a large number of users from enjoying an advantage so necessary in their study of Sanskrit. There is, therefore, a crying need for one which supplies everything required by an average reader and which is at the same time characterized by brevity and cheapness. The present compilation is intended to serve this purpose. The author in this handy work has kept out Sanskrit words that are less commonly used and has tried to avoid all technicalities as well as words that can easily be seen as simple derivatives of some given words. Thus he has been able to reduce the bulk of the dictionary without compromising its usefulness.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=F-AuEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Slaughter","description":"My name is Avery Decker, and my story isn","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=3zqavQEACAAJ&dq=Slaughter&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Intelligence War (World War II Chronicles)","description":"Examines some of the methods employed by Allied and Axis nations to gather intelligence about their enemies during World War II, and discusses the role of espionage in the outcome of the war.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=wZ7ZAAAACAAJ&dq=The+Intelligence+War+(World+War+II+Chronicles)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Structural Analysis/Book and 2 Disks (Schaum's Outline Series in Civil Engineering)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=CTZYAAAAMAAJ&dq=Structural+Analysis/Book+and+2+Disks+(Schaum%27s+Outline+Series+in+Civil+Engineering)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Positively George Street","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=oQ-cAAAACAAJ&dq=Positively+George+Street&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Imm Mathilda: A Bethlehem Mother's Diary","description":"This is the voice of a wife and mother, an American expatriate living with her Palestinian husband and their young children in occupied Bethlehem during the incursions of the Israeli army following the uprising known as the Al Aqsa Intifada.

Featuring a sleuth who handles balance sheets and income statements the way most detectives handle guns, Lenny Cramer and his humorous sidekick put accounting and business concepts into real-life context. Dr. Cramer, a professor at the Wharton School, operates a small forensic accounting firm. He teaches, testifies before Congress, and appears as an expert witness in a court battle. But the real action occurs when he investigates financial fraud in a friend's jade shop. Using his forensic skills, he uncovers a plot to steal treasures from a remote Asian country and almost gets himself killed trying to stop the heist. Golden Spire is an educational novel designed as a supplement to financial accounting courses and professional ethics seminars at either the undergraduate or graduate level. It has been used successfully near the end of principles of accounting, at the beginning of intermediate accounting, and as basis for the discussion of professional codes of conduct in an accounting ethics course. The supplement would also be ideal for an MBA program which has a light coverage of accounting, or in CPA firms' in-house training programs as an enrichment exercise. Classroom tests of early drafts of this third edition and the previous two published editions have demonstrated repeatedly that students enjoy reading the instructional thriller and learn the accounting concepts more readily than through traditional texts.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=0OTAmgEACAAJ&dq=Accosting+the+Golden+Spire&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Czerny: Practical Method for Beginners on the Piano OPUS 599 Complete","description":"While Czerny's excellent fingering has been preserved, all unnecessary fingering has been removed by editor Willard A.

In ancient times, although they were socially marginal, prostitutes connected with almost every aspect of daily life. They sat in brothels and walked the streets; they paid taxes and set up dedications in religious sanctuaries; they appeared as characters sometimes admirable, sometimes despicable on the comic stage and in the law courts; they lived lavishly, consorting with famous poets and politicians; and they participated in otherwise all-male banquets and drinking parties, where they aroused jealousy among their anxious lovers. The chapters in this volume examine a wide variety of genres and sources, from legal and religious tracts to the genres of lyric poetry, love elegy, and comic drama to the graffiti scrawled on the walls of ancient Pompeii. These essays reflect the variety and vitality of the debates engendered by the last three decades of research by confronting the ambiguous terms for prostitution in ancient languages, the difficulty of distinguishing the prostitute from the woman who is merely promiscuous or adulterous, the question of whether sacred or temple prostitution actually existed in the ancient Near East and Greece, and the political and social implications of literary representations of prostitutes and courtesans.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=kxOLn0IoGhAC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Enjoying America's Gardens","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=lYg_AAAAYAAJ&dq=Enjoying+America%27s+Gardens&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Country Living Scrapbooking: Creating Scrapbooks, Albums, Journals & Memory Boxes","description":"Twenty-five scrapbooking projects illustrate how to preserve and show off your mementoes.

It was necessary to invent calculus along the way, since fundamental equations of motion involve velocities and accelerations, of position. His greatest single success was his discovery that which are derivatives the motion of the planets and moons of the solar system resulted from a single fundamental source: the gravitational attraction of the hodies. He demonstrated that the ohserved motion of the planets could he explained hy assuming that there is a gravitational attraction he tween any two ohjects, a force that is proportional to the product of masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. The circular, elliptical, and parabolic orhits of astronomy were v INTRODUCTION no longer fundamental determinants of motion, but were approximations of laws specified with differential equations. His methods are now used in modeling motion and change in all areas of science. Subsequent generations of scientists extended the method of using differ ential equations to describe how physical systems evolve. But the method had a limitation. While the differential equations were sufficient to determine the behavior-in the sense that solutions of the equations did exist-it was frequently difficult to figure out what that behavior would be. It was often impossible to write down solutions in relatively simple algebraic expressions using a finite number of terms. Series solutions involving infinite sums often would not converge beyond some finite time.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=POPtCAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Our Governors' Mansions","description":"Glossy color photographs lavishly depict the residences of the governors of 44 states (six states do not have governor's mansions).

Rarely do science and literature come together in the same book. When they do -- as in Charles Darwin's On the Origin of Species, for example -- they become classics, quoted and studied by scholars and the general public alike. Margaret Mead accomplished this remarkable feat not once but several times, beginning with Coming of Age in Samoa. It details her historic journey to American Samoa, taken when she was just twenty-three, where she did her first fieldwork. Here, for the first time, she presented to the public the idea that the individual experience of developmental stages could be shaped by cultural demands and expectations. Adolescence, she wrote, might be more or less stormy, and sexual development more or less problematic in different cultures. Mead s revolutionary book, dedicated to the girls of Tau, was one of the first studies to pay attention to girls  lives. Her keen observations contain many ideas that are still powerful today that sexuality is culturally-shaped, that adolescence need not be stressful, and that the lives of adolescent girls are worthy of attention and respect. Now this groundbreaking, beautifully written work as been reissued for the centennial of Mead's birth, featuring introductions by Mary Pipher, Ph.D. (Reviving Ophelia) and by Mead's daughter, Mary Catherine Bateso (Composing a Life).","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=3HSSCwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Toward the Twenty-first Century in Christian Mission","description":"This is a print on demand book and is therefore non- returnable.

This innovative approach balances the need for an intellectual understanding of structural elements with multiple opportunities to experience the language within its cultural context. From the outset, learners are presented with samples of authentic language that are context-sensitive and culturally coherent. Instructional time is used primarily to rehearse interactions that learners of Japanese are likely to encounter in the future, whether they involve speaking, listening, writing, or reading. Level 1 is comprised of two textbooks with accompanying activity books. These four books in combination with audio files allow instructors to adapt a beginning-level course, such as the first year of college Japanese, to their students  needs. They focus on language and modeled behavior, providing opportunities for learners to acquire language through performance templates. Online resources provide additional support for both students and instructors.

Founded in 1694, its world-famous buildings were built and rebuilt four times by different architects, most notably Sir John Soane. The Bank's three-and-aquarter-acre complex has included elegant public banking halls and private offices, courtyards and gardens, warehouses and vaults, residential apartments and guards' barracks. This lavishly illustrated book examines for the first time the entire architectural history of the Bank from the seventeenth through the twentieth centuries. Drawing on a variety of perspectives, the book relates the history of the Bank of England to current debates on English economic, social, and urban history, including issues of national identity, mercantile politics, and the commercialization of culture. The book also shows how the building itself has expressed various historical tensions among the Bank's inhabitants and publics: its directors and detractors, its clerks and clientele, its tourists, and even its mob attackers.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=lHeAQgAACAAJ&dq=Building+the+Bank+of+England:+Money,+Architecture,+Society+1694-1942+(Paul+Mellon+Centre+for+Studies+in+Britis)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Magnetic Hearts: Whispers Of Love\\\\White Diamonds\\\\Legacy (Arabesque)","description":"Contains three full-length stories of passion, love, and romance in one volume, including Whispers of Love, in which FBI agent Robyn Richards, forced to fake her death and leave her husband behind, returns to ask for his help in saving their child, the daughter he never knew he had.

Applicable to both Jewish and Christian communities, this illuminating exploration takes a look at the psychology behind scapegoating, why it is perpetuated, and how you can quell the damaging tradition of silence. Understanding Clergy Misconduct in Religious Systems helps you see leaders of religious institutions in a way that the world has been afraid to see them--in a glass clearly. Enriched with metaphoric myths and fairy tales instead of technical jargon, its unique systemic perspective reveals the psychodynamics behind the obsession with family secrets and lets you understand this dysfunction from the perspectives of victim, abuser, and counselor. These specific areas will both inform and aid you in dealing with this difficult subject: the religious institution as a family system the religious system as an illusion of the perfect family the concept of God-transference and the overidealization of clergy clergy personal relationships and clergy congregational relationships vulnerability and the psychology of the victim strategies for healing dysfunctional religious systems Understanding Clergy Misconduct in Religious Systems comes at just the right time--in an era when little has been written on the subject, especially from a systemic perspective, this work comes at a time when the phenomena of clergy sexual misconduct has rocked the very foundation of religious systems worldwide. Whether you re a lay congregational leader, judicatory administrator, pastoral counselor, psychologist, or seminarian, you ll find that the coping strategies and intervention techniques it outlines will guide you in pinpointing the sickness at its source and restoring felicity and order to your religious leaders and their communities.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=gWGuBAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Comic Party, Vol. 1","description":"Kazuki Sendo, has a passion and talent for painting and drawing that propels him into the world of doujinshi (underground comics).

Our underlying assumptions predetermine the results and preclude the broad success we so desperately seek. Change efforts often end up off-track because of small expectations. What is needed are grand expectations, so big that they cannot be realized in many lifetimes. It is only when people awaken to and work toward these immense purposes that they have the chance of finding fulfillment. Organizations are the perfect place to do this-these \\"beasts\\" which we create and curse, love and hate, that are so essential to our lives. In The Beauty of the Beast, Bellman shows how we can explore our huge potential and shift our daily organizational focus to one of long life and fulfillment-and in the process redesign our organizations for tomorrow. Bellman examines why we keep creating these creatures that fall so far short of our dreams for them. He reveals how to recognize the beast in ourselves, showing how organizational control and hierarchy multiply our natural and less constructive inclinations many times over. He points out that the problem is not the existence of organizations but in the ways we imagine them. Bellman asks us to consider what we want to pass on to future generations, helps us imagine the organizations we would be proud to create, and challenges us to take action from where we are today. He offers twenty renewal assertions to help us in redesigning organizations for tomorrow. These solid guides (with related questions for work groups) open the organization to new possibilities, helping us to embrace the organizational world as it really is while working hard to change it. In the process we will also change ourselves, as we ultimately feel less distant from-and more responsible for-creating those troubling structures we love to vent about. The Beauty of the Beast. will help people see their daily work in a new and larger perspective. It will help them embrace the real organizational world while they work at renewing it. And it will help people to recognize the choices available to them-and to exercise those choices for positive results.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=T9b6P3bNj0cC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Abeng","description":"Ever since Abeng was first published in 1984, Michelle Cliff has steadily become a literary force. Her novels evoke both the clearly delineated hierarchies of colonial Jamaica and the subtleties of present-day island life. Nowhere is her power felt more than in Clare Savage, her Jamaican heroine, who appeared, already grown, in No Telephone to Heaven. Abeng is a kind of prequel to that highly-acclaimed novel and is a small masterpiece in its own right. Here Clare is twelve years old, the light-skinned daughter of a middle-class family, growing up among the complex contradictions of class versus color, blood versus history, harsh reality versus delusion, in a colonized country. In language that surrounds us with a richness of meaning and voices, the several strands of young Clare's heritage are explored: the Maroons, who used the conch shell the abeng to pass messages as they fought a guerilla struggle against their English enslavers; and the legacy of Clare's white great-great-grandfater, Judge Savage, who burned his hundred slaves on the eve of their emancipation. A lyrical, explosive coming-of-age story combined with a provocative retelling of the colonial history of Jamaica, this novel is a triumph.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=mKBPEAAAQBAJ&dq=Abeng&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Echoes of an Autobiography","description":"From the Foreword by Nadine Gordimer: \\"These pieces are meditations which echo that which was, has been, and is the writer Mahfouz. They are--in the words of the title of one of the prose pieces--'The Dialogue of the Late Afternoon' of his life. I don't believe any autobiography, with its inevitable implication of self-presentation, could have matched what we have here.\\" With more than 500,000 copies of his books in print, Naguib Mahfouz has established a following of readers for whom Echoes of an Autobiography provides a unique opportunity to catch an intimate glimpse into the life and mind of this magnificent storyteller. Here, in his first work of nonfiction ever to be published in the United States, Mahfouz considers the myriad perplexities of existence, including preoccupations with old age, death, and life's transitory nature. A surprising and delightful departure from his bestselling and much-loved fiction, this unusual and thoughtful book is breathtaking evidence of the fact that Naguib Mahfouz is not only a \\"storyteller of the first order\\" (Vanity Fair), but also a profound thinker of the first order.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=sZ5BDAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Rancher's Wife (Western Lovers: Ranchin' Dads #13)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=tion1OzJPK8C&dq=Rancher%27s+Wife+(Western+Lovers:+Ranchin%27+Dads&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Arabs: A Compact History","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=zBZuAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+Arabs:+A+Compact+History&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Night Moves (Zebra Romantic Suspense)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=GObCzgEACAAJ&dq=Night+Moves+(Zebra+Romantic+Suspense)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Success","description":"The road to success can be a long, arduous journey. It is a journey that needs a step-by-step, clearly defined strategy to arrive at the final destination. To accomplish this goal, Gary A. McAbee has laid out a series of success principles, carefully placed in a logical order, which can lead to greater success. These principles have been used consistently by many of the highest achievers in our society. If they can use these concepts to reach success, then they can also be used by everyone to achieve victory. The book Defining Success: One Word at a Time starts with defining and visualizing the end result: victory. From there, concepts like faith, passion, knowledge, and patience are introduced to the reader as building blocks toward success. Finally, the book ends with an all-encompassing definition of success. This definition, like all of the success keywords before it, includes the previous concepts outlined in this book. Projects, known as Call-to-Action exercises, are located throughout the book as samples that can be used to supplement the success keywords. In essence, these exercises serve as written examples that allow the reader to work toward success. By completing projects such as The Success Book, Goal Worksheet, and Define Your Success, the success keywords and the concepts associated with them come to life. Defining Success: One Word at a Time serves as a road map to success. Make no mistake about it; the road to success can be daunting. Yet this book, along with the teachings and exercises it contains, is the ultimate guide to producing greater results.

If you want to discover this, then keep reading... Are you looking for something more than just another self-help book? Do you often feel overwhelmed, exhausted, and emotionally drained? Do you often ask yourself why you're not happy? Do you get sick often? Do you have difficulty staying in relationships or gravitate toward unhealthy attractions? Do you tend to overthink and worry too much about the future? Are you becoming increasingly cynical and feeling at odds with the world? Do you lack inspiration and creativity and often feel stifled? Do you sometimes wonder why you are here, and what life is all about? Or - are you generally happy in your life but still wonder what it's all about? Your dormant third eye is most likely the cause. How do you feel about learning how to open it and transform your life? Since the beginning of human history, the third eye chakra has been recognized and revered by ancient cultures as a powerful entity that is the gateway from the physical world into the non-physical world. It has been described as \\"the seat of the soul\\", \\"the eye of wisdom\\", \\"the inner eye\\", and \\"the mind's eye.\\" Awakening the third eye to harness its amazing powers has long been the pursuit of many spiritual schools, including Buddhism and Hinduism. Today, it remains the pursuit of those seeking happiness, health, and wellbeing. When awakened, the third eye allows us to fathom into the non-physical (but very real) spiritual realm, where we can find the true enrichment and purpose that we lack. This is the realm of our higher consciousness where we can claim our deepest intuition, our highest wisdom, and inner abundance to become healthier, more productive, and happier human beings. Today, slowly but surely, science has begun to confirm this. This book is a step-by-step guide that contains all you need to know about your inner eye and the steps required to awaken it. This is not your typical book on spirituality. This is a book about \\"actionable spirituality,\\" meaning that you will learn very real and effective techniques to awaken, empower, and nurture your dormant third eye. After all, what good are vague theories and spiritual platitudes if you can't apply them to get tangible results? You will learn: How to awaken your third eye to bring your physical and spiritual body into harmony, empowering you to live as your highest possible self. How the amazing and mysterious pineal gland is related to your third eye. Basic groundwork techniques for opening the third eye. Powerful meditations for opening and balancing the third eye. How to nurture your third eye with diet, crystals, color, essential oils and affirmations. How to balance the chakra system. Preparing yourself for the spiritual gifts of psychic dreams, seeing auras and clairvoyance. How to see and read auras. How to interpret psychic dreams and intuitive messages. And much more, including visualizations, lifestyle changes, and simple tips and methods to add to your routine. It's unfortunate that many people are skeptical of the spiritual aspect of our being and the role it can play in reconnecting us with ourselves and with the world around us. The powerful takeaways and the results you will experience will make this very clear. This book will take you on a magnificent adventure that will end with you experiencing inner peace, incredible wisdom, immense gratitude, and the discovery of realms you never knew existed. So, start this journey that will transform your life forever, by ordering this book today!","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=lP5FzQEACAAJ&dq=A+Look+Into+My+Third+Eye&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Two Brothers [2 BROTHERS] [Mass Market Paperback]","description":"Will he still love her every touch  when he finds out who she really is?

This book explores that question by analyzing how the Planet of the Apes films functioned both as entertaining adventures and as apocalyptic political commentary. Informative and thought provoking, the book demonstrates how this enormously popular series of secular myths used images of racial and ecological crisis to respond to events like the Cold War, the race riots of the 1960s, the Civil Rights movement, the Black Power movement, and the Vietnam War. The work utilizes interviews with key filmmakers and close readings of the five Apes films and two television series to trace the development of the series' theme of racial conflict in the context of the shifting ideologies of race during the sixties and seventies. The book also observes that today, amid growing concerns over race relations, the resurgent popularity of Apes and Twentieth Century--Fox's upcoming film may again make Planet of the Apes a pop culture phenomenon that asks who we are and where we are going.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=esgi9gn0qeEC&dq=Planet+of+the+Apes+as+American+Myth:+Race,+Politics,+and+Popular+Culture&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Occult View of the War","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Q3dtAQAACAAJ&dq=Occult+View+of+the+War&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Jewish People, Jewish Thought : The Jewish Experience in History","description":"An extensive introduction to Jewish experience and thought combines social and political history and intellectual tradition and is complemented by historical photographs, illustrations of Jewish art, maps, and detailed chronological charts","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=GyVlKAAACAAJ&dq=Jewish+People,+Jewish+Thought+:+The+Jewish+Experience+in+History&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Case of the Lonely Heiress","description":"A fight over a rich man s will turns deadly in this murder mystery by the  kingpin among the mystery writers  from the series that inspired the HBO show (The New York Times).

The shocks of 2020 have been great and small, disrupting the world economy, international relations and the daily lives of virtually everyone on the planet. Never before has the entire world economy contracted by 20 percent in a matter of weeks nor in the historic record of modern capitalism has there been a moment in which 95 percent of the world's economies were suffering all at the same time. Across the world hundreds of millions have lost their jobs. And over it all looms the specter of pandemic, and death. Adam Tooze, whose last book was universally lauded for guiding us coherently through the chaos of the 2008 crash, now brings his bravura analytical and narrative skills to a panoramic and synthetic overview of our current crisis. By focusing on finance and business, he sets the pandemic story in a frame that casts a sobering new light on how unprepared the world was to fight the crisis, and how deep the ruptures in our way of living and doing business are. The virus has attacked the economy with as much ferocity as it has our health, and there is no vaccine arriving to address that. Tooze's special gift is to show how social organization, political interests, and economic policy interact with devastating human consequences, from your local hospital to the World Bank. He moves fluidly from the impact of currency fluctuations to the decimation of institutions--such as health-care systems, schools, and social services--in the name of efficiency. He starkly analyzes what happened when the pandemic collided with domestic politics (China's party conferences; the American elections), what the unintended consequences of the vaccine race might be, and the role climate change played in the pandemic. Finally, he proves how no unilateral declaration of 'independence\\" or isolation can extricate any modern country from the global web of travel, goods, services, and finance.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=jq5BEAAAQBAJ&dq=Shutdown&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The adventures of Ulysses (Smith's standard library)","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=pMcdAAAAMAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Fenwick Travers and the Panama Canal: An Entertainment","description":"Fenny's presidential patron, Teddy Roosevelt, sends him off to Panama as an agent provocateur to foment rebellion among the peaceful Panamanians.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=9TcLAAAACAAJ&dq=Fenwick+Travers+and+the+Panama+Canal:+An+Entertainment&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Greek Myths","description":"The gold standard in Greek mythology, in a dazzling Graphic Deluxe Edition with a new introduction by the bestselling author of the Percy Jackson and the Olympians series From the creation of the world out of Chaos and the birth of the Olympians to the Trojan War and Odysseus's return, Robert Graves's superb retelling of the Greek myths has long been acclaimed as the definitive edition.

Imagine staring into a mirror and recognizing your reflection as that of a chimpanzee, before you swing to work on a vine, or consider the possibility that you and your spouse are the newest additions to the ape house at the zoo, where your every move is being scrutinized. Prepare yourself for Brodsky's auto-factory-assembly-line worker from south St. Louis, who takes the stage in six pieces that set up a chronological continuity around which the other fictions swirl. His humor is boisterous, whimsical, condemnatory, at times even self-deprecating, his language a study in fractured English that nonetheless debunks conventional wisdom and political correctness, exposing the cant and hypocrisy of 1990s America. These fast-paced fictions, about persons bedeviled by phobias and physical afflictions arising from the realities of old age, racism, and too-rapid change, are pieces of life that examine the world and revel in its absurdities. If Jonathan Swift, Franz Kafka, and Richard Brautigan could collaborate, the result might be Catchin' the Drift o' the Draft, a highly original, satirical, and altogether entertaining collection of forty-one short short fictions.
