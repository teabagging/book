I have read a few of Dr. Gieslers articles prior to this book.I found this book to very exteremely through. There are no assumptions made and thus it starts in the begining. The Prolegomena (preconditions) covered every debating ground i could think of and some i didnt think of. To say the least to me it appears Dr. Giesler took every type of argument made to the \\"preconditions\\" and expanded on each one in great detail. I believe Dr Giesler did not build any \\"straw-man\\" arguments. He represented aposing views very very well and critqued them as fit. Dr. Giesler did a great job of putting all the evidence out there and allows you to draw your own conclusion but he is clear on where he stands and why. I found the book to be very well written, organized, and referenced. The material demands some heavy thinking but is still written in a very clear manner.I am so impressed with this volume (1) that i now plan to read his following 3 volumes. I would recommend this to anyone who is learning what they believe, why they believe it, and how to think."},{"Title":"Systematic Theology, Vol. 1: Introduction/Bible","review":"Dr. Geisler's four-volume systematic theology treatment needs to be studied by any serious student of Christian theology, because he emphasizes a logical approach and recognizes the importance of apologetics when doing any part of theology OR philosophy from a Christian standpoint. I certainly won't brag that I've made my way through all three of the presently available volumes, but as far as I HAVE gotten, I have been blessed, taught, motivated, and enlightened. Even those who find themselves at odds with Dr. Geisler's points-of-view on certain topics will appreciate the way he presents opposing and alternative ideas and deals with the differences, instead of assuming his to be givens.Highly recommended and profoundly enjoyable."},{"Title":"Systematic Theology, Vol. 1: Introduction/Bible","review":"Having sampled quite a range of Christian apologetics and theology works, I think I can say safely say Norman Geisler is a crucial addition to any thinking Christian's library.At a time when liberal scholarship is adrift in a sea of desperation, the cool, calm analysis and breadth of knowledge of Geisler is an asset to a faith in need of revitalisation and energising.Like Todd Vick, I think Geisler is at his best on issues like inerrancy and inspiration, but his thorough background treatise on the varying paths of liberal and fundamental thought is just as vital to understanding where Christianity has been and where it's going.Systematic Theology is highly recommended as a solid grounding for evangelicals.

However, having read a few of Dr. Geisler's other works before this, I knew it would be a wealth of knowledge that would be well worth the time and effort invested in reading it, and would no doubt exceed my expectations in the process. So far, it appears I was right.Not only is this first volume extremely thorough, but it is clearly written, heavily referenced, and incredibly organized. It is structured in a logical fashion in which there are little \\"a priori\\" assumptions. Instead, it starts at the most foundational level and builds from there, brick by brick, justifying every step of the way. In the first half, the Prolegomena (preconditions), Dr. Geisler lays out all the preconditions necessary for Christianity. I found this half to be delightfully philosophically rich in that it introduced and expanded upon, in great detail, every philosophical viewpoint and presupposition I could possibly think of and some I'd probably never have thought of - and in understandable language. In the second half, Dr. Geisler outlines not philosophy, but the Bible itself. Here, he links the philosophical views in the first half to their corresponding perspectives regarding the Bible and its origin, its historicity, its meaning, its theology, etc., and ultimately its purpose for us as humans. In both halves, the various viewpoints were represented and analyzed well, being critiqued or supported as seemed fit; and although Dr. Geisler is very clear on where he stands and why, he did a great job of laying out all the evidence, thus allowing the reader to draw their own conclusions from where the arguments lead. I also found the appendix on \\"Objections to Theistic Arguments\\" to be tremendously beneficial as well - something I wouldn't expect to see in a book on systematic theology.Overall, I loved it and cannot wait to read the next three volumes, however long it takes. I would highly recommend this collection to any Christian who desires to take the time to think critically about their faith, as well as to simply learn what they believe and why they believe it. The wealth of knowledge available is truly overwhelming, but with patience and perseverance, this \\"culminating work of a lifetime of study and research\\" will leave you with a faith that is grounded, strengthened, justified, confident, defensible, and enriched. You will not be let down."},{"Title":"Systematic Theology, Vol. 1: Introduction/Bible","review":"First of all, I love this book! I've now bought volumes two and three, and am eagerly awaiting the release of volume four. I can only recommend this book to those who are serious about Christian Theology, and learning the logic, history, and science behind it. Dr. Geisler strips everything bare and systematically (pun intended) lays out the foundations necessary to make a logical discourse in theology possible. After the preconditions (the first 12 chapters of the book), he goes into an extensive exposition on the Bible.This book is a valuable tool in gaining a greater understanding and appreciation of the Bible. For the most part, it is right on the money. I found only one weak part in the book. In Chapter 25 \\"The Historicity of the Old Testament\\", he goes into a weak discourse on certain \\"gaps\\" in genealogies. He mostly does this to accomodate current scientific theories on the age of the earth, but his support and referrances are not adequately supported. This only accounts for one page out of 589.

This is the first of a four-volume series, the other volumes of which areSystematic Theology, Vol. 2, God/Creation,Systematic Theology, Vol. 3: Sin/Salvation, andSystematic Theology, Vol. 4: Church/Last Things. He endorses what he calls \\"Thomistic Theism\\" (i.e., based on Thomas Aquinas), noting, \\"Thomistic theism is also called classical theism, a view shared among Augustine, Anselm, the Reformers, and many modern thinkers, including C.S. Lewis.\\" (Pg. 24)He states, \\"...there are no mathematical errors in God's inerrant Word, but then again there is very little geometry or algebra and no calculus in it either... The same is true of most every area of the arts and science. Whenever the Bible speaks in these areas, it speaks authoritatively, but God has largely left the discoveries of His truths in these areas to a study of general revelation.\\" (Pg. 71) But he cautions, \\"depraved human beings have found a way to deflect, divert, or distort God's commands; therefore, the teachings of God's Word have no more immunity from tortured contortion than does the reality of God's world.\\" (Pg. 73) Finally, he adds, \\"we must be careful to distinguish between God's Word, which is infallible, and our interpretation of it, which is not.\\" (Pg. 77)Concerning the difficult question of free will and predeterminism, he argues, \\"God does not force (events) to happen against our free will; rather He predetermines that they will occur through our free will. Or, to put it minimally, God does not have to MAKE these events occur; He can SEE them occur---from His eternal vantage point.\\" (Pg. 94) He explains, \\"God can know for sure (has determined) what we will freely do. So one and the same event is determined from the standpoint of God's knowledge and FREE from the vantage point of our choice. Again, this may be a mystery, but the great mystery of predestination and free will, whatever else it is, is not a logical contradiction.\\" (Pg. 96)Surprising to some, he opines, \\"For those most familiar with C.S. Lewis's strong and eloquent defense of ... historic Christianity, his view of Scripture comes as a great surprise. Indeed, his perspective ... combines seemingly contradictory elements of the orthodox, liberal, neo-orthodox, and neo-evangelical views.\\" (Pg. 397) He laments, \\"...it comes as a great disappointment... in his otherwise excellent book on Miracles to hear him deny many Old Testament miracles.\\" (Pg. 403)Geisler's series is one of the most important recent contributions to evangelical systematic theology."},{"Title":"Systematic Theology, Vol. 1: Introduction/Bible","review":"i now have the whole four volumes!!!! this will increase my ministry work all the more!!! an excellent resource for the serious student of Scripture!!!!"},{"Title":"Systematic Theology, Vol. 1: Introduction/Bible","review":"Norman Geisler's Four Volume set puts most systematic theologies to shame.

Highly recommended.

He has done a tremendous amount of good for the Christian Church and this should not be forgotten. However, upon reading all four volumes of his systematic theology, I have found them failing to provide a sound Biblical construct. By this I mean that Dr. Geisler frequently misuses and misrepresents Scripture and various theological schools of thought (Calvinism most often) to make better use out of his own position; which I believe, if we are to use Scripture as our standard, is utterly and hopelessly flawed. He asserts man's freedom of will while reducing God to a mere observer of His creation, on the knife's edge of deistic reservation. He has given himself the title of \\"Moderate Calvinist\\" while not only disbelieving all of the Five Points of Calvinism in their true form, but resenting and renaming those who hold to the Five Points as \\"extreme\\", lumping together both Calvinism and Hyper-Calvinism without line or distinction. He holds that man is capable of inclining himself to God, even though the Bible makes clear that man is totally dead in sin. He holds that God only foresees our own decision to place our faith in Him, yet the Bible unmistakably puts forth the doctrine of eternal predestination of those whom He has granted both faith and grace. He holds that God makes salvation conditional by Christ's life and work, while the Bible undeniably states that Christ died to make salvation actual. He holds that God's grace is resistible by all, presuming then, none could have been saved by Christ's atonement. Once again, he places all of the work of salvation in the hands of men and snatches it from the hand of God. The one point that he appears to agree with Calvinism is in the point of eternal security. However, his doctrine is much different than that of Perseverance of the Saints. Calvinists believe that Christ chose some for salvation and died to save them, working in them and, by the power of the Holy Spirit, keeping them until the final judgment, not by any endurance or will of their own, but wholly by the sovereign grace and power of God. Geisler, contrary to this, asserts that once man chooses God, God is then under obligation to him to save him, regardless of the fruit he bears.It seems here that Dr. Geisler wants it both ways, He wants to be totally free from God's control, and yet totally under His sovereign grace until judgment. For a man who prides himself on theology consistency, I find this contradiction especially peculiar.Man, according to Geisler, is the axis point upon which all of salvation occurs. It is saddening to see a man trusted by so many to be teaching such poor doctrine. It is equally as saddening to see how quickly an old heresy (Pelagianism) can become the new orthodoxy."},{"Title":"Optimization: Algorithms and Consistent Approximations (Applied Mathematical Sciences)","review":"Develops a powerful algorithmic and implementable framework for solving finite and semi-infinite nonlinear optimization problems with a special emphasis on min-max optimization problems."},{"Title":"Optimization: Algorithms and Consistent Approximations (Applied Mathematical Sciences)","review":"A good book on an important subject!"},{"Title":"Experiencing youth;: First-person accounts","review":"George Gothals was my mentor when I was at Harvard and I worked with him as my thesis director, for my master's degree.

In a heart-felt memoir of his family's farm in Iowa, a way of life gone forever is brought to life. Mr. Harnack could have been describing my own family's history in Indiana and when I first discovered the book in the 1980's, I read the book on tape for my Aunt and Uncle, then in their 80's, because their way of life was by then a thing of the past. &quot;We Have All Gone Away&quot; becomes a memorial for all who contributed to the rich fabric of our agricultural ecomony in a much simpler time.The book, which reads like good fiction, paints the powerful picture of a proud chapter in our country's growth. While the book doesn't spare the reader the full impact on individual lives as a result of agricultural expansion into big business, nor does Mr. Harnack wallow in the necessary demise of era.I shared the book with my daughter some years ago. She has passed the book on to more than a dozen people, all who share some remnant of a memory of our midwestern farming heritage. What a treasure this book is! I hope it never goes out of print."},{"Title":"We have all gone away","review":"Man, this was just such an absorbing, well-written book that I hardly know where to begin. I found so much here that I could relate to, and I didn't even grow up on a farm, although my grandpa's small \\"hobby\\" farm was next door and I got medium-sized \\"tastes\\" of what it was like to be a farm boy between the ages of nine and eighteen, when I finished high school and joined the army. And my \\"pseudo\\" farm boy experiences served me well for the rest of my life. Because Harnack makes it clear in his book how important the work, discipline and seasonal rhythms of farm life was in his own maturation. But at the same time, as the title implies, he was also stretching toward a future that would not actively include the farm where he was raised. His college-educated widowed mother was adamant that all four of her children would reach higher than the life of a farmer, and they all did. But, in the meantime, as I read through this book I had to keep stopping and would silently exclaim to myself, \\"Yes! That's exactly how it was!\\" Or almost, at any rate. As an example, Harnack describes a fishing trip where his Uncle Jack takes the whole tribe of siblings and cousins to catch \\"bullheads.\\" Their expedition is successful and they have a feast that first night -\\"The white sweet flesh was rather mealy, delicately fish-flavored. We were told - and knew - that we were privileged to be eating a truly rare delicacy; we savored each morsel and sucked the spines.\\"I was never fond of fishing as a kid, and only went with my dad a couple of times. But Dad loved to fish and often brought home a mixed mess of bluegills, lake perch and sunfish, which he cleaned and fileted for a sumptuous feast cooked by Mom in the same way Harnack describes. Our lakeside neighbor favored bass, both as a game fish and a delicacy. But he and my dad were unanimous in their opinion that bullheads, bottom-feeding suckers, were trash fish, and always threw them back when they happened to catch them. A perhaps minor, but interesting distinction between my childhood and Harnack's. His other tales of cows, pigs and chickens - gathering, candling, cleaning and bartering eggs - all ring true to my own memories, although I will freely admit I never had all the responsibilities and heavy labor that Harnack and his siblings and cousins bore. His descriptions of the barns that his grandfather built and and how they were, in many ways, the center of life on a farm, reminded me of Anne-Marie Oomen's wonderful memoir, PULLING DOWN THE BARN, in which she characterized her family's barn as cathedral-like and absolutely central to their life. Harnack's book also brought to mind another memoir, EIGHTY ACRES: ELEGY FOR A FAMILY FARM, by Ron Jager, who grew up near McBain, Michigan, less than an hour from my own childhood home, here in Reed City. Harnack's depiction of the strict separation of the various religions in his small town also rang true for me, causing me to remember how the nuns who taught us in the Catholic school always warned us to never set foot in any of those Protestant churches, of which there were several in our town. For doing so would constitute, if not a grave sin, then certainly a dangerous \\"occasion of sin\\" for us \\"chosen of God\\" of the Catholic faith. There is one other facet of small-town and farm community living mentioned in Harnack's book which is disturbing to me, because I have seen it to be true here, in this town where I grew up and came back to after nearly forty years away. It is the closed clannishness of large families, most of whom never left and have married and raised succeeding generations. Harnack mentions how when, once a year, all the surrounding farmers and their families would meet at the Harnack farm to work out a schedule for threshing season.\\"Mother and Aunt Lizzie felt a trifle uneasy, for this was the only night of the year when our visitors were other than relatives. With so many dozens of kin on both sides of the family, we needed no further friends.\\"I have heard friends of mine from childhood, the ones who never left town, say the same thing - that they have such big families they don't ever need to visit with other people, outside of family. Such smug insularity initially shocked me, but I have grown used to such comments and attitudes in the past few years. It is a part of small town life. I could keep on, but suffice it to say this is one hell of a good book. I liked it much better than another recent memoir of Depression-era Iowa farm life, LITTLE HEATHENS, perhaps because it was from a male point of view and didn't shrink from the biological lessons also learned on a farm. I hope this book finds a new life in a new edition soon, because it strongly deserves a new generation of readers. I will recommend it highly to my other reader friends and lovers of good books. - Tim Bazzett, author of the REED CITY BOY trilogy and LOVE, WAR & POLIO"},{"Title":"We have all gone away","review":"Anyone who grew up on a farm will be entranced by this book, and if you grew up on an Iowa farm you will be overjoyed.

If you or a loved one are undergoing a medical crisis, you MUST read this book, it could save your life!"},{"Title":"Unsolved Disappearances in the Great Smoky Mountains","review":"Book was in ok condition. Boring read though. The stories were told then updated then updated again I wouldn't re-read."},{"Title":"Unsolved Disappearances in the Great Smoky Mountains","review":"This book has pretty poor production quality and one would be hard pressed to say any of it is particularly well written. It was originally released in the early 1990s and updated, in a half baked kind of way, in 2001. It's also a bit ghoulish. The authors seem well aware of this and try and present the book as a potential means of still finding those that were lost or preventing others from going missing. But its a pretty thin vineer. The fact is they are benefitting from the misfortune of these victims, and they must know it. All that said, the stories are oddly compelling and the research behind each case is detailed but not so overwhelming as to get too dry. So it moves along. Two and a half stars, rounded up to three."},{"Title":"Unsolved Disappearances in the Great Smoky Mountains","review":"This is a wonderful book. Every time I go to the Smokey Mountains I make sure that this book goes with me. As I am riding through the mountains I am always wondering what really did happen to the people in the book. It will keep you guessing even after you have read the last page."},{"Title":"Unsolved Disappearances in the Great Smoky Mountains","review":"I am a professional folklorist in east Tennessee. For years I have conducted short walking tours telling ghost and folk tales.So many people on my tours began asking me about stories they had read in this book - Unsolved Disappearances in the Great Smoky Mountains - that I bought a copy. I was spellbound and knew I had to tell these stories. I contacted the authors and arranged to tell the true stories they had written of people who vanished without a trace in the Great Smoky Mountains."},{"Title":"Unsolved Disappearances in the Great Smoky Mountains","review":"After reading this book, I was most appreciative of the amount of research that went into its writing. The authors made the folks who disappeared, 'real' to the reader by including many details of their lives. It's not a fun book to read, but it certainly is a fascinating one. The 'facts' of each case are interwoven into the whole cloth of a well-done story. It is a book to ponder upon."},{"Title":"Unsolved Disappearances in the Great Smoky Mountains","review":"I live in Cherokee, NC, and had heard about people disappearing in the Smokies. When I saw this book in my library, I was surprised to learn somebody had documented the disappearances. I bought it and went to Clingmans Dome for an afternoon of reading and reflection. It was wonderul, and I came away with a new respect for the mountains, and felt great sorrow for those left behind."},{"Title":"Unsolved Disappearances in the Great Smoky Mountains","review":"This book is a &quot;must read&quot; for anyone who enjoys the challenge of untangling a web of the unknown mixed with the truth. The authors not only furnish an excellent accounting of factual events, they often challenge the readers to draw their own conclusions. Are these people really missing in the mountains? Are they dead? Did some step into the realm of the unknown? Or did they use the mountains simply as an escape route, knowing they could never be found.To this day, the Smoky Mountains are filled with mysteries and most are never solved. What is it, about the ancient-old Smokies, that allows them to so cleverly hide their secrets? Travel with these authors as they try, with actual documentation and personal interviews, to find answers to these questions."},{"Title":"Unsolved Disappearances in the Great Smoky Mountains","review":"I visited the Great Smoky Mountains National Park last month. While browsing the Visitor Center I saw this book and bought it since unsolved mysteries have always intrigued me. My group and I read a story each night and then discussed it. We visited the places where the people disappeared without a trace. It was a real human experience, and different from the many tourist traps with nothing but junk to offer."},{"Title":"Unsolved Disappearances in the Great Smoky Mountains","review":"I hike in the Great Smoky Mountains and had never given much thought to getting lost or disappearing.

The writing style is ala Dragnet, so while it is not high art, it is effective in providing a clear picture of these strange, inexplicable disapperances."},{"Title":"Unsolved Disappearances in the Great Smoky Mountains","review":"I love this book. The stories are told in a factual style with just the right amount of background and detail. Some of my friends and I read the stories several times and have developed theories about what happened to these people.I will be first in line to buy the book the authors promise to write if and when any of these unsolved disappearances are solved."},{"Title":"Unsolved Disappearances in the Great Smoky Mountains","review":"The factually documented stories about people who have disappeared in the Great Smoky Mountains, are so sad. But having read them before our group went hiking, it made us far more concerned with safety.

While they were indeed interesting, I think they fell short in research. Talk about a quick read!"},{"Title":"Unsolved Disappearances in the Great Smoky Mountains","review":"Kind of basic. If I lived in the area Id probably have gotten more out of the story. The insidents took place a while ago and dont have the same impact as if they happen last year. Still a well writen book and it did give me some things to think about next time I go camping."},{"Title":"Unsolved Disappearances in the Great Smoky Mountains","review":"I now have family in N.C. so I enjoy reading about the area. The missing person cases in the book seem well researched and as factual as possible, in spite of the passage of time in some cases, and/ or the lack of witnesses in some cases. There wasn't any far-fetched speculation on the author's part; the reader is allowed to draw their own conclusions. Some of the cases were so intriguing that I did further reading and research as time allowed."},{"Title":"Unsolved Disappearances in the Great Smoky Mountains","review":"Great book full of detail.

I have to say this book is a great read, when I was done I wanted to read more books about the Great Smoky Mountains and the secrets it holds. I highly recommend it if you like to read books about real life mysteries."},{"Title":"Unsolved Disappearances in the Great Smoky Mountains","review":"The sections in this book are quick and to the point. The subject matter is extremely interesting for amateur sleuths, Smoky Mountain historians and folklorists. Each story is presented as a mini case-file with just the facts, a to-the-point overview of how things were handled, and the outcomes. You won't have to wade through a lot of unnecessary prose because the facts are interesting on their own. It was, at least to me, a sad \\"read\\" at times. If you enjoy reading about the Smokies you will want this one for your collection. Avid readers can easily finish it in one sitting or those who like to savor one chapter at a time will find it easy to set aside for a few days but not loose one's train of thought. It appears to be self-published so there are a few typos and ill-fitting formats, thus the four-star rating, but they are easily over-looked."},{"Title":"Unsolved Disappearances in the Great Smoky Mountains","review":"The seven stories in this book were taken from an original list of over 100 names of persons who had met with some type of misfortunes in the Great Smokey Mountains.The authors did an excellent job with adding updates to each revision of the book.I would like to see more books on the original list of over 100 names.This book is 152 pages filled with intriguing stories of the Great Smokey Mountains.The Smokey Mountains are absolutely beautiful."},{"Title":"Unsolved Disappearances in the Great Smoky Mountains","review":"We bought the book at a gift shop in the mountains on our vacation in Blairsville GA. My 10 year old niece and my sisters and I took turns reading the stories out loud on the deck of our cabin each evening. Simple stories, well researched, and intriguing, the stories stirred up much suspense and long discussions. Since the stories include maps and detailed locations of the disappearances, we went to some of the sites to enrich our discussions of what we each theorized happened...a dramatic way to &quot;feel&quot; a part of solving the mysteries. We will probably visit more of the sites in the future."},{"Title":"Unsolved Disappearances in the Great Smoky Mountains","review":"The Smoky Mountains are my favorite place to be. While staying in a cabin on vacation, I picked this book up at a gift shop to a cave attraction. I read the entire thing all the way through. The stories stay with you so much, it's like the people within them actually haunt you. I would read this book over and over! If you like mysteries, specially true ones, you will LOVE this book. What made it the best was that as I was reading the stories, I was actually near places and in proximity of these locations where the people went missing from. Although heartbreaking, it makes you want to find out what happened to these people."},{"Title":"Unsolved Disappearances in the Great Smoky Mountains","review":"Unsolved dissapearances is something that I am always interested in and had to grab this book. Anything that happens in a cluster of one area always sparks curiousity in me. This book was a very quick read. It was much thinner than I anticipated and poorly edited. There were multiple spelling errors throughout the book and it was not always a smooth read.It seemed as though there were two completely contrasting writing styles in the book; and you could certainly tell the difference. (Hence the two different authors).The book was written in a purely objective style and got right to the point from page 1, which explains why it was so short. This book could be compared more closely to an investigative journal rather than a true account book. I was a bit dissapointed however that it did not offer up any theories from the authors' perspective on how some of these people vanished. Although there were tales and rumors told from the locals in some cases, there was no collective theory from the investigators of this book which would have made this mystery more interesting. Could all of these dissapearances be a coincidence with each a unique explanation? Could these dissapearances be the work of years of foul play? Are the Smoky Mountains the perfect place for predators, animal and human?This book does ignite curiousity, and you will find yourself trying to come up with a million different scenarios for each dissapearance. I will certainly remember these unfortunate souls when I visit the Smokies."},{"Title":"Unsolved Disappearances in the Great Smoky Mountains","review":"As I read the stories in this book, my heart went out to those who lost a loved one, and yet have no closure. My heart pumped harder when I read about Dennis Martin, the six year old, because when I was about his age my parents took me to the Smokies. I had a tendency to wander off, and one time I was lost for about an hour. I sat down and cried, then got up and yelled. My dad, who was looking for me, heard me; if he had not I may have been in this book."},{"Title":"Unsolved Disappearances in the Great Smoky Mountains","review":"Fun read, Dennis martin info was chilling.

Would recommend to anyone interested in most beautiful place in the country"},{"Title":"Unsolved Disappearances in the Great Smoky Mountains","review":"The first section of the book is very insightful. Baldwin relates three accounts of well-known, daylight disappearances in which the missing person virtually vanished in plain sight. Likewise, this edition offers updates not in the original text, which make these cases even creepier. The search attempts are well-detailed, and the time and man hours involved make these disappearances even more baffling.The negatives are minor, but I do regard the last couple of chapters involving the at-large convicts as little more than filler. Also, the Kindle version is poorly-formatted, and reading the book is very trying in spots. Nonetheless, much of the book is a real page-turner, and I would recommend it."},{"Title":"Unsolved Disappearances in the Great Smoky Mountains","review":"this was a slow read and not what I thought it would be.

I wish it were a bit longer, but that is not meant as a criticism."},{"Title":"Welcome to the Sea of Sand","review":"Beautiful illustrations of desert plants and animal life with short but eloquent descriptions. Dispelling the myth that deserts are barren and lifeless, the author and illustrator show the desert teeming with life. Birds and animals not mentioned in the text but shown in the illustrations are listed at the back of the book. This is a wonderful quick read to round out learning about life in the desert. The life in this desert seems to be that of the southwestern United States and there is a reference to find more information through the Arizona-Sonora Desert Museum."},{"Title":"Welcome to the Sea of Sand","review":"Welcome to the Sea of Sand, is an excellent informational book for younger children.

Why didn't I enjoy this book, then? The plot was, frankly, a bit more nonexistent than I was expecting -- the sex begins on Page 5 and continues almost unabated until Page 129. Most of it's quite repetitive. Adam finds Connor unconscious, takes him in and cares for him, and they start having sex about twenty minutes after Connor awakes. When they're not having sex, there's some talking, but Adam reveals little (he gets few lines other than \\"you are in my heart, adada [an endearment in his people's language].\\" It's not utterly bad sex. It's even interestingly werewolfy sex, to a point. But I can only read the same scene repeated over and over so long before I start flipping forward and wondering if anything else is going to happen. Are we going to meet Adam's people or understand what it means to be him? Not really. Are any epiphanies going to happen with less expository subtlety than a sledgehammer? Not really. (\\"In his heart, Greg knew the man was right. The scarf was his constant reminder of his responsibility and obligation to the clinic and the people of his adopted town.\\") Greg, Connor's insensitive ex, also eventually learns the joys of being on the receptive end of werewolf sex, which turns the person so involved into a werewolf himself. The werewolves seem careful about obtaining consent for the sex, but don't actually mention the bit about turning furry until much later (and for all the dramatic \\"...and surviving the experience\\" talk, there's no actual implication that werewolves are in the habit of killing their lovers). We don't learn much about what being a werewolf is like, in any case; the book cuts off as soon as Connor transforms for the first time (and has some more sex).Reviews mentioning 'plot' and 'character development' influenced my purchase of the book. I wish they hadn't. These are cardboard characters, and the prose has all the cliched grace of a lead balloon (\\"Greg let enough sarcasm into his voice to let her know her opinion wouldn't faze him in the least one way or the other.\\"). Blood runs cold, someone takes a deep 'breathe,' and people say things like, \\"I never noticed how muscular your arms were before.\\" We're repeatedly told the sex (and the relationship) are meaningful without being shown any actual closeness developing between these two men who've known each other for just a few days by the end of the book.I appreciate a well-written sex scene as well as anybody, but at nearly ten cents a page, this wasn't remotely worth it. The book reads like fanfiction, and so I'm not terribly surprised to read in the biography that that's where the author 'got her start,' or that her credits include \\"unsold screenplays.\\" Know what you're buying."},{"Title":"Out There in the Night","review":"This book being only 130 pages, it is more of a novella than a novel. That being said, the author packs a lot of punch into those pages. This is fantastic paranormal erotica, or \\"slash.\\" The author must have done a good bit of research on Native Alaskans to give such a feeling of realism to the culture and rituals (even the imagined ones). The idea of a Native American skinwalker (werewolf) is richly explored here, and even the secondary characters are well developed. The love story between Connor and Adam is believable and there is plenty of sex. Overall, well worth the money."},{"Title":"Out There in the Night","review":"Well, naturally, I gave up on gay psychics and gay cops, favoring something a bit more fun. Werewolves. Due to past experiences with gay original fic, I wasn't expecting much. Therefore, I wasn't disappointed. Now, I'll go ahead and state that this book went -real- light on plot, but I've found that to be true with most of these types of stories. I will say that there was at least one character that I did NOT like, which is saying something. Why? Because I actually felt something for some of the characters. What was worse, IMHO, is that he got the -best- guy outta all of them! Guh! Where's the justice in that? If you're looking for a quick, porny read, I recommend this book. If you're looking for werewolf plot.... Well, I have no idea where to look for that, but I'm sure there's something out there with it. I will warn you, though. When it comes to the sex, it strikes me as border-line bestiality, which was... uhm. *twitch* Dude, he's in werewolf form sometimes!"},{"Title":"Out There in the Night","review":"If you're going to read this book, take a buddy. You'll need them to keep you from clawing your own eyes out.Besides the pseudo-bestiality, what else has gone wrong? Hmm. Flat characterization. Men with all of the emotional depth of twelve year old girls. Sex scenes that defy all physical possibility. Yes, it's fantasy. I mean, BESIDES the part where the guy turns into a wolf partway through coitus. I'm talking about \\"channels\\" that are apparently self-lubing, because the author doesn't help him out. I'm talking about non-existent refractory periods. There's also just something about the book that makes me think that the author hasn't 1) met many gay men, 2) doesn't know much about gay sex, 3) watch any gay porn, 4) know many men at all, or 5) done any research on Alaska or lived in a cold climate. Apparently the author spent all of her research time on dog wang.Futhermore, the author totally Otherizes the Native American protagonist and reduces him to the object of some kind of jungle fever. It's kind of offensive. Oh! Oh! Oh! And she actually uses a phrase that's like, \\"It's the female in you that allows you to be attracted to men,\\" so she's TOTALLY conflating transgenderism with homosexuality, and THAT'S pretty offensive, too.Anyway, this book reads like bad fanfic, so if that's what you're into, you should enjoy it. But if you're into bad fanfic, why pay for it? Great gag gift, though."},{"Title":"Out There in the Night","review":"I think had this book been labelled \\"romantic erotica\\" instead of romance, I would have been less disappointed with the story. Because having the characters say 'I love you' a lot doesn't make it a romance (especially when they've known each other for all of a day)! Both Connor and Adam felt very 'flat' to me- there wasn't anything to differentiate them from the surrounding characters, and the surrounding characters weren't painted all that vividly either. It's hard to get into a story like this when you don't care what happens to the characters. The heavy-handed exposition and info dumping was also quite irritating, as was the fetishization of aboriginal people."},{"Title":"Out There in the Night","review":"This is the best gay paranomal erotica I have read and I have read quite a few. The sex is steamy because this writer bares all with her words. Add to that a touch of magic and the sex is also sensual and alluring. As in \\"A bit of Rough\\", Ms Baumbach once again proved her talents. This story is not merely sizzling sex. Her characters, both main and secondary, are well developed and her world building skills is a pleasant surprise in this latest effort. I will read any m/m stories from this writer. Surfing her website I am glad she has quite a few planned in the horizon. Looking forward to her summer release in Loose-id website."},{"Title":"Out There in the Night","review":"This short, rather expensive m/m romance will probably please anyone looking for a quick read scattered with nicely executed sex scenes.The supernatural touch and the Alaskan setting will add to the pleasure with their exoticism.Ms Baumbach is a professional, she apparently set herself a task and she achieved it brilliantly: the plot flaws smoothly, her characters are nearly believable and rounded, the writing proficient.What is wrong? People reading my other reviews will probably have already understood.First of all, such an interesting plot could have easily supported more pages giving the reader more satisfaction and more fun for his/her money. This without burdening the easy, light romance and thus avoiding some clumsy quick personality descriptions.Second, sex scenes are well crafted -coming from a woman- but kind of repetitive, with silly renderings of moaning sounds and several description of intimate caresses either hard to believe or more suited for a heterosexual coupling.Third, the devastating superficiality of the author's views about love in general and gay love in particular. Even admitting that an easy to read romance has to comply with some set stereotypes they are unacceptable bording with the outrageous.One of her character is a beautiful, vulnerable, cub-like youth, the other an impossibly large, gorgeous, all manly stud. Sounds familiar? Of course if you have read \\"Bit of rough\\" by the same author, where we get exactly the same kind of dumb cub vs alpha male relationship. Not satisfied with the two main characters she sets the same trick with two side ones. Pleeeease...The necessary consequence to this cub to wolf love story I find also very questionable : the alpha male must perforce be sexually dominant and the cub submissive and finding nothing wrong with it. I mean: it has taken decades for harlequin lady authors to propose heroines with self assurance and a job, must we really face the same stereotype repeated in gay romance? Such relationships exist, of course, but should they be presented as commendable? No, Ms Baumbach, I really do not think so.Not to mention the fact that in an erotic novel this set stereotypes strongly limit the scope of the depicted sex scenes.Last but not least the author offers us a rather unexpected kind of lycantropy. It could have been a good idea, but one usually reads a paranormal romance for the kicks of the human vs monster relatioship. The werewolves here have nothing feral. They just look like overgrown and overlusty lapdogs. Not really thrilling, are they?I would have have given 0 stars but it was not possible... pity."},{"Title":"Out There in the Night","review":"I can't be the only one to see that I have a thing for &#34;shifters&#34; and &#34;werewolves&#34;!

Mature readers only.Note from reader to writer.........Great job on your endeavor in this genre...would love more from you. I liked it so much I'm purchasing it as gifts for friends with Kindles! ;D"},{"Title":"Out There in the Night","review":"Most of the story took place in a single cabin and was intense sex. Don't get me wrong, I love sex but not at the sacrfice of storyline. The story felt rushed and like there were too many things for such a short book and too many questions left unanswered. I loved the sex scenes at first, especially the canine overtones involved in the werewolf action, however, it became redundant and I found myself skimming over and through them. Certain words, phrases and descriptions were repeated to often or too close together. one metaphor I LOVED was the one about the child's toy scattering. Also, if you make a point of a character not putting on socks, don't have his lover take them off later. Overall it was a fun read and I would love to explore more works by this author before writing her off, especially since I adore some of her colleagues' work, unfortunately I have to write off this story. If you have some time to kill between bus stops and on your work break read this but don't add it to your book club list or curl up with it on a rainy day."},{"Title":"Out There in the Night","review":"This is worth the money and the time to read it.

I recommend it wholeheartedly."},{"Title":"Out There in the Night","review":"Werewolves in Alaska were what caught my attention and made me buy this book. I wasn't sorry I did. Baumbach builds an intriguing world in the story and Adam and Connor are likeable heroes. There's a lot of sex in this book, and most of it is a good mix of lust-driven and emotional. I found the sex in shifted form oddly intriguing. My one fault with the sex scenes is that there was a lot of repetitive language. I kept seeing some of the same phrases over and over. Still, I cared about the characters and was absorbed enough in their love scenes that the repetition wasn't a huge stumbling point. Overall this is a good one if you like hot, gay werewolf fiction."},{"Title":"Out There in the Night","review":"I wasn't sure what plot I was going to get with this book, but this was very good.

Now that Connor has started on his destiny, what about Greg---that undercurrent left me wondering what is up for him and the others in this story. I haven't checked out her website yet, but I will in a moment and am hoping some more is in the works for them."},{"Title":"Out There in the Night","review":"The sex was uber-fantastic! Great story of Alpha Male Wolf who unexpectedly finds his mate after waiting for 100 years! You can imagine how horny he was!! Connor is shy, young doctor with an obnoxious boyfriend. But not for long. When Adam (Alph) finds Connor injured he takes him to his cabin and begins nursing him back to health and then they bond! and bond! and bond!I thought it had a good storyline and I particularly liked that Connor's now ex-boyfriend showed a tender side for Connor but too late and that Connor's ex was then claimed by another shapeshifter working at the same clinic!I am looking forward to the sequel! Laura Baumback does not disappoint for those looking for erotic sex! FYI:This is also an e-book. Go Laura!!"},{"Title":"Out There in the Night","review":"Adam Lowell became a werewolf, or skinwalker in 1905. He's the son of a trapper father and a native Alaskan mother. Adam is drawn to the native Alaskan culture, especially the spiritual aspect which often invades his dreams. The attack that changed him to a skinwalker is at first painful, then freeing as his soul bonds with the creature destined to become part of him for all time.In 2005, Dr. Connor Jacy left his family practice in the city for the remote wilds of Alaska to practice medicine with Dr. Greg Pierce. While Connor and Greg are romantically involved, they aren't in love with each other. Connor longs for a commitment based relationship and since moving to Alaska he's been plagued by dreams of a fantasy lover that Connor instinctively knows is \\"the one\\" despite the fact that he's never seen the man in real life.After yet another disagreement with Greg, Connor's debating the wisdom of staying at the Alaskan clinic with Greg past the expiration of his contract. The relationship is going nowhere, chances are that he wouldn't stay with Greg as a lover, and there just doesn't seem to be any other gay men in the nearby area. His dreams/visions become stronger, but being a modern man, accepting the path of his dreams as possibly being a reality is staggering and that's before he even understands that he's been marked, a two-spirits (both human and were), and that the moon has claimed him. Connor has accepted that his and Greg's relationship is coming to an end when he is called out to deliver a baby for one of the locals. It's on the way back to the clinic that Connor and his guide are injured when the snowmobile they're riding mysteriously crashes. Connor is knocked unconscious when he's thrown from the snowmobile so he never saw the werewolf who came to claim him as its mate and carried him away.Alaska is the perfect setting for OUT THERE IN THE NIGHT. It's a wild untamed land that's full of mysteries, where you feel like anything can happen. I love the way Laura Baumbach is able to merge mythical creatures with modern day times and make it seem very real. Connor's down to earth simplistic dreams and way of coping with life is very sweet and endeared him to me. As rugged as Adam is, he's very gentle with Connor and you can tell he's waited a very long time to find his mate. All of the characters vary in intensity but they fascinated me and kept me glued to the pages as I ventured through each breathtaking scene throughout this book.Chrissy Dionne (courtesy of Romance Junkies)"},{"Title":"Out There in the Night","review":"Out There in the NightThe story is set in the outer reaches of Alaska, the characters are well developed and likeable.

The story gives just enough background for the story to make sense. a little drama leading up to the mating and a intense love scene exhibiting Conner's transformation into werewolf. This is a well paced story with a touch of intrigue, heartwarming and a few explicit sex scenes. The secondary characters adds interest and helps to define the main characters. The story is a Happy ever after with an opening left for a sequel. Overall this is an excellent werewolf story."},{"Title":"Out There in the Night","review":"A great plot combines with steamy sex for an interesting story, which is one of the best specimens for combining erotica and mythology."},{"Title":"Out There in the Night","review":"I don't really have much to say about this book except that it was one of the best books I've read that combined steamy (and I really do mean STEAMY), hot sex with a pretty generous plot. Might I add, it actually had a plot?I was very pleased in all genres the book contained: romance, fantasy, erotica, and maybe a little action/adventure."},{"Title":"Out There in the Night","review":"It kind of reminded me of a movie. Well, an NC17 movie, but still a movie. I found it a nice way to spend some time instead of watching television. Not a life changer, but it doesnt make you want to toss your kindle out the window either. Like I said it very enteraining."},{"Title":"Out There in the Night","review":"I'm not a big fan of insta-love, but this was definitely well written, so the insta-love is excusable in light of the whole supernatural mating bond thing. I would have paid $5 or $6 for this book and not been disappointed. At $0.99, it's a must-read."},{"Title":"Out There in the Night","review":"**spoiler alert** Pros: The Native American shifter, and the mythos woven into the story, is amazing. The flow of words, the narrative itself, the imagery -- all beautiful and engaging. The characters are lovely, believable, and you really are swept up in their story. I like being swept up.Cons: I have an issue when irreversible changes are done to a character without all the consequences adequately explained outside of a sexual situation. It reeks of dubious consent. And the fact that Conner isn't as angry at having choice ripped away from him as one would expect leaves me with that 'WTF' feeling."},{"Title":"Out There in the Night","review":"I'm going to say something about this book that I never thought I'd say: there was too much sex in this book. Now, I love smut and fluff and erotic content as much as the next person when reading slash, but at times this book felt like it was all porn and no substance. That's not to say that it was all bad either, but just a bit excessive at times.The book is your typical supernatural love story. Adam is a werewolf, Connor is destined to be his soulmate, and throughout the book Connor learns to come to terms with who and what the man that he loves is. With lots of hot sex to help convince the young doctor *LOL* I actually found the sidestory/secondary romance between Greg and Mitch (another werewolf) to be more enjoyable, however brief their scenes were, than the main couple.The romance was sweet, even if some of the sex seemed a bit forced at first, and the characters are rather endearing. All four of the main guys grow on you throughout the book, and that's probably the strong point of \\"Out There in the Night\\".Overall I enjoyed the book, but I can't say it's the most amazing thing I've ever read either. If you like sexy gay werewolf books, then go for it, it's not a waste of time. Just don't set your expectations too high.Oh, and an FYI? This book should have come with a warning for borderline beastiality. I have a pretty high tolerance for nontraditional sex scenes, but at times this book made me a bit uncomfortable. If you squick easy then tread lightly when considering this book."},{"Title":"Out There in the Night","review":"This book will melt igloos and cold hearts. Adam is one hot, hunky, \\"half-breed (half white, half Native American),\\" dominant, alpha male werewolf, and his mate (he knows it for years before Connor even appears on the scene) is a short, slender, young blond doctor named Connor Jacy. This book, evidently the first of a series, tells how the two became acquainted and became life-mates, overcoming the bitter Alaskan winter and the interference of Jacy's fellow doctor/kind of lover. I actually thought it worked pretty well, if you're willing to swallow the main premise of the existence of werewolves who don't really kill humans, but \\"control the balance of nature\\" (whatever the hell that means; it really isn't ever explained). The two lovers are incredibly hot together with some scorching sex scenes between them. There's not a lot of conflict between them (Connor isn't really given a choice in the matter of his mate or whether he becomes a werewolf himself), but the two exhibit a strong attraction for each other and develop a powerful passion between them. Good gay romance and hot sex. No depth of plotline, but what do you expect. Apparently, some reviewers expected more than they should have. If you want powerful gay romance, sex and passion, you can find it here. Go for it."},{"Title":"Out There in the Night","review":"Legend foretold of a wolf's mate that was of twin spirits. Dr. Conner Jacy doesn't know about this legend, but he dreams of a tall, dark, seductively handsome man who is the half that makes him whole. As an Alaskan Peninsula traveling health care physician, Conner thought he was happy. A fellow physician, Greg, has been his lover for five months, but something is missing. Something that Conner just can't stop thinking about. When Greg's selfishness becomes too much to bear, Conner volunteers to go through the Alaskan wilderness on a snowmobile to help a young Eskimo girl deliver a baby. On the way back to base, his snowmobile is attacked by a huge, black wolf and Conner is injured. Waking up in a strange cabin, Conner comes face to face with the man of his dreams and falls instantly in love.Adam has been waiting over 100 years for his mate. As the Alpha of a pack of Native American werewolf skin-walkers, Adam had almost given up until Fate decided differently; now he is at peace. Carrying an injured Conner into his cabin, Adam sets out to heal his mate. He cleans him, bandages his cuts and bruises, and then shares his body warmth with him. Adam knows that Conner is his destiny. Now, all he has to do is convince Conner of it. In order for the mating to be complete, Conner and Adam must mark each other three times. Plus, there is the added consequence of mating a werewolf...I had not read any previous teasers or summaries about Out There in the Night, so I began reading it without any hint of plot or content. For that, I am grateful because this story held me riveted from the moment I began to read. I am usually not a big fan of m/m or f/f books. However, Out There in the Night kept me enthralled until I read the last word. I could only wish for a mate who cared for me as much as Adam cared for Conner. As for Conner, he has to be the luckiest guy I have ever read about. Not only did he get an Alpha as a mate, but he is actually the one in control of the relationship because his mate lives to please him. All in all, a dream come true!Out There in the Night may be the first Laura Baumbach book I have read, but it won't be the last. I hope to read more from her soon! And for anyone wanting a great love story, Out There in the Night is that and more. Congratulations Ms. Baumbach on a truly, mind-opening, wonderful read!Taliareviewed for Joyfully Reviewed"},{"Title":"Out There in the Night","review":"Overall I enjoyed this book.Baumbach has added some very interesting canine characteristic to the sex of her werewolves, which gives the scenes a very unique and HOT feel. If you want traditional gay sex this book is not for you. These werewolves are all animal. The sex is hot and definitely out there, but if you pay attention the inhumanness belongs to the werewolf. Also I believe someone mentioned the no use of lubes or such things I have to ask did you read the surrounding context? I don't want to give anything away so all I will say is serious muscle relaxing techniques are applied.I will say I would have liked to see a bit more depth to Adam. And I think that a good thesaurus would have helped with a couple of the sex scenes.Now some have pointed out that there is way too much sex (of course I go HUH!?) Personally I don't agree. I hate reading books that have one sex scene and apparently the rest are either implied or nothing is even mentioned. And besides there is one sex scene that is important to establishing relationship dynamics, 1 that is essential to the main plot, and 1 that is the establishing of a new relationship. (and I will point out that 2 of those are not the main couple) All that sex another purpose. Showing the absolute sensuality of Baumbach's werewolves. And I have to say; yum!So as I said overall I liked it. There are some things that could have been improved but can't everything? And if you don't mind letting a little imagination in with you gay erotica I would definitely recommend this book.Also I really want more. Apparently there is supposed to be another book in this series. There are no details though so I have no idea if it will even be about this particular couple (who I adore!)"},{"Title":"Out There in the Night","review":"I bought this book with caution, mainly because every book I've found that claims to combine erotica with mythology ends up being nothing more than sex between humans within a fantasy story. Where's the human/mythical being erotica? And if finding the \\"real thing\\" is just about impossible, imagine hoping to find a M/M one.Here we finally have as close to the real thing as you'll find in \\"mainstream\\" publishing. There is plenty of conventional sex crammed into it's short length. But the scenes that really stand out are the ones where our werewolf friend is ravaging his newfound love in the best possible way, and the auther has the guts to intertwine transformation and (were)wolven physical attributes into the sex.There's *just* enough story to encapsulate all that steamy erotica. My only real wish (it doesn't really qualify as a complaint) would be that the protagonist didn't spend the entire book under the influence of several severe head injuries. He's always doubting what's going on and speculating on whether it's happening or a hallucination. If it were me, I'd want him to be clear-headed, fully aware and STILL loving it.If you're sick of the teasers and want real erotica with a real werewolf, this is your book. Again; it's a bummer that the werewolf is always viewed by the protagonist through a haze of concussion and suspected hallucination, and sometimes the werewolf physically refuses to let him see. I subtracted a star mainly because of my own preferences. Like I said, I'd want a more lucid description. Also, I had to take issue with a couple of tiny annoyances about his physical attributes - mainly dealing with certain parts of his fur being described as stiff and bristly where you'd want it to be soft.All in all though it was a very satisfying story and I wish there were more like it."},{"Title":"Out There in the Night","review":"I adored this book. I really did, and looking at some of the reviews I do agree with them to a point. Laura has made some interesting characters and a good premise that could have developed further. Short books irritate me too, especially if they're expensive to buy. I can only hope that her sequel will be longer, and in depth. Yes it is quality over quantity but the author could have done more with this story.Nevertheless I will rate this book 4/5 only because I think she made some fantastic characters."},{"Title":"Out There in the Night","review":"I have read a lot of books with M to M Writing. These books that she writes are very sensual and have a great story line. I enjoyed every moment of this book and all the others that she has written. It was absolutely wonderful. Her writing is very smoothe and constant. Her characters just flow together. A lot of the man on man books that I buy they are more for the sex then the romance, with hers there is both. I am definitely buying and more books that come out by her. I read different reviews about her books, but if you just read them and stop trying to be so critical of them you would enjoy them more. The only regret I have is that she does not write faster so that I can buy them.WAY TOO GO.Keep doing what you are doing and let no one stand in your way."},{"Title":"Pro Secrets of Heavy Rock Singing","review":"* First off, this is a very good book that I ejoyed quite a bit, and will go back to re-read several times, I'm sure. I'd give it 4.5 stars if I could. I say this because most of my comments below will sound a bit critical, but I don't mean to convey a negative impression, necessarily, I just state where this book might have been even better. Bill Martin did a fine job overall, IMO.This book was supposed to be entitled &quot;Metal Pipes&quot; from what I'd heard about beforehand, and only recently learned that it had been released under the eventual title. It's a very good read, mostly because of the interviews with star rock/metal singers. A couple of comments...1. The first section of chapters, which is actually quite short and repeats phrases/views from the subsequent interviews with the singers, is actually sort of okay, but not that good. If you've never learned anything about singing at all (e.g., the importance of hyrdation, warmup, and sleep/rest), it will be of help, but it is of limited value and really is a rather half-hearted attempt at delivering the basics of vocal production/technique and maintenance/care. It probably would have been better to integrate more on these topics with some of the sources cited on vocal technique/production and the interview comments/opinions in a summary section at the end of the book. The section on producing 'rasp' was quite unique, however, and one I've not seen before, even in Mark Baxter's &quot;Rock and Roll Singer's Survival Manual&quot;.2. Most of the interviews are quite good, but they are of varying quality, not because of the questions asked, but rather because some of the singers didn't really say that much in their responses (e.g., Rik Emmett, surprisingly). My favorite interview was with Tim &quot;Ripper&quot; Owens, who was very forthcoming in his responses (and he's a really good guy, I e-mailed with him a few times on vocal technique). I'd heard that Michael Matijevic, of Steelheart and &quot;Rock Star&quot; fame, was going to participate, but apparently this didn't ultimately happen.3. Finally, a word of caution - although most of these singers have had some lessons at some time in their careers, none of them are experts in vocal production, so I'd say to take their advice if it seems logical or workable, apply it, and if it doesn't seem to be working out for you, drop it. Just because they sing well does not mean that their advice will necessarily work for you - every voice is different.* Bottom line: Very good overall, could have been a bit better. Maybe I'll write a follow-up that addresses some of the shortcomings I saw in this book and interview some of the missing greats (e.g., Halford, Dio, Kiske)."},{"Title":"Pro Secrets of Heavy Rock Singing","review":"The title is unfair, because it leads you to think that you will actually have a solid vocal lessons book on heavy metal,It ain't true. the book should have been titled \\"Interviews with heavy rock singers\\". Now \\"Bill Martin\\" who ever you are, your book !!sucks!!. If the title would have been another, then it probably wouldn't suck. I wish somebody would write a real book on heavy rock singing. There are a lot of kids outhere that would love to learn this technique, and it is not fair that jerks that aren't even singers, take advantage of this by putting misleading titles to there books just to sell them."},{"Title":"Pro Secrets of Heavy Rock Singing","review":"This book is overall a great read. I am not a lead vocalist, I am a guitarist, but I know a lot about singing and other instruments. A few things I suggest you skip over are anything said by Chuck Billy(although I'm a huge fan of Testament, his vocal techniques are very harsh and damaging on your vocal chords)and the guy from Disturbed(he apparently damaged his voice so bad that he needed surgery). Other than that, this is a great book. Winger-haters, don't skip over the Kip Winger interview...Although Winger had horribly cheesy music, Kip is a very knowledgable musician and gives great advice. Bruce gives awesome but common warm-up tips, and James Labree obviously knows what he is talking aboot, eh? Geoff Tate's advice did not impress me. I expected more out of such a vocal god. I do recomend this book for any lead or backup vocalist. It gives great insight to whatever style you are playing, especially Metal. Well, I hope this review helped you. My Metal Hails hgo out to all of you!"},{"Title":"Pro Secrets of Heavy Rock Singing","review":"This is the first vocal instruction book for rock singers, which addresses the voice from the professional singer's point of view. Pro Secret's of Heavy Rock Singing contains 25 interviews from professional rock singers, such as, Bruce Dickinson of Iron Maiden, Geoff Tate of Queensryche, James Labrie of Dream Theater, and David Draiman of Disturbed.This book presents the \\"secrets\\" of professionals that will help you to sing like a professional, improve your range, increase your power and avoid vocal burnout. Bill covers the basic aspects of a rock singer's voice starting with voice types. He discusses voice range classifications and differences between male and female voices. He explains breath control and utilizing resonance for power. He then moves on to explain how to warm up the voice. Rock singing is about range and rasp, both of which are covered in detail. Finally, Bill touches on vocal health, discussing such important factors, such as hydration and sleep.This is an excellent book for getting the basics of rock singing. The book is worth buying for the interviews. What better way to learn how to sing rock, than by words of wisdom directly from the masters. Many of the singers discuss singing metal music by way of falsetto. I am not a big fan of using falsetto for singing all of your upper notes because I know that you can develop your full voice to achieve the same range. Regardless of each individual vocalists approach, each interview has several gems detrimental to developing your voice. I recommend this book for all serious rock and hard rock singers."},{"Title":"Pro Secrets of Heavy Rock Singing","review":"Just flipping through the first few pages it reads like just another vocal coaching book. But wait - get your form and posture correct because what you are about to read will change your vocals forever. Bill asks the best vocal singers the questions we all long to ask. This book delivers. Page after page I thought, \\"this is unbelievable!\\". These Metal Heroes really tell all their secrets. They share tips, tricks, techniques...everything!! I felt just by reading a couple of the singers interviews I could sing easier. This is the closest thing to a weight loss pill that requires no exercise. I just kept reading and thinking \\"I can do this now!\\". This book motivates as well as it removes mental barriers. It removed all the blocks I had. I can sing all the way to the limits of my range and 5 notes beyond what I thought was possible. There is no other book like this in any style of music. My only dissapointment was the fact that Halford and Steven Tyler weren't included. But then who would be left for the sequel? The quality of these singers interviewed in this book is literally the best in the world. I think heavy metal singing is the most difficult style in the first place. In this book you get all the masters of metal to tell you exactly how they do it. Does anyone agree that heavy metal singing is the hardest stlye? Ask Brittney Spears to sing Eyes of a Stranger- Queensryche. Ask Jennifer Lopez to sing Screaming for Vengence-Judas Priest. How about the Back Street Boys singing Time Bomb-Annihilator. How do you think they would sound? Only a few people can sing these songs and most, if not all, will own this book or they're in this book. Band together all heavy metal fans of the world. Buy this book and let these Metal Heroes show us the way."},{"Title":"Pro Secrets of Heavy Rock Singing","review":"I agree with Gregg in previous review. The book (or should we call it a magazine?) consists mainly of interviews with rock stars on techniques they're using. There are no vocal lessons as stated in description. If you're looking for vocal excersizes, this is not quite the book.The picture of the product is deceptive - it's actually white, with the fill of what's displayed here and this fill takes on only 1/3 of the front cover.Again, I agree, the title should be changed."},{"Title":"Pro Secrets of Heavy Rock Singing","review":"The title of the book is a bit deceiving. If one does not know what kind of information it consists, then you would be under the assumption that the title \\"Pro Secret of Heavy Rock Singing\\" would be an instructional book of how to sing heavy rock. Since it's cheesy anyway to have any kind of instructional material of how to sing rock I found what this book has inside is more valuable. It does consists of some basic vocal explanation, but mostly it's heavy laden with opinions and interviews with some of the most famous metal singers. Famous vocal books like Jerome Hines' \\"Great Singers On Great Singing\\" has always been one of my favorites on my shelve, cause Hines took the time to interview famous opera singers about their opinion on singing. This book does the same concept. It deserves a high rating just for that fact that the writer Bill Martin took the time to find people like Geoff Tate, Bruce Dickinson, James Labrie, etc. and interview them about singing. The interview consists of questions like: Range, Warm-Ups, Preparation, Sensation, Technique, Health etc,. You'll also find out about of their influences, and how they started to sing. I have to admit that their were some metal singers I was not familiar with, but then again for the fact that Bill Martin got Dickinson and Joe Lynn Turner to give lengthy answers is worth the price of the book. When I saw at the end of the book the further reading that Martin recommended I agreed with his recommendation 75%. Bill Martin is not off track. I am sure he knows quite a bit about vocal theory, but do we need another instructional book? Bill Martin gave me exactly what I am more interested in. Interviews of famous rock singers that have various different opinions. Some are good, and some bad, but it's up to you to discern what will work for you. This book is a testimony of what they do, and it becomes valuable when you are trying to align your own theory what works for you with somebody else. Anybody that truly considers themself a singer will attest that singing is a personal discovery. So another \\"how to sing rock\\" book is ridiculous in my opinion, cause rock to begin with has a primitive edge to it. The attitude has always been \\"don't think just rock.\\" Interviews like Geoffe Tate's was especially hard to get a solid answer, but to Tate's credit he answered the best he could. The reason is simple. It's hard for a some singers to explain what they are doing, cause intrinsically it works for them, and the truth of the matter is IT MIGHT NOT WORK FOR YOU. The point for books like these is to find one singer that answers your long awaited questions, and that confirms a technique that personally works for you. I sensed a common thread to all these singers. That they are naturally gifted with their vocal endowment in their genre. So some do attest that their voices did improve through certain methods, but they already had those kind of voices. Why am I stating the obvious? It's because the obvious is that if you think you are going to be a metal vocal god, and you have a James Taylor voice, than you are sorely mistaken that a rock instructional cd or book will get you pipes like James Labrie. I hope the important point you get from reading this book is that every singer is different, and also hopefully you will find that there are some close defined theories, but they are not set in stone. Hopefully through the testimony of some these singers you will begin to be inspired to work hard and find your own pro secrets of rock singing."},{"Title":"Pro Secrets of Heavy Rock Singing","review":"I gave this book to friend that has been singing for a long time. He indicated that he learned so much from the book in such a short time. He knew he was doing things differently too as he was getting sore muscles from singing in a more appropriate fashion. He has improved and is very happy to have such a reference book in his collection!"},{"Title":"Pro Secrets of Heavy Rock Singing","review":"As a long time fan of heavy rock, I found this book to be original, providing very useful tips from the legends themselves. I've not found anything else like it. It was exciting to hear about the pros' secrets to success. Heavy metal singing is a difficult genre. It takes a special style and hard work. This book breaks down the steps. It's easy to digest, motivating and enjoyable to read. You'll be off and singing before you know it. I highly recommend you check it out!!!

I love this book especially because it isn't commercial at all (even though I love her depictions of popular cartoons), but instead is her own interpretation of these favorite stories, which I find inspiring. Also, she keeps it very simple to the point that, though I haven't started on one yet, I can easily see that the shapes and designs are basic enough that one can leave the more complex details out and still have a great looking result. In that sense it's her least intimidating book so far! By basic I don't mean that you won't have a lot of colors to work with -- which is time-consuming of course, coloring and rolling the different pieces of sugarpaste, etc. But if that doesn't scare you off, it's definitely a good addition to any cake book collection, makes me smile just to look at, and one of the best value-for-money I've gotten this year."},{"Title":"Enchanted Cakes for Children (Merehurst Cake Decorating)","review":"This book is great and has lots of colored pictures.

So I found it on Amazon. Debbie Brown has a gift for making beautiful, creative cakes of all kinds, as exhibited in all of her books. The photos are lovely and there are lots of hints and tips and step by step photographs for creating the elements. The creations really do seem easier to make than you'd expect, and many of the characters are merely like little edible \\"clay\\" creations. She includes all the basic information needed to create such cakes to make it accessible to beginners, from cake construction to modeling figures, adding details and so on. The cakes have interchangeable elements and you can make as much detail or as little or you want or combine elements from several cakes to make your own creation. Using edible paints and glitter, these cakes really sparkle. Her characters and her architecture (castles, teapot houses, sleeping beauty's bed, sunken treasure ship, etc.) are so very charming. The fruit in the fruit fairy cake looks so real! She also includes templates in the back of the book.Very helpful is the table of contents which includes the name of the cake creation, along with a picture--so at a 2 page glance, you can see the entire contents of the book without having to flip through the pages, and to compare cakes to each other. I wish I had this book in time for the mermaid and pirate birthday party I had for my daughters. These cakes are too pretty to eat, though!This book includes many fairy tale favorites (Peter Pan, Snow White, Sleeping Beauty, mermaids and sea life, Cinderella, wizards, witches, fairies, dragons, knights, an Arabian palace, enchanted castle, elves and more.)

The tales evoke the lifestyle and atmosphere of this very particular place and time in a way that makes the book special. I don't live too far from this region, and once lived even closer, so I can recognize some of the natural features of the landscape, but it is still hard to imagine what life was like there so long ago, when bobcats roamed the mountains and a railroad (long since discontinued) carried passengers from town to town. The title comes from a group of mixed-race people (whose ancestors were local Indians, Dutch settlers and slaves), called Eagle-Nesters who settled in the region long ago.Some of these stories contain supernatural elements such as ghosts and changelings. There are recurring characters, such as the old Eagle-Nester of the title, who is something of a witch who makes baskets, tells fortunes and serves a mysterious tea that has an unusual effect on people. Most of the stories are very low-key and focus on the often difficult everyday lives of the people, who were basically pioneers living off the land. They are true regional folk tales, variations on ones the author, herself a native of this area, heard as a child. The stories are atmospheric, quaint and well told. They will not appeal to people looking for suspense, action or melodrama. On the other hand, if you usually seek those things, this book might be a good way to look at life from a different perspective and appreciate a slower paced way of life that has all but disappeared from modern society."},{"Title":"Nesting Birds of a Tropical Frontier: The Lower Rio Grande Valley of Texas (Perspectives on South Texas, sponsored by Texas A&M; University-Kingsville)","review":"The Lower Rio Grande Valley of southern Texas, the LRGV to any knowledgeable birding enthusiast, is THE place to witness the widest diversity and greater number of bird species anywhere in the United States including even Alaska. More than 500 different species have been seen at one time or another in the Valley including dozens of birds from Mexico that rarely if ever get more than a few miles north of that nation's boundary. Though there have been several interesting guides to the \\"where\\" of these birds--guides that highlight the best spots in the area to see the wonderful diversity that exists--there has not until now been a careful, encyclopedic examination of those birds. Timothy Brush, a biology professor at the University of Texas-Pan American, has filled that void in Nesting Birds of a Tropical Frontier.No-one would argue that Brush's wonderful study is the type of book that anyone would want to curl up with in front of a warm fire on a cold night but for anybody interesting in the fauna of southern Texas, it is a proverbial gold mine. Brush provides an extremely thorough examination of each of the many birds which nest throughout the Lower Rio Grande Valley. His volume is filled with scientific data galore but it is never uninteresting thanks in large part to the many frequent personal asides which the author includes and which allow us to see not only a scientist but also an avid birder at work.Unquestionably this relatively small volume will remain the authoritative study of southern Texas' birdlife for decades to come."},{"Title":"Nesting Birds of a Tropical Frontier: The Lower Rio Grande Valley of Texas (Perspectives on South Texas, sponsored by Texas A&M; University-Kingsville)","review":"An excellent overview of the breeding birds along the Rio Grande of South Texas.

The illustrations, while fun and bright, date the book. Of course, young kids probably won't care about that.The illustrations add to the text, but it's the text itself that really stands out. The dialogue is realistic and feels very comfortable--almost like a family member recounting a story we all know. The young first-person narrative adds to that effect, and the asides make me grin. The topic (wheedling Mom into keeping a cat) is appealing to many kids--so beware if you're a parent who doesn't want a pet!This is definitely a \\"read to\\" book rather than a book for a young child to read themselves, with three short paragraphs per page being typical. This is an excellent book to read together; you might check your local library to see if they have a copy, too."},{"Title":"103 Questions Children Ask about Right from Wrong (Questions Children Ask)","review":"This book has sparked many conversations on why things we do are right or wrong.

It requires some thought and effort, as with Saramago's other books, but the rewards are great. To the people in bookclubs, I would advise to stick to Grisham and leave the serious literature to others."},{"Title":"The History of the Siege of Lisbon","review":"this is not the best of saramago but it is nothing to trought away you must unsderstand the new way of writting, whitch is not convencional to read a saramago you must left your references marks behind and try to adopt some new ones: the saramago's to read this book you must be patient or try BLINDESS more madure but...even more difficult. However, after enter the book, you can not stop."},{"Title":"The History of the Siege of Lisbon","review":"There are moments in Saramago's treatise that are positively spellbinding, pearls of wisdom uttered in an almost incidental poetry. Unfortunately, these passages are too few and too far between. The histroy of the story is mildly interesting; the hisorical farce, or the farce of history is an intriguing idea, but perhaps better served in a novella. The idea runs out of steam. The love intertest is mildly alluring but so tepid by North American standards as to be stale. It suggests an innocence and vulnerabillity that could perhaps hve been the ideal of Victorian courtship.This personal, emotional parallel story becomes almost childish. Love stories work in conflict; the rose in the desert metaphor, and assorted literary fodder. Yet in Saramago I see the strong spiritual current alluded to in the Nobel synopsis of his work, and this is most engaging, at best almost Blake, but, at times degenerating to what seems a Papal harangue. I do recommend this book, but only for true lovers of literature. If you got even a quarter of the way through Tristram Shandy, you'll finish the Siege of Lisbon."},{"Title":"The History of the Siege of Lisbon","review":"The author (translator?) ignores the standard use of quotation marks. This makes it extremely difficult to follow conversations in the book. So I was completely distracted from the actual content of the book."},{"Title":"The History of the Siege of Lisbon","review":"After reading this book, I am very surprised that this author won the Nobel Prize. I did not find this book ingenious; I found it ponderous and laboured. The idea behind the story is intriguing, but the potential is never realized. The style of writing is such that the reader must really work to follow what is going on. In my case, the story and the protagonist were not sufficiently interesting to warrant such effort."},{"Title":"The History of the Siege of Lisbon","review":"I'm sure Saramago's Nobel Prize was not based on this work. Not one person in my book group was able to finish this book because of the tedious, run-on sentences (the first chapter is all one sentence), and characters too shallow to care about plodding further. The initial premise was interesting -- how one word could change the entire perspective of historical events -- but failed to deliver."},{"Title":"The History of the Siege of Lisbon","review":"my whole reading group found this book extreamely dissappointing. It was the first time in years that most of us did not finish a book we were going to discuss. While Saramago's idea of imagining what would happen if the iberian penninsula were to break off from the rest of Europe is mildly amusing, after twenty pages, he runs out of ideas and keeps repeating himself over and over, in long complex sentances that take quite an effort to read. he does not develope interesting caracters - he creates a series of stick figures. there is no real plot to speak of, just a series of random travels. maybe the magic of this book is completely lost in translation."},{"Title":"The History of the Siege of Lisbon","review":"After reading The year of the death of Ricardo Reis a book I thought was one of the best ever written and Blindness (not quite the best book ever written) I thought by buying this I was in for a good read...wrong!Jose Saramago continues his bizarre obsession with young women being attracted to decrepid old men (as he does in all his books) The story is thin, uninteresting and leads nowhere and the siege (read massacre) of the Muslims of Lisbon by the 'brave' crusader knights seems to have little to do with the plot apart from add a little sexual sleeze (the gang rape of a Arab woman by crusader knights) and some ill placed Portuguese nationalism."},{"Title":"The History of the Siege of Lisbon","review":"The one line summary says it all. A perefct ornament. Reading it is a different story. Very poorly written or an incredibly poor translation. Can you imagine writing like this? Hooray to the run on sentences! Grade F"},{"Title":"The History of the Siege of Lisbon","review":"This is a beautiful book and I am surprised at the poor reviews here. What a wonderful way with language Saramago has! A book that is, in its very essence, a reflection on language and writing. Its cast of characters include a proofreader, books that have been written, the narrator (is he then the ultimate writer?) and of course we, the readers who, through Saramago's genius, become an intimate part of the novel. And what a brilliant idea that history can be revised by changing the way it is written! Could one perhaps conclude then that the exquisite love affair between the proofreader and the woman at the publishing house is really a love affair between the author and the reader?"},{"Title":"The History of the Siege of Lisbon","review":"A man no longer needs a woman. He has his work. And he has the prostitutes downtown. He is too old. He is too conservative. He is content to live his life through the books he proofreads.In a process of professional malpractice he alters history and encounters a love he never expected.In 'The History of the Seige of Lisbon,' Saramago has created an epic love story. Where many love stories stumble over cliches of plot and word, 'The History' is about the emotions, confusions, and distractions of new love: the angst of imagining our objet with another, the pain of waiting for the phone to ring, and the primal need to distract ourselves from obsessing on our own vices and virtues.Conventional prose fails to capture these emotions. Saramago give us something else.Saramago reveals the intimacy of all our relationships --with others, with places, and with history. His description of Lisbon isn't that of a travel guide but of an intimate. His retelling of the crusader's seige of Lisbon shows the patience and care of a father rather than the reserved impartiality of an academic.Not since Mordecai Richler's 'Barney's Version' have I read such a brilliant story that reveals a love for person, place, and time."},{"Title":"The History of the Siege of Lisbon","review":"saramago's odd use of punctuation, especially for dialog, is indeed difficult to get used to. he forces us to think differently about how words fit and form, and the power of alteration.at the core is the sweet, furtive love story of a quiet middle-aged proof reader and his immediate superior, who has been assigned to oversee his work and prevent further alterations of history. beautifully erotic in places, this work is for the patient reader and may take some time to read and re-read."},{"Title":"The History of the Siege of Lisbon","review":"If you can handle a reworking of the concept of 'punctuation' as we know it, Saramago's History of the Siege of Lisbon is well worth reading. It's not easy, by any stretch of the imagination: dialogue becomes a single block of text, single paragraphs go on for pages with no breaks and often without a period, and the whole concept of 'run-on sentence' is mostly ignored.But it adds an incredible flow to this book. Based on a fairly simple premise--adding a single word to a history to change the entire course of the story--the book rises above plot, due in large part to the aforementioned style. Once you get used to it, the dialogue feels completely natural, not forced at all, and the sub-story of love between the proofreader and his editor falls into place perfectly. The characters are well developed to a fault, and by the end of the novel, you feel like you know them on a personal basis.And it's got a two-page discussion of the beauty of toast. How can you not be fascinated? (&quot;...it is so perfect and crunchy golden brown that one thinks one could go without the butter entirely, but you'd be a fool, only a fool would forego the butter...&quot;)Overall, it took me a solid two weeks to finish this book, but it was worth my time: I completely understand why Saramago won the Nobel Prize."},{"Title":"The History of the Siege of Lisbon","review":"this book was one of the surprises of 1999. I was intrigued by the title since I am a history buff, and impressed by the fact that Jose saragmago had won the Nobel prize for Literature. I had never even heard of him. The book was a total delight, in both the language and the idea it presented--how a proofreader, by altering a single word, can devastate a book and completely alter its meaning. The proofreader in question, a middle-aged quasi failure in his profession conceives a daring idea how to gain attention, and he follows through with his plan, with the expected results. The wit and deftness of the author are apparent from the beginning, and the development midstream is totally unexpected. I highly recommend this book to anyone with a literary bent and a taste for the bizarre."},{"Title":"The History of the Siege of Lisbon","review":"I'm not one of those people who throws around words like brilliant and genius. But.Saramago seems to me to have created a new form of writing here. The language is astonishing, exhilarating, its twists and turns some kind of sorcerer's spell. A mischievous, laughing conjurer of irony. His frequent asides to the reader, abashed corrections of his own turns of phrase--I don't know, maybe this turns off some people, but it drew me ever further into the labyrinthine and quite sly workings of the narrative. Saramago is doing something unprecedented here. I'd say he's reinvented the English language itself--but then I remember that the novel was written in Portuguese and the translation I read probably provided only a shadow of the glee that explodes from the original.I can't believe some readers seem to have found the book repetitive or silly or boring. For me it opened new vistas and showed that a literary genius can still create something miraculous and new.The day after I started reading the book, it was announced that Saramago had won the Nobel Prize. Then I learned that he is a leading Portuguese communist, and that made me even happier. Then the Vatican issued a stinging denunciation of the Nobel committee for giving the prize to an atheist. Saramago held a news conference and said he'd sooner give up the prize than renounce his atheism. So not only is he an innovator on a par with the greatest artists--but he's one of us, a worker, one of the few remaining artists who refuses to sell out, renounce his class, or let bourgeois norms dictate his art.Reading The History of the Siege of Lisbon was like drinking down a bracing antidote to the deadly dreck that usually passes for literature."},{"Title":"The History of the Siege of Lisbon","review":"Readers of Saramago will recognize the protagonist of this disarmingly charming novel from his other work: a reclusive, shy, bachelor who works in a Kafkaesque world as an unseen, undistinguished clerk and who, one day, inexplicably does something that shatters the routine and frees him from the daily grind. In this story, Raimundo Silva is a proofreader and his act of rebellion is to insert a single word --\\"not\\"--into the manuscript on the history of the siege of Lisbon. Upon publication, the book states (incorrectly) that foreign crusaders did not help the Portuguese with the 12th-century siege that wrested Lisbon from the Moors.From such seemingly trite and random events emanate massive life changes (and subversive comedies). When his publisher discovers the embarrassing and costly error, they hire a new boss to oversee the proofreaders. Instead of mistrusting her new charge, however, she is intrigued by his inexplicable act of subversiveness, and she subtly (well, not that subtly) recommends that he write his own book, an entry in the genre of alternative history: what would have happened if the Crusaders had indeed turned down King Afonso's request for aid? Silva takes up the challenge, and the remainder of the Saramago's novel alternates (often within the same sentence) between Silva's imaginary book and his subsequent life in Lisbon.At the most obvious level, Saramago is commenting on the tension between historiography and history, between fiction and veracity. Furthermore, there are many parallels--in themes, in characters, in style, in plot--between this book and Saramago's later novel, \\"All the Names.\\" And, as always, the author's snakelike, page-long sentences demand much from the reader even as they offer insight, beauty, wit, and comedy.What's unexpected here, however, is the depth of the twin love stories that develop in both the novel and the novel-within-the-novel. \\"I don't know how people loved at that time,\\" confesses Silva to his own new love about the challenge of writing his book. Her advice: \\"Invent a love story without any amorous words, . . . assuming such a thing is possible.\\" But his confession and her response are not only about the historical work at hand; they also serve as veiled remarks about the couple's own nascent relationship. In addition to questioning the very nature of how we conceive and recall history, Saramago's novel teases out the human passions behind the parade of names and events selected for the official versions in the chronicles."},{"Title":"The History of the Siege of Lisbon","review":"It is not exactly a fetching title for a work of fiction!It sounds like... well, a history book, does it not?And in a sense, it is a history book, but one that basically, from start to finish, speculates upon what exactly a book of \\"history\\" is! It questions the nature of history and the relationship of words to truth and reality.Much like another favorite author of mine [Ian McEwan], Saramago's fiction capitalizes on the effects of seemingly innocuous antecedent causes. He has the uncanny ability of constructing looming fictional mountains from the most shadowless of molehills.In Siege of Lisbon, he is writing at the height of his powers.Our protagonist is Raimundo Silva, a middle-aged, quiet, [somewhat] celibate bachelor, well-respected for his years of accuracy as proof-reader for a well-known publishing house.One day, while proof-reading a standard text of the history of the siege of Lisbon, Raimundo inexplicably succumbs to an urge to insert one word in the concluding portions of the text.This word \\"not\\" [the most shadowless of molehills] amounts to a sort of re-invention of the founding myth of Portugal. As amended by Silva, the text now reads that the crusaders did not come to the aid of the 12th-century Portuguese King who was laying siege to Lisbon, aiming to expel the Moors from the area.Silva submits his bastardized work and then lives twelve full days of angst-riddled guilt, pending discovery and punishment, both of which duly arrive in the form of a pre-judged tribunal, with Raimundo in the dock!He is acquitted of his offense, but put on probation. And to deal with any further lapses in proof-reading efficiency, the publisher has hired a new executive. The young, voluptuous, alluring and astute Maria Sara, to whom Raimundo will be obligated to report.Rather than being reproachful, Maria is fascinated with Raimundo's anarchic ways.In a private meeting, she proposes that he write his own version of the siege of Lisbon... the version which would elaborate upon his insertion of the word \\"not.\\" Initially, he feels unequal to the task, but soon becomes equally obsessed with the idea, and sets out upon his assignment.But this is not the only obsession now alive in Raimundo. Along with the project, he is also obsessed with Maria, and she, with him.What follows in the book before us is an amazing intertwining of history with fiction.As in, it happens not only in the book that is in our own hands, but also in the one that Raimundo is writing, for he creates a love story within his fictionalized \\"history\\" that mirrors his own burgeoning relationship with Maria.What we hold in our hands is:a) a contemporary love story, set in modern-day Lisbon.b) an unorthodox \\"Raimundo-ized\\" retelling of events surrounding the actual siege of Lisbon in 1147, which itself resolves into a believable love affair between a common soldier and a knight's concubine.c) a wonderfully rich and rewarding Saramagian discourse on the mutability of history, and the inadequacy of words to describe what is [too often] perceived as fact.This being the eighth Saramago novel I have read, it saddens me to think there is only one left for me to read through for the first time. [The Year of the Death of Ricardo Reis]. The thing about Jose Saramago is that each novel is so good, that while you are reading it, you feel a loyalty to claiming that it is his best work. I felt that way repeatedly during the reading of The History of the Siege of Lisbon.Sentences and passages run off into the horizon like an endlessly rolling landscape. His use of punctuation is completely not normal. Some of his sentences go on for pages at a time, spliced together with a sand-on-the-seashore amount of commas. Within sentences, new speakers speak, with no use of quotation marks differentiating one from the other.If Saramago submitted to any sort of standardized Grammar Test [something I cannot imagine him doing...] any teacher would have to fail him. Then, were that same teacher to read something by Saramago, she would find that the old man has much to teach her, about grammar.Such unconventionality extends even to the narration. In Saramago, the narrator must be listed as a principle character so absorbingly digressive and ubiquitously intercalary that he is nowhere non-evident, often stumbling forward to inform the reader that there are certain things that even he cannot possibly know, and hence, in humble non-omniscience, he must remain silent upon these issues!In a word, if you have not experienced the work of Jose Saramago, I greatly encourage you to dive in. And The History of the Siege of Lisbon seems to me as good a place as any, to begin."},{"Title":"The History of the Siege of Lisbon","review":"This is a challenging book to read. It's easy to get discouraged. I fortunately had several long plane rides, so I ploughed through and was really thrilled when it was all done--thrilled enough to run out immediately and buy _The Gospel According to Jesus Christ_.

Though intellectually challenging, it's not syntactically head-spinning, and I would recommend it before this book as a first exposure to Saramago."},{"Title":"The History of the Siege of Lisbon","review":"This was my first Saramago book. I read it in 2000, and I am still amazed by it. once you get pass the first few pages you'll get a feeling for the style of the book and you'll start enjoying it.The story reminded me of something obvious about history: history, as we know it, is written by the winners. Losers do not have much to say when looking back to recollect what happened. The winner's biases are all over history books and the loser's perspective is lost in the way. The book is much more that that, there is a love story in the background, and there are beautiful descriptions of the city of Lisbon."},{"Title":"The History of the Siege of Lisbon","review":"After reading two Saramagos novels (Balthasar and Blimunda, Blindness), this one is quit down to earth. It has two main strands, one being essay on (re)writing the history, and the other is about two love stories. As for the former we are not reading some dry philosophical musing, but one concrete 'example': the siege of Lisbon in the AD 1147. We can find some fine points (which are not stated explicitely by Saramago): main sources are 'professional' christians (monks, friars, bishops) and in this particular case winners (losers are Moors), so their bias must be taken into account for example how can you trust the author who wrote down the miracles of the dead knight (here soem apologies might be in order, but that is not in the spirit of Saramago).So Raimundo Silva who worked as proofreader for just issued 'official' version of The History of the Siege of Lisbon, starts to write alternative version of The History of the Siege of Lisbon - from more or less from the same sources but with different accents and with some artistic liberty. And where did impetus for this rewriting come from? From the Maria Sara, his new boss. It may be speculated, he writes new history to impress here and yes they fall in love.And they are mirrored in the year 1147 with Mogueime - a foot soldier - and Ouroana - kidnapped girl who serves as concubine to before mentioned miracle-doing knight. Their story is depicted zen like; they have just two lines - he: What is your name? .. I'm Mogueime. she: My name is Ouroana. Of course Saramago tells this much more beautiful and not only once."},{"Title":"The History of the Siege of Lisbon","review":"Simply amazing. Pick this book up, read the first few pages: if you are not convinced that Sarmago is a brilliant master of language after the initial dialogue between himself and the author, then this book is not for you. He meanders with a timeless freedom; a soul of pure art bound to a body and mind very much of this earth. The truly amazing thing, is that i read this in translation. It would seem this type of exploratory word-smithing novel would be literally lost in translation. Not so! it breathes. Kudos to the translator. I am considering learning Portuguese just so i can read native Saramago! It would probably take me a lifetime to truly make headway in it though since 'History..' challenged my English. Then again, i'm a computer/engineering guy, so that's not saying much ;)"},{"Title":"The History of the Siege of Lisbon","review":"The book is riveting, I really can't say more than that. Like alot of his characters and plots in his other works, you are pulled in and stuck until you realize you need to get up for work in two hours.You need to be familiar with portuguese history and culture to get a lot of his humor, but even if you arent his overall jabs on human nature make the book still soooo worth it. He has the ability to mock and yet show humanity in its best light. He, again teaches you how to laugh at yourself and our situation without losing respect for it."},{"Title":"The History of the Siege of Lisbon","review":"never thought I will be drowned into a book describing professional relationships between 2 men. nevertheless, the history of the siege of lisebon has done it to me. the way saramgo is painting every detail, his amazingly assotiative writing gets to higher peaks in this book. a must to saramago fans, or as a starting point in geting addicted to his books."},{"Title":"The History of the Siege of Lisbon","review":"A book within a book. A history inside a history. Paradoxes that defy the intelligence of macho readers (Cortazar dixit) and that shows that the power of literature lies on the reader, and the way that, each time a new pairs of eyes sets upon a it, the book changes, has new answers, different perspectives, and illuminates everything and everyone that touches it. So, just one word can change the course of history? Yes, when its mere purpose is to change the way you view at things. An incredible tour de force, that travels through your mind swiftly, kindly, like a warm summer day, and that will give you a new perspective on rythm in literature. Do yourself a favour: Get lost in Lisbon and with Maria Sara, and then decide with whom you will fall in love"},{"Title":"The History of the Siege of Lisbon","review":"Very briefly, the unfortunate souls who have given this work a poor rating are undoubtably those who would flunk Umberto Eco's &quot;reader's test&quot;. Saramago, with his unique use of punctuation and line-division, is clearly separating the sheep from the goats. The result, should you accept the challenge he has posed, is a work which is engaging, moving, delicately erotic in the truest sense, and which sustains its momentum to the last page."},{"Title":"The History of the Siege of Lisbon","review":"Raimundo Silva is a reclusive bachelor who works as proofreader for a publishing house. One day, carried away by an irresistible impulse when revising a historical text, he introduces a &#34;no&#34; where a &#34;yes&#34; should be, and so alters History. His bosses take notice and give him a severe reprimand, especially one Maria Sara, a new, young, and good-looking executive. So Raimundo goes on working, and the novel tells us about his everyday life and the relationship that begins to develop between he and Maria Sara, mixed with the false history of the Siege of Lisbon, occurred in 1147 when a band of Crusaders, on their way to the Holy Land, agreed to help Alphonse I of Portugal to recover the city, which had been in the hands of Moors for centuries.With his elaborate prose on long paragraphs, where voices, ages and situations get mixed up, but nevertheless lucid and beautiful, Saramago recounts the vicissitudes, travails and adventures of the besieging Crusaders and the resisting Moors, as well as the new life that begins to happen to Raimundo by gradually falling in love with Maria Sara and finding out that he is well-received. During his walks through the city, Raimundo recreates its history, the long and hazardous development that populated the hills surrounding the bay. During these walks he befriends a stray dog, who one day disappears leaving him feeling identified with that dispossessed and lonely being, just as he was before reuniting, at the same time, with Love and with his city, reborn under the magic of its history.Against my expectations, for I thought this would be a presumptuous and excruciating narrative, it turned to be a simple, warm, and lovely story, which elicits sympathy for the characters and an urgent desire to visit Lisbon. It is a good novel which, though it makes use of narrative techniques typical of the XX Century's vanguards, nevertheless is never a difficult text, but instead it flows smoothly and leaves one with a good aftertaste."},{"Title":"The History of the Siege of Lisbon","review":"If you have not read him before, it may take some getting used to. Once you adapt to the idea that a sentence may contain dialogue from more than one person,take place at widely separated times and contain little or no punctuation, it is a wonderful book to read.The book moves between the present and the past. In the present a proof reader faces the consquences of having purposely changed a text entrusted to him, while in the past events unfold with history as amended by the proofreader.

An ordinary (or not so) book reviewer decides to alter one of the most important episodes of the History of Europe. A simple change - a No for a Yes - and the Crusades don't help Portugal's first king to conquer Lisbon! In fact they did, but just find out how things 'really' happened because of this very imaginative 'ordinary' book reviewer."},{"Title":"The History of the Siege of Lisbon","review":"I have had a difficult time deciding how many stars I should appoint to \\"The History of the Siege of Lisbon\\", and here's why--I found the following passage to be a pragmatic and insightful observation of human character:\\"...We're positively mad, Do you mean us, No, I was referring to people in general, I'm one of those people who thinks that human beings have always been mentally deranged, As platitudes go, that isn't bad, Perhaps it will sound less like a platitude if I tell you that in my opinion madness is the result of the shock produced in man by his own intelligence and we still haven't recovered from the trauma three million years later...\\"This is part of a conversation between the two main contemporary characters in the book, Raimundo Silva and Maria Sara, and no matter how many times I re-read it, ticking off sentence by sentence, I cannot tell who believes human beings to be mentally deranged, Raimundo Silva or Maria Sara. I suspect these words belong to Silva because they have a male arrogance about them, but that's not the point. These words could just as easily have come from Maria Sara. It is possible that Saramago meant for the reader to be confused, to show his characters becoming one mentally as well as physically, but I don't think so. I think that in the original Portuguese there is some gender inflection that casts this dialog in context.Perhaps, perhaps not, but here's the rub: When an author abandons the norms of punctuation and structure in order to create a different ambience within the story, well, the story better work. This could be the most difficult book I have ever read. I am even thinking back to my days with Proust and Dostoevsky, and I think Saramago's got them beat. I experienced moments of sincere enjoyment, but these were few. For the most part this book was pure work, confusing and slow. But within the confused sentence structure I could sometimes sense a meter; I could detect an order and flow to the words and I found an irony there. Saramago's main character, a proof-reader, alters history by changing a single word in a historical text, launching a hidden narrative that reaches out from medieval times to connect with the present--islands in the stream of time. The continuity of timelessness is what Saramago represents with his run-on sentence structure, and his lines in the Portuguese must read with the beauty of verse. Alas, this beauty is lost in the English translation, like a crucial change in a historical account, creating a much different story, almost a mystery...interesting, now I must re-read the book. Brilliant! Five stars."},{"Title":"The History of the Siege of Lisbon","review":"When I started reading this book, all I knew about Saramago was that he had won the Nobel Prize for Literature; so I did not know what to expect. Although the publisher compares him to Borges, Rushdie, and Garcia Marquez, what we have in the man from Portugal is a true native original.We are introduced to the dusty world of a professional proofreader -- a fussy type who regrets having two gerunds in his name. I felt as if I were propelled into MOLLOY or some other of Beckett's novels as the beginning spiralled around this seemingly unlikely character.Suddenly, everything changes. At a critical juncture in a history of the siege of Lisbon he is proofreading, Silva suddenly introduces a caret and adds the word &quot;not&quot; -- thus completely changing the history.His new boss, a Dr Maria Sara is enchanted by this Bartleby-like act of negation. She challenges Silva to write a &quot;what if&quot; novel on the supposition that the history occurred as modified by the &quot;not&quot;: that the Crusaders, instead of helping the King of Portugal defeat the Moors, actually sailed on to the Holy Land directly.Meanwhile, Silva is clearly becoming enchanted with Maria Sara. What ensues is both the strangest and most convincing of love stories. Silva writes his book, brings us into the thick of the history as he imagines the various characters from the blind muezzin to the German knight to the king himself. All along, he and Maria are romancing each other through the events of the siege.What an incredible ride! Saramago is a master at easing from one world into another and taking us with him. He is both a master story-teller and an authentic modern in his handling of a character's state of mind -- a writer who easily could hold his own in the company of the great writers of our time."},{"Title":"The History of the Siege of Lisbon","review":"Before we begin, I must confess that Jos&eacute; Saramago is one of my favorite authors. His creativity, social critiques, and pseudo-realism in works like Blindness, The Stone Raft, and All the Names leave spellbinding memories etched in my brain. With Saramago's recent passing, I felt it necessary to finally read his Nobel Prize winning book, The History of the Siege of Lisbon.Characteristic of Saramago's work, The History of the Siege of Lisbon contains long flowing sentences with little punctuation. Where a period would usually suffice, Saramago inserts a comma; where quotation marks typically reside, he deletes them. With these characteristics in mind, the book requires a close reading.The History of the Siege of Lisbon follows a lonely proof-reader named Raimundo Silva through his secluded lifestyle within the remarkable metropolis of Lisbon. Raimundo's only friends seem to be reference books on grammar and his only hobby is to correct the thoughts of others. One day while Raimundo edits a book detailing the history of the siege of Lisbon, he decides to create instead of edit. Where the book once reminded us that the crusaders came to the aid of the Portuguese in the war against the Moors, Raimundo's newly revised edition concludes that the crusaders most certainly did not heed the call to help their Portuguese brethren. A simple \\"no\\" not only alters the course of history, it also modifies his relationship with his publishing house. Ultimately, Raimundo's talent is the only thing that keeps him from unemployment.The turmoil generated by a proofreader's decision to create instead of edit brings Raimundo some unlikely benefit: the publishing house hires a lovely woman named Maria Sara to proofread the proofreaders. As the narrative expands, Raimundo and Maria's relationship slowly turns from professional to something slightly more romantic. Raimundo's brazen attempt to alter a historical fact intrigues Maria and one day she encourages him to finish the history of the siege of Lisbon with the changed premise regarding the crusaders. What follows is a masterfully blended tale of both Raimundo and Maria's relationship and the relationship of characters developed in the revised history book Raimundo writes at the request of Maria Sara.\\"The two roses in the vase are standing in water from which they draw nourishment, it is true that they do not last long, but relatively speaking, neither do we\\" (285).The History of the Siege of Lisbon is ultimately a book about life, death, and the relationships that keep us going. Years pass on a clock and years pass on a face, but the more important part of life is the relationship you have with the people around you, the joy of having a second rose in the vase.As mentioned before, The History of the Siege of Lisbon is a challenging read. Jos&eacute; Saramago's unique style coupled with a story told in two dimensions requires an astute eye. However, persistence pays off with this book as the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. I wholeheartedly recommend this book to anyone who is willing to work through the challenging syntax in order to see the narrative as a whole. However, if you are new to Jos&eacute; Saramago, I urge you to start with a more popular work such as Blindness.Originally published at [...]"},{"Title":"The History of the Siege of Lisbon","review":"Raimundo Silva, 50+,is a proofreader living alone in the oldest part of Lisbon. The publishing house he works for has trusted his corrections to many of their texts for years, yet one day on impulse he decides to alter a book, \\"The History of the Siege of Lisbon\\", by inserting a word of his own. Where the author writes that the crusaders on their way to the Holy Land stayed to help the Portugese conquer the city of Lisbon and drive out the Muslims, Raimundo inserts the word \\"not\\" saying the crusaders did not help the Portugese changing the whole meaning of what the author had written. His employers are embarrassed when the book makes it to publication and Raimundo is reprimanded, made to write a letter of apology and told he'll be reporting to a new boss, a woman, responsible for checking all his corrections.His new boss and lover to be, Maria Sara convinces him to re-write the history of Lisbon with the word \\"not\\", and as he reimagines the siege of Lisbon, he reimagines his own life and falls in love for the first time. Slow moving, philosophical, this is a romantic & sensual love story, especially for mature readers as well as being great historical fiction. This book was my introduction to Portugese history some years ago.Saramago's style is challenging as usual, single paragraphs that go on for 2 pages, sentences that meander for half a page, whole conversations in a single sentence. Personally I find his way of writing fluid and beautiful, like being right inside the character's head flowing along with his thoughts. He certainly deserved to win the Nobel Prize for literature."},{"Title":"The History of the Siege of Lisbon","review":"I read this book, hoping for something eye opening and startlingly and amazingly overwhelming like The Stone Raft, but this book did not have that same ability to captivate. I cannot deny that The History of... is a well-crafted and, well, for lack of better diction, interesting book. It is. I read it with interest and sometimes amusement. The main character is charming, and you learn that his career as an editor has been long, distinguished and honorable (if indeed an editor can be called \\"honorable\\"). In his entire career he has never abused his position, but one day, as you will read, he does... and his liberty changes everything. Indeed Saramago raises interesting questions with this concept... when you change one single word, even the smallest of words, the entire meaning of everything can be changed. Saramago, naturally, delves more deeply into this subject in the book than I will here, but I think the book is worth reading simply for the merits of Saramago's verbal and philosophical meanderings."},{"Title":"The History of the Siege of Lisbon","review":"Jose Saramago's \\"The History of the Siege of Lisbon\\" is simultaneously both very funny and very sober. At times it is out-loud laughingly hilarious, especially Raimundo Silva's internal dialogues with his alter ego. At other times, it makes you ponder the reliability and veracity of any historical document or text. You learn a lot about Portuguese beginnings.Once you overcome your frustration with Saramago's style, only then will you fully appreciate this masterpiece of intelligence, sacrilege, history, and love. Don't get hung up on criticizing his lack of punctuation, long sentences, big vocabulary, and how hard you have to work at knowing who is talking and when they stop talking or when the narration begins and ends. Too many of the negative reviewers here fail to get past their rather silly reactions to style, like prim schoolmarms bristling at a boy's hat worn backwards. That's too bad. If you become angry at a writer for \\"how\\" he writes, you will never appreciate the message.I spent 5 weeks in Lisbon in January and February 2010. I carried the book with me, reading it at lunch and in coffee shops. I asked virtually every Portuguese person I met if they had read this book. About 95% said \\"no,\\" but virtually all of those who had not read it had -- nonetheless -- formed an opinion about it, based only on Saramago's stylistic reputation, but never did these people have an opinion about the contents of the book!! Imagine that!! None really knew what the book was about. But to a person, they said, \\"Well, people either hate Saramago, or love him. No one is neutral.\\" How true!The most fun I had in Lisbon was retracing the steps of the main character, Raimundo Silva, as he walked up and down the steep hilly streets near his home on Rua do Milagre de Santo Antonio in the old part of Lisbon near the Castelo de Sao Jorge. Silva's episode with the starving mongrel dog near the Escadinhas Sao Crispim (134 steps) is filled with pathos and humor, revealing a generous side of Silva not seen earlier in the story, when at first he seemed so self-absorbed and introverted. I looked long and hard for Caf&eacute; Graciosa, Silva's favorite respite from his proof-reading tasks and later from his crazed hesitancy about falling in love. Alas, this caf&eacute; seems not to exist, even though there is a painting of it by Raymond Lang Chandler, entitled, \\"Caf&eacute; Graciosa.\\"Well, what is this book about? The main message is seen on page 96 with Dr. Maria Sara (Silva's eventual soul-mate) speaking, \\"...the \`Not' you slipped in that day (to the manuscript he was proof-reading) will prove to be the most important act in your life.\\" A small, virtually insignificant act, even when intentional, often begins a path from which we can never fully deviate. Years later, we look back at that moment (if blessed with awareness) and only then realize its importance. For Silva, it was the beginning of the most meaningful era of his life. Secondarily, Saramago speaks to us about history, in this case the 12th Century actual siege of Lisbon. He brings the back-then characters and their awful existence to life, and the reader empathizes with both the Moors and the \\"Portuguese.\\" (There really was not a Portugal as we know it at that time.) He questions what history is real and what actually happened in the way history books describe it. True or no? What history sources are reliable and valid? If the reverse had occurred what then? For instance, what if Germany and Japan had won World War II? What would your life be like today? See, \\"Resistance,\\" by Owen Sheers, for another example of reversed (modern day) history, the imaginary invasion of Britain by the Nazis. It's no intellectual powerhouse like \\"The History of the Siege of Lisbon,\\" but worth a read for a flight into imaginary history.One thing that I liked in \\"The History of the Siege...\\" was the strength and purposefulness of all the women characters, from Silva's housekeeper, to his lover, to the receptionist at the publisher's offices. Even in the \\"re-told and re-invented\\" history of the siege of Lisbon without the Crusader's help, the primary historical woman character was also made of steel. As Arturo Perez-Reverte, Saramago writes women very well. As a side note, I noticed that two of the main female characters were named \\"Sara,\\" as if Sara-mago saw something of himself in both of these women.The writing is simply beautiful. Page 263, \\"...shadows in the room suddenly lit up, no doubt because over by the straits the evening clouds had opened up, and the last rays of sun were coming through the window, oblique, casting over that side of the wall a flickering light the colour of cherries...\\" The translation is first rate.While the modern part of the story (early 1990's Lisbon) is more interesting than the 12th Century siege part of the story, one part could not exist without the other. I loved the humor, the wry perspective on life, the challenge to history and the tensions of love. From start to finish, it's a 5."},{"Title":"The History of the Siege of Lisbon","review":"When I first read this book eight years ago I thought immediately that Saramago would, one day, win the Nobel price. This year my wife came with the announcement: someone from Portugal. I immediately guessed : Saramago. You won't be able to put down this book once you start. It contains two very different but converging (in a publishing house) : that otf the siege and conquest of Lisbon from the moors by the Galician king Afonso, and a most exquisite love affair between a proofreader and an executive lady at the publishing house, both unmarried and getting on in years."},{"Title":"The History of the Siege of Lisbon","review":"I could blather on about what a great book this is but I'll concentrate on the impact it had on me personally. This book convincingly describes the way a love affair turns an ordinary man's dull life into a creative one. The main character, inspired by a new girlfriend, hesitantly metamorphoses from proofreader to author.It's a failure's redemption, as if J. Alfred Prufrock suddenly got his stuff together. I'm assuming that the proofreader's character has at least some parallels with Saramago himself, because I know he didn't begin his career as a writer until later in life. In any case, I found the whole proofreader-in-love-becomes-author plot inspiring and pleasant (without being unnecessarily sentimental or romanticized) and if you're bookish enough to be reading this review online, you might, too."},{"Title":"The History of the Siege of Lisbon","review":"There are moments in Saramago's treatise that are positively spellbinding, pearls of wisdom uttered in an almost incidental poetry. Unfortunately, these passages are too few and too far between. The histroy of the story is mildly interesting; the hisorical farce, or the farce of history is an intriguing idea, but perhaps better served in a novella. The idea runs out of steam. The love intertest is mildly alluring but so tepid by North American standards as to be stale. It suggests an innocence and vulnerabillity that could perhaps hve been the ideal of Victorian courtship.This personal, emotional parallel story becomes almost childish. Love stories work in conflict; the rose in the desert metaphor, and assorted literary fodder. Yet in Saramago I see the strong spiritual current alluded to in the Nobel synopsis of his work, and this is most engaging, at best almost Blake, but, at times degenerating to what seems a Papal harangue. I do recommend this book, but only for true lovers of literature. If you got even a quarter of the way through Tristram Shandy, you'll finish the Siege of Lisbon."},{"Title":"The History of the Siege of Lisbon","review":"One afternoon while proofreading a book titled \\"The History of the Siege of Lisbon\\", timid and reserved proofreader Raimundo Silva decides to insert a \\"NOT\\" where there decidedly should not be one, effectively rewriting the entire history he has been entrusted to fact check. He knows this will cause trouble, possibly the loss of his job, but in an unusual burst of recklessness, he leaves the \\"NOT\\" in and submits his rewritten book as accurate. From this simplest of premises, Saramago weaves a compelling tale of Portugal, the history of the siege of Lisbon (but not as history tells it), and a love story between Raimundo and an unexpected admirer.After his error is discovered three agonizing weeks later, Raimundo is challenged by his editor to actually write the History of the Siege of Lisbon but with the \\"NOT\\" intact. Raimundo accepts this challenge, only to realize that history (even when rewritten) is not simple enough to merely change. He struggles with this rewrite and is forced to contemplate history, books about history, interpretations of history, and what he, in fact, is attempting to do. Meanwhile, Saramago deftly parallels Raimundo's budding relationship with his admirer with the siege itself (as rewritten).\\"The History of the Siege of Lisbon\\" is funny, educational, full of clever surprises, and incredibly well written. Saramago- consider this a warning- is highly stylized, however, eschewing such devices as quotations, dialogue breaks, paragraphs that aren't pages long, and others. For some, this makes for difficult reading. If you can get pass the peculiarities of his style, then you are in for one memorable read."},{"Title":"The History of the Siege of Lisbon","review":"Without doubt, much of Jose Saramago's work is an acquired taste (although his complementary novels BLINDNESS and SEEING along with THE DOUBLE are rather more easily approachable). His writing style is often dense, with page-long sentences nearly devoid of punctuation but littered with enough parenthetical asides and digressions to suggest some bizarre form of authorial attention deficit disorder. Yet for all his storytelling whimsy, his ramblings inevitably have a point, and not just for the sardonic, occasionally biting sarcasms he tosses into their mix. An acquired taste, yes, but one well worth acquiring.In THE HISTORY OF THE SIEGE OF LISBON, Saramago introduces us to one Raimundo Benvindo Silva, a paragon of that most mundane and thankless of professions: the proofreader. Mr. Silva's lifestyle positively screams the stereotype: middle-aged, bookish to excess, consumed by minutiae and trivia, unmarried (although an occasional patron of prostitutes), without close family, not particularly handsome, prone to dyeing his hair in a hopeless effort to stave off the old age he knows he is entering. He has been charged by the publishing house with whom he works as a stringer to proofread a certain new work of Portuguese history entitled \\"The History of the Siege of Lisbon.\\" This book ostensibly details the twelfth century retaking of Lisbon by the Christian Portuguese from the hands of the Moors.One afternoon, for reasons he himself does not understand, Silva elects to violate the principles of his craft by inserting a word in the author's draft text. Not just any word, but one that directly contradicts both the author's statement as well as the \\"known facts\\" of Portuguese history. This capricious, intentionally destructive act sets off a chain of unanticipated and unlikely events, including an effort on Mr. Silva's part to rewrite the siege's history to conform to the very facts he previously negated in the book he was proofreading.The above provides the barest of outlines for the earliest parts of the book, setting the stage for a set of parallel (and improbable) love stories, one taking place in the twelfth century, the other in current times. Along the way, Mr. Saramago has more than ample opportunity to contemplate the notion of history and the processes of historiography. How real are source documents, and can we truly understand today words that may have been pronounced and heard differently in a different era? How much of history is selective, and by whom are those facts selected or ignored and then interpreted? In certain respects, Saramago here is channeling Leo Tolstoy, whose great Napoleanic era masterpiece, WAR AND PEACE, is a discourse on and contemplation of the concept of history. It was Tolstoy himself who wrote, \\"For a historian, considering the contribution rendered by some person towards a certain goal, there are heroes; for the artist, considering the correspondence of this person to all sides of life, there cannot and should not be any heroes, but there should be people.\\" And thus it is in THE HISTORY OF THE SIEGE OF LISBON -- there are people.Of particular note in this novel is the blind muezzin who calls the Moslem faithful to prayer from his towering perch over twelfth century Lisbon. This nameless old man is the book's most enigmatic character, and perhaps its central one as well. Sightless as he is, he represents historians who cannot see history directly but only infer it from senses or sources (even if they are seated in a high tower). Even amidst the historical events of the moment, those within which they happen to live, historians are unable to see them clearly or in full perspective. The historian nevertheless writes, thereby calling his or her faithful readers to attend.THE HISTORY OF THE SIEGE OF LISBON provides an interesting contemplation of history and the usual array of Saramago's sly asides, but it falls a bit short of his other works (THE STONE RAFT, THE GOSPEL ACCORDING TO JESUS CHRIST, THE CAVE) in holding the reader's interest. The current-day love story feels totally unmotivated and artificial, a literary convenience that lacks believability and seems almost more of a distraction than an integral element of the novel. Nevertheless, as with all things Saramago, the patient reader will be rewarded with more than a few things about which to think."},{"Title":"Foundations of Theological Study: A Sourcebook","review":"This is a good book for those who are interested in this subject, otherwise it can be a hard read for the fact of lack of interest."},{"Title":"The Irish Connection","review":"Although this is George Feild's first novel, his craft is very readable and impressive with the obvious efforts he undertook for convincing details.

If there had to be a choice I would probably opt for the new 1999 Penguin Guide to CDs that just came out. For those seeking low price quality CDs, this guide is excellent although some of the more contemporary and obscure (lesser known)composers are scarely covered.This is a keeper but should be supplemented by a comprehensive guide as well for those really into classical CDs. Now, if Penguin only had an Index, like Gramophone? But, Penguin justifies each of its choices rather than just reviewing one and listing others as does Gramophone.For this alone, pushed I opt for Penguin over Gramophone. Incidentally look up almost any work and seldom is there agreement on the best works. Are music critics like economists, too?

It is a complement to the 1996 guide as well as the 1998 update. It is particularly interesting because it reviews many older yet famous recordings that I was not familiar with and makes collecting easier and less risk taking as it rates sound quality. It's nice to know that many great recordings are available for a fraction of the cost of their full price editions . Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Torment, Incorporated (Nexus)","review":"Normally I avoid this genre, but when one of my kinkier friends recommended Torment Incorporated I gave it a try. It's got everything I look for in an LA novel: harsh cynicism, a disturbing linkage between the American workplace and sexual dominance, Richard Nixon, and the entire twisted Southern California Dream haunting the whole mess. I'll be keeping my eyes open for the next Murilee Martin novel- she could be to erotic fiction what Ellroy was for crime fiction."},{"Title":"Torment, Incorporated (Nexus)","review":"I had a great time reading this book with my girlfriend! It is so much more intelligent and funny than the usual tie 'em up, tie 'em down books we've read in this genre. The erotic scenes are so well detailed that I could nearly feel the heavy breathing on my skin. I was immediately drawn into Ed and Charlene's twisted California world of sex, deceipt and mayhem.I hightly recommend this book! It turned on my mind, my funny bone and other things..."},{"Title":"Science and the Bible in a Troubled World","review":"Crouch begins with a brief, historical overview of the Bible, its oral traditions and how it came to be recorded. &quot;The Bible,&quot; he points out, &quot;had to describe things in simple terms that early men could write and understand. So it allegorically described a Creation in six days, with man being formed from the dust of the earth.&quot; From the creation of the universe, Crouch proceeds to marry science and theology.The book is divided into 7 sections. The second section is a collection of musings on the Garden of Eden, the 10 Commandments, Burnt Offerings and the Parables of Jesus. He points out that the 3rd commandment has had an immense affect on the customs and laws of world societies.The 3rd chapter is devoted entirely to reconciling evolution and the Biblical account of creation. In Chapter 4, Crouch describes what is right and what is wrong in current scientific thinking (which changes as technology develops). He points out that three crucial events can't be explained by science: The creation of the universe, the creation of the first living cell, and the development of man as the only living creature who has intelligence and an understanding and knowledge of God.In the last three chapters Crouch covers a number of issues: among them gravity, electricity, chemical reactions. Lucky accidents, he asks? He sails into spacement, UFOs, government money and medical hoaxes with jubilant abandon.Readable, thoughtful, entertaining and arguable. A great book for a book club discussion."},{"Title":"Organizational Behavior","review":"I thought this book was one of the worst textbooks I have ever picked up. The best thing about it was finishing it! Organizational Behavior is not the only class I am taking and yet I poured way more time and effort into reading this book than it deserved. It is NOT student friendly. There are no callouts and I simply believe there is a better way to deliver this information than I experienced in this text. That's not to say there isn't a ton of good information in it, but that it's poorly organized and assumes that the reader is familiar with organizational behavior and will know the references the author names by last name only. Also, the entire first chapter was spent telling the reader what he will learn in the remaining 17 chapters. Get on with it. Throughout, the author continues to reference what the reader will learn in upcoming chapters. STOP IT. Revise this piece of junk to something more student-friendly. When I am a teacher, I will not come close to asking my students to use this. I do not recommend this book for someone who is not planning on becoming an organizational behavior major. If you're a teacher, please don't ask your student to read this. Terrible."},{"Title":"Organizational Behavior","review":"I used this book for an Organizational Behavior graduate course. The overall topic is very interesting, however, the book is incredibly hard to get through. It seems that all of the long drawn out chapters could be cut down easily to a tenth of their size, while still conveying all the necessary information. I found myself spending several hours reading each of the chapters, only to find that the same information was just being regurgitated over and over again. And I had to read many of the sentences over and over until they made sense. Though such an interesting topic, it was difficult, time consuming, and frustrating to get through the whole book."},{"Title":"Organizational Behavior","review":"This was one of the worst textbooks I've ever read. It drones on in excruciating detail for pages before finally stating the main point or idea. People don't think that way. State what you're talking about and then give the supporting details and examples. Not the other way around. It is a very frustrating read. I had to reference other resources in order understand the theories and concepts presented in this book."},{"Title":"Organizational Behavior","review":"This book is about inflicting pain on the reader. It is incredibly difficult to understand and absorb the ideas presented in this book, as the author has a dull, long-winded, and pedantic writing style. Requires rereading many sentences, often just to understand the sentence structure itself, let alone its meaning and context within that section of the book. I can't believe the author intended this as an introduction to Organizational Behavior."},{"Title":"Organizational Behavior","review":"Fred Luthans presents OB in a great light.

It gives you the most important issues in points rather than full text, which increases your efficiency with little effort! Its USMLE-case-type questions focus more on the treatment. I wish there could be more questions to give us more practice for the exam. It includes introduction to Anesthesiology, but unfortunately not Urology &amp; Orthopedic surgery. In addition, it doesn't have many pictures or diagrams e.g. x-rays, diseases mechanisms."},{"Title":"General Surgery (Board Review Series)","review":"Previous reviewer is right on the money.

The practice questions in this book are very useful. I used both this book and the old student manual (course 801) from Novell to study for the exam. This book hasn't mentioned about ARCNet. Make sure you get some additional information from the student manual as well. Of course, you still need to know how to use MTL SupportSource and the Support Connection CDs. I highly recommended to study the exam with this valuable book."},{"Title":"Exam Cram for Service and Support CNE (Exam: 50-635)","review":"Well, 3 stars...why because they only target Netware5 related questions. I just missed out the first exams, and after a resit passed. The exam relates to all netware versions, 3/4/5 which the book does not advise.

I am currently using it for a project on the historic role of the death penalty. I only have a library copy, but I really want to find one to own. Although amazon doesn't have it offered to purchase currently. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Nursing Mother's Companion","review":"This book is a wonderful tool to use if breastfeeding your child. It breaks down the breastfeeding experience into specific time periods (first week, first two weeks, first two months, months 2 to 6, etc.) and details problems and solutions specific to that time period. I found the solutions to be incredibly helpful- clogged ducts and latching-on difficulties were two problems I had with my first child, and the book's step by step method for correction was right on target. The author provides help in developing your child's diet as they start to eat solid food and continue nursing, and helps in the weaning process, all the while never making you feel guilty if you don't nurse until your child is four years old, but not making you feel guilty if you nurse that long either. The book is especially useful for first-time breastfeeding, although I did refer back to it a few times with my second child. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Nursing Mother's Companion","review":"I am a first time mother, and took nursing classes while in the hospital after giving birth. They were a big help, but it was easy to forget specifics after going home. This book was a life saver! Especially when I had to face the questioning/criticism of my mother in law and other well meaning friends who told me not to nurse my baby every two hours, to let her sleep, etc. After 11 weeks of exclusively and very successfully nursing my daughter, I am happy to have had this book to refer to!! Because I followed the advice in this book, my milk came in right away, and has been plentiful since! The book also helped me deduce that my newborn's &quot;colic&quot; was possibly a reaction to cow's milk protein (which my pediatrician said was unlikely), as well as her awful facial rash (which my pediatrician labled excema). This book suggested eliminating dairy from my diet for 2 weeks, and then reintroducing it; sure enough the symtoms went away and then reappeared briefly until I eliminated dairy again. My baby has clear skin and does not cry for hours, and hasn't for weeks! I'm buying 2 copies of this book for pregnant friends!"},{"Title":"The Nursing Mother's Companion","review":"After taking two breastfeeding classes through WIC (Women, Infants and Children) and two classes ofered through my hospital - I didn't want to hear another insight on breastfeeding - everything any instructor said always contradicted the other person...I really wasn't planning on reading anything on breastfeeding, because I didn't think there was anything to it...out of all of my childcare books, every reference seemed so clinical - and boring. When my son was born via emergency cesearean on the 4th of January, I was visited by a lactation consultant in my recovery room. Though we were progressing wonderfully and he was latching on fine - I was surprised with all of the questions I suddenly had...after all, I was planning on doing this for AT LEAST 9 months...she recommended this book, I ordered it from Amazon (and it arrived quickly in pristine condition!) and it really is great. I have questions every day and we are now on week 3 of nursing. If you are pregnant (or already have a child for that matter!) and think that you might need a breastfeeding book - get this one. The layout is great and all info. very relevant and helpful."},{"Title":"The Nursing Mother's Companion","review":"Having received an sampling of this book in my hospital goody bag, I ordered the full copy. It was so informative, and enlightening. A lot of information is not available to new mother's on breastfeeding, and support is not always readily available. Many times new mothers give up. But this book will give you the courage to go on. It is technical, and provides answers to the most commonly asked questions, as well as information on obscure problems and drug interactions. I highly recommend this book!"},{"Title":"The Nursing Mother's Companion","review":"One thing about breastfeeding that you can't understand until you do it is that it is a constantly evolving process. Once you think you've got it down, something new starts happening. This book guides you through all the stages with in-depth information. I found myself returning to it often over the two years I nursed by son. None of my other baby books came close to the level of knowledge and understanding this book presents. The book certainly advocates breastfeeding, but in a non-judgmental way (not suggesting that you wrap it up by six months or suggesting you're a bad mother if you do); I really appreciated this attitude."},{"Title":"The Nursing Mother's Companion","review":"The Nursing Mother's Companion is so informative, concise, well-laid out, and comprehensive that I don't know how I would have survived learning to breastfeed without it.It answered ALL of my questions as I was trying to master nursing my baby. It has chapters that go in-depth on all subjects relating to breastfeeding as well as wonderful \\"Survival Guide\\" sections that help you quickly pinpoint problems, tell you why you're having them, and then give you solutions that actually work and work well. When you're in pain (physical or emotional) from learning such a new skill, you want answers as quickly as possible.This book covers preparation during pregnancy, learning to breastfeed, and it continues to teach and help throughout your entire nursing experience. It has sections on special circumstances like nursing premature babies, adopted babies, and babies with conditions or diseases that make nursing difficult. It also has advise for mothers with special circumstances.One more aspect about this book that was wonderful was it's non-preachy tone. The author asserts that breast is best (which you probably know if you're reading the book), explains why, then moves on to the practical matters of breastfeeding. No annoying and repetitive condemnation of anyone choosing to formula feed.This is a wonderful book! I recommend it to everyone who is breastfeeding and give it as shower gifts to soon-to-be nursing moms."},{"Title":"The Nursing Mother's Companion","review":"I have had several breastfeeding books over the course of the last 10 years, but this is the only one I use. My third child is now 9 months old and continuing to nurse while making a great transition to table food (this book has excellent advice on how to make this happen!). I had a previous edition with my older 2 children--it was a lifesaver with my second. I thought I had nursing down to an art after nursing my daughter 22 months, but my older son did not \\"get it\\". I felt encouraged to hang in there with lots of ideas from the book and worked with a lactation consultant, who taught my son how to suck. He also nursed till 22 months.I lost my old copy between children, and picked up this new version when I found out I was pregnant again, because I didn't want to be without it. The new edition is even more fantastic--I wish I had had it five years ago with my older son. I would have known we were in trouble a lot sooner and needed help.My younger son was a great nurser from the start, partially due to advice from this book(the parts on building a good milk supply are essential to success), and I will continue to use this book until it's time to wean him.Recently I purchased this book as a baby shower present for a first-time mom. She was really pleased and interested in the \\"Survival Guide\\" sections. I have recommended it to countless friends and strangers alike. If you aren't sure you want to breastfeed, read this book. Kathleen Huggins is not preachy; she just gives the most up-to-date info on the benefits to both baby and mom, not just in terms of physical health, but also in connecting with your baby."},{"Title":"The Nursing Mother's Companion","review":"My first child's step-grandmother gave me an old copy of this book when she was born and I had decided to nurse her. I put the book on the shelf and, as an exhausted first-time working mom, never got around to reading it. Now I'm a new mom again, and one day I randomly picked the book off the shelf and finally read it. What a wonderful book! I sincerely wish I had read it BEFORE I had my first baby. Besides being a great resource on the how-to's of breastfeeding, the book covers all the difficult problems and issues the nursing mom may face. Huggins describes and helps you diagnose nursing problems, and provides good information about how and why these problems may occur. Her advice and solutions are clear, concise, and highlighted throughout the book. I had planned to breastfeed my daughter for at least a year, but she weaned at 9 months. When I read this book, I thought of all the things I could have done differently (and better) when I had nursed my daughter. This time around I am determined to breastfeed my son for at least a year. When I run into nursing problems, I will refer to Dr. Sears to remind myself why I decided to breastfeed in the first place, then I'll refer to this book to figure out how to overcome them."},{"Title":"The Nursing Mother's Companion","review":"This is an excellent resource to have before and throughout your nursing experience with your first or subsequent children! I read it through and later used it as a guide for problems I encountered. I have read five of the most reccomended books on this subject, and this is the one I go back to over and over. It is thorough, has depth, is comprehensive, and is supportive, but not pushy. It discusses the many reasons to nurse (this section is accurate and well-writen). It also takes you through the major stages your baby goes through during his/her nursing years), then after each of these sections, there is a chapter on common problems encounterred during each period. Also included is information about expressing milk, going back to work, nursing the older child, and weaning. In addition it discusses special situations, and has included several wonderful appendices. I continue to use this book even today. I reccommend it to all of my friends planning to have children and/or breastfeed! I wish I had had this book as a guide for my first child. I definately would have been more successful at breastfeeding with the support and knowledge this book provides!"},{"Title":"The Nursing Mother's Companion","review":"I have been breastfeeding my new baby for 7 weeks now and had some problems getting started. I really wanted to breastfeed and was so upset when our pediatrician hinted we might want to throw in the towel. If it were not for this book, we probably would have just given up. I am so glad we persevered. It is going so well now and the baby and I are both so happy. While this book doesn't replace a lactation consultant, it is like having one on call 24 hours a day. It provides reassurance and step by step instructions for just about anything that can come up and has valuable information to help prevent problems from happening at all. I would highly recommend this to anyone considering or planning to breast feed. It's really the only book you'll need. You may not have any trouble at all but just in case you do, have this book on hand and save yourself and your baby many teary and sleepless days and nights."},{"Title":"The Nursing Mother's Companion","review":"If you want to learn about breastfeeding your baby, this book is certainly helpful.If you want to be passionately inspired about all the reasons you should breastfeed (which is especially helpful in those first few DIFFICULT weeks), you should turn to Bill and Martha Sears' The Breastfeeding Book.I bought both books as a first time breastfeeding mom, who at first thought breastfeeding was terrible and exhausting (which it was the first few weeks). Now at 4 months, my baby hasn't had a bottle yet, and it was because of how much the other book motivated me to want to give my baby the best start in life possible. If I had only read this one, I would've been out buying formula within the first month.For those of you still in the rough time, know that it passes. Today everything is easy, stress-free and exhaustion free, and I am thrilled to be bonding with my son in this way.Nothing in this book is bad or offensive, but in my opinion it's just not the best there is."},{"Title":"The Nursing Mother's Companion","review":"There are three general approaches to breastfeeding books: advocacy, empathy, and answers. This book uses the two former approaches, with an emphasis on empathy--the author understands our frustration and confusion. But word for word her main goal is to convince us that breastfeeding is best, as if we weren't already aware of that fact.Sometimes a gentle reassurance is very helpful, and that's where this book proves its worth. But when we need actual help or answers, her writing is opaque or even withholding, as if suffering is a mother's rightful burden.That's where the book may interfere with parents' choice of a style that isn't attachment parenting. Huggins recommends letting the baby drop only one night feeding until it's a year old. She advocates co-sleeping and suggests that sleeping on its own will deprive a baby of the benefits of breastmilk. She promotes distrust in the medical profession based on biases that fell out of favor many years ago.If you need actual help with a problem or question, the book is of limited use, yet it has lengthy discussions about food sensitivities that simply are not medically possible. It's still a good book to have, but it's wise to discuss her assertions with your pediatrician and a trained lactation consultant for advice you can truly trust."},{"Title":"The Nursing Mother's Companion","review":"This book is the most helpful nursing book found for those new or experienced Mom's. This guide explains how to successfully nurse your infant and make it work for your lifestyle. As a new, full-time working Mom, with the help of this book, I was able to nurse my newborn and pump milk for the first year of her life. I was guided on how to store and use frozen breast milk. As I recommend breastfeeding, I would also recommend this book. I've bought many copies for my friends who plan to nurse their babies!"},{"Title":"The Nursing Mother's Companion","review":"This book stayed within easy reach for me during the 24 months of my life I nursed my 3 kids. The drug index in the back is an extremely useful, unique feature of this book above other nursing books. This means that when you get a headache, indigestion, sinus infection, or have a sore throat while you're nursing your baby, you can flip to the back of this book and find out what you can take to make MAMA feel better... and you won't sit there and wonder, &quot;If I take this, will it get into my breastmilk and to my baby?&quot; That peace of mind is huge.I have probably bought this book 10 times for baby showers and friends of mine and everyone agrees this is the creme de la creme for nursing.

This book includes a chapter for the breastfeeding mother's partner, and it eased many tensions for him.I have been back at work for over two months, and am happy to say that my son has had nothing but human milk since birth. This book taught me how to keep up my supply after going back to work--it also provides a few arguments in case any co-workers say that it isn't fair for you to take a 15-minute pumping break, or if your boss isn't supportive of your choice to continue to breast feed after returning to work.This book is TRULY a companion to any woman who wants to breastfeed her children."},{"Title":"The Nursing Mother's Companion","review":"I had a horrible experience breastfeeding my first child.

With the practical step-by-step advice in this book, I was able to successfully establish a healthy nursing relationship with my son.I also like the fact that it's not as dogmatic as &quot;The Womanly Art of Breastfeeding&quot;. We had to use a few supplemental bottles in the early weeks. This book taught me how to get my milk supply up so we could discontinue supplementing, while reassuring me that these supplements wouldn't kill him. He's been on breatmilk alone for 5 1/2 months! Now that he's 6 months and we're introducing solids, I am going back to it for advice on how to combine solids and nursing.I would recommend this book to any pregnant or nursing mom I know.

When I was pregnant the second time around I bought two other books (Sears and Newman)to see if they offered more help and more information. Sears is very supportive of breastfeeding generally (breastfeeding eight babies--wow!) and Newman is a bracing advocate of breastfeeding in the face of bottle feeding, but for practical things I keep rereading Huggins, even though I know what it says by heart. It's somehow very comforting to have a long list of 14 things you can *do* if your nipples hurt or if you think something you eat is bothering the baby. Or be able to look up whether you can take cough medicine with dextromethorphan while breastfeeding (and many other less common drugs). That having been said, the best advice I can give you if you're pregnant for the first time is to find a lactation consultant to help you get started--think about it beforehand and don't hesitate to call on her if you need to. None of these books deals with the reality that early breastfeeding can be excruciatingly hard and exhausting and you need a warm, supportive helper. Both times for me it was the hands-on help of one of these wonderful professionals that got me over the tough spots--no book will be as helpful when you're ready to run around the house screaming ready to give up."},{"Title":"The Nursing Mother's Companion","review":"My first child's step-grandmother gave me an old copy of this book when she was born and I had decided to nurse her.

Now I'm a new mom again, and one day I randomly picked the book off the shelf and finally read it. What a wonderful book! I sincerely wish I had read it BEFORE I had my first baby. Besides being a great resource on the how-to's of breastfeeding, the book covers all the difficult problems and issues the nursing mom may face. Huggins describes and helps you diagnose nursing problems, and provides good information about how and why these problems may occur. Her advice and solutions are clear, concise, and highlighted throughout the book. I had planned to breastfeed my daughter for at least a year, but she weaned at 9 months. When I read this book, I thought of all the things I could have done differently (and better) when I had nursed my daughter. This time around I am determined to breastfeed my son for at least a year. When I run into nursing problems, I will refer to Dr. Sears to remind myself why I decided to breastfeed in the first place, then I'll refer to this book to figure out how to overcome them."},{"Title":"The Nursing Mother's Companion","review":"For any woman who will be breastfeeding...BUY THIS BOOK!!

I will recommend it to all my friends who are considering breastfeeding their babies."},{"Title":"The Nursing Mother's Companion","review":"I nursed 5 babies before I received a short condensed version of this book as a gift from my doctor. I thought I new all there was to know about the subject. This book helped me to nurse my last two babies with ease. It is a WEALTH of valuable information for the nursing mother, with practical advice that solves problems specifically. I loved it and bought the full book. If you want to breastfeed, you must have it! Laurel"},{"Title":"The Nursing Mother's Companion","review":"When I first considered breastfeeding, I didn't know where to turn until a dear friend of mine recommended this book. I read it before my daughter was born, and I referred to it constantly in the first few weeks of her life. I used it periodically through the first year, and found it to be an unbiased, no-nonsense approach to breastfeeding. I am grateful that this book existed, especially since EVERYONE has an opinion on breastfeeding! When I didn't know who to believe, I opened this book. It's a must-have for first-time breastfeeding moms."},{"Title":"The Nursing Mother's Companion","review":"Over all a good reference book for the basics of breastfeeding. I would have liked to see more information on common feeding problems such as Reflux in infants. If just a little information would have been provided on this issue, I think I could have recognized this problem, my daughter would have gotten diagnosed sooner and not suffered so. (No information on this common feeding problem was addressed)."},{"Title":"The Nursing Mother's Companion","review":"This book is very good with detailed lists of suggestions to try for various problems - blocked duct, underfeeding etc. It is a good reference, but for a more all around comprehensive book I prefer Nursing Your Baby by Karen and Gale Pryor."},{"Title":"The Nursing Mother's Companion","review":"I love this book--it helped me during the first two weeks of of my baby's life when I was told by my pediatrician that I was not going to be able to breastfeed. This book not only proved him wrong, it reassured me that my child could thrive without supplement and taught me to ignore well-intentioned but wrong advice. Huggins presents her material in a practical, down-to-earth way and in the early hours of the morning when nothing seems to be going well, this book can be a lifesaver."},{"Title":"The Nursing Mother's Companion","review":"This book has a well-organized simple format which makes it easy to look up various topics. The information is presented in a reassuring manner which is encouraging to first-time breastfeeding mothers. This book was recommended by my physician and corresponded well with the information I was given by my health care providers."},{"Title":"The Nursing Mother's Companion","review":"This book was my &quot;bible&quot; of breastfeeding. I truly don't think I would've made it if I hadn't had this resource by my side 24 hours a day. My daughter is 2 1/2 now and I buy this book for all my friends who plan on breastfeeding!"},{"Title":"The Nursing Mother's Companion","review":"I don't actually have the whole book, I just have what they gave me at the hospital which is an excerpt from the book and consists of the survival guides for the first week and first 2 months.I read a lot of other breastfeeding books but this one was by far the most informative and easy to read. I learned so much about what was \\"normal\\" and what I should expect. Also, the sections on Concerns about your Baby were the most helpful. Her recommendations about what to do if your baby pulls away from the breast and spitting up didn't actually work for me, but they were very good recommendations that I didn't get anywhere else.I would highly recommend getting this book."},{"Title":"The Nursing Mother's Companion","review":"I cannot tell you how many times I used this book when I came home from the hospital. It has EVERYTHING you would or could ever need. This book is truly a livesaver. Easy to read, yet very imformative. I give this book to anyone who is pregnant!"},{"Title":"The Nursing Mother's Companion","review":"If you want to succeed in breastfeeding, buy this book.

I am a working mother who was successful at breastfeeding both of my kids for one year."},{"Title":"The Nursing Mother's Companion","review":"Brief but to the point - it kept me breastfeeding when I was going to quit. I went to a lactation specialist who gave me some helpful advice and this was the best piece. I was just about ready to give up but with her help and this book, I nursed for 15 months and loved it all (after the first 2 weeks!)."},{"Title":"The Nursing Mother's Companion","review":"This is such a helpful book - any question you might have is answered. Especially for first-time breastfeeders who may feel unsure about how to nurse, this book will help you feel comfortable and so nursing becomes the magical, wonderful experience it should be. This is a great shower gift too!"},{"Title":"The Nursing Mother's Companion","review":"I bought this book when my daughter was 3 months old and wish I had gotten it earlier. It is very helpful and has lots of information from pregnancy and beyond. I recommmend anyone who plans on breastfeeding to buy this book."},{"Title":"The Nursing Mother's Companion","review":"The lactation consultant recommended this book when I went to the hospital-sponsored breastfeeding class, and it is a wonderful book! I turned to this reference book throughout the first few months of my baby's life as I exclusively breastfed him for over 6 months. It covers many topics that nursing moms have concerns about - engorgement, latching problems, weaning - in a way that is concise and easy to read.I highly recommend this book to my friends who plan to breastfeed as it was extremely helpful for me when I went through those first few uncertain months."},{"Title":"The Nursing Mother's Companion","review":"I was very anxious about breastfeeding, so I bought this book and read it before I had the baby. It helped me to identify problems before they occured, and probably helped me to recognize what was going on and not give up before I really got going. Although I am not as anti-pacifier, anti-bottle as this book, I did find it extremely useful and have referred to it many times. I constantly refer to the extensive section that addresses the safety of many different drugs/substances during nursing. I would highly recommend this book to any new moms!"},{"Title":"The Nursing Mother's Companion","review":"This is the absolute guide to breastfeeding. I decided I wanted to breastfeed despite my family's negative views and remarks about breastfeeding. I heard everything from you'll have a fat baby to the baby could die if you get nervous and breastfeed. This book renewed my hopes and made gave me know how to breastfeed successfully. Everything from different holds to problems that may arise are included. I borrowed this book from my library and was scanning so much out of it that my husband decided to buy me my very own copy.....which is now marked up on practically every page."},{"Title":"The Nursing Mother's Companion","review":"I highly recommend this book. I read it before my son was born, took it to the hospital with me (and used it), and referred to it repeatedly during many months of successful nursing."},{"Title":"The Nursing Mother's Companion","review":"... This book got me through nursing strikes, breast infections, going back to work, traveling and pumping. It's non-judgmental and non-guilt inducing, but still very encouraging and helpful. I give it to every new mom I know."},{"Title":"The Nursing Mother's Companion","review":"A friend recommended this book to me while I was still pregnant. I bought it, but didn't start reading it until I was in the hospital after the birth of my son. Had I done some reading before, I would have been better prepared for the challenges (and rewards!) of breastfeeding.The book is a wonderful source of information even if you are seeing a lactation consultant. (I was fortunate enough to see a LC at Kathleen's clinic!) My little one is now almost 3 months old, and I still find myself referring to the book.Any mom who wants to get the most out of breastfeeding owes it to herself and her baby to read this book."},{"Title":"The Nursing Mother's Companion","review":"Though very helpful and it does seem to cover all area and questions/concerns a mother may have, it's also extremely repetitive! In every chapter I felt like I was re-reading something from the last chapter almost word for word. The same topics are addressed over and over. The book could be cut in half and still cover all bases."},{"Title":"The Nursing Mother's Companion","review":"If this book interfered with parenting style, then I ingnored it. I needed something to teach me how to breast feed and help me through any problems that might come up, because I knew I wasn't going to get any help from anyone I know. And this did just that. It showed basic techniques and covered everything that could possibly go wrong. And when my milk supply dwindled (I had twins) this book helped me double it. As to rather or not it was preachy on breastfeeding is the best way, I didn't notice and didn't care. It did what I needed it to."},{"Title":"The Nursing Mother's Companion","review":"I checked this book out from the local library and brought it with me to the hospital when my daughter was born. I referred to it numerous times in the few days we were in the hospital while we were learning how to breast-feed. It had explicit picutres that explained very well the latching process and addressed all of my oncers -- as well as some I didn't know I'd have prior to giving birth. I highly recommend it for new mothers who want to breast-feed their babies!"},{"Title":"The Nursing Mother's Companion","review":"I actually bought this book at a lactation consultant's suggestion and at her offices. My child was 5.5 weeks premature and had difficulty learning the suck/swallow reflex. I read this book while pumping in the hospital NICU as well as at home. This book answered each and every question I had throughout my nursing relationship with my child (now almost 2). I highly recommend this book to all mothers who want to do everything they can to educate themselves about nursing their child. Because of my experience with it, whenever a friend of mine is pregnant and planning on nursing, I put together a care package for her that includes this book, a tube of Lansinoh cream, and breast pads along with other gifts for her baby shower!"},{"Title":"The Nursing Mother's Companion","review":"I'm a first time mom and went to a breastfeeding class which is how I learned about this book. I made the mistake of waiting until my son was 3 weeks before I made my husband buy it for me. It's supportive tone and easy to read format helped me a great deal. At first I did not find breastfeeding easy at all but this book encouraged and helped me out so many times that my son is 6 months already and I'm still at it (although he's supplementing now). And I'm glad I did. Also, it didn't make me afraid of supplementing-whatever others tell you, babies do not forget to breastfeed because breastmilk is sweeter than formula and they will always prefer it over the latter. I have read this book over and over and still refer to it from time to time. I wish I had asked for this in my registry because it would've been good to read it during the last weeks of my pregnancy. I agree breastfeeding is not for everyone and IT IS A LABOR OF LOVE but once you and your baby master it (read the book!) you'll be glad you did."},{"Title":"The Nursing Mother's Companion","review":"This practical guide to nursing offers step-by-step problem solving guidelines that mothers encounter during the different stages of nursing. The drawings are very helpful, and the advice is complete, comforting, and accurate. I have referred this book to five other mothers, all who use it as their leading reference tool for nursing. INVALUABLE!"},{"Title":"The Nursing Mother's Companion","review":"I received an excerpt out of the book at the hospital and later ordered the book. It covers every situation you may encounter while breastfeeding. I have shared my copy with all my nursing friends and they have found it to be a priceless reference."},{"Title":"The Nursing Mother's Companion","review":"The Nursing Mother's Companion was (&amp; still is) an invaluable reference for me while nursing my now 4 month old daughter. Huggins organizes the information according to the baby's age and discusses common problems/solutions during each of these stages. I found the layout of the book very convienient for refering back to certain issues. I highly recommend it for any mother planning on breastfeeding her baby."},{"Title":"The Nursing Mother's Companion","review":"This book had a great format with survival tips for the rough early weeks. I found it to be very, very helpful."},{"Title":"The Nursing Mother's Companion","review":"I read this book before my baby was born--and I've probably reread it about 12 times since he's been born--and he's only 8 weeks old! A fabulous resource-broken down into easily digestible chunks/categories. You will find answers to your most basic questions--as well as questions about more mysterious aspects of breastfeeding,i.e. &quot;what are these green stools he's been producing?&quot;. Even if you have a lactation consultant at your disposal--I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Nursing Mother's Companion","review":"Well organized and concise. Best part is the list of medications and their effect on breastmilk, although it could be more exhaustive."},{"Title":"The Nursing Mother's Companion","review":"This book was such a help during the first painful month of breastfeeding. A must if you want to succeed. Covered first days, months, returning to work and weaning."},{"Title":"The Nursing Mother's Companion","review":"I enjoyed reading The Nursing Mothers Companion, topics are easy to find and offer somewhat good advice. However I do feel that Kathleen Huggins offers supplementing as a solution too often."},{"Title":"The Nursing Mother's Companion","review":"This is an invaluable tool for any nursing mother. The author presents the information in a very clear, organized manner. The illustrations are terrific. The language used is not too clinical or too simplistic. The book is not preachy as some of these books can tend to be. It is not complicated. The highly organized style helped me to find important answers quickly. This book truly helped to make nursing an enjoyable and successful endeavor for me. I highly recommend it!!!"},{"Title":"The Nursing Mother's Companion","review":"This book was extremely helpful for me. It clearly outlines potential problems and allowed for quick identification of breastfeeding problems for both me and baby. One of the better more straight forward reference books."},{"Title":"The Nursing Mother's Companion","review":"My daughter is now twenty months old and I still use this book. It has gotten me through almost every problem we have encountered from low supply because of growth spurts to sleeping problems. I plan to continue to use this book for many years with this baby and more. I can't recommend this book enough. It tops my list of gifts for expectant mothers. So far, I have given five as gifts. Everyone has loved it."},{"Title":"The Nursing Mother's Companion","review":"As a first time nursing mother, I found this book repetitive and the layout confusing, with many &quot;refer to this section and that section&quot; references (without page numbers) and little help. Some of the information is out of date. I recommend Jack Newman's &quot;Ultimate Breastfeeding Book of Answers&quot; as the absolute best source for a new mom."},{"Title":"The Nursing Mother's Companion","review":"Most of the advice provided in this book can be obtained for free (and more consisely) from your OB/GYN, hospital and health insurance company. The only parts I found useful were the appendices for drug interaction during breastfeeding and contact information for nursing products. BEWARE! Advice given in this book for starting solid foods contradicts the current guidelines given by the American Academy of Pediatrics--some foods recommended in this book are peanut butter, whole eggs and some nitrate-rich foods that should be avoided/given in moderation until your child is older. I would much rather follow the advice of a full-fledged DOCTOR."},{"Title":"The Nursing Mother's Companion","review":"I bought the book since I was suffering from this extreme pain after nursing and none of the doctors I was going to really knew what was going on. After doing research in the internet, I figured it was thrush and the book was of no use to me, since it does not cover thrush"},{"Title":"The Nursing Mother's Companion","review":"I was very pleased with the promptness of delivery and the quality of the product."},{"Title":"The Nursing Mother's Companion","review":"I found this book very helpful. It is a little pushy in some parts but has a lot of good information. I just wish I had had it sooner, I didn't get it until my baby was about 3 months old!!"},{"Title":"The Nursing Mother's Companion","review":"I grudgingly give this book two stars for its basic information in providing essential breastfeeding information. However, other, less condescending manuals provide this as well. A word of advice for mother's with ambiguous feelings regarding breastfeeding, mothers unable to breastfeed for whatever reason: difficult birth, C-section, adoptive parents, whatever... breastfeeding is not the only option. A mother is not a failure if she chooses not to have a child or two attached to her breast for months or years at a time. I was very offended at the judgemental tone and felt like a failure for weeks until I opened my eyes to how happy and healthy my baby was while being fed, gasp and sin, formula. DO NOT BEAT yourself up if breastfeeding does not work out or if it is simply unappealing. At a time when emotions run hot and cold at the best of times, piling additional guilt and feelings of inadequacy is ridiculous. You can still be a good mother, a great one, with a ! ! bottle in one hand and cuddling your baby. Yes, breast milk IS better and breastfeeding is a sweet time with a precious baby, but it is not so much better that you should to make yourself physically, mentally and emotionally miserable if you choose not to. It was milkbone city when our stupid lab ate the book."},{"Title":"The Nursing Mother's Companion","review":"I found out that the author of this book is taking money from formula companies. Apparently she works for a company that accepts formula advertisements. It's difficult to believe objective advice on breastfeeding can come from an author being paid by the formula industry. That's like the cigarette industry giving advice on quitting smoking."},{"Title":"The Nursing Mother's Companion","review":"I totally disagree with the person that put this book down and touted the Dr. Sears book. I too have both books....in the early stages of breastfeeding when you and your little one are still trying to figure out everything....the Sears book is useless. It doesn't help you trouble shoot any problems you might be having...nor does it tell you things you might run into or pitfalls you might expect. This book however was my right hand guide. Any question or problem I ever had I always found a viable answer or suggestion in this book. That helped me continue on because I could carry on knowing everything was ok or that I should consult somebody for help. I think I am a testament to how helpful this was since I am still breastfeeding my daughter happily at 14 months and just starting to wean. My origional goal was only 6 months. Buy this book it is extremely helpful. Breastfeeding is not an easy thing even if your baby takes to it correctly right away. You have to be determined to make it work before the baby gets here. If you just say you'll try it...you will fail at it or give up fast most times I think. Any kind of helpful resource is a push in the right direction for the good of your baby."},{"Title":"The Nursing Mother's Companion","review":"Recommended in two different breast feeding classes, this book is a MUST for all new breast feeding moms. Easy-to-read format, well-organized sections, and good common sense make reading this book enjoyable. The safe drug appendix is helpful and quick. Of the many breastfeeding books on the market ~ this is THE ONE you can't live without!"},{"Title":"The Nursing Mother's Companion","review":"This book is loaded with valuable information. Chapters deal with preparing your breasts before the baby is born, dealing with nursing problems including travel, and nursing under a variety of special conditions (a mother with diabetes, premature infants, multiple children, an adopted baby, etc.). The author, a registered nurse, has organized the book roughly chronologically, categorizing the first two months as a learning period, months two through six as a reward period, and concluding with nursing the older infant and toddler.Appendices are particularly informative. The first gives contact information for many resources, from support and education to nursing bras, pump rental and various accoutrements such as breast shields and lanolin. The second gives charts for determining the amount of milk infants of varying weights need. Appendix three, with its own index, is a gold mine -- a comprehensive overview of all manner of drugs, over-the-counter as well as prescription, with information concerning their safe use (or non-use) while nursing an infant.There is also a bibliography if you'd like to look into certain issues more carefully, and an index which is, as others have stated, rather inadequate.Don't let a poor index stop you from buying this extremely useful resource, though. If you intend to breastfeed, you will refer to this wonderful book many times -- and you will almost certainly find the answer you are looking for."},{"Title":"The Nursing Mother's Companion","review":"As an anxious first-time mother I'd read many books on pregnancy and parenting, and while many of these were fine books, I'd been unable to find more detailed answers about breastfeeding. This book, however, has answered every one of my questions -- even the rather odd ones, like why the milk was green. The index is adequate but not comprehensive, so while it may take some searching to find the information you seek, the information is there and is expressed clearly. Well worth the price."},{"Title":"The Nursing Mother's Companion","review":"I am in the health care field and taught breastfeeding in the hopsital to new moms. When I had my first child , I thought I knew evreything about breastfeeding and did not need another resource. My O.B. doctor continually recommended this book, when I purchased the book - I loved it!! The most resourceful and user friendly book for any breastfeeding mother. It addresses all of your concerns and questions. A must have for all breastfeeding mothers!"},{"Title":"The Nursing Mother's Companion","review":"I purchased this book well in advance of my daughter's birth. I read carefully and packed it in my to go bag. When I went into labor, I was far away from home and far away from my copy. Without a lactation specialist or my book at the hospital I found myself doing the best I could. By the time I left the hospital, I was fearing having to feed my daughter again. When I finally got home, I ran for my book. I was positioning my daughter incorrectly and causing nipple damage. After changing the positioning and following the advice I received about nipple care, I found an immediate difference. By the next day, my nipples did not hurt as much. Now my three month old and I are in a good nursing relationship. If it were not for this book, my daughter would be on formula, and I don't know if we would be as close."},{"Title":"The Nursing Mother's Companion","review":"While I was pregnant I bought The Ultimate Breastfeeding Book of Answers. It was ok, but pretty heavy on the why, and not as much on the how. I had made the decision to breastfeed already and did not require convincing, so I found this portion of the book of little interest or importance. Then, while I was in the hospital I received a pamphlet (from one of the formula companies no less) called Nursing: The First Two Months, by Kathleen Huggins. It was an excerpt from her book, The Nursing Mother's Companion. I found this pamphlet much more useful than the previous book I had read during my pregnancy, so I ordered the book. I especially like the way the book is organized into time periods b/c the problems you come across vary with the age of your baby. This book really helped me keep going when I wanted to give up. I'm not saying it was inspirational or anything. It just helped me understand the causes of the problems I was having and how to fix it. It also has a very useful section in the back on drugs that are safe to take while breastfeeding. Great book and a must for the new mom's reference library!"},{"Title":"The Nursing Mother's Companion","review":"This book answered a couple of questions that went unanswered in the Sears Breastfeeding book and in the LLL \\"Womanly Art of Breastfeeding\\", so I found it worth having.Worth noting: the author, Kathleen Huggins is the lady who patented the \\"My Brest Friend\\" nursing pillow - a great nursing tool!This book features \\"survival\\" sections which are highlighted for easy access and summarize the events of the child's and mother's breastfeeding needs at particular stages: \\"Survival Guide for the First Week\\", \\"Suvival Guide for the first 2 months\\", \\"Survival Guide for months 2-6\\" and \\"Survival Guide for the Later Months\\"None of my three breastfeeding books have all the answers, but I think that if you bought this book and the Sears book, you will have all the info you need."},{"Title":"The Nursing Mother's Companion","review":"This book was a comfort and reassuring during the first six weeks or so of nursing. I like the way it is presented and the encouragement found within the pages of the book. It really helped to calm my frazzled nerves. It also gave me more information on certain things. However, I didn't end up having any of the problems she talks about so I don't know how useful her solutions really are. My only real problem with this book and all nursing books, is that they don't tell you that for most people nursing HURTS at first. There was nothing wrong with my latch or anything, it just made me sore and hurt off and on for the first six weeks. Everyone I ever asked about nursing among my friends who are mothers and my own mother, have told me it hurts. In some cases it was because of problems with the breastfeeding itself, and others it was just soreness until they got used to it and toughened up. I wish that this book had told me that it could hurt without my doing something wrong and that it would go away eventually. It would have saved me some panic and tears that I must be doing it all wrong. Still, the book was helpful and comforting and the section on medicines while breastfeeding is really handy. A good book that I would recommend, as long as it wasn't going to be your only source of comfort and support."},{"Title":"The Nursing Mother's Companion","review":"No matter what anyone says, breastfeeding is not always easy. There were times during the first couple weeks of breastfeeding that I thought that I would give up. This book saved me!! I only read the parts that I needed, and I felt encouraged. I would recommend this for any mother planning to nurse!!"},{"Title":"The Nursing Mother's Companion","review":"This book is an excellent resource for nursing mothers. From positioning to remedies for common breastfeeding ailments, Kathleen Huggins makes you realize you aren't alone out there! She dispells many common myths and misconceptions about breastfeeding with excellent advice to boot. This book gave me great confidence in my natural ability to nurse my baby successfully."},{"Title":"The Nursing Mother's Companion","review":"I love this book. It is so educational, and in functional terms that I can use and understand. It has picture examples, and lots of hands on information. This is the only book you will need to successfully breast feed your baby."},{"Title":"The Nursing Mother's Companion","review":"This was recomended by a lactation cons. at a class I attended. It is a great reference book. I refer to it often. I am buying a copy for my cousin now."},{"Title":"The Nursing Mother's Companion","review":"I had a pediatrician that wasn't much help on the breastfeeding issue. I didn't know many people who had breastfed and I picked up this book at the store. It was absolutely invaluable to me and I referenced it many times. I now have a healthy 1 year old daughter and I attribute that robust health to giving her the right start in life. I was able to continue nursing her right up to her 1st birthday and I don't think I could have done it without this book."},{"Title":"The Nursing Mother's Companion","review":"As a first time mother, I must say that breastfeeding didn't come &quot;naturally.&quot; I met with a lactation consultant 3 times, and after that I referred to this book over and over again.The back of the book has an extensive index of drugs and their effects on a breastfed baby. Now that I've got the breastfeeding gig down, I know that I'll still turn to the index to make sure that I am doing everything I can to keep my daughter from the harmful effects of medications that I may be inclined to take!"},{"Title":"The Nursing Mother's Companion","review":"My baby was almost five months old before I got this book and I was wishing I had it from the beginning! I had already read two other popular breastfeeding books and found them interesting, but this one had the most practical, how-to information. Any new or expecting mom planning to breastfeed needs to read this book."},{"Title":"The Nursing Mother's Companion","review":"I had access to a very good lactation consultant with my firstborn, but everyone who doesnt' should have this book available. If you had trouble nursing a baby (and gave up) you need this book, if you think you won't like breastfeeding, you need this book. If you aren't certain about breastfeeding, read this book and several others before you make up your mind. This is a very clear-cut, easy to read, easy to find answers, sort of book"},{"Title":"The Nursing Mother's Companion","review":"This is one of the most well-known and most frequently recommended breast feeding book. It has lots of facts, and I conferred the book for help many many times (I had much difficulty with nursing).However, while breast is best, and should be encouraged, books shouldn't idolize it as the only acceptable way. I felt that the book was unrealistically positive about the nursing experience and that if you latch correctly, it won't hurt and nursing will be a blissful experience. Most women that I know who have nursed will agree with me when I say that even if you latch correctly, nursing is very difficult and books like this doesn't present a realitic picture of how difficult it is.I also couldn't find anything about what you can do if you are having difficulty pumping-- which makes me think that the book discourages pumping (i.e., nurse every and all the time) and it won't discuss any practice that it discourages. Surprising number of women have difficulty pumping, although NO ONE TALKS ABOUT IT. Another example is supplementing with formula-- book says supplementing is the beginning of the end of nursing and that's all it says. Basically, it simply says to just say no to any formula or pumping."},{"Title":"The Nursing Mother's Companion","review":"I found nothing remarkable about this book. It is a decent introduction but not enough in itself to really educate mothers about overcoming common challenges. Perhaps the greatest challenge for mothers to overcome is the lack of trained, dedicated lactation consultants in most U.S. hospitals so I find more attention needs to be given to the problems that arise and how to make it through them. I highly recommend Dr. Newman's The Ultimate Breastfeeding Book of Answers : The Most Comprehensive Problem-Solution Guide to Breastfeeding from the Foremost Expert in North America. Do not be assured by the comfortable stories about how easy and natural breatsfeeding is. Most women fail for a reason so find out what can help you transition into the patterns you need to feed your baby the best thing in the world available.You don't really have the time to search for possible remedies once your baby is born because you have to feed it and you may be making things very difficult for you and your baby to transision into a happy and fulfilling nursing pair."},{"Title":"The Nursing Mother's Companion","review":"This book provided me with most of the info that I needed before I started breastfeeding. I love the info at the back that tells us exactly which medications Mom can take while breastfeeding!"},{"Title":"The Nursing Mother's Companion","review":"This guide came very highly recommended, and I can see why. It is very easy to follow, and is filled with lots of information I (and my wife) didn't know. The author comes across in a very straightforward way that is not militant about breastfeeding, as some authors are. &quot;If you don't breastfeed, you're guilty of child-abuse,&quot; some books say. Come on!One of the particularly useful sections of the book was the section on breastpumps. Many books on the market have outdated lists with obsolete models.If you're interested in breastfeeding your child, and want a book that explains things in an easy to understand way, this is the one for you."},{"Title":"The Nursing Mother's Companion","review":"This book has the most practical, concrete and easily understood information of any book I have read on nursing. There is a section on how to calulate how much breastmilk your baby is eating (a constant worry for new mothers!) and then determine if your baby REALLY needs supplements and then how to determine HOW MUCH your baby needs. It takes away all the guess work and worry and gives you something you can do to solve problems.Very reassuring.This goes on my list to all expectant mothers, along with Nursing Mother Working Mother by Gayle Pryor and The Womanly Art of Breastfeeding."},{"Title":"The Nursing Mother's Companion","review":"Informative, insightful, well organized, with a great index. This book was a lifesaver to me when I needed it, and now I give copies to all my pregnant friends. Well thought out design and an extensive index make problem solving a snap when those difficulties crop up at 2am! Plenty of alternatives to a variety of nursing difficulties, and month-by-month descriptions of the breastfeeding experience are presented."},{"Title":"The Nursing Mother's Companion","review":"I found the nursing mothers companion book at a yard sale when I was 2 mo. with 2nd, 12 yrs between the 2. It was the best bargin I ever found. It's great. At 17 mo. and still nursing I wouldn't be without it! I'm expecting #3 and DR. said no nursing. Thank God I have this book it says as long as no problems in preg. it's ok to continue nursing!"},{"Title":"The Nursing Mother's Companion","review":"My husband and I wanted to breastfeed our first baby. One of our relative recommended this book and we bought and read it before my son was born. Emotionally and psychologically, it prepared us for the new experience.During our 1st year of the breastfeeding, we continued to go back to the book for help. Our breastfeeding experience has been a blessing to our marriage and family. We are grateful."},{"Title":"The Nursing Mother's Companion","review":"This is the only book that you need about breastfeeding. It has trouble-shooting guides and well as basic beginner information. There is a very useful index in the back that lists which drugs are safe/unsafe to take while breastfeeding. The book is informative without being preachy (like The Womanly Art of Breastfeeding) while at the same time stressing the benefits of breastfeeding. Buy this one first. You won't need to buy anything else."},{"Title":"The Nursing Mother's Companion","review":"This book exceeded my expectations. This is a complete guide for breastfeeding, and it helped me to take care of my baby and of myself too. I recomend it to mothers who really want to breastfeed theirs babies, wich is a difficult thing to do, sometimes. I could not breastfeed my fisrt son because of the lack of knowledge about this matter, and when I was pregnant of my daughter three years later I said to myself that I should not spend so much money and time with formulas, and when she was born I could feel the happiness of being so close to her with breastfeeding, with the help of this book. Enjoy it!"},{"Title":"The Nursing Mother's Companion","review":"If you are planning to breastfeed ( which I personally highly advise you to ) then get this book and read it as soon as possiable, preferably before you have your baby and then again after. It helped me so much and I am so glad for all the advice and encouragment this book gave me. Breasfeeding my new baby is the most wonderful expierence! True, it takes a little time and patience to get it but when you do- it is so worth it!!! This book and a good lactation consultant can make it work for you! Good Luck."},{"Title":"The Nursing Mother's Companion","review":"A reference book is only as good as its index, and this one was terrible! The book contains valuable information for the new breastfeeding mother. However, the index was the worst I have ever used. There would be 10-20 pages sited for a word or topic, most of which only mentioned the word in passing, or not at all. Unless you plan on reading this book cover to cover (and think you will be able to remember everything you have read) find a different book."},{"Title":"The Nursing Mother's Companion","review":"I thought this was an excellent book for basic reference-type breatfeeding information. I think it could have had a little more &quot;medical&quot; quality information. It's great for help with things like: how do you know if your child is getting enough, how often and how long to nurse, pumping and storage of breastmilk. I do wish it had spent more time on the problems that come with breastfeeding. The books make it seem easier than it really is and it would be nice to have a more realistic approach to the REAL problems that are associated with it. I'm sure there are very few women out there who start breastfeeding and do not encounter ANY issues at all. Maybe if there were to be an updated version of this book she could go into a little more depth about the pain, guilt, tears, and depression that comes along with breastfeeding if you are having problems...and hopefully the problems could be solved without having to give up breastfeeding all together or consulting Le Leche Mafia!"},{"Title":"The Nursing Mother's Companion","review":"I nursed 6 children and used this book as a guide for each one of my children. Not only was it reassuring as a first time mom, but it was also very helpful in helping resolve different nursing issues as they arose. I would definitely recommend this book to any nursing mother."},{"Title":"The Nursing Mother's Companion","review":"I am the mother of two children who were both breastfed (the second only weaned this year), and this book was my resource. Don't let any of those soft focus ads fool you into thinking breast feeding is natural and easy: getting started is a challenge! If you make it through the first week you are well on your way, and after the second week the hard part is over -- why not keep going for your child's health? The strange things you notice (lumps in my breast, white \\"fluff\\" on my nipple, etc.) are explained and remedies offered.This book was my support when I started and beyond. It was recommended by a maternity ward nurse, and I used it whenever I had a question. My first several days were painful, but the book was reassuring. I'm so glad I persevered. The nursing experience is a godsend when you need to soothe your child; there is nothing that will calm them like you can by nursing them. And as experts will admit, we STILL don't know all the components in breast milk, and can only put the ones we know about (and can produce) in formula. Use this book and get over the hurdle of getting started and you'll be starting your baby off right and giving yourself a sweet bonding experience."},{"Title":"The Nursing Mother's Companion","review":"....because it doesn't contain attachment parenting nonsense that is nonessential to breastfeeding.Don't be intimidated by LLL (...). Breastfeed!

I referred to this book many times and always found suggestions and/or solutions. Very detailed!"},{"Title":"The Nursing Mother's Companion","review":"A friend recommended this book and I dutifully read it while pregnant to learn about breastfeeding. I brought it with me to the hospital (yes, giving birth in Japan) and I referred to it several times each day. When our baby lost more than 10% of her birth weight in two days, I checked the charts and recommendations in the book before allowing the hospital to give us a bottle supplement for the baby. Their recommended amount was exactly what the book said, which made us feel much better about what we were doing. 4 months have passed and we are still exclusively breastfeeding (with the exception of those 2 supplemental bottles in the hospital) and the book has been my constant companion through plugged ducts and breast and nipple pain, as well as the success and joy of nursing. I recommend this book to all of my pregnant and nursing friends."},{"Title":"The Nursing Mother's Companion","review":"My babies both loved to nurse! My son weaned at about 20 months and my daughter weaned at about 26 months. So...I've spent a LOT of time nursing babies. That being said, I highly recommend this book for any nursing mother. The book is not very long which is a major plus for any busy mom. I also like the way it is segmented based on the baby's age so you can read things that are relevant to your specific situation. It also has briefly written helpful hints for breastfeeding troubles. Sometimes, when you're frustrated, it's nice to have a list of 1,2,3,4 telling you exactly what to try. In my experience, her lists really help! Best of luck! Stick with it! You can do it! :o)"},{"Title":"The Nursing Mother's Companion","review":"I had tremendous difficulty nursing my first child...sore, cracked nipples and over-abundant let-down had me frustrated and crying while my son was a newborn. My friend lent me this book, which was full of easy-to-read, practical advice. All of my problems were addressed, and I was able to work through each issue and experiment until we formed a comfortable nursing relationship.In the end, I nursed my son for seventeen months, then my daughter for 26 months, quite comfortably and happily. I highly recommend this book for new mothers, or to those having difficulties during nursing. I have since read many good breastfeeding books, but The Nursing Mothers' Companion was definitely the most useful."},{"Title":"The Nursing Mother's Companion","review":"I had a very difficult time during the first two months of breastfeeding. My mom bought this book for me shortly after my son was born, and it was a lifesaver. It provides helpful tips on how to care for yourself (sore nipples, mastitis, etc.), and also provides great detail about the different nursing positions. I think it's a must for any new breastfeeding mom."},{"Title":"The Nursing Mother's Companion","review":"I recommend this book to all of my patients. I have yet to see a mother who purchased this book in the last part of pregnancy, not &quot;make it&quot; breastfeeding.If you plan to breastfeed, this book is one to have in your bag, take to the birth center or hospital and believe me, you will use it and find it helpful.This combined with Simkins &quot;Birth Partner&quot; are two absolute essentials for purchase in late pregnancy."},{"Title":"The Nursing Mother's Companion","review":"This book is by far the best, most comprehensive resource for the breastfeeding mom. I turned to this book regularly during the first few months (especially the first weeks!) of my son's life. The writing is direct and simple without being preachy, and the solutions for basic breastfeeding issues were right on the money.Despite the fact that breastfeeding is painted out to be &quot;natural and instinctual&quot; - it isn't. If you only buy one book to get you on the road to breastfeeding with confidence, this is it."},{"Title":"The Nursing Mother's Companion","review":"The Nursing Mother's Companion is an easy-to-use manual on breastfeeding. It has good chapters on positioning and solving some common breastfeeding problems. HOWEVER, the author seems to hold the commonly held belief that because breastfeeding is &quot;natural&quot; it will work for everybody. She does not provide information on how to diagnose and treat the problem if breastfeeding isn't going well. I have a low milk supply, a somewhat common problem which this author doesn't seem to recognize the existence of. Furthermore, my low milk supply probably could have been avoided if I had had Dr. Mom's Guide to Breastfeeding in my first few weeks, instead of this book."},{"Title":"The Nursing Mother's Companion","review":"Very informative book---highly recommend to any nursing mom or anyone planning on nursing. This book is comprehensive and easy to read."},{"Title":"The Nursing Mother's Companion","review":"I found this book to be an excellent aid in solving the many initial problems I had with breastfeeding as a new mom/breastfeeder. I thought breastfeeding would be a piece of cake. I took a class, had instructions by the nurses in the hospital. But by day two, the problems began: sore nipples led to cracked nipples led to bleeding nipples. This book helped me immensely with positioning and some of the common and not so common challenges - there were sections for every possible problem imaginable. I would recommend this book to anyone new to breastfeeding - you'd be doing yourself a big favor by reading the first section or two before you start feeding - and/or anyone who has specific challenges (medical problems, c-section, etc - anything that adds a potential wrench in the process). I found the layout of the book very easy to navigate and the instructions impeccably clear. Thank you Kathleen Huggins for saving my nipples!"},{"Title":"The Nursing Mother's Companion","review":"I found it to be informative, especially in the first chapters, where it talks about positions, food allergies,and undernourishment. It even mentions something about babies growing \\"too big\\" (which I never thought was a problem) and what it can cause this, and about acid reflux, and jaundice for which my first baby was hospitalized. I am very glad I bought it, although there is a new version out. My only complaint is that it's supposed to take you step by step through the baby's months, but it gets generic, as it gives the same advice over and over and it's not as specific as it should be. It also quotes information, such as studies and articles, without bothering to give the references, which could be construed as made-up data, although I'm sure the author did not. Overall, I recommend it, particularly for first time nursers."},{"Title":"The Nursing Mother's Companion","review":"This book is good to get some information on how to hold the baby and get it to latch. I believe it does the reader a disservice as it fails to discuss a lot of serious issues that might be wrong with your little one's feeding process (i.e. GERD, reflux, etc). The author just refers you back to checkign your technique, when she should be recommending you call your pediatrician.The general tone is that medical doctors are evil if they ask you to supplement for the heath of the baby. This book is about breast feeding, it is not about ensuring your baby gets fed. No intelligent discussion about how to supplement successfully, if you supplement you might as well close up shop and give up breastfeeding, you've failed. That is the message. I know many mothers who supplement low weight babies or who had low supply and their babies don't have this horrible \\"nipple confusion\\" which the author even states is easily rectified in another section. In the end, the baby gets its mother's milk and enough food so that it thrives, and no one is in a panic. Even pumping and giving in a bottle is looked down upon by the author. No discussion on how this may include dad and give mom's tired sore breasts a rest! Everything about maintaining mother's health and wellbeing is sidelined to breastfeeding and subtle blame is placed on the technique you are using.I also take issue with how it so simply advocates co-sleeping without discussion of the dangers or how to do it safely."},{"Title":"The Nursing Mother's Companion","review":"The book is a tell-all resource for nursing moms and was practically all I needed to nurse my son ( I am still nursing and he is 3 months). UPDATE: He was completely weaned at 17 months of age."},{"Title":"The Nursing Mother's Companion","review":"This book is a must have and the bible for anyone who wants to nurse their baby.

This book answers all the questions clearly and easily. It got me through the first (scarey) 4 weeks of breastfeeding perfectly."},{"Title":"Home-Based Business For Dummies (For Dummies (Business & Personal Finance))","review":"If you're completely clueless to running your own home-based business, this is a great beginner (hence the title &quot;for Dummies&quot;). I found the book to work best when you already have an idea for your business. As with similar books, it's great to have a general idea of what type of business you'd like to pursue before reading the book; it will help you better shape your idea.The book did spend a lot of time talking about how to deal with family problems, creating a quiet workspace, setting work hours and how to get through a project when you have no desire. While some people might find this beneficial, it read like &quot;filler&quot; to me.All in all, though, it's worth checking out."},{"Title":"Home-Based Business For Dummies (For Dummies (Business & Personal Finance))","review":"I would classify this book as more of a general overview of all the important things you need to consider before actually starting your business. For particulars you will definitely want to contact a good business attorney and a good accountant. Not to mention, you'll need to interface a lot initially with your local city/state governments to get tax forms and your business license.This book seems to work best if you already have an idea for your business. Granted , they do throw out a few ideas for things like medical billing and place an emphasis on what could be described as services geared towards either elderly folks, or dual income families who are too busy to deal with traditional family type things. If you already kind of know what you think you want to try, this book will primarily help you fine tune your thoughts, and bring them to reality.The section on Managing Money is probably one of the best things anyone can read. Obviously, if you're in business, the goal is to make money. By understanding the basic accounting principles presented in Part II of the book, you'll be well on your way to managing your business money wisely.For general knowledge, my favorite part of the book was Part V. Here you will find Top 10 lists that describe common myths and pitfalls, and even success producing ideas to help you on your journey as a home based business owner. If you have a family, you'll want to take note on the section about what I would call, \\"The good way to set up your office.\\" Which means, keeping distractions from the spouse and kids to a minimum while you are working at home.There is a section on marketing, but in lieu of just that section alone, I would definitely recommend \\"Guerilla Marketing\\" by Jay Conrad Levinson. It's a very dry read, but there are a lot of interesting and unique ideas for getting word out about your business with out spending much (if any) money. And when you're in business for yourself, the more advertising you can get for free, the better!I really like the way the authors describe how to get in to the home based business. Meaning, the idea of working at your full-time job (which you may or may not like) while you test the waters with your own venture on the side. That's excellent advice because if your business idea doesn't take off, you're not stuck without any income. Plus you can stay under your current employer's medical plan (A HUGE money saver!)Overall there is so much information in here, it will be hard to take it in all at once. Likewise, as I stated earlier, the most important thing to remember is make sure and check with a professional accountant and lawyer in your area before/as you get started so they can help walk you through the particulars in your area. Every city and state is different in terms of setting up a business when it comes to taxes and getting your license.Bottom line is, if you are semi-seriously considering starting a home based business, do yourself a favor and pick up this book and read it through. You'll get some good advice and knowledge on what it takes to be your own boss. Of course the other thing you can do is, talk to other small business owners in your area. Take them to lunch and learn as much as you can from those who are successful small business owners."},{"Title":"Home-Based Business For Dummies (For Dummies (Business & Personal Finance))","review":"I will launch my business in March 2005.

The Edwards have written several books on working on home. Their advice is sound and filled with common sense. However, this book does not rate a 5 because it is lacking in details about individual businesses you can start at home. They do have other home businesses books, as I stated. These are filled with 3-5 pages at the most on some individual businesses, but does not go too far into details about each, obviously.

I have known Paul and Sarah Edwards for a long time, both personally and professionally, and one of the reasons for maintaining these relationships is that I admire what they do, how they do it, and how they love to share it. And, this latest book, Home-Based Business for Dummies, is only one example of my admiration.When I found out that Paul and Sarah were authoring yet another edition of this book, I could not wait to see it. I followed their journey of helping people achieve self-actualization for over twenty years, and I can tell you that they worked hard to make Home-Based Business for Dummies the most complete reference on the subject.The book has several beginnings, and the one I truly like is the section titled \\"Taking the Home-Based Business Quiz.\\" That section alone, with its questions focused on what each of us who starts a business needs to ask, is worth the price of the book. It asks you to look at and evaluate your strengths and potential weaknesses and your readiness to get started.Another section of the book goes into the choices that you need to make about the nature of your business, and what you can start right in your garage as did the good people who started Hewlett-Packard, Apple, Amazon, and others, to buying an existing business or franchise, and more, and includes advice on identifying the best option for you..Chapters 3 and 4 detail the ABCs of starting the business, and includes just about everything you need to cover to make it a success, including words to the wise about what financing you should consider, and some sound advice on how to get it. Once the business is started, however, there is still more work to be done to market what you have to offer, and that is covered, as well. There is even a chapter about doing business in \\"challenging times,\\" which is extremely useful for today.The book is easy-to-read, well organized, and thoroughly helpful, and I highly recommend \\"Home-Based Business for Dummies\\" to anyone who wants to start a business, or has a home-based business and has some unanswered questions.

Reading this book about all the crime and police corruption going on and there isn't a single mention of Whitey Bulger (but there is of the Winter Hill Gang) makes it seem like the Boston area in the 80's was just like the wild west.It would be great to get an updated on Clemente and the other members of the gang and see how time has changed their attitudes."},{"Title":"The Cops Are Robbers","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed the book, couldn't stop until my eyes dropped shut. A great first-hand account of police corruption in Masachusetts during the 1970's. I highly suggest this to anyone that grew-up during the era in Massachusetts."},{"Title":"Skin Deep","review":"Ms. Cross has a winner of a novel in 'Skin Deep.' She has interwoven several great story lines, in depth characterization with some serious messages about racism. Kathleen Cross expertly characterizes all of the aspects of the racial divide - white on black - black on white - and especially black on black. Ms. Cross reveals the dynamics of black / black racism and brings out the skin color issue among blacks in a way that brings it home. The dynamics of being black with white coloring living in this society is as complicated as being black and looking black, with all of the confusing messages sent from parents, neighbors, television and society in general.I applaud Ms. Cross for tackling such a complicated subject and delivering her message in a sensational novel.I look forward to her future work."},{"Title":"Skin Deep","review":"Kathleen Cross introduces a problem that most people wouldn't think of--being white in a black world. Nina Moore, a beautiful black woman, is as white as any white person could be, including blue eyes to match her flawless white skin. For many, this would not be a problem, but for her, it causes dismay and uncertainty as to her actual belonging, not only to her family but also to her race. Having grown up in an upper middle class black home, she perceives of herself as black and is proud of her heritage. However, she finds that while looking white opens doors for her, it also alienates her in some respects from her fellow blacks. As events in the novel unfold, she finds herself in a search for her real heritage and is shocked, surprised, and dismayed by what she finds out. The story is interesting, if there are a bit too many soulsearching passages of angst as she despairs over her color, and there are some surprising twists that make it worth reading. The characters are real and engaging and we find ourselves wanting to know more. For a first novel, this is a good one, easy to read and with just enough meat to satisfy the discerning reader."},{"Title":"Skin Deep","review":"Having one Mexican parent and one White parent, I assumed that I was aware of the dilemmas faced by a woman like Nina who does not look like what she is. But I soon realized that the journey Nina Moore was on in Skin Deep opened my eyes to the complexities of skin color and identity, and made me question my own relationships and experiences with the people in my life. I read the book initially because of the theme of ethnic identity, but I was drawn in by the mystery and had to know how the romance would turn out. I couldn't put the book down and I recommend Skin Deep to anyone looking for a witty, sassy love story with an ending that's totally unpredictable!"},{"Title":"Skin Deep","review":"When I picked this book up I thought it was another romance book which I have begun to read again. While reading I realized that this book was more than that. Skin Deep has romance, intrigue and drama. The storyline is not predicatable and the questions that I had throughout were not easily answered until the end. Kathleen Cross has done a wonderful job with this book. How can she top this?Nina, the story's center, was outwardly comfortable with her bi-racial make-up but inwardly she was confused and had every right to be. Too many secrets were being kept from her. I enjoyed the romance between Nina and Ahmad and was glad to see it play itself out. Ahmad was a stand up type of guy and a blessing for his daughter Ebony. Ahmad was betrayed throughout his life but came out on top. Nina's best friend Tonya was a true friend indeed and was the most humorous of them all. All the characters portrayed are believable which makes this book very captivating.There are so many twists and turns in this book that it's hard to categorize and hard to put down (one day to read). My favorite sections are Rasheed and his poetry (deep) and Ahmad's determination to have Nina as his wife. He never gave up!Excellent job!"},{"Title":"Skin Deep","review":"While I found this book entertaining, I have to say I was also disappointed in how the author dealt with the multiracial issues. The characters in this fictional college town setting, particularly Nina's brother and best friend, seemed to go out of their way to discredit multiracial people. When the author has her characters accuse these multiracial students of just &quot;wanting to be anything other than black&quot;, she falls right into the same ignorant category that she is trying to speak out against through this book. To say that someone who is half black and half whatever else should only identify as &quot;black&quot; is insulting and small minded. What would the author say about a person who is half Chinese and half Mexican? No one side is any better than the other and there is NOTHING wrong with wanting to acknowledge both halves of a whole. All Nina did was bemoan her white half and praise her black half. And that's fine, identify with whatever you choose. But to then have your characters ridicule someone in the same position who identifies as multiracial is hypocritical, Miss Cross. You, of all people, should know better."},{"Title":"Skin Deep","review":"In Skin Deep, Kathleen Cross addresses the subjects of race and skin color and masterfully crafts a modern day classic. Cross's imaginative and artful use of the English language breathes intriguing life into her characters from the simple to the complex. Her plot is at once seductive, creative and exciting. Her study of the multifaceted evolution of African American men and their roles in our families dismisses all stereotypes and is a testament to both the strength and vulnerability of our men.The story revolves around Nina, a &quot;proud young Black woman&quot; of mixed parentage, who in appearance is white but in heart, soul and lineage is Black. The story explores Nina's loves, passions, her family secrets, and a God awful nightmare. In this novel, Cross lifts the bar for all modern day novelists. Each chapter provides an intricate piece of an elaborate puzzle. Every sentence compels you to scramble to find the next piece, breathlessly anticipating that next morsel and yet dreading the day when you solve the mystery. As the puzzle takes shape, each piece is increasingly difficult to anticipate until the last elusive part slides into place.This book leaves you wanting, needing, demanding MORE! I anxiously await the next adventure with Ms. Cross. On behalf of all who enjoy superior writing, I thank Ms. Cross for the gift of this brilliant literary work."},{"Title":"Skin Deep","review":"...why I even got this book. It was one of those free ones they offered. A few day's of my time wasted"},{"Title":"Skin Deep","review":"the book has a good story line and i liked the way it was presented to the reader. there were times when i felt that it was a little drawn out. i found myself skipping a couple of pages."},{"Title":"Skin Deep","review":"I liked this book, although I wasn't sure I would at the beginning. The author explores the differences in being a black American or a white American, and does a good job at it. There were parts of the story that I sort of skimmed through (like the long description of the rooms of the house one character purchased), and a few instances where the author left out quotation marks when some characters were talking, but overall it is very well written, keeps your interest and it seems to accurately depict the relationship between the races today in America. I would definitely recommend this, although be warned some of the language is off-color."},{"Title":"Skin Deep","review":"I have to confess this is a book I probably would never have read just judging from the cover and description, but I would have missed out on one of the best novels I've read in a very long time. I recently finished this author's other novel, Schooling Carmen, and loved it so much I thought I'd give this one a try as well. The two books are very different in style and substance, but I loved Skin Deep even more! The two mysteries (hers and his) were very well written. I thought I had the whole thing figured out, but what a twist!I almost wish this book wasn't listed as \\"multicultural\\" or \\"African American\\" because readers like me (waspy) aren't going to find it and that's a damn shame. The characters (LOVED the relationship between Ahmad and his little girl) and the story have such universal appeal. Skin Deep is impossible to put down once the mystery takes hold of you. This book will be on my mind for a long, long time. Not often do you find a novel that is both entertaining and thought-provoking. I highly recommend this one.Kathleen Cross is my new favorite writer. I can't wait to read her next book!"},{"Title":"Skin Deep","review":"This was a wonderful, interesting and thought-provoking book. The author's style of writing definately kept my interest.

It was amazingly different from other novels of the type, far surpassing any expectations. The Spiritual association is especially appreciated. I found the characters to be genuine, with the scope of thought well covered. A subject for further discussion and development is the difference in reaction Nina and &quot;T&quot; had to Rasheed's poem (blame vs bootstrap). In addition I would like to see how Nina, mature in head and heart, would resolve a different reality -- suppose she was a white individual raised with an African-American world-view? This contemporary (thank you!) story would translate well to television, or as an independent film. More, please!"},{"Title":"Skin Deep","review":"I enjoyed the book. I was skeptical at first, this being Ms. Cross' first novel. However, I remember reading her article in Ebony magazine, and I truly enjoyed it. The only thing that I really did not care for in the book was the ending. It jumped too much at the end. However, I will not let that deter me from Ms. Cross' future works. Much success and blessings. Peace!!"},{"Title":"Skin Deep","review":"Nina Moore faces many of the same obstacles that many African-American women face. She's in a relationship that she believes has run its course. She's employed at a university who's just beginning to recognize the importance of African American's contribution to society and is having to fight tooth and nail to make sure the university commits to increasing opportunities for African American students and faculty. She comes from a loving family, of a jazz musician father, a loving mother and funny, bright brother. She is trying to strike balance in her life while continually reconciling with herself and to others the fact that she's not like all the other &quot;sisters&quot; because she is trapped in a white woman's skin.Skin Deep explores the prejudices of both blacks and whites against African Americans who are on the lighter end of the color spectrum. Nina reveals these prejudices from her fianc&eacute;' Derrick who's with her because she looks white, Ahmad, who loathes her (in the beginning) because she looks white and the white administration she works with who promote her over her dark skinned best friend, because she's more palatable to their taste. However the question of color runs deepest for Nina who has a degree of self-loathing because she is so different from other &quot;sisters&quot;. A recurring nightmare is a product of that fear but is also a key to the secret of who she really is. Her parents explained to her that she was the product of an affair that her father had with a white woman. But the truth comes out in dramatic fashion during a deathbed confessional.Skin Deep is a slow read at the beginning. The reader may get the feeling that this is one of those typical black vs. white, light is right diatribes. However Cross skillfully weaves into the mix, how lies, drugs, the criminal justice system and racism can affect the dynamics of family life."},{"Title":"Skin Deep","review":"Nina Moore is 100% sistah. However, to the world, she appears to be white despite the fact that 1/2 of her heritage is African American.Nina wants acceptance and she struggles to find it.The world questions her identity as an African American woman.Her current man Derrick is color struck and she is haunted bya recurring nightmare.Nina meets Ahmad who has an imperfect past. He's now trying to make good by raising her daughter.A slow deep friendship develops between Nina and Ahmad. They later take their friendship to the next level.Nina's nightmare does not end until she discovers the truth about her past. A truth that will almost shatter Nina's world.Skin Deep is a bold and sizzling romance novel. It delves not only into race relations, but also, intra-race relations within the African American community.I would highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Skin Deep","review":"This year, I came across a ... novel that was romantic, suspenseful and real, and had me crying at the end because it wrenched every emotion from you. That novel is Kathleen Cross' &quot;Skin Deep&quot;. I had the privilege of interviewing Ms. Cross..... and without a doubt, I have to say the author is just as real as her writing.SKIN DEEP is the story of Nina Moore, an African American woman who up until her move to Arizona, never considered herself to be anything else BUT a black woman. Even with her pale skin and blue eyes, it didn't bother her when others mistook her for being white, but she soon realizes, through her fianc&eacute; (whose own past creates a need to be with someone &quot;like&quot; Nina), her need and want to find a true love (enter the ever sexy, yet recently released ex-convict, widower and single father, Ahmad) and the secrets that slowly leak from her past, that the most important things in life and love are truly SKIN DEEP.This novel is a definite must-read for all readers, white and black. For romance readers, the sensuous scenes will leave you wanting an AHMAD, STAT! For suspense readers, the secrets that spill from Nina's past will definitely leave you spent! For realist, the racial identity issues (between blacks and whites, as well as blacks and blacks) will definitely leave you nodding your head in confirmation and shaking it in dismay.Shonell Bacon...."},{"Title":"Skin Deep","review":"I read Skin Deep in a matter of 3 days. It is a gripping story and the author painted extremely vivid pictures with her descriptive writing. I found myself getting emotional at some parts of the book and that is not an easy feat to perform for a writer. There is a difference between making someone smile on the outside and inside as well. For a novelist to do both shows a remarkable gift. Its hard to believe this is her first novel. Her style of writing is amazing and her attention to every detail was refreshing.The underlying theme of judging the inside of a person rather than what is on the outside really hit home and I commend her for such a bold debut into the writing world. She boldy ventures into a world of black on black and white on black racism and is real with it.I look forward to reading her future novels."},{"Title":"Skin Deep","review":"To read ova and ova and ova again!Ms. Kathleen Cross has a dynamite novel on her hands.Prior to reading this author's work I thought I had been catapulted to the pinnacle of romance mountaintops via the writing of such big guns as Rochelle Alers, Bette Ford, Gay G. Gunn, Brenda Jackson, Evelyn Palfrey, Donna Hill, Sandra Brown and Terry McMillan, just to name a few. And the brothas that also launched me to those mountaintops, we can't forget them either, such as Eric Jerome Dickey, E. Lynn Harris, James Earl Hardy, Louis Edwards and Michael Baisden.Well, guess what Yall, we have to build more mountaintops and put Ms. Cross along with the greats. Just imagine all of the above greats rolled into one with Donna Hill leading the pack for her mystery input and you come up with Ms. Kathleen Cross. I told you this woman is dynamite (say it like JJ used to say it on &quot;Good Times&quot;).It's hard to believe that this is the sistah's first time out in the literary arena. You have just got to give her major props for this book.Get ready to have your head blown completely off your shoulders. This woman's pen is loaded down with mind-blowing dialogue. On the cover of the book Ms. Rita Ewing astutely lets us know what type of writer Ms. Cross is. The book is &quot;filled with the best ingredients: love, intrigue, conflict and hidden secrets.&quot; Well, anyone who is privileged to read &quot;Skin Deep&quot; had better put on your safety belts before getting on the roller coaster of emotions that Ms. Cross has in store for you.Take a ride through the caverns of hidden secrets (and there are many); get slam dunked in the bed of LOVE, then ride through the underworld of intrigue, and we finally exit into the world of conflicts (again, there are many) - but not necessarily in that order.Now lets wrap the whole package around a stellar cast, created by the one and only Kathleen Cross. Meet Nina Moore - a black woman sealed in a white body; Ahmad Jefferson - a beautiful black specimen who has been wrongfully imprisoned for &quot;5 years, 3 months, 4 days and six hours&quot; (and when you read how he gets slam-dunked in the bed of LOVE you'll recognize the effect of this imprisonment). This brotha wants nothing more than to forget about the harm he encountered at the hands of white people who professed to love him. Now put this in the mix - Nina sets her sights on this fine brotha from the gitty up (getting you interested in reading this book)? You can imagine the conflicts which will arise out of this situation.Now meet some subordinate cast members, but very important ones to the story, and each in their own way creates much drama. Mitchel Moore - Nina's father, Tonya - Nina's best friend (is black and looks black) Nathan - Nina's half brother and the creme De La creme supporting cast member, Morris Michaels.The plot that brings Nina together with her man/apart from her man and..., and the reasons surrounding this mismatched, star crossed couple will keep them on your mind long after you've read the last punctuation mark and have you wishing that there was more to read.The ending will blow you out of romance heaven, as never before captured on paper.The poem by one of the characters I neglected to mention (Rasheed Steele who is Tonya's lover) is so real and pertinent to our people as it puts forth what was taken from us by a people who never had it themselves will have you reflecting on its importance for a very long time. Please, Please, Please just buy the book and experience and breathe this woman's work of art. I assure you, you will not be disappointed.Though I share all of my books with ten other people, I'm going to buy another (or maybe even two more) to keep, just in case this one never makes it back to me. The book is all that!By the way, I wish the people putting the pictures on the covers of these novels would take the time to read the book so the faces would coincide with, or at the very least, resemble what the author depicts in the written word. I'm open for the job!We are not dumb. We know a light skinned black woman (as depicted on the cover of the book) from a woman that could easily travel on the other side and they wouldn't even know it unless we told them (or rather Ms. Cross). The publisher would have done better by using the picture of Ms.Cross herself. I definitely had trouble recognizing our own there.I hope you readers get to read my opinion. I know its long, but it will surely get more book sales for Amazon.com and also Ms.Cross."},{"Title":"Skin Deep","review":"To the author -- THANK YOU for something different! I'm at the point where I can't read another book about three, four or five Black women and their silly relationships. SKIN DEEP was skillfully written and I enjoyed the multicultural theme. The twists and surprises were so well done that I couldn't quite believe this was her first book. I've recommended this to several friends and the best part is -- the book is not expensive. You won't have to plunk down a hefty $25-plus to enjoy this realistic slice of life. Great job, Ms. Cross! I'm looking forward to your next book."},{"Title":"Skin Deep","review":"Like others who picked up this book, i assumed it was a love story. But it IS so much more,it tackles a racial issue that is constantly swept under the rug....Nina deals with the racism of all the races,she deals with being too light for some, and too dark for others. With an incredible amount of inner stregth she faces the struggle with her environment and with herself.She meets a man at a crossroads of his life, Ahmad. Their love story is absolutely beautiful. Kathleen Cross makes everything perfect about the story of Nina and Ahmad, From their first bumpy meeting, to his own battles with her appearance, and to the very end and the way they come together. If she had changed anything about this, it would have stolen its intensity! The author balanced the stories perfectly, Skin Deep, has alot of substories going to build one incredibly intoxicating journey for 6 people. But it never gets dull, it never drags, and it never gets confusing. Each story carries just enough weight, and the mystery following you the whole time ends beautifully"},{"Title":"Skin Deep","review":"Just get though the fisrt few chapters trust me this book will keep you up at night.This book will surprise you just stick with it and trust me if you think you know the ending YOU DON'T just keep reading.Ms Cross I'm ready for you next one GOD BLESS"},{"Title":"Skin Deep","review":"Very good Kathleen Cross. It took me a few chapters to really get into it. But once I go to know the characters which was after 4 chapter. I was really into it. I like the character plots as well as storyline.

Good luck on next book."},{"Title":"Skin Deep","review":"The plot of SKIN DEEP is by no means an original ideal, but the creativity of Ms. Cross has definitely open some eyes and hearts with this story, dealing with issues of black/white parents, family secrets, interracial relationships, injustice in society, single/male parenting, and enabling the reader to be more tolerant of these issues. I truly enjoyed reading SKIN DEEP and look forward to more of Ms. Cross novels in the future. Congratulation! Betty"},{"Title":"Skin Deep","review":"I am not into romance type books but this one is okay. Despite all of the romance, there is a message behind the theme. Reading this book will make you take a look at yourself and how you may treat others because of a difference. It is a good &quot;makes you think&quot; kind of book. Nina, the main character, battles the constant reference to her skin color. She attempts to enlighten those she come in contact with. I especially liked the explanation Nina gives Ebony when Ebony wonders why she is brown and Nina is white-looking. Also, Ms. Cross adds some twists and turns to keep you interested in reading &quot;Skin Deep&quot;. There is no lacking confrontation in this novel. This is a good book to read because it provokes the thought about why we live in a world so hung up on race. I definitely would recommend &quot;Skin Deep&quot; to my friends not for the romantic backdrop but for the message they may derive from reading the book."},{"Title":"Skin Deep","review":"I had planned to get started on my spring cleaning this weekend, but my copy of Skin Deep came in the mail and I didn't get a thing done.

I will order the next one as soon as it is available!"},{"Title":"Skin Deep","review":"I started this book and lost interest after the first chapter. Just seemed like one of a million other cookie cutter african american novels with the untrustworthy male, professional female in the process of getting two-timed. I forgot about it, then several weeks later when I was in the hair salon with nothing else unread on my kindle, I picked it up again. I was surprised that it picked up nicely, and was a decent read. I thought the whole \\"sista\\" \\"brotha\\" thing was silly, and detracted from the book bigtime, made it sound juvenile. Additionally, I felt that even the (male) hero of the book demonstrated the negative black stereotypes I hate: ignorant when it comes to holding on to money, frittering it away when you do get it on silly status symbols. I mean, really! Did he HAVE to get a \\"fully loaded Lincoln navigator\\" a couple months out of jail, when he basically came into not that much, especially if he intended to go to school, own a home etc? At that rate in real life that money would be gone in a few months. It reeks of stupidity. But overall it was decent, I didn't anticipate the twist at the end."},{"Title":"Skin Deep","review":"This book totally backed up my belief that if a Biracial person wants to be &quot;Black&quot; she/he has to totally deny his or her &quot;Whiteness&quot;. If Derrick was a self-hating Black man, wasn't Nina a self-hating &quot;Biracial&quot;? Not all Biracial people are &quot;valley girls&quot; and surprisingly enough, they have a good sense of who they are and where they come from, on BOTH sides. Too much emphasis on being Black!

The author explores the many facets of prejudice, generational curses and secrets that each of us live with each day.The book should become required reading for high schools and colleges across the country. It's defintely an award winning novel and a true page turner.Anfra - author of You Are My Sister"},{"Title":"Skin Deep","review":"These novel was a wonderful piece. I really enjoyed the facted it showed Black men on a positive level. It expressed that not all our men are &quot;dead beat fathers&quot; trying to avoided the monthly child-surpport dues. Ahmad cherished his daughter with everything. He was smart and witty and lets not forget handsome....Nina was a warrior, she knew what she wanted. This book really had me on my toes. The twists and turns in this lituature will really have you going. I find a slice of me in each character. Truly, I think the point that Ms. Cross was displaying in her first and hopefully not the last collections of thoughts was that: it is truly what is IN the inside that counts!"},{"Title":"Skin Deep","review":"Skin Deep gives an oppulent view of dealing with the prejudices and perils that often accompany being of mixed heritage. Kathleen also delves into how one knows who they are. Do you define your race and character according to your color, creed, and parents, or do you define yourself by who you've loved and those that love you back? The story made me think about such things. Insight is all that I received though. I never developed a relationship with the characters of Skin Deep. I really didn't care what happened to them or how their problems were solved. This bothered me because I thought the idea for the story was awesome, but I needed more of a connection or deep caring for the characters. It took me a while to finish the story. I didn't race home from work to read it. Nevertheless, Skin Deep's theme was unique and the point of view held me through out the novel."},{"Title":"Skin Deep","review":"Skin Deep by Kathleen Cross is one of Avon Books best-kept secrets! The Plot was Compelling and Kept Me Turning The Pages Long After My Bedtime Hour. While Skin Deep initially starts off from Nina's perspective it quickly becomes apparent that Skin Deep is just as much Ahmad's story. Nina -a sista who was raised by AA parents but who looks white and as such others perceive her as white until she sets them straight; Ahmad-the handsome, intriguing and recently released ex-convict and struggling single father who won't give Nina the time of day...and she wants to know why.Chapter One starts off with the relationship of Nina and her fianc&eacute;e Derrick...as such I thought this would be another one-dimensional relationship story. However, Nina has a dream that keeps re-occurring and it is soon revealed that one of the reasons she's with Derrick is because she's afraid of what the nightmares might reveal if she doesn't wake up in time ...and from that point I was hooked! I needed to know what was this sista hiding...what was she afraid of...why couldn't she sleep by herself...? How Did Ahmad Fit Into Her Life? What Secrets was He Hiding? Why was he afraid of Nina? Skin Deep's storyline was filled with so much more than relationships gone awry...Love, Betrayal, Abandonment, Rage, Resentment, Revenge, Conflict, Hidden Secrets, and Intrigue were all part of this Compelling Plot.Skin Deep by Kathleen Cross delivers powerful messages in a poignant and memorable fashion and is quite Simply An Outstanding Debut! The storyline includes all the elements of the types of books that I like to read-craftily constructed page turner that is easy to read, emotional, insightful, has vivid imagery(Nina and Ahmad at the praying tree-this scene alone--is worth the cost of the book!), substantial storyline, and a cast of multicultural characters that are memorable, well-developed and ones that I can relate to and care about. Read Skin Deep Today and enlighten yourself to the real meaning of FREE AT LAST, FREE AT LAST, THANK GOD WE'RE FREE AT LAST!"},{"Title":"Skin Deep","review":"The story did start slowly for me and I was tempted to give up but a small voice told me to push through and I'm so glad I did. When all the secrets had come out, I was blown away. I seriously questioned how I would have reacted in that situation and I had to think about how I treat and prejudge people. I am a biracial daughter. My father is African American and my mom is Czech. While I am not light enough to ever \\"pass\\", I could certainly connect with receiving preferential treatment from white people. I know my life would be different had my skin been darker and I have definitely made choices based on how people have treated me (both black and white). There are so many layers to this book that I did not expect to see and I will be thinking of this book for a long time to come."},{"Title":"Skin Deep","review":"Skin Deep was an absolute great read from beginning to end. It share so much insight and many different views. This novel touched close to home for me because I am a biracial female (african american/hispanic) so I can relate to many things discussed. Skin Deep definitely keeps readers engrossed throughout the story, it keeps you wondering what happened and why things are the way they are. You find everything out by the end of the story but it's definitely not what you may expect but all in all it puts things into perspective for you. I recommend this novel 10 times over and will mention it to my Exquisite Ladies Book Club members to go on our BOTM reading list for this year. I will absolutely be looking forward to reading more novels by Kathleen Cross."},{"Title":"Skin Deep","review":"The romance in Skin Deep unfolds so beautifully and the female relationships are solid. This novel is riveting with mystery and sensuousness as it explores race issues in an inspiring way. The novel made me think. And I learned a bit about myself in the process. But, mostly I fell in love with the characters and was cheering for them throughout. I have already passed the book on to a friend and can't wait to read Schooling Carmen!"},{"Title":"Skin Deep","review":"I can see why this is used as college class reading materiial. Although packaged as a romance/mystery novel, it provides remarkable insights into the complexities of interracial and intraracial relationships. The romance is well written. I always like romance written from a woman's perspective and this is well done. The mystery is excellent. I really thought I had it figured out up until the last few chapters when the plot did a 181 degree turn. I am starting to read Ms Cross's blog articles. This compliments her fiction."},{"Title":"Skin Deep","review":"I can't recall how I stumbled across this book but boy am I glad I did. This was an excellent read. I finished this book in one day. The characters were very well developed and the story was believable. This book makes you take a look at yourself. I would definitely recommend it."},{"Title":"Skin Deep","review":"This book was an incredible novel that covered so many complex issues in one touching story. When an author tries to encompass so many elements into a piece they often dont develop them all properly but Kathleen Cross does an excellent job. She put the complex racial issues we ALL face in our society every day into words in a way I have never seen. VERY highly recommended."},{"Title":"Skin Deep","review":"This novel provided me the opportunity to see life through Nina's eyes (well, someone like Nina). Although I have relatives who have coloring like Nina, I never really considered how intra-color discrimination affects them.I would recommend this novel for anyone who feels that African- American females with an ivory or cafe-au-lait color have it \\"easy.\\" To me, this novel clearly shows that having a lighter hue \\"ain't all that,\\" although Nina was blessed to have her parents during her childhood to help her develop a strong sense of who and what she is.This novel helped me to re-evaluate my own color attitudes and prejudices when it comes to African-Americans of the lightest hue."},{"Title":"Skin Deep","review":"Nina's experiences as a black women who looked white were extraordinary.I recommend this book to anyone who likes to read about romance and deceit, because this is your type of book.I loved the book, I loved the characters, and I loved the relationships between them. This is a must read."},{"Title":"Skin Deep","review":"The author spends a great deal of time developing the characters in the first few chapters which can be boring at times. But, once all the characters are introduced the book take off. You will not want to put it down. The book has it all: Romance, Suspense, Love and more. This is a must read."},{"Title":"Skin Deep","review":"I wish I could rate this novel with a 10. I enjoyed this book with all my heart. I cried and laughed throughout the book. I really was sad when I turned to the last page. I'm hoping for a sequel. Ebony was a very articulate little girl. The relationship she shared with her father was heartwarming. Ms. Cross I understand this is your first novel. I want to say, you are very talented. I can't wait for your next novel. Keep the faith and be blessed!"},{"Title":"Skin Deep","review":"This book not only has a compelling plot to keep you turning pages, but it raises issues of what culture, race, and color actually mean--those issues will stay with you long after you finish the book. I'm very impressed with Katherine Cross' first novel, and look forward to more."},{"Title":"Skin Deep","review":"Our book club had already tentatively chosen a book for September, but I am so glad a fellow member suggested we read Skin Deep. I laughed, cried and talked out loud to this book. But, what was even better was the discussion we just had at our monthly meeting! The issues of skin color, interracial dating, raising our children to love themselves (and others) no matter what &quot;color&quot; they are... I mean, we got DEEP with it.The author created characters that are believable and lovable (even Derrick, with his messed up self) and every chapter was like a story in itself. Skin Deep is highly recommended!!!"},{"Title":"Skin Deep","review":"I was traveling through Chicgo on my way home to Baltimore (from Los Angeles) when I came across a book store that displayed Skin Deep.

I can't wait for the next one."},{"Title":"Skin Deep","review":"I had to know. Talk about a page turner - I thought I figured out the mystery, and I was sure I knew exactly how the romance would turn out, but once I realized I had it all wrong - I couldn't put the book down until I knew how the story would end. I found the ending to be creative and unexpected. I loved the book from start to finish."},{"Title":"Skin Deep","review":"in general, Skin Deep is a breezy, entertaining, and at times a quite moving read, exploring important issues like the connection between self loathing and interracial dating, single parenthood, and the confusion caused by the conflict between one's socialized racial identity and their biological racial make-up. good stuff that was handled persuasively and even-handedly by a very competent first-time writer. however, i've read in some of the other 'online reviews' that other readers found the ending to be 'surprising' and 'strong', but i couldn't disagree more. i personally found the ending to be a bit pat, manipulative, and (ironically) soap opera-ish. certainly this story and the important issues so deftly and subtly handled in the rest of the novel deserved a better, less sensationalized, more organic conclusion. still, a solid first novel. support this sista and buy it. tell your friends to buy it. spread the good word... peace."},{"Title":"Skin Deep","review":"Cross writes a biracial character who is not a pitiful victim - LONG OVERDUE! Being mixed with Black and Japanese, I could relate to the story, and I was so GLAD to finally see a biracial character who wasn't portrayed as a confused victim! With or without the intriguing issue of skin color and race, Cross wrote a story anyone can relate to because its about what we all want deep down - to be loved for WHO we are not WHAT we happen to look like. The mystery Nina Moore was trying to uncover, and the sizzling love story kept me turning pages for hours and hours straight - AND best of all, the ending was satisfying and unpredictable. This is her FIRST novel??? I can't wait for the next!"},{"Title":"Skin Deep","review":"A FUNNY, PAINFUL and HOPEFUL BOOK... I was fortunate to be a review reader of this novel before it was released by the publisher. The dialogue is fresh and funny and the characters are real people you are sure to recognize... The issue of skin color was treated in a refreshing way that made me want to pass the book on to some folks I know who I wish would've read it aloud to themselves A LONG TIME AGO. And on top of all that, Kathleen Cross did something no author has been able to do to me in a long while...she wrote an ending I just never saw coming... I LOVED THE BOOK!"},{"Title":"Skin Deep","review":"A good read. Very entertaining. No matter what color we are we are not in controlled of our emotions, especially when it comes to love. Mrs. Cross did an excellent job in getting the message across. Nina was a very strong woman who despite Ahmad's background gave him a chance. I just love every word of this book."},{"Title":"Skin Deep","review":"I ordered the book to evaluate for my Book Club reading list.

Oh, but what an ending - I was in tears.I have read all of Terry McMillan's books, several of Bebe Moore-Campbell's books, and a few others, and I must say that SKIN DEEP ranks in with the best of them!!The author's use of imagery was incredible :) I could picture everything - from a soapy Ebony in the gym to Nina and Ahmad at the praying tree.I am in love with this book and I hope she will write more of these!"},{"Title":"Skin Deep","review":"My fiance asked (begged) me to read this book and I honestly was not the most willing participant going in. I am a black man who usually reads non-fiction, and MAYBE a mystery now and then.I was a little put off at the beginning - thought it was the start of another male bashing book.WHAT A SURPRISE to find that after only a couple of chapters I was HOOKED. I loved Ahmad and I especially liked Tonya who was so pragmatic and straightforward about everything she believed.Ms. Cross skillfully used the character of Nina Moore to make me question the lines between black and white, and also led me and my fiance (who is Iranian) to discuss our attraction for each other, our relationship, and the issues we should be prepared to address when we have children.We didn't get the impression Nina rejected the white side of herself, but that she was grateful to have been raised by her father... He was the reason she had a tie to the black community and that tie was deep and precious to her. My fiance could relate to that because no matter how much she respects and loves me and my culture, she knows that tie is something she cannot have - an unspoken &quot;disconnection&quot; exists for her because she isn't black.Anyone who reads this book with open eyes can't help but see the underlying message: Race is a social construct that has taken on a reality of its own - but the real truth is - underneath the surface, we are all members of a greater race... the HUMAN one!"},{"Title":"Skin Deep","review":"This was a great read from the beginning to the end.

I'm glad I made the purchase."},{"Title":"Skin Deep","review":"Kathleen Cross writes a touching story about race and racial perceptions. Set in Arizona, one of the last states to celebrate Martin Luther King Day, Nina Morris is a very fair skinned bi-racial PhD student at Founders University. She breaks up with her fiance, gets a job she thinks her roommate deserves, and can't sleep because of a re-occuring nightmare. Ahmad Jefferson is good looking chocolate man, just out of prison who recently obtained custody of his daughter and can't see himself dating white women. Each of them is searching for the same thing. Each of them have the same problem. Each of them learn much about themselves.This was a pleasant read that had me at the beginning and kept me engaged through out.

But it caught and kept my attention from the beginning. The poetry also was beautiful and though I was able to (partially) figure out the ending, I was still surprised. There are very few books that I'm not able to figure out the ending completely.I would definitely recommend this book to anyone...irregardless of race."},{"Title":"Skin Deep","review":"This was an awesome read - read it in a few days. Kathleen told a wonderful story that you could relate to. I especially liked the way she portrayed the child - very insightful and true to the bone. Children are exactly the way little Miss Ebony was portrayed - I smiled a lot when I read parts with Ebony in it and even cried. The story told regarding the skin color of people was one that is true to this very day and told very well without a lot of prejudices involved. Especially if you are bi-racial you can relate very well to how hard it is to fit in when you are not enough of either race. I know a lot of people think it's easy to be bi-racial but it is a very hard thing for children and adults to deal with. Because as I said you are not enough of either race and caught in-between, which sometimes will leave confusion if you are not comfortable with who you are as a person. Kathleen told the struggle of that very well with Nina. This was a wonderful book that I think anyone would be delighted to read. Loved the story line and the little romance between the two main characters was nice and sweet once overcoming the feelings of skin color. LOVE IT! Oh and the twist at the end - never saw that coming!!"},{"Title":"Technology Strategies for the Hospitality Industry","review":"This is an interesting and basic book for those planning to work in the hospitality industry to become familiarized with the technology issues and information systems they are likely to encounter in their jobs. The book isn't on the sharpest cutting edge of technology, but in an introductory book like this, that matters much less. It is the broad subjects of each chapter that matter most.The book is eleven chapters in two parts. The first part consists of four chapters on computing basics. They discuss IT based careers in Hospitality, using IT for competitive advantage, computing essentials, and networks & security.The second part has chapters on e-commerce, restaurant management systems, property management systems & interfaces, hotel global distribution systems, databases, the power of information, and strategic hospitality technology investment.One interesting feature is that each chapter begins with a short interview with an authority in the field of the topic the chapter discusses followed by a short introduction.The authors do a fine job of keeping the techo-speak to a very minimum because this book is focused for hospitality industry people rather than computer jocks. However, it is about IT matters rather than sunblock and chlorination levels for the hotel pool. So, with that little caveat, have fun!"},{"Title":"Technology Strategies for the Hospitality Industry","review":"This is an excellent beginner's guide to hospitality technology. It is a &quot;Reader's Digest-on-Adkins-Diet&quot; treatment but the authors hit some high points and de-mystify much of the jargon without bogging the reader down in too much information.Each chapter begins with an interview of an industry luminary. While a tad superfluous, the interviews are a light-weight introduction of each topic, a reinforcement of the vocational pragmatism of the text and an attempt to humanize the subject matter.The first two chapters are preachy but a good discussion of what IT (information technology) means in the context of hospitality and why one should care. For those just beginning their careers, or those who might have forgotten why we do what we do, they are worthwhile reading.The balance of the book is a compendium of the major application sets specific to the industry - CRS, PMS, POS, CRM, MIS, EIS - and just in time to prevent TLA overload, includes segments on e-commerce (defined mostly as Internet purchasing methods) and a primer on how to specify, evaluate and acquire technology.The authors are faithful throughout to the theme of technology for the sake of the business and emphasize strategic considerations at each turn. They reasonably stop short of defining or recommending specific business strategies, instead stressing the importance of aligning technology with the strategies of the organization as a whole.Recommended reading for newbie's or baffled veterans trying to get their arms around IT hospitality concepts and issues.(Review first appeared on Hotel-Online and in Hospitality Upgrade Magazine)"},{"Title":"Technology Strategies for the Hospitality Industry","review":"An excellent grounding in systems fundamentals and the principal hospitality industry applications, as well as on the use of information technology for strategic operational advantages, on how the power of data analysis leads to better informed management, and on making strategic investments in technology. The appendices on using IT for intelligent marketing, revenue management and distribution channel management are especially worthwhile. The pace of technology has left some of the technology specifics rather out of date, especially the chapter and appendix on interface standards, although the latter do give a good grounding on why inter-systems communications have been such a problem. Overall a very worthwhile addition to the available literature and highly recommended."},{"Title":"Technology Strategies for the Hospitality Industry","review":"Very nice item , accurate item description and careful packaging .

While beneficial, too much reading about other people's lives gets old real fast."},{"Title":"Technology Strategies for the Hospitality Industry","review":"There is scarcely any room in modern business for the technologically naive worker. This is especially so in hospitality where information is the competitive edge in a highly competitive industry.The useful book is divided into two parts with a total of eleven chapters. The first part talks about the basics of information technology. The discussion is crisp and thorough and could be useful to anyone who was just beginning to consider the rle of information technology in business. The overall tone and message of the book is set in chapter 2: Using Information Technology for Competitive Advantage. This is a book about the part that information plays in the business strategy of hospitality organizations.The second part covers specific needs of the modern hospitality organization. The chapters deal with E-commerce, restaurant management systems, property management systems and interfaces, hotel global distribution systems and channels, databases and more. There is a chapter called The Power of Information that is one of the best examples of useful philosophy that I've ever seen in a business text.Each chapter begins with an interview with someone who has coped with infomanagement in a practical setting. The interviews could stand to be a little tighter, but they allow students a soft intro to each chapters topic while humanizing the concerns expressed in the chapter. The interviews are one of the aspects of the book that make it so much better than anything else available. The authors wisely refrain from recommending specific solutions to problems of information gathering and analysis. The emphasis is relentlessly on the needs of business strategizing.This is one of those rare books that manages to talk about a quickly changing situation without becoming immediately obsolete. It is written in an easy style that students (and faculty and professionals) will find approachable. It would be an excellent source for in-service training and I highly recommend it to any hospitality professional who wants to advance his or her career.-Lynn Hoffman, author of The New Short Course in Wine and the forthcoming novel bang-BANG from Kunati Press."},{"Title":"Technology Strategies for the Hospitality Industry","review":"This book makes great reading for students and veterans alike. After over 25 years in hospitality technology, I still found nuggets of golden information inside. Particularly useful are the sections on inventory management and channel distribution - two of the most complex and important subjects faced by managers in the hospitality industry today. This was written as a text. Well, I admit that I skipped the learning activities at the end of each section. But I made up for it by recommending the book to many industry friends."},{"Title":"How to flow in the super supernatural","review":"It was easy to read. It was a good look at tongues and the Holy Spirit from a non-Pentecostal perspective."},{"Title":"Hollywood","review":"This is unquestionably one of the best of Vidal's longitudinal series on the governing classes of the US. While the cover is something of a double misnomer - Hollywood is more of a theme than the plot and it barely gets into the 20s - the book offers a deep and hilarious view of what was going on in the period. You feel what it was like (for some of the monied elite) to be there as witnesses and occasionally shapers of events, which is the essence of successful historical fiction, making the reader curious to look to history books for greater detail and analyis. Indeed, I found this volume to be Vidal's most subtle since Lincoln, full of themes and concepts that fascinate and titillate. It is often difficult to know where Vidal stands, at least for me, and that is a big part of the fun.In addition to the usual characters of the Sanford sibs and Sen. Day, at the center of the novel is Woodrow Wilson. You watch his decline, at once political - he loses his grip on the nation's political imagination with WWI and then the wrangle over the League of Nations - and physical. While he was indeed a messianic idealist, Vidal also creates a very human portrait of him that I read as sympathetic and, while typically sarcastic, almost entirely lacking in vidalian cynicism. You get Wilson's vision of the future as well, which events were surpassing as he dug in his heals, pointing directly to WWII. The nation at war, with all of the moral principles so blithely thrown about, also appeared to me as a prescient evocation of a key part of the American character, its narcissistic belief in the face of contrary evidence that it always acts for a righteous cause on the good guys side - just look at the current war in Iraq! More particularly, Vidal portrays the repression of free speech and the blatant hypocracy in light of our stated constitutional ideals.But there is also WG Harding and his courtiers, who added up to a disastrous mix of executive inattention and the crudest corruption, complete with murdered scapegoats. This too is a huge part of the American system, the desire to let things go and seek the good life while the rats are chewing out the bottom of the barrel. Sound familar? Again, it seems so prescient.Lastly, there is a taste of the power that Hollywood was becoming. This was the most unexpected part for me, as I am a hardened political junkie and quite ignorent of this part of American culture. Essentially, Vidal questions whether the incipient movie moguls' vision - that of shaping the dreams of the American psyche - will become more important than the shenanigans going on in Wash, DC. As such, his characters see a progression from politicians telling people what to believe, through Hearst's yellow journalism evoking what they should fear, to the far deeper tappng into the public's collective unconscious. That Vidal succeeds in getting a person as jaded as I am to take a new look at so many things is indeed a feat.Recommended as one of the best of the series. Now that I have read them all, I feel I must go back through the entire series to see more subtle linkages. This series is a wonderful experiment in a new style of hyper novel."},{"Title":"Hollywood","review":"With an absolute grip on detail, Gore Vidal describes an era: the presidencies of Woodrow Wilson and Warren Harding. Vidal's storytelling skills are venerable, however, the text often reads like a stream of consciousness rather than one marked by satisfying conclusions on his characters' actions. Rather than being swept up in the narrative, I kept getting lost in the vast number of characters introduced. Vidal's incisive wit seems to have been tempered by age to the point of blandness at times.. Hearst, Hollywood, Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt drift through the pages without bringing impact to the story.I still love anything Vidal writes, but this book disappointed me.Judith ClancyKyoto, Japan"},{"Title":"Hollywood","review":"The fifth novel, chronologically, of Gore Vidal's American chronicle series deals with much more than the evolution of the industry that bears the title of this book. There is at least as much political chicanery in Washington as movie-making propagandizing in Hollywood. Politics runs through Vidal's blood so he can never escape the subject entirely. The dual career of Caroline Sanford as east coast newspaper publisher and west coast starlet, while not completely implausible, seems to be a way of weaving the world of the entertainment capital into the fabric of the political capital. I was quite interested in many of the strands of both stories but I felt they were welded together more than organically linked.I have read the American chronicle novels preceding this one and two of his early novels (The Judgement of Paris and Messiah). I had thought that Vidal had a workmanlike but non-descript style similar to Steinbeck's, at the opposite end of the spectrum from writers like Faulkner and Hemingway who announce their unique presence on every page. In the American chronicle novels, however, the god-like narrator is none other than Vidal himself, the catty, gossipy gadfly insider/outsider who can't resist giving you the inside scoop on every major development that occurs in his world. There are passages of spectacular wit and irony as well as a few in which he seems to be straining for an effect. Hollywood is nonetheless quite readable and especially indispensable in Vidal's American mythology and contributes new evidence to support my belief that he is one of America's most underrated writers from the mainstream."},{"Title":"Hollywood","review":"Hollywood, at least as it stands in relation to Empire, Vidal's previous book on turn of the century power politics, is dissapointing. Vidal's old gang of power brokers, Caroline Sanford, James Burden Day, Blaise Sanford, William Randolph Hearst and the rest do return, though older and strangely out of breath.Vidal's main focus, the joining of Hollywood and Washington as collaborating sources in producing a particular type of propaganda -- America as it must and shall be -- is only forcefully embraced at the end of the novel. Earlier chapters set in the movie capitol, though meant to support this thesis, are unfocused and star-struck. Trivial personalities, simply because they were stars 80 years ago, are given the bulk of Vidal's precious pages. The deft and conceited Caroline, one of Vidal's best all-time creations, is really not allowed to say that much.Instead, horribly, she becomes a movie star. Nevermind that she is co-publisher of the most powerful newspaper in Washington and, if she were a more realistically fleshed out charachter, might prefer to stay there. Added to this she is given a filmmaker boyfriend.&quot;Yes, this was her lover. Women, Blaise noted, not for the first time, had no taste in men.&quot; With his own pen Vidal dismisses Caroline's love interest, the hapless Timothy X. Farell. As we are inclined to do also.In spite of its flaws, Hollywood is a necessary read for those won over by its brilliant predecessor Empire. Strangely enough some of its finest writing centers around the lowly charachters of the Harding Administration -- as swinish, one senses, as their day.Washington is Vidal's comfort zone, the place where his writing reads the most accurately, where his charachters speak the most assuredly. In Hollywood much of those gifts are wasted."},{"Title":"Hollywood","review":"Gore Vidal's Empire series is pretty much the best thing ever to happen to American historical fiction, and his style alone makes anything of his catalog readable. Readers will no doubt notice that this is the sort of prelude to a critique of someone you admire, and this is indeed what it is. Hollywood, Vidal's fifth book in the Empire series, qualifies as one of the lower points in a series that has seen nearly unimaginable highs, but this entry often feels more erudite than inspired, and more harping than insightful.This being said, there's much to like in this book. It roughly covers the second Wilson Administration, as well as the Harding years, and ends shortly after Harding's death. I thought that the political elements of the book are strong--Vidal has always had an uncanny knack for getting in the heads of powerful men, and rendering to life forgotten figures like Harding and Harry Daugherty is admirable and invaluable. Even more appreciated is Vidal's focus on important women--the second Mrs. Wilson and Mrs. Harding both provide vivid presences, just as poor old Mrs. McKinley in Empire. Vidal's characterization in this book is a little spotty at times, but there's lots of good stuff to be had here: Harding's arc, in particular, is a fascinating look at how power can change a fundamentally good man, and there's a thoroughly-covered convention scene that has Vidal running on all cylinders. There's also the rise and fall (mostly fall) of Woodrow Wilson, who is blessedly complicated here as a man of genuine idealism as well as incredible pigheadedness and ambition. Other political notables, like Theodore Roosevelt, make appearances. I've always been amused by Vidal's dark--and evidently accurate--take on Teddy, whose enduring popularity mostly proves that not only are elections popularity contests, but so are historical appraisals. How else could Andrew Jackson find himself anywhere near the top of any lists of presidential historical rankings?So, that's all well and good. But much of this book is given over to a main plot about Caroline Sanford moving to Southern California and becoming something of a minor screen star in silent pictures, having random encounters with contemporaneous film industry notables, engaging in some affairs, etc. This story isn't followed through quite as nicely as one would have hoped. The story fundamentally lacks dramatic tension, the observations aren't quite fresh enough to count as insightful (really, if stars using drugs and \\"political\\" films being whitewashed of any controversy to avoid angering the powers that be are revelations to you, you should pay a little more attention) and while he makes some good narrative argumentation about the importance of movies, there's not much tension in this storyline. Even a murder subplot at the end of the novel can't quite make the material sing (though I echo the official Amazon review--the bathhouse scene is pretty amazing).In any event, Vidal still has a pretty high batting average when it comes to American historical fiction, despite some of the less compelling material here. Vidal fans will find much to like, but when one thinks of what Vidal could have made of the movie business and what kind of stories could have been told about it, it just seems like we should expect more from such a legend. And if you're new to Vidal's work, it's probably best to start with Burr or Lincoln."},{"Title":"Hollywood","review":"The first scene is grand, with William Hearst's bulk shattering an antique chair and dropping to the thick Persian rug. The place to be now is Hollywood, says early 20th century media mogul Hearst as he bids good-by to his host and owner of the demolished Biedermeier chair, Blaise Sanford. Unlike Hearst, Washington newspaper publisher Sanford is fictional.But it's the second scene that starts the more mesmerizing narrative thread. Madame Marcia conducts a s&eacute;ance for Mrs. Harding and Jesse Smith--the Hardings' Ohio friend, owner of a dry goods emporium, a dewy-eyed political groupie and an unofficial lobbyist-government contractor of sorts. Poor Jess suffers from diabetes and sees ghosts.The shadows on the screens merge with shadows in Washington as power shapes the manufacturing of screen fantasies and conversely the making of fantasies leads to power. The wonderful movie, Wag the Dog, is many decades in the future. But as Gore Vidal presents it, the 1920s is when politics became integrated with moving pictures and the latter took over the world.What's so wonderful, says Hearst, is that all over the world the illiterate masses are watching my Pauline. His Pauline keeps moving on the screen because otherwise the audience might move out of the theater. This vivid depiction of Hearst stays close to the real man while making his foray into the movies the emblem of a society increasingly ruled by the image.But Hearst is a side character. President Harding, Sanford, his sister Caroline, Senator Burden Day and blind Senator Thomas Gore--quite a cast. But it's Jess who's truly unforgettable.At the end of the book, the shadows and ghouls get Jess, in a manner of speaking. As the reader wonders how he could have committed suicide by shooting himself on the left side of his head when he is right handed, all kinds of recent events involving lobbyists, lawyers, contractors, wars and sex in the oval office come to mind. Vidal is a master in bringing the distant past alive in a way that helps you think about the recent past and the present.The whole perhaps does not match the brilliance of some of the parts, but this historical novel, and indeed the series of five novels that starts with Burr and ends with Hollywood, are a must read for anyone who wants to understand America. And if you have any thoughts of what exactly happened to Jess, I'd love to hear."},{"Title":"Hollywood","review":"Arguably, I am at fault for not having read Gore Vidal's other historical works in some sort of chronological order. Indeed, I reached for \\"Hollywood\\" upon hearing of Vidal's death. I thought it timely that I acquaint myself with this much-lauded author.Unfortunately, I struggled with \\"Hollywood\\". Some of the nuances of the story and characters were probably lost on me. Whilst I knew the broad sweep of the history under discussion, I was not familiar with the finer points.In brief, \\"Hollywood\\" is something of a misnomer as the book covers the period of the dying days of the Wilson presidency and thence the Harding presidency until the latter's untimely death in late 1923. Hollywood itself is largely a backdrop upon which the larger events play.I would suggest that \\"Hollywood\\" is best read and enjoyed by those persons with a deep interest in American political history. Although well written, the novel played above my head. However, to the true aficionado, I suspect it will be very well received."},{"Title":"Hollywood","review":"I just love the Narratives of Empire books from Mr. Vidal. This is the first book of these that I bought and fell in love with the story. Since then I have purchased the other books in the series and am just about finished with Empire and will be re-reading Hollywood next. For me I love the excursion to Hollywood of the silent era which I have done some reading on so much of what Mr. Vidal writes of I have read of before. It does help if you have a grasp not only of politics of the early part of the last century and of early Hollywood. Still if you have never heard of Warren G. Harding or D W Griffith you will still love the book because of Mr. Vidal's wonderful writing. His writing is so descriptive that you can see the places he writes about and his humor is such a treat. I would highly recommend these books to anyone and everyone."},{"Title":"Hollywood","review":"Images manufactured with the intent of directing public opinion to support adventurers and profiteers is the tragic central theme of this novel. Our nation is in the hands of rascals and criminals, but as long as the pictures are pleasing and square with some melodramatic logic, the great unwashed stay quiet. It's enough to make you weep."},{"Title":"Hollywood","review":"This book provides several leitmotifs from the perspectives of several major fictional characters (Caroline Sanford, Blaise Sanford, and James Burden Day) that easily intermingle with the era's most historical non-fictional figures. With uncanny serendipity, each fictional character is able to find themselves engaged with every major political player at the exact moment they are making a major international decision. As there is no real historical figure to personify the influence of Hollywood on global politics, only Vidal's historical fiction can investigate the connection. His main character, Caroline Sanford, a.k.a. Emma Traxler, has an impossibly rich life transgresses the boundaries of American socialite, newspaper mogul and movie starlet. All while raising an illegitimate daughter and having affairs with America's most powerful men (two directors and a senator). Wow! What a woman!The story covers the transition from the pre-World War I presidency of Woodrow Wilson through the convoluted election of his successor, Warren Gamaliel Harding. As the Presbyterian Minster turned History Professor turned quixotic dictator, Woodrow Wilson, personifies utopian ideals of \\"peace without victory\\" and \\"League of Nations\\" while insulating himself personally from Americans. Wilson is the main non-fictional character of the book, but is neither portrayed as a villain or hero. He is an apparent victim; a man with vision and ideals, but unable to navigate the ruthless power struggles with Teddy Roosevelt nor the recent Republican majorities of the congress and senate. The League of Nations becomes a logomachy for the political advancement among party power brokers rather than a realistic foreign policy. The 1920 presidential campaign was characterized less by the stature of the candidates who ran but by the stature of those who could not run (Teddy Roosevelt -died suddenly; Woodrow Wilson - stroke). Warren Gamaliel Harding is, at best, the third most popular candidate in the 1920 Republican Primary. He is the ideal \\"middle of the road candidate\\" who prefers the sports pages to the editorials election and is addicted to chewing tobacco. As everyone's second favorite, he is able to slip past two more popular candidates at the republican convention, then easily pass an unsupported democratic candidate, who never has a chance because Woodrow Wilson refuses to pull out of the race, despite his physical and mental incapacities. An appreciation I have for Vidal is that he dispels the myth that political futility has only occurred in the last twenty years. Through his American Chronicles Series, he truly illustrates that politicians since George Washington have been caught in the organization of government and have found themselves spinning their myriad wheels frantically in the mud, going no where. Self-promotion, deception and manipulation were as prevalent for the founding fathers and their rowdy successors as they are today.However, the common focus of the book is the examining a fledgling American Empire that is bent on expanding its capitalist markets while professing democratic demagoguery. For Vidal, America's top export is its military. Despite an isolationist bent and fear of foreign entanglements, America is a burgeoning market looking to expand. Although the League of Nations makes rational sense and had supporters on both the Republican and Democratic parties, it was implausible because \\"Americans are too used to going alone in the world. You're also at the start of your own empire, and no rising empire wants to commit itself to peace when there are still so many profitable wars to fight (p. 119).\\" Hence an ongoing theme for Vidal: ongoing demagoguery for democracy while implementing militant actions with the intent of enriching the nation. Not so coincidently, the term \\"gilded\\" is ubiquitous in a not so subtle illusion to Mark Twain's \\"Gilded Age.\\" America is a world power with a perceivably dominant military, but still a neophyte to the international power business and the American citizenry is largely folksy, ignorant and superstitious. Vidal further points out the hypocrisy of America's \\"freedom\\" while implementing quasi-fascist legislation including the Espionage Act, Prohibition and Selective Service. There has always been tension in America between individual rights and the common good; however, the decisions about \\"common good\\" usually come at the leisure and advantage of the reigning political elite.In his elitist style, all decisions are made by an exclusive star chamber of the rich and educated social superiors. As in past novels, senatorial cabals interplay with corrupt Party power-brokers to create historical events. For Vidal, \\"the American voters\\" act as a singular player; a pawn moving at the whim of the newspapers and politicians. Often, Vidal portrays the intent of American politicians as being as much to deceive the American voters as our enemies. For example, the Committee on Public Information was established to propagandize for the war. In this vein, Hollywood is introduced and becomes a new national player. The few small towns on the west coast become influential in international politics as the wealthy (William Randolph Hearst) and powerful (Colonel George Creel) discover that if Americans can be easily influenced by what is on the printed page, then they will be exponentially seduced by what they see on the silver screen. Vidal connects the celebrity endorsements of Liberty Bonds, which predominantly funded the effort for World War I, with the propaganda movies that vilified international enemies; first, the \\"Huns\\" of Germany, then, the \\"Reds\\" of Russia.I would warn readers that this is first and foremost a novel of historical fiction based primarily on the political events of 1917 through 1920. If you are primarily interested in the industry of Hollywood during that era, I would recommend looking elsewhere. Hollywood is merely a tangential player in the novel \\"Hollywood\\" in that the fledgling industry propagates the political manipulation of the masses. Actors, actresses, directors and studio moguls of the times are mentioned but are not primary players. For example, Vidal provides a great monologue of Charlie Chaplin as he flits through various characters in a Robin Williams-esque manner. However, smoke filled meetings of strategizing senators are the scenes of climatic intrigue, not the dynamics of a growing silver screen industry."},{"Title":"Hollywood","review":"I bought this book because it was ostensibly about Hollywood during the golden days of the silent movies. I found the beginning of the book so tedious I actually stopped reading it-- starting over again a few months later. After at least one hundred boring pages introducing endless Washington characters (trying to sort out their relationships to each other is mind numbing), you finally get a glimpse of Hollywood. The book then goes back and forth, with the majority of &quot;action&quot; (a term I use very loosely) taking place in the east. I enjoyed the last fifty pages or so. If you like Gore Vidal, okay read it. But if you are interested in old Hollywood--I suggest you skip this book and find something else."},{"Title":"A treasury of Ozark country humor: 1,400 stories, anecdotes, witticisms, and one-liners for speakers, storytellers, and anyone who enjoys a good laugh","review":"There are indeed 1,400 stories, anecdotes, witticisms and on-lineers in this work and some, very few, are even sort of cute and funny. The biggest problems I have with this work is that for the life of me I cannot see how the work within this book has any thing to do with country, much less the Ozarks. I suppose there may be a few that relate, but you certainly have to dig for them. On the other hand, there are some nice lines that would indeed be useful to speakers, etc. Maybe this was just my cup of tea, you might quite well enjoy it."},{"Title":"Handbook to Higher Consciousness: The Workbook (Keyes, Jr, Ken)","review":"I was given this book by my boyfriend. For several years I have struggled with Panic Attacks. They have totally controlled my life for the past three years. I had a problem with the ability to trust men. A year ago I would have never thought to get into another relationship for the fact that I did not think that I was capable of handling one. Until I met the man of my dreams. I was very scared at first because I did not want to reveal that I had two major problems, panic attacks and trust. As soon as I told him that these were major obsticles in my life, he and I started the road to recovery.This book has shown me that I am not the only person who thinks like this. It showed me that things throughout my life have programmed me to think this way, and all I had to do is reprogram my brain. This book gives you the resources to do that.Since reading this book I have almost completely wiped out my panic attacks and I am now experiencing a wonderful, happy and healty relationship with the man I love. This book has also shown me how to love UNCONDITIONALLY, a word that has never been in my vocabulary. I now have the ability to love him the way that love was meant to be &quot;from the heart.&quot;I can't say enough about this book, it has truly changed my life."},{"Title":"Handbook to Higher Consciousness: The Workbook (Keyes, Jr, Ken)","review":"If there was to be only one book that humanity could hold, to represent it's pinacle of loving wisdom - then this would be it. The handbook is not based on any one religious teaching but rather a scientific approach to understanding what it is that can make us feel either depressed or in a state of total bliss. The book is well written and easily understood; when I read this book the words seamed not only to make sence but it was though they rang true in the most profound way. I was lucky enough to find a copy in a charity shop and I have lent the book to all of my friends, one of which has lost the book and now thanks to Amazon I hope to be reunited with this timeless gem of wisdom."},{"Title":"Handbook to Higher Consciousness: The Workbook (Keyes, Jr, Ken)","review":"The author sees our brain as a computer and our experiences of life as the computer's programs.

This is a fantastic book and everyone can benefit from its common sense advice.. and find true happiness"},{"Title":"Handbook to Higher Consciousness: The Workbook (Keyes, Jr, Ken)","review":"The Handbook To Higher Consciousness by Ken Keyes needs to be experienced, to be understood and learned. It is said that what is truly learned, is life changing. The writing of Ken Keyes changed my life. It made me happier.What I learned from \\"The Handbook To Higher Consciousness\\" has stayed constant, yet through applying the methods in every day situations, I continually discover new \\"Ah-ha's.\\"I have come to realize, everything boils down to what Ken defines as \\"Addictions/Demands\\" and\\"Preferences\\".Demands bring unhappiness. Preferences bring happiness. What is a demand for one person, may not be for another.The key is to be to become aware of ones own demands (not other people's) and then to go to work on up-leveling them. Not to become a BETTER person, but a HAPPIER one.The book and its methods, made me increasingly aware, that everyday life is a school; one filled with people and circumstances that made me aware of what triggers my own demands, and interfered with my happiness, and consequently the happiness of everyone around me.Ken says:1. Everyone and everything, becomes your teacher.2. Everything is always perfect--either for your growth or for pleasure.Working with Ken's methods, I began to realize the scores of ego driven demands I'd acquired early on in life. Gradually, many of them were uplifted to preferences. Others still remain, but are less painful. (Just knowing what is happening when a demand is triggered, goes a long ways, in helping to alleviate it.)Over time, I have been able to operate more and more consistently from a peaceful and loving basis. When I do not, at least I can, usually, identify the demand I am experiencing--be reminded once again--life is checking me out.My up-leveled \\"preferences\\" create the experience of happiness-- my \\"demands\\" always create the experience of pain.Example: A psychologist might say \\"Conditioning\\" creates unhappiness. A Christian might say happiness depends on \\"Letting go, and letting God.\\"A Buddhist may say, \\"When it rains, than rain is my choice.\\"Along the same lines, teachings from \\"A Course In Miracles\\" says, \\"Nothing real can be threatened. Nothing unreal exists. Herein lies the peace of God.\\" OR \\"The world we see merely reflects our own internal frame of reference-- the dominant ideas, wishes and emotions in our minds. \\"Projection makes perception.\\"The methods in Kens and Penny's workbook provide a precise way to reprogram whatever it is an individual finds he or she needs to reprogram.The methods always work regardless of ones particular \\"religious\\" leanings, or the lack of any.I believe it is one of many paths \\"to the top of the mountain.\\" For me, the methods proved to be an ideal path, because they not only produced (and continue to produce) immediate results, as well as accumulative ones.Note: Dr. Wayne Dyer has written about Ken and his teachings and joins the millions who admire Handbook To Higher Consciousness."},{"Title":"Handbook to Higher Consciousness: The Workbook (Keyes, Jr, Ken)","review":"What a wonderful book for assisting anyone who needs direction in their life.

This is an excellent compilation that stands by itself (although, for an intro class, it definitely requires a &quot;discipline-oriented&quot; text book like Kottak as a guiding force). I would recommend this book highly to my fellow anthros and to general readers alike. What follows is a brief summary of some of my favorite articles in the collection. The selections are all short and well-written, they make interesting and useful points and convey the complexity and utility of anthropology very, very well.I've been waiting a long time to see Peggy McIntosh's wonderful essay on &quot;White Privilege&quot; in print somewhere. I had the distinct pleasure of hearing her give an oral version of the same talk a number of years ago and am very very pleased to see it published here for the benefit of students. The book is worth the price for that article alone.However, this is not the only gem in this collection. Phillipe Bourgois' work on crack dealers is introduced here as is Gerald Murray's work on wood farming as a means to encourage re-forestation programs in Haiti. There are also classics such as Richard Lee's story of the !Kung San insulting of his gift of a Christmas ox (&quot;Eating Christmas in the Kalahari&quot;) and Laura Bohannon's failure to get Tiv elders to see Hamlet as a story about incest, revenge and justice. Jared Diamond's revisionist view of the advent of agriculture is also here (perhaps an antidote for his more recent &quot;Guns, Germs and Steel&quot; though undoutedly similar in style).Other personal favorites of mine include Eugene Cooper's discussion of Chinese table manners (also a must for people who want to teach a course on the anthropology of food), Richard Reed's examination of the tension between environmentalists and indigenous communities in Paraguay, Joan Cassels' excellent analysis of surgery as a male-gendered medical speciality and Paul Farmer's and Arthur Kleinman's thoughtful peice on suffering and AIDS in Haiti.Incidentally, I would thoroughly recommend anything by Paul Farmer to readers interested in social medicine. His scholarship and humanity are both quite phenomenal and totally justify the attention he has recieved due to the MacArthur fellowship.I only have a couple of quibbles with this book and even these are not so much criticisms as comments for the unwary: Jennifer Laab's peice on corporate anthropologists seems to have been written for a corporate audience as a selling point for anthropology. As such it plays up the notion of anthropologists as service providers for corporate interests in a way which is a little frown-inducing for an academician such as myself. Not because I don't approve of anthropology in the private sector, but because the peice itself seems to argue that anthropology is merely a set of techniques that can be workshopped (like team-building exercises)to busy executives for the greater good of the company. Again, this is a VERY worthwhile point to debate, but not one that easily stands without comment. Secondly, the article by Wade Davis (he of &quot;Serpent and the Rainbow&quot; fame), while again discussion-worthy, seems a little superficial, dated in language and probably replaceable (Robert Voeks'recently-published &quot;Sacred Leaves of Candomble&quot; is one alternative that springs to mind). Lastly, I would like to plead for the inclusion of a selection on tatooing or bodily adornment of some sort in any future editions. This is a topic of enduring interest among students and would definitely be an asset to such a nicely-balanced and valuable collection."},{"Title":"Applying Cultural Anthropology: An Introductory Reader","review":"When I took a sophomore level anthropology class at my University, Applying Anthropology was required as a secondary reading text, in addition to Kottak's Anthropology (7th edition). Applying Anthropology contains 52 articles in the categories of Biological Anthropology, Archaeology, Cultural Anthropology, Culture and Communication, Culture and Food, Culture and Race, Economy and Business, Gender and Socialization, Politics &amp; Law &amp; Warfare, and Social &amp; Cultural Change. Instead of being a textbook that was something I just read for the class that required it, it turned out to be a book that I would have bought for my own personal purposes. Also, in addition to enjoying reading it, I learned a lot about anthropology. One of my favorite articles discusses what may have happened on Easter Island that resulted in the demise of an entire culture. All in all, Applying Anthropology provides an interesting approach to learning a lot about culture worldwide."},{"Title":"Tommy DoLittle","review":"Tommy DoLittle is a fun and funny picture book about what happens when perpetually pajama-clad Tommy,the laziest boy in the world- so lazy that his dog walks him- actually reads the words in a book.

Also the last third of the book, which contains specimens of fonts, addresses for font vendors and reference books, is also out date."},{"Title":"Drawn to the Rhythm: A Passionate Life Reclaimed","review":"Several weeks a friend sent me an e-mail concerning a book entitled Drawn to the Rhythm by Sara Hall. I read his comments and was skeptical at first because I did not feel I would enjoy a memoir about a woman in her 40s who became a world-class sculler. But I bought the book anyway.Was I pleasantly surprised! Sara has written a very exciting book depicting her life on the water and off. She is an excellent writer and is able to capture the reader's interest with her story. At times it's a very depressing story and then suddenly rockets to excitement, victory, and happiness.Sara has transformed a very interesting biography into a &quot;page-turner&quot;. She is focused on two challenges in her life: first in her life with her family, and then in her time on the water with her rowing. It amazes me that she's able to mold these two very different facets of her experience into a very intriguing story. My guess many of you will despise the husband because he is such a jerk. As my English Lit professor might have said, the word jerk is strictly a euphemism in this instance!I won't try to convince any of you to buy this book, but I think if you do, you will hear and experience the incredible story of a woman whose life totally changed over the last 6 years. I was flabbergasted in the last chapter where she even shows gratitude to her former husband, because if life with him had not been so difficult, she probably never would have pushed herself so hard in this new life and adventure.This is a moving and inspirational book, so if you don't have the time to read it, then at least buy a copy for your wife, sister or niece. In fact, I am sending my copy to my niece in Concord NH because I think it will give her some real inspiration and she will enjoy reading Sara's story."},{"Title":"Drawn to the Rhythm: A Passionate Life Reclaimed","review":"Sara Hall has transcended the memoir genre with this inspirational account of the emotional and physical pain she underwent in order to evolve into a fully-integrated human being --and also,along the way, become the World's Masters Champion in the woman's single shell, one of the most demanding sports in the world. Marital abuse comes in many forms, and in Hall's case, the years of verbal disparagement and icy indifference left no physical scars - but the mental damage to her psyche was profound. The day that turned her life around was the day she glimpsed a figure racing along the water in a rowing shell and, like Paul on the road to Damascus, she was forever changed. What followed was the grueling effort (often surreptitious as well, as her husband did not approve of any activity of hers not related to the house or the children)to become proficient in an extremely demanding sport. That she was 44 at the time did not deter her. That she had to sneak out of the house in the pre-dawn hours to practice, without coach or companion, did not deter her. She knew in her heart and soul and gut that she wanted to do this, and to do it well. As she gained confidence in her abilities, she also found herself strong enough to break away from the suffocating circumstances of her personal life. Both her athletic skills and her growing self-confidence have been achieved at great cost.The physical agony of turning oneself into a champion in any sport has rarely been described as well as this. It makes one realize that most of us will never have that defining moment experienced by Hall, and we certainly don't have the mental stamina and will power to arrive at the point where she now finds herself. Her writing is lyrical, tough, funny, and very honest. If she decides to leave the world of rowing, she has a bright literary future."},{"Title":"Drawn to the Rhythm: A Passionate Life Reclaimed","review":"Sara Hall has done something in her book, Drawn to the Rythm, that until now I thought was impossible. She addresses issues of spousal abuse without accusing an entire gender. Sara found comfort in a grueling sport, rowing, and an escape route from a troubling relationship with her husband. In becoming a World Champion she has offered a sterling example of the kind of strength it takes for anyone to set themselves free. Her writing style is almost musical, a tribute to her mother I suspect. Her story is heroic, in honor of all the strong men and women in her life - father, uncle, mentors, coaches, competitors, sons, daughters and yes, even her husband. Sara says that what a winner looks like is &quot;a woman who lets go of her demons and takes her strength into the world.&quot; This is exactly what she has done in Drawn to the Rythm. She has found in her rowing (and her writing) ways to triumph over bitterness, sorrow, resignation and anger. If only all champions had such grace."},{"Title":"Drawn to the Rhythm: A Passionate Life Reclaimed","review":"To say this book is about rowing is to say that Brian's Song is about football. If you are looking for rowing tips, forget it.This is a story - a true story - a page-turner that you cannot put down.What Sara Hall has given us is the story of a journey to self-discovery and freedom. And to say that her writing is \\"lyrical,\\" is a gross understatement. The rhythm and razor-sharp imagery of her writing is breathtaking. Sometimes it's poetic, sometimes irreverent and funny, sometimes downright scary. Her gifts extend far beyond her world-class ability to row.I've never rowed and (fortunately) cannot identify with the abusive relationship she found herself mired in. But everything else in the book rang bells for me: the dual-edged sword of motherhood -both fulfilling and sometimes suffocating, feelings of isolation, the need to find kindred spirits, the joys of supportive friendships, the power of self-determination, the exhilaration of pushing yourself to the limits (my limits are far lower than Sara's), and so much more.Picking up this book is like hearing faint peckings within a slightly wobbly egg and turning your attention to it in fascination and astonishment as you see cracks appear, chips pop out, and finally the miracle of what's inside.When I finished Drawn to the Rhythm, I was ready to turn right back to page one and start all over again - Sara's writing is that good and that inspiring."},{"Title":"Drawn to the Rhythm: A Passionate Life Reclaimed","review":"Sara Hall is a private person who, even in her unfulfilling marriage, preferred solitude to a busy, outgoing lifestyle. To her husband she was submissive, always trying to please him at any cost, afraid to do anything which might cause his disapproval. As she tells her story, one can almost conjure up the image of a timid mouse cowering in the corner, too afraid and insecure to speak out. As she tells of her self-discovery and passion for rowing, she is inspired by the peace, tranquility and movement the sport brings. From that point on, she becomes less submissive, and rowing becomes her salvation from a domineering husband - her personal outlet in life just as some of us choose writing, music, dance or art.Unlike the book, &quot;An Unfinished Marriage&quot; by Joan Anderson, which I also highly recommend to readers, this marriage does not survive. However, Sara and her husband both learn some vitally important facts about their marriage and their own personal lives. Sara goes on to become a world championship rower, her confidence grows, and in the process she discovers her true self, a new passion and zest for life, and joy in her athletic accomplishments. The book is inspirational, highly recommended and most deserving of a five star rating. Thank you, Sara, for sharing your journey. May the waters you row upon always be calm and peaceful."},{"Title":"Drawn to the Rhythm: A Passionate Life Reclaimed","review":"I started this book because my son is a rower and I'd hoped to learn a bit more about the techniques and the mindset of rowers. Sara Hall provides that, but so much more. Her account of coming to grips with an abusive relationship is delicate and sensitive. Many middle-class women can see themselves caught in a subtle dance with a domineering, controlling, cagey husband. The strength she finds through rowing and her connection to community is beautifully portrayed. I encourage every woman to read it."},{"Title":"Drawn to the Rhythm: A Passionate Life Reclaimed","review":"I bought this book because it's about rowing, but soon found that its power lay in the way Hall described her terrible marriage and the freedom she earned by taking up sculling. Certainly it became overly introspective at some points, but as I read I was willing Hall to break free, aware of the inevitable conclusion but entranced by her impending triumph. I usually discard such personal memoirs halfway through, but this work kept me engrossed until the end."},{"Title":"Drawn to the Rhythm: A Passionate Life Reclaimed","review":"Ms. Hall provides inspiration for all women (or men) in an abusive and controlling situation. She is a survivor who found her passion, stuck by her children and finally had the courage to stand up for herself. Ms. Hall's writing is free-flowing, touching, honest but not scornful. Her \\"rising above\\" the challenges that faced her and still maintaining a positive attitude are truly admirable. I highly recommend this to all people searching for their \\"passion\\" because this book gives you hope that anything is possible, even for a 40-something mom."},{"Title":"Drawn to the Rhythm: A Passionate Life Reclaimed","review":"Ostensibly about a mid-life woman's &quot;falling in love with a boat&quot; and her struggles toward a realization of her personal gifts. Very feminine yet gender-neutral in its lessons, this memoir is an intimate look at a personal transformation achieved in emotional hardship but propelled by a sense of love, a sense of G-d's guidance, hardheaded Rocky-like stubborness, and lessons learned from childrens' stories like Mary Poppins and The Little Mermaid. This book is a very good read and possibly personally transformational. Be prepared to get wiser as you read. I just bought it for my Gen X daughter. It's the sequel to REVIVING OPHELIA that I bought for her 8 years ago."},{"Title":"Drawn to the Rhythm: A Passionate Life Reclaimed","review":"This is a beautiful book which I could hardly put down. It is particularly inspirational for women, however the message is universal. You can find your passion and be true to yourself. Usually stories of domestic abuse are clearly black and white but Hall's story is full of complexity and marvelous shades of gray. Kudos to Hall for pursuing her dream and breaking free from a damaging relationship. Readers are in for a treat with Hall's lyrical and moving descriptions of rowing. This is clearly a very special book!"},{"Title":"Drawn to the Rhythm: A Passionate Life Reclaimed","review":"Sara Hall is a strong, loving women with a poetic gift for prose. She is simply lovely to read and uplifting in her descriptions of the journey she undertook to escape a hearbreaking, even dangerous marriage. More stories should have the happy ending of this one--discovery of a passion not personal, from an ugly marriage to a better world for herself and her children. In impeccable and gracious prose she shows the reader how a life can be transformed without once being mean or diminishing to the source of her years of torture. She is a woman of many gifts who finds freedom and triumph in the hard work of becoming a champion athlete. Most women will never row, at least in the kind of boat she races. But too many women have been in the sorry boat of dependency on a man for the family well-being. When the controlling, cruel abuse goes on, hidden from the world by outward good fortune (fine children; enough to eat; freedom to &quot;make it all look good&quot;) it is all the more horrible that the perpetrator holds the keys to the store. She and their children won't eat unless he permits it, and while he permits it he is simultaneously laying on strong, negative, dishonest messages. Fortunately Sara Hall has found victory as she acquires skills in another area. Anyone can do it. It doesn't take a boat or a pretty house to make escape and redemption possible, and she tells her story in flowing and gracious prose. Anyone who cares about marriage should have to read this as a prerequisite to saying vows and signing the contract. It's a dread possibility to think of a marriage like this, and a joy to learn that such marriages don't have to be. With enough courage any woman can be her own wonderful self--and a wife and mother too. Ms. Hall deserves gold medals for her achievements against great odds--and for her gracious, beautifully written accounts of her own triumph."},{"Title":"Drawn to the Rhythm: A Passionate Life Reclaimed","review":"There are two distinct components to this book. The first, and the reason I bought it, is a very interesting and inspiring story about a woman who, in her 40s, transformed herself from a sedentary housewife to a world champion sculler. The second is a heart-felt, sincere yet self-indulgent story about a woman who after many years of marriage becomes dissatisfied with the lifestyle she, by her own admission, chose and decides to make some major changes.I describe the personal growth theme of the book as \\"self-indulgent\\" not out of disrespect for the author's personal struggle, which is heart-felt and compelling, but because the narrative seems to lack balance. Some reviewers portray the author's ex-husband as a chauvinist jerk, but as the story unfolds it appears his major failing seems to be that he was upset and confused by his wife's apparently sudden dissatisfaction with the way of life they had established together for many years. By the author's own admission, she was a partner in building the lifestyle she later abandoned, but in the telling of the story her complicity is downplayed while her husband's failure to embrace her change of heart is portrayed rather unsympathetically. That's understandable, but at the same time I can't help but feel the husband may not have been treated fairly, and because that story is such a significant part of the book, it diminished my overall appreciation and enjoyment of it.I would recommend the book, with the above caveat, because it is interesting and pretty well-written. However, prospective readers should understand what the book is about."},{"Title":"Drawn to the Rhythm: A Passionate Life Reclaimed","review":"I loved this book. I thought it was very well-written and I admired the courage of the author to put her truth on the page. My only frustration in reading the book was wishing that she had removed herself from the abusive husband sooner.Unlike many memoirs where I come away disappointed that the author has lived a harrowing life and has very little insight into what got them there in the first place, Sara Hall has examined her part in the drama and has come away, in my opinion, both humble and wiser."},{"Title":"Drawn to the Rhythm: A Passionate Life Reclaimed","review":"I've read Sara Hall's book a couple of times. She's a fantastic writer.Some of the recent reviews are interesting. It's my impression that Ms. Hall downplayed her absusive husband and in fact treated him with not just kindness but with necessary kid gloves in her portrayal.Her book reminded me of other women I know who have been in non physically abusive marriages. The horror of her truly sociopathic husband is evident between the lines in her book. What actually took place in her marriage is likely far worse than the reader can imagine.Curiously enough after reading Hall's book the last two reviews seem as if they could have been written by a very angry, very disturbed ex-huband.I hope that Ms. Hall has moved on. Her book demonstrates that she has the pluck to do just that.

I would agree Ms. Hall has certain gifts as a writer and I'm sure journaling this was therapeutic for her, but I think I'd like to read her husband's account as well - like the old saying goes, it takes two to tango.

HIGHLY NOT RECOMMENDED!!!"},{"Title":"Drawn to the Rhythm: A Passionate Life Reclaimed","review":"The Rhythm in Sara Hall's book is NOT sculling, as one is led to believe in the reviews. The book is a self-serving account of Ms Hall's priviledged life in which she seeks to blame her dispair in her adult life on incidents of abuse in her preteen years. She ridicules her life as a mother, trivializing the importance of being a presence in her childrens early years. Her life with her husband IS tragic, is it any of our business? She wants us to believe that winning is not what is important to her, yet the bulk of discussion on rowing focused on her accomplishments, placements, and medals. This is one of the worst books I have ever read, a complete disappointment."},{"Title":"Drawn to the Rhythm: A Passionate Life Reclaimed","review":"Interesting info on rowing, but aren't there 2 sides to every story?

I don't remember the movie explaining the title, either; Jones is comparing Earth to the Pacific islands in World War II where the fighting washed back and forth, and the inhabitants were dragooned into helping build airstrips and such for either side. Here it's a war involving numberless galaxies (where the movie's was just between two planets).The novel is good, but the book is terrible. Pulpless.com's typesetters put in more typos than Raymond F. Jones could have made in a couple of centuries of writing. And the editors let it all slip by. But I don't believe there was any mass-market paperback, so this is the only game in town."},{"Title":"This Island Earth","review":"I was born in 1947 and first read this book when I was in junior high school. I also saw the movie around the same time (say, age 10-13), but it was not as good as the book. Leonard Maltin said of the movie something like &quot;lacks the existential ending of the book.&quot; This *really* made me want to reread the book. About 10 years ago, I found a used copy, read it and loved it, then gave it to a friend. So I was thrilled to find this re-issue, produced by Forrest Ackerman, who was the literary agent of Jones and several other science-fiction writers of that era. Jones has a dark view of humanity. As someone who came of age in the '60s, I'm surprised to hear characters in the book (written 1952) express some of the thoughts my friends and I thought were so new during the anti-war movement. Jones is also intrigued by randomness and statistics. This fascination figures in the ending of this book as well as in the theme of his &quot;Non-statistical Man&quot; (also quite worthwhile). As for the existential ending, well, I agree, until we get to the last sentence, which Sartre never could have written. But read it and decide for yourself. Once you do, hook up your interociter and we can trade thoughts."},{"Title":"This Island Earth","review":"This is a true Science Fiction classic. I first read it when I was in Middle School, and it made quite an impression on me as a fantastic story with a wild premise, well-told. Picking it up thirty-five years later, the novel has lost none of its punch or impact. This is a true science fiction classic.The premise of the novel is simple enough: Earth is being visited by warring factions of a monstrously large inter-galactic conflict. Each side views Earth as an obscure planet of limited importance, much as the US Navy might have viewed certain obscure islands in the Pacific during the Second World War. The protagonists become caught up in this conflict in a very interesting way. More would be telling, but suffice to say, this is a really interesting story, and its premise has not been done better (to my knowledge) in any science fiction novels that have come later.This one is highly recommended to anyone who enjoys good science fiction."},{"Title":"This Island Earth","review":"This book is great if anyone saw the movie and wants to read the book you won't be dissapointed. Although it gets diffrent halfway you can still see parts that the movie did put in. If you are a fan of the movie you can tell that in the book they realy picked out the right actors for the movie. It is an interesting way how Russel Johnsons' character (the professer) blew up in the book than he did in the movie. The interociters also can pick up brain waves. There are typos however that make it anoying. But just the fact that Raymond F. Jones' fun story is available you can surpass that.

My parents took me to see it at a Drive In waay back \\"in the day\\". I have remembered that movie for years and watched it on TV when I could. I even ordered one on EBay alas it was a fast copy, rip-off - the guy got shut down pretty quickly.But, I would like to find the serial version that appeared in Thrilling Wonder Stories. It seems to me that this is the very first Star Trek Book. If the Great One read this book (and I can not believe that he did not), you can even see where the idea for one episode came from. I am not saying what, because I don't want to spoil it for new buyers/readers.I would like to see the move remade and this time follow the book.Finally, I do have to agree with regard to the typos. Does PulPless have proof readers? If so, they need to be replaced. This was without a doubt the worst job of proofing or typesetting that I have ever seen. This is why the low stars."},{"Title":"This Island Earth","review":"You want it short and sweet? Fine. If you're a fan of 50s era sci-fi, this is not a novel to be missed.You want the longer version?Here goes...One of the most interesting things to me about this work is the stylistic contrast with modern adult science fiction. This Island Earth was originally published in serial form in a science fiction magazine of the day. It does seem to have been written so that a child of 10 or maybe 12 could quite easily follow it. I'm guessing that people of that age probably did constitute a fairly sizable portion of the magazine's readership. Perhaps as a result, the writing style is extremely clean and simple, and the basic story - while not without its twists and turns - is essentially straightforward.But even given all this, it would be a mistake to categorize this work solely as juvenile fiction. For me, the most obvious thing that lifts this novel up to be more than just another tale of interplanetary adventure is the underlying dialectic between pacifism on the one hand, and the possibility of a just or even necessary war on the other. That said, for me at least this dialectic is somewhat let down by the fact that it is premised on the idea of an enemy that is wholly and simply evil. That does seem more than a tad on the juvenile side; at least from a contemporary perspective.Even so, this is a work with a significant political consciousness, and one that goes well beyond the \\"reds under the bed/saucers in the sky\\" metaphor that was to become such a clich&eacute; of the era. Its political content essentially leans towards the center-right. However, for me personally, the specific direction of such leanings is of less significance than the simple fact that this is at least a book that actually has an underlying political philosophy; and one that does remain consistent throughout the work in its treatment of both Earthly and extra-terrestrial conflicts alike.Finally, it's worth adding this is perhaps one of the pioneering works of its generation to move towards a more realistic appraisal of the likely true place of humanity in the cosmos. Another reviewer (writing simply as \\"A Customer\\") has even suggested an existential interpretation that I confess did not occur to me.And... even if it were nothing else, This Island Earth is still at the very least an unusually well executed tale of interplanetary adventure.Today, most will come to This Island Earth via the film of the same name (This Island Earth), made six years later. I am a fan of the film myself, but I will say that like so many Hollywood films, it diverges considerably from the novel on which it was \\"based\\". Of course, today we would be far more likely to use a more flexible term like \\"reimaged\\" to describe how the second telling was derived from the first. In this case, \\"reimagined\\" would certainly be the more accurate way of putting it. For while there is no shortage of common ground between the two works, there are also major differences. I don't want to give away any spoilers, so that's all I'll say!In conclusion, no serious fan of 1950s science fiction should miss either the book or the film. Both are classics in their own right.Theo."},{"Title":"This Island Earth","review":"This is a fun book to read if you are into 50's science fiction.

Sigh .... It has a great theme which is excellently explained by other reviewers here. I want to comment on the quality of the printing. I don't know who &quot;Forrest J. Ackerman&quot; is, but I would bet that either he or his Bean Counting Accountants have dictated a book that looks and feels just like one of the Tiajuana Sex books from the late 1940's. Cruddy paper, muddled printing and so many typographical errors I wonder if they even HAVE proof readers? Well, OK, maybe they print this over in Boola-Boola Land or Eastern Fredonia where the English Language is not well known. I think it is outrageous that there is a list price of almost 20 bucks for this lousy printing and binding job. My recommendation is to wait until the PDF version comes out and download it and print it off on your home laser printer. At least then you can run spell check and format it properly without &quot;Widows and Orphans&quot; and other awful mistakes of style."},{"Title":"Dan O'Brien's Ultimate Workout: The Gold Medal Plan For Reaching Your Peak Performance","review":"The book did not seem very well thought out as a book in itself. The information within was very minor, and the routines did not seem as ultimate as the cover suggested in achieving the athletic body or performance as Dan O'Brien possesses. The most disturbing aspect was the graphic content inside. Most exercise demonstrations were in pencil sketch. Text was large, as if filling up space, and the design concept at the start of each chapter was too busy. It had the feel of a rushed book, and that Dan didn't even have time to perform the routines himself so drawings were made of him instead; which made knowing how to perform the workouts correctly &amp; safely difficult to gauge. It also lost the personal touch that most books have because I never felt that Dan was actually there with me at every step."},{"Title":"Dan O'Brien's Ultimate Workout: The Gold Medal Plan For Reaching Your Peak Performance","review":"I am sorry to say that I must agree with another reviewer here in that this book does not quite hit the mark. It is rather poorly done and the information it contains in pretty standard stuff, i.e. just about any work out book you can name has pretty much the same information contained here. The design of the book is poor, at best with sketches which are not all that good or informative. All in all, this work was rather disappointing and I think if you would like to read it, it would be better to check it out from the library rather than come up with the purchase price. I would have much more enjoyed a good biography of Dan O'Brian himself. That, I think, would be interesting and I am sure much more motivational. I did give this one three stars simply because O'Brian is O'Brian. Wish this one could have been better."},{"Title":"Mexico (Countries and Cultures) (Countries & Cultures)","review":"This book was okay. It was better than most of the books about Mexico I've been reading with my daughter (she is really turned on by Dora the Explorer). The part she liked the most was the discussion about the history of chocolate and the recipe for making hot chocolate... it was certainly a more interesting way to talk about food culture than \\"Mexican people eat tacos,\\" which is what most of the other books in her age range that we've read say."},{"Title":"The Counterfeiters","review":"I read The Counterfeiters (in effectively one sitting) with some sadness. I realized that only a few more books remain before I will have read everything Hugh Kenner has written. He was one of the geniuses of the century, and The Counterfeiters shows him at his best. Imagine The Critique of Pure Reason written in the form of a few offhand essays about Buster Keaton. Imagine laughing out loud in the middle of a scholarly essay.What Kenner has done in this book is to demolish, with Keatonesque deadpan, the rationalist foundation of Western culture. He is brilliant on Keaton. He is brilliant on Pope and Swift (the best reading of Swift's intentions in Gulliver's Travels that I've ever seen, and I have a PhD in 18C English Lit). He is brilliant on Andy Warhol and Alan Turing.Kenner is often more interesting to read than his subject. I've never been able to finish Ulysses; Dublin's Joyce is a feast from beginning to end. Pound is an acquired taste; The Pound Era reads like a novel, Umberto Eco without the snobbery. Whether he is writing about William Butler Yeats, Buckminster Fuller, Chuck Jones, or William Carlos Williams, what he has to say will be challenging, well-informed, and entertaining. This is a literary scholar who had a column in Byte magazine for years.Kenner died a few years ago after a long and productive life, leaving behind as legacy a dozen of the most accessible and valuable works of literary criticism in contemporary letters. The Counterfeiters is a great place to meet this amazing mind."},{"Title":"The Counterfeiters","review":"\\"The Counterfeiters\\" is a humorous work of genius of the sort one doesn't usually associate with \\"literary criticism\\"... ranging over topics as diverse as comically Bad Poetry, Alan Turing's Turing Machine (and Turing Game), Andy Warhol, and Buster Keaton's comic artistry, Kenner probes the nature of identity and \\"humanitas\\". His prose style is remarkably clever and lucid; his prose is complemented by Guy Davenport's illustrations (e.g., \\"Mr. Andy Warhol Fetches a Work of Art Through a Metaphysical Barrier\\", depicting Warhol taking a can of Campbell's Tomato Soup from the shelf, one soon to be transformed into a Genuine Warhol Soup Can through the magic of his signature).This short book is well worth reading... and re-reading.

All of the prior great translators of Aesop have been British--Caxton, L'Estrange, Ogilby, Croxall, Clarke, James, Townsend, Jacobs, and Jones--and of these only Jacobs was a serious Aesop scholar. Laura Gibbs is a scholar as well as a translator; she bases her translations on the best editions; she includes more fables (to show historical variation, some fables appear twice); she provides a better introduction and much better notes than competing editions. Gibbs's volume also has the best index of any Aesop in English. This is an edition worthy of the Oxford imprint, and the first thorough translation of Aesop by an American since Lloyd Daly's AESOP WITHOUT MORALS (1961, now out of print).

This edition (Kindle) is the best I've read. Not only did the editor/author cross-reference and arrange the fables in easy form, reading them on the Kindle makes the reference experience excellent.Some other reviews disagree with the analysis the book gives to many of the fables. The purpose of the Fables has for thousands of years been for the reader to decide what lessons to take from them. That has not changed. That this edition includes summaries and conclusions that were added and debated over millennia ADDS to its value. I don't think audiences have forgotten to think for themselves as other reviewers claim.Aesop's Fables have provided intellectual fodder for generations and still does not disappoint. It is a great way to introduce kids to critical thinking and debate.My only slight critique is it needs a detailed table of contents, but the Kindle's search capabilities makes up for it."},{"Title":"Aesop's Fables","review":"Although, I haven't finish reading all of the fables, however, the ones that I have read are enobling for educators and any serious literature reader.

I of course act like the fox and laugh at the silly attempts. It seems funny to me when people borrow ideas halfway, only based on hows and whats without any understanding of the whys.Chopsticks is designed to shove food from the bowl into the mouth and plates work best when food is delivered to the mouth by forks or fingers. Different tools are designed for different purposes to accommondate different arrangements.Strange enough, crane is revered by the Chinese and the Japanese and is the embodiment of elegance and other lofty spiritual concepts. Fox on the other hand embodies different meanings.I bet this is news even to Aesop."},{"Title":"Aesop's Fables","review":"Aesop's fables short tales in which animals act almost as if they were human , rounded off with a good 'moral' are the first instance of , and perhaps the most memorable of the fable form in literature.

Perhaps this is a good exercise for improvisational reading.Some of the tales are downright puzzling as well. If the moral of the story is saying \\"Huh?!?\\" then many tales accomplish that objective.I would prefer a book that's edited for 21st Century taste and with appropriate fables for kids.

There is a profound social message to learn from all Aesop's fables but regretfully many do not originate from his pen but accreted around his tales with the passing of time."},{"Title":"A sentimental journey through France and Italy","review":"This autobiographical acount by Sterne of his amorous progress through France and Northern Italy is surely one of the most delightful books ever written. Composed as he lay dying of tuberculosis, the book nonetheless encaptures the author's renowned zest for life as well as the libertine spirit of the age in which he lived. The journey down through France to Northern Italy is the perfect vehicle for an excursion into the nature of human sensibility, and from the moment that this cultured Anglo-Irish cleric sets foot in Calais, the reader is treated to a seies of exquisite encounters with the fairer sex. Rarely has an author transmitted so well his understanding of the psychological complexity of women, or the pleasure he takes in their company. Engaging, perceptive and witty, this is a book whiich cannot fail to leave an imprint on the imagination."},{"Title":"A sentimental journey through France and Italy","review":"Sterne befuddles and delights readers and critics alike in A Sentimental Journey. He takes the fashionable travel log of the time and satarizes it. Contemporary critics had a fit over its supposedly bawdy nature, yet some modern readers may over look its sublte innuendo. The form of the novel is quite unlike anything that had preceeded it, thus is important for any scholars. Most importanly, however, the book is funny and fun to read."},{"Title":"A sentimental journey through France and Italy","review":"Even for modern readers, \\"A Sentimental Journey\\" (published 1768)is as startlingly innovative as Sterne's celebrated \\"Tristram Shandy\\". Sterne's ability to crystallize the minute details of experience - which may be down to a few seconds only - is reminiscent of Virginia Woolf's \\"To the Lighthouse\\". Indeed, Woolf admired this book.This is by no means an easy read. The 18th-century prose is difficult; the book is larded with Frenchisms and Biblical or classical allusions; the complex, slow narrative often requires re-reading. But the rewards are great! It's wise, deeply comical, and incredibly perceptive.There are several helpful reviews below dealing with the aspect of \\"sentimentality\\", and so I will just single out two things which appealed to me:1. STERNE AND BODY LANGUAGE. Sterne shows an almost 20th-century appreciation of body language. In fact, I believe he might have been the first to identify it as such. His chapter, \\"The Translation\\", highlights the importance of being able to interpret subtle physical hints, like a language: \\"There is not a secret so aiding to the progress of sociality, as to get master of this _shorthand_, and be quick in rendering the several turns of looks and limbs, with all their inflections and delineations, into plain words.\\" How visionary!2. STERNE AND THE FRENCH. Ever since Shakespeare inserted a scene in \\"cod French\\" into _Henry V_, actually ever since the Norman Conquest and up to Monty Python and beyond, the English have revelled in mocking the French and their language. His Continental travelling gives Sterne the perfect excuse to do this. At one point he differentiates between \\"tant pis\\" (= \\"never mind\\" - where there is nothing to be gained) and \\"tant mieux\\" (= so much the better - where there IS an advantage). He also has a hilarious section on the grades of French swearing: first \\"Diable!\\", then \\"Peste!\\" and finally the words that he won't repeat. In all cases, Sterne carefully shows the social niceties of these expressions.The protagonist, Yorick, has various adventures of lust and feeling with women and other typically travelish things like losing his passport that we can all relate to. He's tender, obscene, learned, funny, companionable, and above all, readable - if tough."},{"Title":"A sentimental journey through France and Italy","review":"A Sentimental Journey is a fabulous book for so many reasons. Laurence Sterne was an immensely influential writer in the 18th century--his major works, Sentimental Journey and Tristram Shandy, were responses to the travel narrative and newly born novel, respectively. His writing is essential to scholars of the 18th century--he is referenced in Austen's Mansfield Park and Northanger Abbey, Brown's The Power of Sympathy, Foster's The Coquette and Tyler's The Contrast. To understand and appreciate his novel is to have a better appreciation and love of the works that built their structures on his foundation. And yet it is original, as Yorick says himself, \\"both my travels and observations will be altogether of a different cast from any of my fore-runners.\\"Yet it is not solely for historical benefit that one should read Sentimental Journey. The adventures and amours of Sterne's semi-autobiographical Yorick are delightful. One of the most romantic passages I've read in a book occurs when Yorick inadvertantly takes the hand of a woman and describes in detail the thrill of merely holding it. Granted, hers is not the only hand he will hold, but he writes so wonderfully, candidly and engagingly that it is extremely difficult to hold his passions against the sentimental Yorick. His scene with the starling locked in a cage is pertinent and a touching commentary on slavery. What a guy! My only complaint is the editor of this edition does not feel it necessary to translate the French-of which there is plenty-making some passages difficult to understand at best. However,this is a sentimental journey that I will gladly take over and over."},{"Title":"A sentimental journey through France and Italy","review":"Like Sterne's other works, _A Sentimental Journey_ is extraordinarily playful. His works are the eighteenth century's postmodernist works of play. They have lots of textual puzzles and tend toward the absurd. For example, the Mr. Yorick of the _Journey_ is also a character in Sterne's major novel _Tristram Shandy_ and is also the name under which he publishes his own sermons (he was a clergyman). The text is very &quot;fragmentary&quot; and the novel even jokes about that itself, labelling parts of itself &quot;fragment.&quot; In these ways, the _Journey_ is fun and modern.But it is also indicative of an important eighteenth-century trend--sensibility or sentimentalism. All eras have their debates about the relationshp between the individual and society and this is one eighteenth-century answer. This opinion has nothing to do with &quot;rights&quot; but everything to do with &quot;sympathy.&quot; Mr. Yorick, the &quot;sentimental traveller,&quot; relates to other human beings through sympathetic physical responses, most notably the &quot;pulses&quot; and &quot;beats&quot; of his heart and hands for various women.Therefore, this book is a good way to get into a very different historical mindset while at the same time seeing the roots of some of the literary forms of today."},{"Title":"A sentimental journey through France and Italy","review":"Building up my library so no time to read-then-review but looks good at first glance.

Trinket is an incorrigible teenage rogue from the &quot;pleasure quarter&quot; of Yangzhou who by guile and good fortune becomes simultaneously a confidant of the boy emperor Kang Xi and a leader of the loyalist martial arts outlaws of the Heaven and Earth Society. John Minford's graceful translation gives the most popular Chinese novelist on earth a fighting chance of winning a brand new legion of fans.(An earlier Louis Cha no"},{"Title":"The Deer and The Cauldron: The First Book (Bk. 1)","review":"A previous reviewer stated that this was the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; of Asia. Please, give me a break. Don't compare the two, I beg of you. Trinket was having fun in China at least 500 years before Harry Potter was stuck inside a cabinet. Don't compare things that you don't understand, and don't mislead the potential readers.Lu Ding Ji (The Chinese name of the book) is a story I've heard from my parents ever since I was a child. I've loved Xiao Bao (Trinket) for years, and I'm happy to have finally read his life story.Jiang Hu is usually described from a hero's perspective, and to hear it from a pre-teen troublemaker is a refreshing change. It almost seems taboo for Trinket to have his way with the martial arts world, but I suppose that's what makes all of us love this novel.I think the character developments were wonderfully translated in this book, and I hope that everyone enjoys it as much as I did. Keep at bay your stereotypes of the Chinese culture and perhaps you will learn something."},{"Title":"The Deer and The Cauldron: The First Book (Bk. 1)","review":"Let me first state that I had no particular &quot;reason&quot; to read this book: no personal connection to Chinese culture, nor history, nor a love of martial arts movies. In fact, I cannot remember why I purchased it. Yet I'm sitting here having read books 1 and 2, and wondering why the third volume's release has been delayed from October 2002 to early 2003? Doesn't anybody know that I'm in suspense?This book feels like something pulled out of the past. Cross an Errol Flynn swashbuckler movie with Cervantes, set it in China, and maybe you'll get something close to this: great writing, comedy, and an irresistible antihero.

Trust me on this, this is a great book to buy and will keep you occupied!!!"},{"Title":"The Deer and The Cauldron: The First Book (Bk. 1)","review":"Literary (unlike scientific) translations always lose a good deal in the task. It's like travellng to an alien civilization in outerspace, then coming back to describe what you saw without the help of any photographs. Imagine translating Tolkien into a language as different from English as Chinese, and you see the problem here. (How does one even attempt to translate Tolkien's Elvish verses?) One may as well read Shakespeare in Egyptian Hieroglyphs! Too many concepts have no exact counterparts, and a detailed translation would require extensive endnotes and glossaries and appendices. Still, better to have a translation than none at all for those unfortunate foreigners who don't know Chinese. For Louis Cha is the best-known and best-loved living writer of fantasy novels in the Chinese-speaking world. Those who know little Chinese history and culture will get much less out of reading Cha's novels, but that would be asking too much from foreigners interested in reading only the translations.It's indeed interesting to compare Tolkien with Cha. Tolkien was an Oxford don - a highly respected one in fact, though his scholarship is totally eclipsed by his literary fame. Cha never held a real academic post, but his literary achievement is recognized by universities all over the world - including Oxford and Cambridge. Tolkien's one single book (\\"The Lord of the Rings\\" is not actually a trilogy, but one long book divided into three parts) has been turned into global blockbusters in the box office. Cha's many more books (he wrote more than a dozen full-length historical romances) have been turned into television series which have been shown all over Asia. Tolkien's fans tend to be hardcore fanatics - so too are Cha's. Tolkien's honors included a CBE from the Queen. Cha's honors included an OBE from the same lady and a similar one from the French President. Tolkien was relatively poor for a highly successful writer (but rich for a professor). He didn't even make real money from the movie rights. Cha is a very wealthy man, his considerable income being the huge newspaper company he founds and owns (the Ming Pao is the most respected Chinese-language newspaper in the world.)It would be tempting to argue who is more famous, Tolkien or Cha. Tolkien's fame in the English-speaking world is beyond doubt. The movies are going to spread this fame into the rest of the world. Cha's fame is also past dispute, but it's confined in the Chinese-speaking world only. Although there are more Chinese native speakers than English native speakers in the world, there are far more English learners everywhere, and English is certainly the more important language. However, non-native speakers of English are not likely to delve into difficult books such as Tolkien's, except perhaps in translation.Which is the reason why translations, despite their limitations, are always and everywhere so necessary!Ironically, although Tolkien and Cha are between them well known to BILLIONS of people, there are likely not many people who are fans of both, English and Chinese being so different from each other."},{"Title":"The Deer and The Cauldron: The First Book (Bk. 1)","review":"I just found out that there is the title to the third book of Cha. It is the &quot;Legendary Couple&quot; (certainly not as poetic a title as the Chinese version). It is not my favorite because I think it is too sad overall, but many people like it. So for those who like Louis Cha, you may want to give it a try."},{"Title":"The Deer and The Cauldron: The First Book (Bk. 1)","review":"I brought the first two volume of this translation. What a complete waste of money. The chinese story is funny, vivid, and full of life. However, this translation sucks all the complexity, life, and wonder from the story. If there were only this translation, no one would care about this story. For those who are only able to know about this chinese story from this translation, they will never understand that this was Jin Yong's (Louis Cha) last and perhaps, greatest novel.It's just really sad that because of this translation, no one else will now do a real translation of this great story in english."},{"Title":"The Deer and The Cauldron: The First Book (Bk. 1)","review":"Very little Chinese martial arts fiction (wuxia xiaoshuo) has been translated into English, and even the phenomenal success of *Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon* does not seem to have convinced any publisher that the American public might actually want to read the original novel by Wu Du Lang. Apart from the first two books of *The Deer and the Cauldron* (and of course such classics as *The Water Margin*), I have only been able to find a translation of Li Shanji's (a.k.a. Huanzhulouzhu) *Blades From the Willows* (Wellsweep Press, 1991), which I found so dumb I could not finish it (it is actually closer to the worst Japanese monster TV series than to any martial arts movie from Hong Kong); and a French translation of a novel by Gu Long (Picquier, 1990), which was better, but not particularly memorable.Given this lack of competition, I would not be paying *The Deer and the Cauldron* much of a compliment if I said it was by far the best martial arts novel I have ever read, so I will simply state that it is the most addictive novel I have read since the early 1990s, when I discovered *The Fountainhead* and *Atlas Shrugged*.Louis Cha's (Jin Yong's) *The Deer and the Cauldron* is the story of Trinket (Wei Xiaobao), the thirteen-year-old son of a Yangzhou whore, in the Eastern province of Jiangsu, who finds himself caught up in the political intrigues of the early Manchu era, in the mid-1660's. A crafty, lazy, unprincipled opportunist, Trinket ingratiates himself with a member of the Triads, which in those days were not a mafia, but secret loyalist societies opposing Manchu rule and seeking to restore the Ming Dynasty; and becomes friends with the Emperor of China himself, another lad of thirteen. Set mostly in Beijing's Forbidden City, the novel involves a quest for copies of a sacred buddhist text, the *Sutra in Forty-Two Sections*, whose importance is only revealed in volume two; an evil Imperial eunuch seeking vengeance for murders most horrid; and power squabbles among the various Triads.The novel is written in a very lucid and unostentatious style, focusing on telling the story rather than on describing the settings. Louis Cha's main interest is in the plot of this wonderfully convoluted tale of deception and false identities: he sees his genre as a Chinese cousin of the historical fictions of Walter Scott, Robert Louis Stevenson, Alexandre Dumas and Prosper Merimee. Unfortunately, the use of foul language, the frequent references to bodily functions and the numerous murders and mutilations described make the novel unsuitable for younger readers, who might otherwise have enjoyed this brilliant adventure (the most recurring term of abuse is &quot;turtle&quot; which, one learns in the glossary of volume 2, is a euphemism for penis; as for &quot;tamardy&quot;, I haven't a clue.)The Second Book of this excellent series (Louis Cha's last work) was published in 1999, also by Oxford University Press, and if you hate cliffhangers, you might want to buy both volumes at once. The translator, John Minford, who also worked on the Penguin edition of *The Story of the Stone*, initially intended to publish a third volume, together with two other works of Cha's, *Book and Sword* and *Eagles and Heroes*. I sincerely hope none of these projects has been abandoned or postponed.(This volume contains a map of Ancient China, a glossary of people and places and a glossary of terms - all of them extremely helpful.)"},{"Title":"The Deer and The Cauldron: The First Book (Bk. 1)","review":"This is the last of Cha's masterful storytelling efforts and it is by far his most original. The siver-tongued and foulmouthed anti-hero (Trinket Wei) will definitely fill your hours with amazement, laughter, gasps of &quot;WHAT!&quot; and &quot;HOW'D HE DO THAT!?!&quot;. For me these comments and expressions were spoken out loud (and very loud somthings), which is something I almost never do. The other characters in this book are very loveable, mostly heroic, and uncommonly very vulnerable. At first glance, the men and women of River and Lake seem to exude the aura of stereotypical &quot;heroes&quot; (and villains) that as children listening to storytellers we have come to believe to have lived in that era. But their personalities and character faults envelope them with a third dimensional layer that definitely makes them leap of the page. Only the first two (of three) books are currently available and you'll definitely want to pickup the second before finishing the first. I think I read about 600 pages the first night.So... Tired of the &quot;poo&quot; that's been floating around in you're Fantasy or Adventure sections of the bookstore? This is one of the books that you'll want to snatch up! Now! Currently, I'm pulling my fingernails out with my teeth waiting for Oxford to put out the THIRD part of this book. I'm also anxiously awaiting Cha's &quot;The Book and The Sword&quot; which was translated by Graham Ernshaw (GREAT translation BTW). This one is mentioned in the intro of TD&amp;TC, so I'm hoping that it comes out soon!"},{"Title":"The Deer and The Cauldron: The First Book (Bk. 1)","review":"I read the Chinese version of this when I was in high school. I don't think I will be exaggerating if I say that Louis Cha is probably one of the most widely read Chinese writer in the 20th century. You may stumble across a lot of Chinese who haven't read Dreams of a Red Mansion, but they have read Cha.Mr. Cha is very knowledgeable of Chinese history, literature and geography, and has managed to incorporate much of his knowledge into his works. Therefore, if the reader is interested in and somewhat familiar with Chinese culture, you will find the reading more enjoyable and not just an adventure/martial arts story. His characters will take you through tradition, culture, poetry, and landmarks. Verses of famous poets from hundreds to 2 to 3 thousand years ago are quoted by the characters at times, quite appropriate to their situation in the novels. I have read somewhere that the Chinese government is now using excerpts from Cha's novels in textbooks.I really hope there will be more translations of other works out soon for everybody to enjoy. Some people will dispute whether the &quot;Deer&quot; book is the best. Almost all of Cha's 4-volume sets are extremely popular. Many claim that his third book (can't translate the name) is the best."},{"Title":"The Deer and The Cauldron: The First Book (Bk. 1)","review":"This book is a lot of fun. I am staying up reading it at night until I can't keep my eyes open anymore. Like the great Looney Tunes cartoons, it can be enjoyed on an adult level and a child's level. The rollicking adventure tale is spiced with just enough Chinese history and culture. It is violent. The 12 year old hero murders a few people with a knife and tries to kill some others. Fingers get sliced off. There is plenty of kungfu talk and anyone studying martial arts will probably enjoy it."},{"Title":"The Deer and The Cauldron: The First Book (Bk. 1)","review":"The film adaptation of &quot;The Deer and the Cauldron&quot; is called &quot;Royal Tramp&quot; 1 &amp; 2 (part 1 is ASIN 6305052212, part 2 says it's ASIN B00000INCR, but I'm not sure that's it). The film is perhaps the best of many excellent adaptations of Louis Cha's work, and while the adaptation is not completely faithful to the book, it does an excellent job of preserving the humor and the spirit of the original.Like the film, the book is divided into relatively arbitrary sections. The end of volume 1 of &quot;The Deer and the Cauldron&quot; is pretty clearly just the end of a chapter chosen as an arbitrary breaking point. Plan on buying all three volumes.Despite the fact that he hasn't written any martial arts fiction in almost half a century, Louis Cha is the author behind many of the best films made in Hong Kong in the last fifteen years. Ever since I first heard of Louis Cha, I've been hoping someone would translate his works (a year of Mandarin in college just won't cut it for reading the original). The only other translation of his work I've found is &quot;Fox Volant of Snowy Mountain&quot; (ISBN 9622017339), which was a mediocre translation of one of Cha's weakest works.I was, therefore, happy to discover that &quot;The Deer and the Cauldron&quot; (at least the part I've read so far) lives up to all my hopes and expectations, and look forward to reading the third volume of the translation, and also any other translations Mr. Minford may make of Louis Cha's work in the future."},{"Title":"The Deer and The Cauldron: The First Book (Bk. 1)","review":"This is an excellent piece of wuxia fiction, or almost anti-wuxia fiction as it a sort of reversal of the conventions of the genre.

Millions of Chinese readers can't be wrong and it has been adapted into at least a dozen movie and tv shows, including serious ones and even a mo-le-tau comedy. The question about this particular book is the translation.The first thing is that these wuxia novels are not written in easy to understand Chinese. To translate it into easy to understand English and a true translation that doesn't lose the nuances or the feel of these novels is a monumental task and it succeeds! The Deer and the Cauldron is an epic and I'm happy to say that the translated English Deer and Cauldron is still an epic.For fans of Louis Cha, fans of Chinese wuxia (movies or novels) who can't read Chinese, this is a hit and highly recommended. This is the best translation of a Chinese novel I've ever read and retains such a feel that it almost feels like it was written in English. Things such as insults and poems have all been translated perfectly. I have not gone into the plot of this book because I'm assuming that anyone looking at a translated version of this book must know something about it already or have seen a version on screen as I myself have."},{"Title":"The Deer and The Cauldron: The First Book (Bk. 1)","review":"Louis Cha is perhaps the paramount Chinese adventure novelist of the modern age and with Deer & the Cauldron, his last epic, he introduces one of his most indelible characters--Trinket Wei.Trinket is the son of a Yangzhou prostitute who goes through a series of adventures so unbelievable, from becoming a 'eunuch' in the Forbidden City and friend of the emperor, to a Shaolin, a Lama, a Heaven & Earth rebellion leader, and a disciple of Snake Island--all woven into the mystery of the sutra and dragon-lines, and the fate of the Qing (Manchu) Empire--yet so utterly entertaining, as to both honor and revolutionize the genre.The only drawback is that the translation maintains the more Chinese style of heavy narrative exposition--they 'tell' almost as much as 'show' which is very much different to the post-TV/Cinema Western style of immediate scene. If the sheer lunatic excitement of the story wasn't so engrossing, it would probably lose some readers along the way.Hopefully more Wuxia will make the transition into English!"},{"Title":"The Deer and The Cauldron: The First Book (Bk. 1)","review":"I bought this (and the other two volumes) off of Amazon a long time ago and it sat on my shelf for a long time based on my own silly preconceived prejudice against Trinket (I don't like the actor that plays him in the television drama). I finally managed to get to reading all three volumes last year and I can't believe I let this story sit around for so long without reading it.It's a work of fun, historical fiction with the main character, Trinket, playing a major role in various historic events in the Qing Dynasty. It starts off with mistaken identity - something I also greatly enjoy - leading to friendship between Trinket and emperor and then Trinket doing all sorts of errands on the emperor's behalf.Only two points keep me from giving these books five stars:One, the translator prefaced volume two or three saying that several plot points were left out as he felt it wasn't important to the story. While the coherency of the story didn't suffer for it, I do wish the completed work could have been translated in full. In fact, I'm surprised by the lack of translations of Louis Cha's books in general considering how famous he is in Asia.Two, Trinket (as was somewhat common during that historical time period) had more than one wife. It was kind of cute at the beginning of the story where he flirted with and teased the girls around him. But then somewhere in book two and/or three, it took on a creepy vibe. In one instance, he got all of them in bed with him (some unwillingly and some drugged) and proceeded to \\"touch\\" them. The book didn't go into detail on what was done, but it made clear that by the end of that incident, all the girls were \\"married\\" to him. Maybe that was what was done back in the days, but as a reader in the 21st century, I thought that was a bit uncomfortable and gave the supposedly loveable Trinket a sinister feel.Despite those two points, I enjoyed the books overall and might actually give the drama version of the story a try."},{"Title":"The Complete Book of Dream Interpretation","review":"I don't know how any author can say they have a complete book of dream interpretations.

The book explores the four approaches to English grammar: Prescriptivism, Descriptivism, Generativism, and Performance. Most grammar taught in public schools is prescriptivist, even though most of us speak and write in a descriptivist way. Generativism and performance explore the way the brain basically spits out sentences. Generativism and performance are also more linguistical in approach, owing a great deal to Noam Chomsky.I found this book to be quite useful. It is informative, fairly easy to understand, and contains many valuable exercises. It's a great textbook to have for studying grammar and can be useful when studying linguistics."},{"Title":"The Brazilian's Blackmailed Bride (Harlequin Presents)","review":"Back cover:A wife at his command....Anton Luis Scott-Lee has to marry the woman who so callously rejected him years ago.

Cristina has no choice but to accept Luis's marriage demand. But Luis will find that his new bride can't or won't fulfill all of her wedding vows...Comments:This is book 2 in the Ramirez series. I don't think that book 1 has to be read first in order to understand what's going on. Just as in the first Ramirez book, Anton receives a package stating that if he does not marry and produce a child within a year then he will never know the true identities of his half-brothers. So, Anton has the perfect person in mind he wants to pay to fulfill this stipulation. Cristina Marques. Though he has loathed her with a passion for six years, he still can't put out the sparks of passion he has for her. The last time they were together she callously ended their relationship and told him that under no circumstances she would bear his English children. Little did he know Cristina was spitting out empty words and trying to cover up her own secrets and pain. So, Anton goes back to England resenting what Cristina did to him and harbors bitter feelings towards her. Then the package comes and Anton sets a plan in motion. He neatly sets up a plan to get Cristina into a position that forces her to either accept his loan from his bank or lose her family home. The passion is definitely there between Cristina and Anton and Reid does a good job at giving both the heroine's and hero's POV. BUT there seemed to be an element missing in this book.

They can bend reality and be forgiven. But I think when you're writing about a foreign country at least some research is needed. As a Brazilian I was appalled by the mistakes committed. Enrico Ramirez is a purely Spanish name as are others. People, Portuguese is very different from Spanish. In Portuguese you don't say 'papa' you say 'pai' or 'papai'. When a woman says thank you, she says 'obrigada'. A man says 'obrigado'. My God is 'meu Deus' and not 'meu Dues'. My darling is 'minha querida' and not 'meu querida'. And at the end of the book, when Anton says 'Nada mat&eacute;rias outras', it means nothin at all in Portuguese. If he wanted to say 'nothing else matters', he should have said 'Nada mais importa'. I was very sad with those mistakes because it shows a lack of care and it's not so difficult to find people who speak Portuguese and who could have edited the use of it. And I'm not going to talk about Rio and the fact that in Brazil we don't refer to ourselves as Portugueses, but as Brazilians.

She reluctantly agrees to hero's marriage proposal even though she knows he's doing it out of vengeance b/c she cruelly rejected his marriage proposal 6 yrs ago without telling him her real reasons & instead married a much older man per her father's business arrangement. Later, an unexpected financial help comes from a man who rescued her when she was child & who hero recently found out was his biological father. And the secrets begin to unfurl.Reid's writing is good. Her writing pulls my emotions, keeps the pace quick, & dialogue interesting. Sexual tension & love scenes are passionate.What made it a 3-star for me is the heroine's convoluted self-sacrifice. It didn't make sense & made the problems much bigger than it should have been. All heroine needed to do was tell the hero about her miscarriage as soon as it happened & save them so many complications. She didn't have a good reason to not contact him as soon as she could, like when she was at the hospital. I just didn't see what her reason was for not doing so & why that wasn't the 1st thing she talked to him about as soon as hero came back from his dad's funeral. As strong & independent as she is, heroine kept making such dumb mistakes by keeping her big secret a secret from hero. She took away his choice by not being honest with him from the beginning & when she saw him again. She acted like a self-effacing martyr. Ugh. These self-sacrificing heroines drive me nuts! It didn't make sense to me either that she agreed to marry her 1st husband. Yes, her dad needed the money for the ranch but she didn't even struggle & find another solution, which seems so unlike her character. I felt so bad for the hero who was so in love with her & was completely baffled as to why she cruelly rejected him. Poor guy. Heroine needed to grovel for hero's forgiveness.

It's an excellent book for allowing a child to be able to find out how to spell a word by themselves.

My daughter has read parts of this and has learned much about spelling. It has improved her spelling abilities in school (she now gets 106% on her tests) and made her more self-reliant, which is important to me.I'd recommend getting this book andMerriam Webster Children's Dictionarytogether, as one is good for looking up spelling, and the other is a great reference for definitions."},{"Title":"Scholastic Dictionary of Spelling","review":"I bought this for my 5th grader and he tells me it is much easier to use than a regular dictionary.

It describes both the basics as well as many of the more advanced aspects of valuation incl. valuation of multi-business, cyclical, and growing companies, as well as companies operating in highly inflationary countries.The aim of the book is to arrive at a rather precise measure of value for a business through detailed valuations. The authors claim to have an error of some 15% in their valuations and this is my first complaint about the book: Their valuations are based on extrapolated future cash flows and even when multiple scenarios of the future are taken into account, there is no way you can achieve that kind of precision. Even Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger aren't that precise in their valuations and they have been doing it for many decades. The trick to investing is to have a greater margin of safety in your buying-price. But the authors dismiss that as being possible, as the book relies on academic theories such as the Efficient Market Theory, Capital Asset Pricing Model, etc., which claim that the stock-markets are good at pricing stocks correctly and great bargains cannot be found. These theories are incorrect in my opinion and experience, and should therefore not be used in valuation e.g. to determine the cost of capital.Overall I have given the book 3 of 5 stars because it does contain some interesting information and ideas for doing valuation. But it is clear that the authors are financial consultants who have an interest in making their craft seem as complicated as possible. It takes much effort to read this book and I therefore recommend some more accessible books instead.For a practitioner who wants to understand cash flow analysis I recommend the book: Free Cash Flow by George Christy, and for understanding corporate finance I recommend: Analysis for Financial Management by Robert Higgins.PS: This review is for the 4th University Edition."},{"Title":"Valuation: Measuring and Managing the Value of Companies, Fourth Edition, University Edition","review":"I work on at a large investment bank in NY in the M&A department. I have yet to see any of the McKinsey consultants' formulas in practice. I like the Jeffrey Hooke book on valuation or the Josh Rosenbaum book on LBOs and value.

It offers incredibly comprehensive and insightful methods for rearranging financial statements into key drivers of firm value. It also teaches you how to apply those drivers to create a forecast for the future. Individual chapters are dedicated to the more complex concepts. This is a great resource for an aspiring or practicing analyst."},{"Title":"Valuation: Measuring and Managing the Value of Companies, Fourth Edition, University Edition","review":"This book is the definitive text on DCF valuation, combining theory, practice, and clear presentation as McKinsey should. Its focus on core value drivers (growth, margin, and capital efficiency) is seminal.Some reviewers claim the book focuses excessively on cash flow modeling to the exclusion of important considerations such as the skill of the management team, the company's product lineup, etc. I think this criticism is off base:For example, a great management team should lead to a more valuable business. Mechanically however, this works because a great management team will be better at driving growth, margins, capital efficiency, or all three -- in other words, cash flows. In fact, all of these broader issues can and should be assessed in terms of the ways in which they influence the expected future cash flows of the business.For example, if you believe a management team is unusually strong in operational cost control, you can adjust your forecasted cost structure, but if you think they're far better in marketing, be more aggressive on the top line while potentially modeling a fatter cost structure. This way you force yourself to be specific about the impact of these factors, and rely on the mechanics of the DCF model to translate this impact into a number. The model - and the value of a company in general - will be more sensitive to some variables than to others. By driving your assumptions through the model, you ensure the different factors' effects are properly scaled in your final value number.To criticisms about using past cash flows to help forecast the future, it is certainly true that to use a model that blithely carries past growth into future years is to develop a valuation based on fantasy. The authors state as much. However, a company's history is full of learnings that are key to assessing its future prospects. Historical financials show what has been accomplished given the constraints of industry, business model, technology, management team etc. To imagine the future, start by really understanding the past, then methodically think about how each variable will most likely change going forward. Some historical variables, of course, won't show up in the financials at all, for example a pharmaceutical company's pipeline of drugs. With good reason, investors look beyond the books to assess such non-financial assets.Some point out that most M&A; fails. What the data shows in fact is that, in general, public companies that buy other public companies do not see an increase in value after the transaction. However, the shareholders of the company being acquired usually sell for a premium over where their stock had traded before any deal announcement. This implies that the market fully prices any expected transaction synergies into the shares. So why do managers buy other companies? Sometimes there is a valid strategic rationale for future synergies that the market doesn't see and doesn't know to give them credit for. And sometimes it's all about misaligned incentives, ego, and empire building. It is not, however, about a methodological flaw in using cash flows for valuation.Ultimately, when you make an investment, there are only two ways to make money. One is to extract cash while you own the business (i.e., dividends), and the other is to sell the investment to someone else for a higher price. A cash flow forecast is the best way to estimate the first of these. Estimating the second depends on how you think potential buyers (i.e., the \\"market\\") will estimate the cash flows during their own hold time as well as their own future prospects for ext. Most institutional investors at some point use a DCF model, so viewing the world through your potential buyer's lens is a useful exercise.Of course investors can also be irrational (viz. \\"New Economy\\" valuations in 1999). Quantifying that irrationality remains one of the biggest gaps in the literature."},{"Title":"Valuation: Measuring and Managing the Value of Companies, Fourth Edition, University Edition","review":"Read the chapters assigned for my equity course.

It determines the valuation of companies based almost exclusively on their cash flow over the previous few years (i.e., 3, 5 and 7 year periods) to the analysis. Unfortunately it ignores (completely) too many issues that play an extremely important role in valuation. For example, the quality, background, knowledge of management, the products the company manufactures, the markets for these products, macroeconomic conditions, intellectual property, market position (i.e., oligopolistic? Is entry/exit difficult in the industry?). Not one of these issues is even touched upon!!! The authors seem to be implying that these issues are irrelevant!! Only the cash flow over the previous few years forecast forward (i.e., discounted for present value) matters according to the book!!! Perhaps this type of mentality explains why the overwhelming majority of mergers and acquistions fail!!!!If you are looking purely for a way to use past cash flows to determine a company's \\"value\\" this is the book for you.

I had no experience in any of this, and I found that these things were not explained well enough for a novice such as myself to fully understand. I got lost.Someone with SOME experience in these other things might find this book to be a great resource for dynamic html, but it was a bit too much of a jump for me.

Along with a very intense main area, the book includes cross-browser reference (including versions of browsers) of ALL elements, attributes, and what code will work in the most popular browsers when the W3C's &quot;Official&quot; code is not yet implemented. Also contains VBScript, JavaScript reference tables, XSL, XML, DHTML and CGI information, and a fairly thorough listing of online references.

This book gives a lot of attention to HTML and when I buy a book on HTML, that's what I want! HTML is the core language of the web and this book provides a good working understanding of the latest version, 4.0. It also gives very nice, but not overdone, history lessons about HTML which further help to understand certain conventions.

Examples were particularly unhelpful, and the CD is worthless. It seems like the more pages stuffed into a computer book (notice how the author brags about 1000+pages), the worse the quality of the material inside.

Having known a little HTML already, I was looking for a comprehensive book that could teach me about the advanced aspects of the language. Unfortunately, I ended up wasting money on this millstone instead. The book's technique--if it can be called that--is to bore the reader with arcane aspects of a topic and then forget to say how it is applied in an HTML document in the real world. Most of this unwieldy tome reads like a verbose editorial on HTML rather than a book designed to teach a person HTML. (And the authors exhibit an almost ideological contempt for &quot;cool&quot; websites.) &quot;HTML 4 Unleashed&quot; is a 1,000 page waste of the human spirit.

I'm not saying the book was without worth, after reading another book on HTML 4, I went back to this book and it did add some more advanced features to my knowledge, but there are other books that would probably be better.If you do buy this book, I would suggest you skip the first part.

Read Trollope, he's an equal unto Forster and Austen."},{"Title":"Eustace Diamonds (World's Classics)","review":"Why are Victorian novels so long? Among other reasons one which stands out is that they were often serialized in popular magazines. This novel of 1873 was serialized in \\"The Fortnightly Review.\\" It is one of the six novels comprising the Palliser Series which deals with the British upper crust and politcs as the fortunes of Prime Minister Platangenet Palisser and his feisty wife Glencora are examined. In this novel they play a minor role sharing gossip about Lizzie Eustace and nothing much else.Lizzie Eustace is the fetching and sexy young widow of Lord Eustace. She has given birth to a son. Lizzie is similar to the scheming Becky Sharp who proceeded her by fifty years and Scarlett O'Hara who came seventy years later and a continent away. Lizzie claims that a 10,000 necklace was given her by her late mate but the family wants it as an heirloom. That is the plot of this 800 page novel!Lizzie is courted by Lord George Carruthers; refuses marriage to the stupid and dull Lord Fawn and is infatuated with her cousin Frank Greystock. Frank has tied up with the good but colorless Lucy Morris who is a governess to the Fawn family featuring Lady Fawn and several of her daughters.The novel becomes a mystery story as the diamonds are stolen from Lizzie? Who took them and why? Check with Miss Crabstick her maid and richbut dishonest jewel dealers in London. Trollope goes to Scotland Yard to follow the case as Lizzie comes under a cloud. Lizzie is exonerated but she is a nefarious lady who cannot tell the truth always searching for a handsome Corsair to whisk her away on a stallion of her romantic imaginings.A good side tale is that of Mrs. Carbuncle and her ward Lucinda Roanoke who seek to wed a title and filthy lucre. Lucinda is to wed Sir Griffin but backs out as the man is an odious and offensive nonentity.Trollope includes a few chapters on fox hunting of which he was a clumsy but devoted adherent. The book is filled with humor, mystery, romance and closely observed English aristocratic life in the 1870s.Unlike other of his huge novels this one moves at a quicker pace though the reader is wearied with the umpteenth explanation of what happened to the jewels recounted by various characters.Anthony Trollope deserves high praise for his storytelling abilities which place him in the top rank of Victorian and British authors. This is one of the best of the Palliser novels. Enjoy the complex Lizzie Eustace as she will take you on a journey through many pages with her panache and deceitfully sly ways."},{"Title":"Eustace Diamonds (World's Classics)","review":"The Eustace Diamonds is a social commentary on man, and man's condition with and without money. It was an introspective look into the character of all humans, particularly when money becomes the root of their focus.Because I had no prior knowledge of this book, nor author, I had no expectations for reading this piece. I truly enjoyed the book and the style in which it was written. Particularly interesting was the author's interaction with the reader throughout the text. Trollope's interruptions and conversations about the characters and progression of the story were enjoyable and interesting. Whereas this is something I've often wished for while reading certain books, it was delightful to actually encounter an author who fulfilled such a personal wish.Initially, I was confused by the beginning of the book, as Trollope introduced the characters, giving such a deep perspective into each one (I admit, I abhor reading prologues, author\`s notes and introductions.) This was such an interesting approach to a text, yet it allowed the reader to immediately become immersed into the text and know the characters with greater intimacy. At times, that the saga of the diamonds became monotonous, and found myself wanting a resolution (I don't know if this is a result of being raised within the American culture). However, after finishing the book, I can't imagine any parts of the story being omitted, as each event was significant to the story and to further revelation of the character's true moral makeup.It was interesting to learn that, during the 1800's, despite a man's intellectual strength and significant career placement, he could still be poor. This resulted in reliance upon a financial marriage, sacrificing true love, to ensure societal placement, thus completing his social framework. (Reminds me of sports figures, here in the US, who's sudden wealth is meant to distance themselves from poverty, uplift their families and subsequent gold-digging females who surround them.) Also interesting, although I think I somewhat knew it, was the role of women during this time. With wealth, a woman was virtually a pawn and/or stepping stone for a gentleman's societal growth. Without wealth, a woman was reduced to dependency, and sometimes mistreatment, upon those of a wealthier class. Interestingly enough, with the decline of the middle class in America, I question whether these same ideals exist today? In truth, wealth or lack thereof, put all persons on a level playing field ... dependence upon others. This situation directly fed into the character development of a person. Money, in the case of Trollope's characters, was truly the root of all evil.Trollope created a world of opposite relationships and mirror images within the text. Lucy Morris and Lady Fawn versus Mrs. Carbuncle and Miss Roanoke is an example of this craft. Lady Fawn counseled Lucy Morris on her engagement to Frank Greystock, seemingly out of motherly concern, but with social overtures. Lady Fawn had grown to love Lucy and dealt with her, as though she were one of her daughters, though to a certain point. When Lucy does become engaged to Mr. Greystock, Lady Fawn responds favorably, although reminding Lucy of the societal implications which she'd face. Mrs. Carbuncle on the other hand, forced her niece Lucinda, into a marriage for her own selfish gain. Despite Lucinda's blatant revulsion and abuse of Sir Griffin Tewett (what a worm to never stand up for himself!), Mrs. Carbuncle crushed Lucinda's zest for life and independence, and doggedly determined the course of her life. Lucinda, a vibrant, energetic and beautiful young woman, is finally reduced to insanity. While Lucinda gets her way and doesn't marry Tewett, she is all but discarded by her aunt, who uses her wedding presents to fulfill her personal need for material gratification.Trollope's femme fatal, Lizzie Eustace, was a morally corrupt woman. I hated her! Lizzie's desire for wealth manipulated every fiber of her being, as well as every aspect of her life. (This was despite the fact Lizzie clung to the diamonds, refusing to give them up, yet repeatedly stating that she should like to throw them into the sea, whenever troubles arose.) She sought to destroy people, like Lucy Morris and her love for Frank. Lizzie was the epitome of selfishness! She believed her own lies (the diamonds were hers), lied to everyone (Frank, her cousin), stole from her in-laws (their family heirloom), and attempted to manipulate everyone around her (Lucy, Frank, Lord Bruce, etc), until she managed to saddle herself with Mrs. Carbuncle, her mirror image (the only sense of justice I found for Lizzie). It disgusted me that Lucy would consider situations, then purposefully consider how she should dress, act and place herself in her sitting room or bed, in order to give the illusion of ill-used widow! Furthermore, she completely abandoned her own child to seek a Corsair of some sort! When she was engaged to Lord Fawn, he had never even met the child! Ugh ... that such a woman should be blessed with a child!Lucy Morris was one of the more redeeming characters of the story. Being the polar opposite of Lizzie Eustace (a nice tactic used by Trollope throughout the novel), Lucy balanced and refreshed the oppressive moral decay of most other characters. Lucy was the embodiment of goodness and I was happy to see her win in the end. Her moral fortitude served to enable Frank Greystock to find redemption in himself, those around her and with this reader. Lucy's morality also revealed the truth of the scripture, \\"Love never fails.\\" Lucy, endured her year long stay with Lady Linlithgow, with graciousness, and gained a positive response from Lady Linlithgow.Frank Greystock was a man still seeking himself. While he was temporarily led astray by the temptation of Lizzie\`s beauty and the possibility of wealth, Frank finally grew into a man of true character. In hindsight, Frank's dedication to his cousin Lizzie, was a sign of him being a man of his word (I didn't see this as I was reading the book). He consistently gave his word to Lizzie and followed through. In the same way, he had asked Lucy to become his wife, and in the end, he did stay true to his commitment. Despite his lengthy ignoring and desertion of Lucy, Frank had experienced pure love. Sensibly enough, he allowed this pure emotion to lead him in the right direction -marrying Lucy Morris, forsaking immediate wealth and the opinions of others - and allowed him to be true to himself and find real happiness.Lord George de Bruce Carruthers surprised me! While it was questionable as to how he afforded his lifestyle and the company he chose to keep, Lord George proved to be a very observant and intuitive character. I appreciated how he withstood the allegations of aiding in the theft of the Eustace Diamonds, despite the attack upon his character (he could have easily run away). Furthermore, Lord George was able to maintain relationships with people, despite their obvious character flaws, as revealed in his final conversation with Lizzie. I'm still not sure how I feel about his lifestyle - seeming to live off the means of others."},{"Title":"Eustace Diamonds (World's Classics)","review":"With movies being adapted from books by Austen and Forster, what's left of Trollope. I stumbled across this book by accident, having never before heard of it's title and author. When I did some research on Anthony Trollope, by golly he was as popular as Eliot and Dickens in the Victorian Time Period.As for the book, this is a true classic of the Victorian Era. Romance, rivalry, jealousy, money, family feuds, death, and new life, this book is fabulous.Everyone should have this book in their library. It's a delight to read over and over again."},{"Title":"Eustace Diamonds (World's Classics)","review":"Lucy Morris is a bore. If you like Jane Austen you will like this novel! It has all the necessary ingredients to keep you turning the pages. It's fun and charming to read just like its heroine Lizzie Eustace. Trollope argues that she is no heroine at all but it is when she appears that your interest is held the longest and that you laugh the loudest. She is wicked and selfish and vain and yet childike spoiled and that's what makes her great. Lucy Morris in comparison bores you with her goodness and her morality and her prim and proper attitude which although greatly admired in 19th century women leaves her nonetheless dull and insipid in comparison to charmingly wicked Lizzie."},{"Title":"Eustace Diamonds (World's Classics)","review":"One of Anthony Trollope's most entralling stories and well worth grabbing a copy and it is very hard to put down. His characterisation of Lady Eustace is thoroughly up to date ..very 2010!"},{"Title":"Eustace Diamonds (World's Classics)","review":"It wasn't hard to finish because it was a difficult read. It's just so damned long. And I'm not certain I can highly recommend it unless, like me, you are determined to read the Palliser novels from end to end. As are all of the Palliser novels I have read so far. The Eustace Diamonds has tantalizing glimpses of Planty Pall and Lady Glencora, and one worries that one won't have the delightful Duke of Omnium with us much longer, but the main characters are people we neither enjoy nor applaud. I think dear little Lucy Morris was given short shrift, and the novel could have used her to much greater advantage."},{"Title":"Eustace Diamonds (World's Classics)","review":"Great book. There's something to be said for Trollope's writing style. The \\"Eustace Diamonds\\" was written in 1873, and yet it is extremely easy and delightful reading. I was drawn to Trollope's works after watching the BBC mini series of his book \\"He Knew He Was Right,\\" and decided I had to look into his other works. So far I have NOT been disappointed. I recommend this (and his other works) highly!"},{"Title":"Eustace Diamonds (World's Classics)","review":"Anthony Trollope's variation on Wilkie Collins' Moonstone story was a public success, but the critics ignored it. It was too much of the same old, the man had been around for so long, and he stuck to his guns, essentially, with his leisurely style of relaxed communications with the reader, with his technique of suspense by concealed consequences, though in a way, this novel is unusually fast paced. It was number 3 in the Palliser sextet and is good fun.We have two heroines.a) Lizzie Greystock becomes Lady Eustace and soon a rich widow. She is a beauty and smart and greedy and deeply ignorant (\`she was quick as a lizard in turning hither and thither, but knew almost nothing'), who is not clear about the legal implications of her inheritance and has no friends with the practical knowledge to advise her against the legal forces that her in-laws activate against her. This is a typical Trollope woman: we understand her problems, but are not expected to like her.b) Lucy Morris is a poor governess with a personality, with charming manners, and with a rational mind. She loves a man of whom she knows that he needs a rich wife, hence she expects little. Trollope talks down to her with a kind of patronizing respect. She is a typical Trollope woman: we like her but can't quite see the way out for her.The man is Frank Greystock, Lizzie's cousin, a young barrister and Member of Parliament, who could well use his cousin's money. He is a bit of an opportunist, but not an entirely bad character at all. Unfortunately he is a bit of a Jekyll and Hyde character. His Jekyll version does all the right things and behaves decently, but when Hyde comes over him, all rules are off.Frank represents the conservatives in the house, though he has no convictions to speak of. A barrister doesn't need any.(This gives Trollope a reason to muse about conservatives in general, and his comments are quite amusing. He had run for parliament himself, as a \`radical', meaning a candidate for the Liberal Party, and had lost badly. He calls himself a \`conservative liberal'.)There is another suitor for Lizzie, Lord Fawn, who can give her a peerage, but he is miserably poor for an aristocrat and politician, and he needs her money as badly as Greystock. His family hates Lizzie as much as her first set of in-laws. The woman is marvelously good ad attracting dislike.The main theme of the plot is a legal entanglement and dispute: who is the rightful owner of the diamonds that the Eustace family considers part of the family property and that Lizzie considers a gift from her husband. That may look like an easy issue, but if you think so, you must have forgotten all that you know of the English legal system of the time from Dickens and others. (Not sure if it has changed since.)Lizzie is stubborn and will not give up the diamonds, which endangers her engagement with Lord Fawn and her cousin's friendship with the Fawn family. The issue becomes a favorite subject of rumors and false claims in London society.Lord Fawn is neither rich nor important, but he is an Under-Secretary in the Whig government, serving the India Secretary, while Lizzie's champion is a rising star of the Tories. Hence there is a political dimension to the dispute.And don't forget the India angle! Like the Moonstone in Collins, the Eustace diamonds have their exotic originals as well! And of course the underworld learns about the stones and has special interests devoted to them.What an entertaining mess!"},{"Title":"Eustace Diamonds (World's Classics)","review":"A wonerful introduction to the marvelous work of Trollope.

Trollope is famous for his lengthy \\"exposes\\" on middle class Victorian society, and this one is a real hoot! His prose is easy to read, and although the book is a bit lengthy, it is well worth the time. The Eustace Diamonds is essentially a Victorian \\"soap opera\\" but the characters and situations are so well-drawn that one can easily believe the same absurdities occurring in the modern world. What I like most about this novel is that the \\"heroine\\", if you can call her that, gets just what she deserves in a wonderfully ironic ending."},{"Title":"Eustace Diamonds (World's Classics)","review":"I suspect that Anthony Trollope who knew the language so well and used it so nicely would have sneered at the adjective \\"exciting\\" to characterize this exquisite novel. So over-used, so vulgar, so trans-Atlantic an epithet! Well,maybe so. Nevertheless, that is the word that springs inevitably to my mind--vulgar though it may be!--when I think of Trollope's picaresque heroine in \\"The Eustace Diamonds.\\" Trollope's plots are usually pretty formulaic; we read him for his wonderful characters. But, in this novel, the plot of more than usually intriguing and the anti-heroine is a triumph."},{"Title":"Eustace Diamonds (World's Classics)","review":"I have only read one Anthony Trollope novel, and I had the very good fortune of having chosen \\"The Eustace Diamonds.\\" This superbly constructed novel begins with what is probably my favorite opening sentence of a novel--it's right up there with the opening sentence to Jane Austen's \\"Pride and Prejudice\\":\\"It was admitted by all her friends, and also by her enemies--who were in truth the more numerous and active body of the two--that Lizzie Greystock had done very well with herself.\\" The second sentence further clarifies Lizzie's character when it goes on with, \\"We will tell the story of Lizzie Greystock from the beginning, but we will not dwell over it at great length, as we might do if we loved her.\\"Lizzie Greystock--eventually to become Lady Eustace--is a fascinating combination of cunning and foolishness, of avarice and pitiable character, of steely backbone and whimpering fits. She reminds me so very much of both Emma Bovary and Scarlett O'Hara. Her determination to keep the Eustace family diamonds entirely for herself is what sets the novel in motion, and with this rather simple device, Trollope goes on to spin out a tale which encompasses morality, greed, Victorian social mores, the corrupting influence of money, and the blindness it can cause to everything else of value.Lizzie is contrasted, with every shade under the sun, with the sweet and constant Lucy Morris. Picture the contrast as one very much like that of Scarlett O'Hara and Melanie Wilkes. \\"The Eustace Diamonds\\" is a deliciously satisfying book, and a classic for a very good reason: despite having been written in the 19th century, what it has to say reverberates as soundly now as when Trollope first published it. I can't recommend it highly enough."},{"Title":"Eustace Diamonds (World's Classics)","review":"The Lady Lizzie Eustace, a beautiful young widow, claims that her husband gave her the extremely valuable diamond necklace to be her very own. However, Mr. Camperdown, lawyer for the estate, says that it is a family heirloom and must be given up. Lizzie, for whom lying is always more natural than telling the truth, stubbornly clings to the diamonds, taking them with her everywhere, rather than entrusting them to some safe depository.But then there is a skillfully performed burglary, and the jewels are stolen from her hotel room in Carlisle. Or are they? Did Lizzie just use this scheme to make the diamonds disappear? Why is there a second burglary at her London apartment? The novel becomes a fascinating detective story.Lizzie longs for a husband to share her problems. But which man is it to be? There is Lord Fawn, to whom she is engaged, but who breaks with her because of the diamonds. Lord George, a rather shady character, intrigues her with his swashbuckling mann! ! er. Then there is her ever loyal cousin, Frank Greystock, but he is supposedly engaged to a penniless nonentity, Lucy Morris.Lizzie Eustace is one of Trollope's most interesting characters--beautiful, strong willed, intelligent in her way, but utterly untrustworthy, constantly scheming to get what she wants and always able to justify her actions to herself. It is no wonder that even the similarly mendacious Lord George is afraid of her. Lizzie alone makes this third novel of the Palliser series well worth reading."},{"Title":"Eustace Diamonds (World's Classics)","review":"From the very start of this novel, you know that you're not going to like Lizzie (Lady Eustace), the main character. She's one of those women who does ANYthing she can to get her way...and she'll be damned if she doesn't get it. She can flirt, act sweet and innocent, step on other women's toes, turn on her tears in a timely manner...and all of the men are just bending over backwards to help her. She was born with nothing, and she's going to get what she wants in life. She starts out by getting herself a rich husband who will conveniently die right away and leave his riches and jewels to her. But, wait, did he &quot;correct&quot; his will in the exact manner Lizzie wanted before he died? Well, it doesn't matter, she'll get what she wants (the Eustace diamonds) in another manner---wear them around and refuse to take them off! It's difficult to contradict this extremely clever woman, but she has enemies who are certainly going to try. Some of her &quot;tricks&quot; to get her way just want to make you scream--she can be SO cruel and heartless.This novel is a battle of wills...a woman and her enemies. You don't have to like her, but you must admit she's on a higher playing field than everyone else...and she should at least get credit for her effort and her cleverness! Everyone knows a woman like Lady Eustace and hopes she gets what she deserves. This book will show you if she does. It's very long, but the political plots that are a part of the other books in this series are left out and make for an entertaining, can't-put-it-down read."},{"Title":"Eustace Diamonds (World's Classics)","review":"There is a lot to like about this book. It has the usual host of colorful and varied characters that one finds in Trollope's novels. There are strong and complex women, sturdy and weak-willed men, and some wonderful set-pieces. It's a bit of a let-down after _Phineas Finn_, though, which to my mind is the greatest political novel in the English language. The previous two 'Palliser' novels having been clearly both for and about Liberals, I think that Trollope was struggling in this novel to write in a way that would both reflect and appeal to more Conservative sensibilities. So we get a lot of domestic gossip, a little mild anti-semitism, and endless lectures about the Proper way for a Gentleman to Behave to a Lady. Still, the protagonist, Lizzie Eustace, is a gem."},{"Title":"Eustace Diamonds (World's Classics)","review":"This set of novels is (nearly) worth the price of the Kindle itself. Anthony Trollope has been a favorite author of mine since college. His books deal with political and social themes which we are still struggling with today (seems like this year more than ever!) He also writes with a sense of humor that I enjoy and it is hard to believe that he was a contemporary of Dickens and not a modern-day writer. He also writes so descriptively that you feel like you are part of the 18th century British Aristocracy.However, Trollope was paid by the word so his books tend to be BIG and LONG. If you tried to keep the whole collection in one place, it would take up an entire shelf -- never mind trying to carry them with you.This set is very well formatted (I'm very picky about my formatting) and is actually better in terms of quality than most books that cost a lot more. The collection of novels has been organized so that it is easy to jump from one book to another and also within the book itself -- again a must given the length of the books.For the price of the set and the quality, you can't go wrong.If you aren't familiar with Anthony Trollope, all of these books build on one another and are best enjoyed if read as a series. However, if you want to get a taste of Trollope without investing in an entire series, probably one of his best books is a stand-alone novel calledOrley Farm. The free Kindle Edition of Orley Farm was also very well done. I just wish all publishers put this much effort into formatting and editing their Kindle editions and certainly appreciate the folks that have done so with the Trollope novels.[NCJAR]"},{"Title":"Eustace Diamonds (World's Classics)","review":"It is hard to choose my favorite Trollope but this is definitely right at the top of my list. It has everything a novel needs to pique your interest and keep you turning the pages--love, intrique, mystery, jealousy. It is a must read for a Trollope reader. And do yourself a favor. If you have kids, introduce them to this prince."},{"Title":"Eustace Diamonds (World's Classics)","review":"It's hard to adequately describe my affection for \\"The Eustace Diamonds.\\" This was the first Trollope I read, and I did so more out of a sense of obligation than anything else. (I had heard of Trollope, and thought that I SHOULD read him, much in the way one thinks one SHOULD get a yearly prostate exam.) I expected a dense, difficult read on the lines of Henry James or Thomas Hardy, but was completely surprised -- blown away, frankly -- by how entertaining and funny a writer Trollope is. This is the book that started my love affair with his works, one that has only deepened with each new book.\\"The Eustace Diamonds,\\" as you probably know, revolves around the vivacious Lizzie Greystock, who marries for money and goes to unimaginable lengths to hold on to it. She is a liar, a cheat, a wicked, wicked woman...and an utter delight. She ensnares every man she meets, and that seems to have included her creator, Trollope himself! I know that I find her irresistible, along with the novel in which she's the sun, moon and stars.If you haven't yet read Trollope, I might work up to this book by reading its two predecessors in The Palliser Chronicles, but be forewarned that the first of them, \\"Can You Forgive Her?\\" is not Trollope at his best. Certainly read \\"Phineas Finn,\\" though, as the characters introduced there will factor into \\"Phineas Redux,\\" which, in part, continues Lizzie Greystock's dubious adventures. But regardless of the order in which you decide to proceed, don't miss out on \\"The Eustace Diamonds,\\" one of the great, most pleasurable contributions to English literature."},{"Title":"Eustace Diamonds (World's Classics)","review":"Anthony Trollope's \`The Eustace Diamonds' is sometimes referred to as the third of his Palliser novels, but this is misleading. This novel is only loosely connected with the series, and can be read and enjoyed without the knowledge about the other \`Palliser' novels. And though many would prefer his earlier works, \`Diamonds' shows considerable merit of its own with its satires on the world he lived in, and vivid portraits of the intriguing characters..The novel is best remembered for beautiful Lizzie Eustace, strong-willed (and unscrupulous) heroine. She claims that her late husband Sir Florian Eustace \`gave' the precious diamonds of the Eustace family to her, and she is determined to have them. Of course, such an expensive thing cannot be \`given' so casually, and the family's lawyer Mr. Camperdown starts to fight to regain what he thinks is the heirloom of the Eustace family.But no one can stop Lizzie. After brief mourning, we find Lizzie engaged to Lord Fawn, indecisive, but respectable gentleman. While timid Lord Fawn soon regrets his hasty decision, and hesitates to marry her, Lizzie has plenty of time to think about the alternative plans - how about Lord George, or her cousin Frank Greystock? Frank is already engaged to Lucy Morris, but Lucy is only a governess, and he is MP, isn't it? But whatever her final choice may be, Lizzie is determined to teach Lord Fawn a lesson before that.But things get confusing when the diamonds are \`stolen' by thieves in he middle of the night. (\`The Eustace Diamonds' was originally published in 1872, only four years after the huge success of \`The Moonstone' by Wilkie Collins.) But what really happened to the diamonds is not the novelist's real concern because he reveals it very soon. I will not write that part. I can only say Trollope's idea is very ingenious.\`The Eustace Diamonds' is not a detective story, but the fate of the characters is as interesting as the discovery of The Moonstone. Will Lizzie get what she wants? Will Frank marry Lucy? Trollope, whose digressive habits sometimes damage his works, succeeds in creating the tightly-constructed plot here. Plus, there are some funny in-jokes. In one scene Lizzie changes the date of her letter, and the narratives about her action can be taken as Trollope's own commentary on the meticulous details of Collins' novels.Not everything is good, I must say. The chapters about hunting are, I thought, a bit lengthy and Jewish characters, though they are relatively minor ones, will be called negative stereotypes.But I find the book very amusing with the lively characters and interesting story, especially Lizzie Eustace, who often mistakes lies for poetry. \`The Eustace Diamonds' shows the author's clear vision of the society. The satires are often biting, and the narratives are incisive. (Though very briefly, Lizzie appears again later in \`Phineas Redux.')"},{"Title":"Eustace Diamonds (World's Classics)","review":"Anthony Trollope is fabulous.

This is from a 18 year girl, so a must read for all."},{"Title":"The doctrine of God,","review":"Bavinck's Doctrine of God is richly informative, very detailed, and difficult to read. I give it 4 stars because Bavinck is both thorough in his handling of the material, well-organized (the material is laid out within an outline format) and of course thoroughly scriptural.As negatives go, Bavinck often quotes writers and theologians who are obscure today, as if the reader had a good, workable knowledge of their material. This can often leave the reader bewildered as to the argument the quoted writer was making, with no opportunity to read the original materials.Bavinck breaks down the Doctrine of God into 7 categories: God's Incomprehensibility, God's Knowability, God's Names, God's Incommunicable Attributes, God's Communicable Attributes, The Holy Trinity, and God's Counsel. Each of these of course is further subdivided in a logical format. Note that in the Dutch original, God's Names came after God's Incommunicable Attributes, and the editor does not give any rational for the change.The last chapter on God's Counsel is the real gem of this work, and Bavinck's treatment of election is a gripping read, demonstrating God's love and forethought of His creatures. His treatment of the supra/infra-lapsarian debate should also be consulted by any who wish to avoid these errors.The hardback itself is of good quality and mine has held up well over its first reading, although it is rather unremarkable (in fact it looks almost identical to Berkhof's Systematic Theology also published by Banner of Truth)."},{"Title":"The doctrine of God,","review":"This book was required reading for me during a course on Systematic Theology at Reformed Theological Seminary.At the time, I was unfamiliar with Bavinck's work and thought, but have since come to appreciate and value his perspective and ministry. Bavinck (b. 1854; d. 1921) was a Dutch Reformed theologian, churchman, and statesman. He was first appointed as Professor of Dogmatics at Kampen Theological Seminary (where he began his studies) and eventually succeeded Abraham Kuyper as Professor of Theology at the Free University in Amsterdam.In The Doctrine of God, Bavinck engages this foundational aspect of Christian theology by devoting his chapters to (I) God's Incomprehensibility, (II) God's Knowability, (III) God's names, (IV) God's Incommunicable Attributes, (V) God's Communicable Attributes, (VI) The Holy Trinity, and finally to (VII) God's Counsel.His treatment of \\"The Holy Trinity\\" is worth the price of the book.If you are new to Bavinck, this is a great introduction to an important theologian. If you are a serious student of Reformed theology, this is an essential volume."},{"Title":"The doctrine of God,","review":"No theological library can afford the lacuna that would be without this volume! While one may (rightfully) opt to purchase the four volume edition of Bavinck's work, this is still the translation to always have at your elbow. All major discussions of theology are explored and opened up for the serious reader.Of particular interest is the perennial debate of supralapsarian and infralapsarian interpretations. Bavinck is without equal in both explanation and resolution.Bavinck is Reformed, yet those of other theological persuasions will find this volume to be one of the most sound orthodox books in print."},{"Title":"The Essence of COM: A Programmer's Workbook (3rd Edition)","review":"The author touts the book's simplicity and ease of use in learning COM.

Other topics are covered in a bits-and-pieces style that doesn't quite explain.I don't believe that a COM novice would get too much out of this book. Only a COM knowledgeable person could fill in the gaps that this book leaves.

This book accomplishes its goal pretty nicely."},{"Title":"Basic Endgame Strategy: Queens & Rooks (Road to Chess Mastery)","review":"The book is very brief. The fist example basic, but the other examples are moderate to very good especially the queen examples (first 80 pages). I only paid $2 plus $3.49 S&H. If you dislike notation and like explanation, this is the book for you. It uses paragraph style of writing explaining every little move, thus very few examples, but covers the title \\"queens and rooks\\" well. I'm uscf 1600 and think this is a good book for anyone 1700 or below. Its very reader friendly so even beginners should be able to follow along. I however would not pay more than $7 for this book total only because of its size not because of its content. Its 138 pages and can be read through very quickly. Based on the price I paid I would have given it 5 stars, the games on queens and pawns,, and,,, two rooks vs queen with pawns on the board was worth the $5.50 total I paid. which are covered in pages 80-138, other than the rooks and pawns pages, the other 80 pages are probably something you would find in a more complete endgame chess book. Such as, another endgame book I bought \\"improve your endgame play\\" Glenn Flear is more bang for the buck which has just as many or more queens and pawns endings and rooks and pawns endings, but with much less text explaining and doesn't have two rooks & pawns vs queen & pawns section. Rooks and Queens are common to be the last pieces on the board, so this book should quickly cover and improve your game. I'm sure there are better books out there, but not at this price.

So it was the German recipes of the mid-1920s that my Oma passed on to my mother, and my mother to us.Thus, I can verify that some of the recipes in this cookbook are classic, old German recipes. Whether or not the other recipes are \\"modern\\" German cooking, I'm not sure. Also, as with all ethnic cooking, many recipes passed down in families have regional variations. This cookbook lists many variations on common dishes, and I've often been able to find my grandmother's version of a dish in one of the variations listed for a particular recipe.Virtually all of the recipes for roasted, stuffed poultries (duck, chicken, goose) are the same as my grandmother made them, or have variations listed that are the same. The pork, beef (Rouladen!), and organ recipes (tongue!) are also mainly as my grandmother made them. Even the recipes I hated as a child--or still hate!-- such as Eintopf (all the vegetables you hate in one watery soup!), are here in all their authentically horrible glory.Some of the recipes in this book call for prepared packets such as the Dr. Oetker prepared mixes or packets. My grandmother used some of Dr. Oetker's prepared mixes (such as the Rote Gruetze, Vanilla Sugar, Sahnesteif). However, the overwhelming majority of the recipes -- I'd say 98-99% -- in here call for nothing but good quality meat and produce.Most or all of the traditional meat recipes and sauces (gravies made from various broths or roast drippings) have some or all ingredients in common with our German family recipes. Same with dumplings, pancakes, noodles (Spaetzle!), and many of the different ways of preparing potatoes and other vegetables (such as cabbage, red cabbage, cucumbers, or leeks).If you're REALLY into authentic cuisine, you might want to check old copies of the magazine \\"Meine Familie und Ich\\" for German recipes. My grandmother subscribed to that magazine for various years in the late 60s and 70s (and to Amerika Woche, of course). Not sure where you'd get them if they aren't already in your family, but libraries might have them. (Of course, the magazine and its recipes are in German, so it helps if you know a little German...)A couple things to note: this cookbook is in British English, not American English. There are translation tables for some US versions of British terms on the insides of the front and back covers. There are also metric to imperial standard conversion tables as well (unless you are lucky enough to have cups with metric AND imperial measures, which I have and inherited from my German grandmother!).Another great thing about this cookbook are the many tips and tricks listed about cooking, mixing, whipping, browning, larding, and food/produce quality-- for example, how to tell if eggs are fresh, a few days old, or a few *weeks* old. The method described on page 260 (floating the eggs in a bowl of water and seeing how they float -- or don't) is exactly how my grandmother taught my mother, and how my mother taught us.You'll also find valuable tidbits on making sauces, reductions, gravies, drippings, jus, or even how to make your own mayonnaise. If you didn't grow up learning these from your own mother, the methods listed may seem like too much work. But if you love good food, the time and effort involved can make the difference between a good-tasting dish and a GREAT-tasting dish.

Lit by a spark but rooted in the region's worst drought on record, the summer of 2002's Missionary Ridge Fire transformed Southwest Colorado, burning 57 homes and 70,085 acres, leaving a bitter legacy of debris flows and showcasing La Plata County's greatest strength--community. &quot;Fire in the Sky&quot; documents the region's biggest fire in words, maps and dozens of color photographs by the staff of The Durango Herald. The book goes beyond the fire to look at its roots in the drought. The effects of catastrophic wildfires don't end when the flames are out and the book documents the floods and debris flows that follow a large scale fire. It looks at recovery efforts, and it discusses prevention. ... The 117 page volume uses text, 142 photographs (by Jerry McBride, Nancy Richmond and Dustin Bradford) and several maps (by Keith Alewine) to tell the story of the 39-day blaze. The book is in its second printing: The first printing sold out. ... No question I'm biased, but this is a thorough account of a Western wildfire that contributes to general knowledge of the crisis facing our forests and the debate about how to fix it."},{"Title":"The Aggressive Adolescent: Clinical and Forensic Issues","review":"Davis DL. The aggressive adolescent. Binghamton, New York: Haworth Press, 2000, 158 pages,This book is written by a clinical psychologist with many years of experience within the Ohio State mental health, rehabilitation and corrections system. It is easely read, full of illustrative case stories with treatment interventions and valuable information for the professional working with aggressive adolescents. The book presents statistics about juvenile violence and crime in American society, developmental theories on adolescent violence, assessment and treatment options. The inserted stories facilitates the understanding. The last chapter gives advice on how \\"to find a good mechanic\\". Many of the case histories give a story of prior abuse and neglect in the life of the adolescent, who later commits violent crime or murder and preventive measures within the family and by society is therefore called for. The Aggressive Adolescent is written in down to earth language. I especially liked the inclusion of information about the author and a reader friendly index, items that often times are missing in otherwise good books. I can therefore recommend the book for professionals working with aggressive, violent or crime prone adolescents.Professor Joav Merrick, MD, DMSc Medical Director, Division for the Mentally Retarded, Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs, Box 1260, IL-91012 Jerusalem, Israel; Email: jmerrick@aquanet.co.il"},{"Title":"The Aggressive Adolescent: Clinical and Forensic Issues","review":"THIS BOOK WAS VERY HARD TO UNDERSTAND BUT THAT MIGHT MEAN I NEED TO BACK TO SCHOOL FOR A WHILE.

The whore represents evil Babylon (the i.e.Roman empire), while the bride represents the New Jerusalem.She traces the literary imagery of Revelation to the Old Testament and Greek and Roman wisdom traditions. In the wisdom tradition, the two woman motif (topos) invites the reader/hearer to choose between the good woman of wisdom and the bad woman of licentiousness. The reader of Revelation is also given a choice - choose the evil woman or choose the good woman.This book does a very good job at discussing the good woman/bad woman theme of Revelation.After reading this book, I definately choose New Jerusalem. down with the evil emprire of greed and injustice!"},{"Title":"How to Use Microsoft Windows(R) XP (2nd Edition) (Visually in Full Color)","review":"This book meets the needs of both the new user wanting to learn the basics and the experienced user needing to know the new features in this completely redesigned Windows operating system.

This book answers sooooo many questions. Just what *exactly* happened to Sinclair, or to his fiance, Cathryn Sakai? How have the Vorlons been involved?

Even if it did not answer questions many of us have been asking that the TV show has not answered, the writing is crisp, flows well, and there are no inconsistencies with the TV universe - it would still be worthwhile.

As Ambassador Kosh might say, the avalanche had just started. After eating, I got home and continued reading. By the end of the first chapter, I was intrigued; by the third, I was hooked. The other books could wait.&quot;To Dream in the City of Sorrows&quot; is the jigsaw puzzle piece you've been looking for.

I'd always been fascinated by the mysterious paladins of Babylon 5, and felt cheated when Crusade didn't feature them at all.But it's a real cheat that the novel ends so soon! There's a wealth of material that could be covered here. I felt the training of the Rangers could have been a little more in depth. But that's a minor complaint.I sincerely hope she plans a sequel, perhaps detailing the life of Valen, and the early days of the Rangers?

We get to see more clearly the difference between the two worlon embassadors Kosh and Ulkesh, and get an idea about how this difference is going to manifest in the future of the series.I can recommend this book to every Babylon 5 fan, and have to admit that after I recieved it, it was a delight to sit down and just read it from the beginning until the end!"},{"Title":"To Dream in the City of Sorrows (Babylon 5)","review":"This is a wonderfully crafted masterpirece.It helps me understand a great deal about Minbari culture and society.It also shows how valuable our humanity is to us."},{"Title":"To Dream in the City of Sorrows (Babylon 5)","review":"When the second season of Babylon 5 primiered on television, viewers were shocked to learn that Commander Jeffrey Sinclair (played by Michael O'Hare) was permanently reassigned from Babylon 5 and became the first Earth ambassador to the planet Minbar. Since then one question kept bugging every B5 fan, &quot;What happened to Commander Sinclair during his two years tenure on planet Minbar?&quot; That question was partially answered towards the end of the third season when he made a memorable and final appearance in the outstanding two-part episode entitled, &quot;War Without End&quot;. This was one of the most highly anticipated episodes because it is where he set out to fulfil his important destiny. However, this book goes into further details on how Sinclair adjusted to life on Minbar while dealing with the double burden roles of ambassador and leader of the Rangers. As ambassador, Sinclair blends into the Minbari lifestyle and learns everything he can about their customs and society while gaining some new friends (and enemies) in the process. But he faces a bigger challenge as the leader of the Rangers when an alien race known as the Shadows threatens the galaxy with its super high tech ships and weapons, in an attempt to cleanse the universe of anyone is not like them.The book is a fascinating read because it immerses the reader on the insights of Minbari life, culture, religion, philosophy, and most importantly, the internal workings of the political system structure of the Minbari Federation government. One of the most interesting and likable characters is Marcus Cole, a ranger under Sinclair's command. He plays a central role in the story who begins to admire Sinclair and remains very loyal to him. The author, Kathryn M. Drennan (the wife of B5 creator J. Michael Straczynski) writes in an eloquent and precise manner in which the characters resemble their counterparts on the show. Unlike the Star Trek novels, all the Babylon 5 books are canon and this one is no exception. Ms. Drennan constantly stresses the horrid and harsh realities of war and that it is not a viable solution. The only salvation is the pursue of peace at all cost. It's a story about a man who finds his true self amidst an alien world and is force to choose between his lover and duty. Hence, Sinclair begins to truly understand the awful truth of what it means to be a real leader. You'll enjoy this book even if you're not a B5 fan. A must read."},{"Title":"To Dream in the City of Sorrows (Babylon 5)","review":"I just finished &quot;To Dream in the City of Sorrows&quot; last night, and I must say, I think that, of the nine books I've read in this series, this one is the best.I have to thank my friend Travis for introducing me to the TV series. I have been reading the novels, and have had reactions ranging from &quot;it was okay&quot; to &quot;yuck!&quot;The biggest problem that I've had with the novels to date is that a lot of times, the characters act in ways that I find aren't consistent with their behaviors in the TV series. In this book, though, the characters behave as I'd expect them to.Plus, this book explains a lot of the back story stuff that I didn't quite understand from the series.A great read!"},{"Title":"To Dream in the City of Sorrows (Babylon 5)","review":"This is a great book. I usually do not read tie-in books for Sci-Fi series, out of the experience of past disappointments. &quot;To Dream in the City of Sorrows,&quot; however, is a fabulous book. It ties up so much from the series and answers so many unanswered questions (for example, exactly how DID Sinclair know who Lucy and Ethel were?!). It also makes me remember how much I miss Michael O'Hare's portrayal of Jeffrey Sinclair from Season 1 -- Kathrynn Drennan has captured Sinclair (and O'Hare as Sinclair) perfectly, as well as the characters of Marcus Cole and Catherine Sakai.If you fell in love with &quot;Babylon 5,&quot; you'll love this book. It is the missing piece to the puzzle."},{"Title":"To Dream in the City of Sorrows (Babylon 5)","review":"This was good \\"filler\\" material for the time between Sinclair leaving the station and his assumption of his destiny. And it was nice to explain what happened to his girlfriend, even if that was not ultimately satisfying.But there was little that could not be guessed at, and the action seemed tacked on in some respects. There were some nice moments with Sinclair and his background, but the Mimbari moments seemed out of joint.As a big fan of the series, it was very nice reading. As someone hoping for more, it was barely satisfying reading."},{"Title":"To Dream in the City of Sorrows (Babylon 5)","review":"I'm a big fan of Babylon 5, even took the time to put together my own model Starfurry. Got the pencil sharpeners for my office, taped the episodes, watched the repeats, etc. And so, finding a novel by JMS's own wife filling in the gaps of Sinclair's life seemed great... And then I read it. Terrible. Within a few pages I realized this ranks right up there with the long list of horribly-written Star Trek books. And my major complaint is with the writing. The style is very tedious. Sorry, Babylon fans, skip this book! My other complaint is the sheer lack of action. Chapter after chapter goes by while NOTHING happens. Sinclair looks at the statue of Valen. Sinclair sits around. Sinclair seems to be in charge of high-tech military training yet he doesn't interact with the students. Right up to the ending, which wasn't a surprise, seemed a long drawn-out, boring experience. Avoid, avoid, avoid."},{"Title":"To Dream in the City of Sorrows (Babylon 5)","review":"A breathtaking exploration of the time Jeffrey Sinclair spent on Minbar as Ambassador. Rivetting from page one and leaves you breathless with anticipation. Poingant and heartrending in parts as special characters face ordeals. As a writer too, I commend Ms. Drennan for the way she spun this tale. A story that is seared into my mind and heart. If you haven't already done so ... READ THE BOOK!"},{"Title":"To Dream in the City of Sorrows (Babylon 5)","review":"This is my favorite Babylon 5 book. It's well written and has a great plot. My favorite episodes were War Without End parts one and two and the rest of season 1. This book ties in well with those episodes. I only wish I could read more about Valen after he goes back in time. This is the only Babylon 5 book that has brought me to tears. A very good book for any season 1 or 3 fan."},{"Title":"To Dream in the City of Sorrows (Babylon 5)","review":"Not only does this book answer all the questions you see in all the other reviews, but it has one important thing that none of the other B5 books has: Joe M. Straczynski's seal of approval. He wrote the forward and he states &quot;While most of the Dell books to date have contained some elements that are considered canon, this is the very first one that is considered canonical in every small detail....[it] should be considered as authentic as any episode in the regular series.&quot;So even if you haven't read any of the other B5 books, you MUST read this one if you're a TRUE Bab-o-Phile. :)Also, this is the author's first novel. I've already instructed Amazon.com's excellent EYES server to let me know the SECOND she produces another one. She's quite good."},{"Title":"To Dream in the City of Sorrows (Babylon 5)","review":"A very involved story about the creation of the Rangers, and the preceding events. We get to see Marcus Cole and his brother, and how they are brought together only to be tragically separated. Catharine Sakai continues her work as a surveyer while Jeffrey Sinclair finds out his promotion was something else he expected. Of course a lot more happens, but you can read about it yourself.The events in the book are mainly taking place during the time from &quot;Chrysalis&quot; upto &quot;Matters of Honor&quot;. While the events are happening on Minbar (revealing a lot of the Minbari culture), they seemlessly fit into the 'grand' picture happening on Babylon 5 simultaneously.Although in style different ('traditional' written prose style) than the previous book Personal Agendas (with its 'filmy' atmosphere), the very involved story, totally built on 'actual' events, keeps the interest up very well and there is nothing unimportant you could leave out.With its 337 pages the book is more than worth its price. There is also a 4-page introduction to the book by jms."},{"Title":"To Dream in the City of Sorrows (Babylon 5)","review":"To be perfectly frank, I cannot help wondering whether the fifty people who rated this book five stars and called it the best they'd ever read, read the same book as I did.I had to force myself to even finish it, and I've always liked Sinclair and the resolution of his arc in 'War Without End'. The story offers neither surprises nor tension, the romantic subplot seems forced, even distracting, as far as Sinclair's character development is concerned. What's more, for me Drennan's take on the events on Minbar doesn't even satisfactory fill the blank between the end of S1 and Sinclair's reappearance in S3; rather it makes it harder to connect the Sinclair at the end of the book with the man in 'War Without End'.The style is flat and uninspired, the story-telling lacks B5's trademark subtlety, twists and emotional impact: every thought and emotion is spelled out in excruciating detail; the repetitions are endless: e.g., Sinclair's \\"the arrow that springs from the bow\\" metaphor is horribly overused in a way that doesn't even make sense.MJS describes his wife as 'relentlessly logical' in his introduction, he also mentions 'late-night conversations, too many to number'. One wonders if the book might not have been better if its author had not been in such close association with B5's creator and had focused a little more on story-telling instead of attempting to logically tie up each and every loose thread.If not for the fact that this is Drennan's first novel, it would have been one star."},{"Title":"To Dream in the City of Sorrows (Babylon 5)","review":"Okay, I'm a Babylon 5 fan, and when I REALLY delight in something, I try and &quot;ingest&quot; everything about it that I can, so I have read all of the Bab 5 novels - however this is the first one that was enjoyable not only as a tie-in but as a well written piece of science fiction. This is an excellent book and I'm afraid, in comparison, the remaining novels suffer. Drennan has the laudable ability to get inside her characters' minds, to mimic their speech patterns and to make them come alive for the readers. I always wondered how Sinclair felt, being yanked off Babylon 5 and sent to Mimbar... I need wonder no more. Almost all the loose threads are tied up here, from the larger questions surrounding Sinclair and the Rangers to tantalizing tidbits concerning just how Marcus might have managed to get bacon for Susan and from whence came that obscure reference to &quot;Lucy and Ethel.&quot; It is small jewels like these that make this book a treasure to read. Only two complaints. One, the book tries to cover too much in one novel. Although Drennan does a superb job of packing in the information, the story could have been stretched out over two or three novels, giving us more to satiate our need for good Babylon 5 fiction! And second, there is a short description of Sheridan's behavior during his time in the Academy which I found out of character. He never struck me as the type to relentlessly torment someone over a mishap, even in the name of &quot;tradition,&quot; but this is a very small grievance in light of the rest of this masterful work. Buy it. Read it. And ENJOY! May we hear from Drennan again!"},{"Title":"To Dream in the City of Sorrows (Babylon 5)","review":"I've really enjoyed reading this book, and it fills some holes and tells a bunch of new stuff about how the rangers made their comeback, about Sinclair as their leader and Marcus.every true fan of Babylon 5 will enjoy this one."},{"Title":"To Dream in the City of Sorrows (Babylon 5)","review":"I loved this book.

Catherine's and Marcus' solo exploits are the more interesting chapters. One wonders if the author felt a bit hamstrung with the Sinclair narrative of dull, planet-bound politics with the implacable and ritual-obsessed Mimbari, all within a time frame too well-circumscribed by events in the television series. Still, its a useful and informative side-story for fans of the SciFi show. Sinclair and Sakai's relationship is far more real and engaging, however brief a glimpse we get, then that of Sheridan and Delenn."},{"Title":"To Dream in the City of Sorrows (Babylon 5)","review":"To Dream in the City of Sorrows is the last of the original nine novels and aims to fill the gaps vis-&agrave;-vis Commander Jeffrey Sinclair's departure from Babylon 5 for Earth followed by his transfer to Minbar as Earth's ambassador and the developments thereafter. The novel focuses on the stories of mainly three characters: Ambassador Jeffrey Sinclair, Catherine Sakai, and Marcus Cole.Kathryn Drennan makes use of existing B5 plots and subplots ranging from President Santiago's mysterious death and President Clark's changes in foreign policy, to Draal and the machine on Epsilon 3, to Minbari caste conflict/politics, and to the Centauri-Narn War and the coming of Shadows, among others.The book is very well written and presented, and the reader feels that they are watching a B5 feature film.The amount of information regarding the B5 universe included in To Dream in the City of Sorrows greatly surpasses that of the first eight novels combined (even though Clark's Law was really the only one that made any significant contribution.)The book starts off incredibly well, immediately catching the reader's interest and attention, and holding on to it until the very end.Throughout the novel, Kathryn Drennan brings to the forefront characters that we have come to know and love in a way that does not sway from accuracy and additionally introduces new interesting characters.The book does an excellent job of providing information on Minbar and Minbari culture and civilization e.g. that \\"[t]he Minbari day was twenty hours and forty-seven minutes long,\\" (p.9) that \\"... the Minbari believed sleeping in the horizontal was tempting death,\\" (p.28) and that when dealing with Minbari caste dialects, \\"[i]t was far too easy to say the wrong thing to the wrong person in the wrong grammatical way in the religious-caste dialect, and thereby commit a faux pas or an interstellar incident.\\" (p.12)Chapter 6 gives us information on the mineral known as Q-40, used in constructing jump gates, and on pages 97-98 Kathryn Drennan describes the history of jump gates, while on pages 94-95 the reader gets a good description of the symptoms associated with hyperspace travel (HST) syndrome.Moreover, in Chapter 7 the author presents us with some very interesting information on the Shadows.In addition, on page 249, Kathryn Drennan provides detailed answers to questions such as \\"What is a Ranger,\\" and \\"What is a Ranger's mission.\\"Finally, on page 23, the author gives a very good and accurate description of the ideal military man: \\"Sinclair was a military man; had been all his life, as his father before him. When a superior gave a lawful and moral order, a military man did his damnedest to carry it out to the best of his ability. He did not have to like the order. He didn't have to agree with the reasons behind the order.\\"In short, with the main series over and as we wait to hopefully see some more (and much better) Lost Tales or another B5 spinoff, thank goodness for the novels. More novels please..."},{"Title":"To Dream in the City of Sorrows (Babylon 5)","review":"This is one of the best books I have read and easily the best Babylon 5 book. It not only ties in what happens to Sinclair after he leaves Bablyon 5, but you feel like you get to know the characters personally as you read through the novel. There is only one question that remains unanswered for me, what is the rest of the story bewteen Sinclair/Valen. If you can only read one Babylon 5 novel, To Dream In The City Of Sorrows is the one to read."},{"Title":"To Dream in the City of Sorrows (Babylon 5)","review":"This is a must-read for any fans of Babylon 5 who want to understand what happened to Commander Sinclair after he left the Babylon 5 station. It does an excellent job of providing supplemental information to the television series, tying in very nicely with it (I can't think of any contradictions between the series and the book)."},{"Title":"To Dream in the City of Sorrows (Babylon 5)","review":"As many readers of this series of books re: the television series may be interested in gleaning all the knowledge they can re: the evolution of their favorite characters, this book will most definitely be helpful to bring clarity to the &quot;mystery&quot; surrounding Commander Jeffrey Sinclair. This story arc, is scheduled over a five year period, so all is not revealed to the viewers but given out piecemeal in small installments. However, Ms. Drennnan, who also wrote some of the TV scripts, has explored the background of former Babylon 5 Commander, Jeffrey Sinclair and given us more information as to what happened to this character in this novel. At first, one may have thought that Commander Sinclair just vanished from Babylon 5 with some excuse alluded to that he was reassigned to Earth, and Sheridan is brought in to replace him. However, we see that Sinclair is reassigned as an Ambassador to the world of Minbar (and there are several comical scenes with him trying to reconfigure the bed from the traditional 45 degree Minbari angle to lie flat, as humans require). We learn more of the &quot;elusive&quot; RANGERS (a legendary Minbari warrior group), and how he becomes their leader and then ultimately the &quot;Entil'Zha&quot; of the Anla shok. We are given some insight into his relationship with Catherine Sakai and Marcus Cole as well. This is truly for the Babylon 5 Fan who hungers for more information and needs to have his curiosity satisifed through this wonderfully informative novel. I truly enjoyed learning more about Commander Sinclair (and the &quot;Rangers&quot;) , and would love to know more about the VALEN/Babylon 4 connection of being transported back through time thousands of years to assist the Minbari against the Shadows. A terrific and enthralling read and a must for all B5 fans!"},{"Title":"To Dream in the City of Sorrows (Babylon 5)","review":"&quot;To Dream in the City of Sorrows&quot; is an excellent tie-in to the B5 universe, tying off those loose ends that bothered me from the end of Season One and the middle of Season Three, Sinclair's dismissal from the station through his return in War Without End, AND what happened to Catherine Sakai, and Marcus Cole's initial involement with the Anla'shok. And Drennan ties in the comic books as well! JMS intros this book saying that it is to be considered B5 canon. If the Great Maker says so, then any fan of the show (passing or deeply involved) should sit down and read this one."},{"Title":"To Dream in the City of Sorrows (Babylon 5)","review":"With &quot;To Dream in the City of Sorrows,&quot; Kathryn Drennan has written the best of the B5 novels. Her unparalleled access to J. Michael Straczynski,the creator of the B5 universe (they're married), shows in the amount of interesting detail and gap filling that Drennan weaves into this tale of triumph and tragedy. This would have made an excellent episode of the television series."},{"Title":"To Dream in the City of Sorrows (Babylon 5)","review":"This book fills in the gap that was left after Commander Sinclair's abrupt departure. It fleshes out the story concerning the Rangers and shows how Sinclair becomes the Entil'Za. I highly recommend this book to anyone who remotely likes B5."},{"Title":"To Dream in the City of Sorrows (Babylon 5)","review":"And this book like the series it self is the future.This is by far the best Babylon 5 book Ive read to date.The characters in the book are faithfull to jms completely!!!A MUST for Sinclair Fans such as my self.Good also for Marcus Fans .It answered alot of questions for me.Raised a couple as well.I wish Kathryn M Drennan would write some more books (especially about Jeffrey David Sinclair),Joe where were you hiding her all this time?? Anyone who watches the show......In Valens name you MUST READ THIS BOOK !!!!! Anla_Shok"},{"Title":"To Dream in the City of Sorrows (Babylon 5)","review":"I simply loved this book. I thought it was wonderful. For me, it really cleared up a lot of the Babylon 5 story for me. There were things I didn't know and this book gave me a great deal of backstory. I always wondered what the Rangers reasons for doing things were and now I know very clearly that it is their dedication to the preservation of life. I truly enjoyed reading this book and was very sad when I had finished it."},{"Title":"To Dream in the City of Sorrows (Babylon 5)","review":"An excellent read for Babylon 5 fans which answers many open questions from the TV series. The only thing missing is a discussion of how Sinclair actually discovers his destiny and how that knowledge affects him in the present."},{"Title":"To Dream in the City of Sorrows (Babylon 5)","review":"Simply the best book covering the Babylon 5 story arc. Yes, it answers many questions, but also asks a few more such as: How did Sinclair find Catherine in the past? and Where are they now? All we need now is a book covering Sinclair's return to Minbar 1000 years ago..... We live for The One."},{"Title":"To Dream in the City of Sorrows (Babylon 5)","review":"This was an incredible book. Fitting seamlessly into the Babylon 5 story arc, it tells the story of Jeffery Sinclair's first days as Earth's new ambassador to the Minbari, and how he came to be leader of the Rangers and later Entil'Zha. Plus, it also reveals how Marcus Cole became a ranger and what happened to Catherine Sakai.I really liked how there were references and tie-ins to the stories in the B5 comic books produced by DC, and this book answers a lot of questions about them as well. Slight spoiler: In fact, after reading this book, you'll have an idea as to what Valen meant in his final message found aboard Babylon 4 in DC's mini-series &quot;In Valen's Name&quot;.So if you're a Babylon 5 fan, and you haven't read this book yet, do it. Now. Strongly recommended."},{"Title":"To Dream in the City of Sorrows (Babylon 5)","review":"One of the most difficult problems faced by authors writing books based on television shows is being able to truely capture the essence of that show and it's charactors. Although the story may be wonderfully written, there are many times when I read these type of books where I really don't feel like these are the same charactors I have come to know and love on the TV show. Kathrynn Drennan has the wonderfully rare gift of being truely able to capture the essences of both the show itself and the charactors therein. &quot;To Dream in the City of Sorrows&quot; focuses on what happened to Commander Sinclair after he was assigned to Minbar, as well as his engagement to Catherine Sakai. It also shows us how Marcus Cole came to join the Rangers. This book is excellently written and you can truely believe you are reading about these same charactors. The story answered many questions but also asked just enough to make you want more! I would love to see Ms. Drennan write a follow-up book involving Babylon 4 and Sinclair's transformation to Valen."},{"Title":"To Dream in the City of Sorrows (Babylon 5)","review":"This book is based on the television series Babylon 5 and it focuses on what happened to Commander Sinclair after he was relocated to Minbar.It also covers what became of his fiance, Catherine Sakai and how Marcus Cole joined the rangers.This book should be required reading for every Babylon 5 fan. It answers a lot of questions fans may have about Sinclair but it's also really well written. You can tell the author did her homework. Sinclair is completely in character and the nuances of Minbari society are explained even better than on the show. Marcus fans may be a bit disappointed since the bulk of the book focuses on Sinclair but I'm sure they'll find something to like. If this book is any indication of the quality of the other Babylon 5 books then I hope they come back into print quickly."},{"Title":"To Dream in the City of Sorrows (Babylon 5)","review":"The &quot;Babylon 5&quot; series, originally printed by Dell, are slowly finding their way back into print and this is one of the best--if not the best of the lot--with its explanantion of what happened to Jeffrey Sinclair when he was relieved as the Commander of B5 until his reappearances in later seasons--appearances which, take it from a loyal viewer, were totally unexpected. As stated by many, the book fills the gaps left by the TV series about the Rangers and how they were developed and several other points.Aside from all this, the book is a fast, solid reading experience that allows the reader to realize, apart from his Minbari soul, why Commander/Ambassador Sinclair was willing to give up so much to follow his destiny. Because it acts as a filler, many readers might be lost in the mythos of the series and so it might not be the best book to begin a novice journey into the B5 world (hence only a 4-star rating). Apart from this, the book is a resounding success!"},{"Title":"To Dream in the City of Sorrows (Babylon 5)","review":"Did you ever wonder what happened to Commander Jeffery Sinclair and his fianc&eacute; Catherine Sakai after Sinclair left the TV series at the end of first season, and before he returned in 3rd season?This book, which is fully endorsed by J Michael Straczynski, (he says you should consider this a missing episode) fills in those blanks. We see how Sinclair moves from being an unwanted (by Earth) Ambassador to Minbar to becoming a figure of prophesy and head of the Rangers on Minbar and how Catherine becomes the lynchpin for many later actions and why Marcus Cole joined the rangers.Enjoyable and well written this book is an essential read for any fan of the series who is curious about the story of Sinclair and his links to Valen. That it has been re-printed in time to be read in conjunction with the B5 DVD's is fortunate for us who missed it the first time round."},{"Title":"To Dream in the City of Sorrows (Babylon 5)","review":"I've got a little book here for you. It's called &quot;To Dream in the City of Sorrows&quot;, based on one of the best television shows around. Written by the show's creator's wife (got that?), this is NOT a case of nepotism. There is a very good reason series creator J. Michael Straczynski allowed this book to be published, and that is that this book is very good.For those that have not seen Babylon 5, this is a very good example of the quality of writing that is used in the show. It is a stand-alone story that is told in such a way that you don't have to have seen the show to understand it. It is a story about a man who is thrust into a situation that he had no knowledge or control of. It is a story about that same man who must walk a very thin line between friends who would be adversaries, and adversaries who would be friends: on the one side, the mysterious Shadows who are spreading war and death wherever they go; on the other, the Minbari who massacred his friends in the Earth-Minbari war ten years ago, and the Vorlons, who appear to have a hidden agenda. In the middle stand those few humans and Minbari that are called the Rangers and who are the only hope for victory.It is NOT a story about war and destruction, but rather a story about what happens when war and destruction are forced upon us, when we have no way to go but forward, when we have no choice but to stand ground and fight.Entil'Zha Veni"},{"Title":"To Dream in the City of Sorrows (Babylon 5)","review":"When the second season of Babylon 5 premiered on television, viewers were shocked to learn that Commander Jeffrey Sinclair (played by Michael O'Hare) was permanently reassigned from Babylon 5 and became the first Earth ambassador to the planet Minbar. Since then one question kept bugging every B5 fan: &quot;What happened to Commander Sinclair during his two years tenure on planet Minbar?&quot; That question was partially answered towards the end of the third season when he made a memorable and final appearance in the outstanding two-part episode entitled, &quot;War Without End&quot;. This was one of the most highly anticipated episodes because it is where he set out to fulfil his important destiny. However, this book goes into further details on how Sinclair adjusted to life on Minbar while dealing with the double burden roles of ambassador and leader of the Rangers. As ambassador, Sinclair blends into the Minbari lifestyle and learns everything he can about their customs and society while gaining some new friends (and enemies) in the process. But he faces a bigger challenge as the leader of the Rangers when an alien race known as the Shadows threatens the galaxy with its super high tech ships and weapons, in an attempt to cleanse the universe of anyone not like them.The book is a fascinating read because it immerses the reader on the insights of Minbari life, culture, religion, philosophy, and most importantly, the internal workings of the political system structure of the Minbari Federation government. One of the most interesting and likable characters is Marcus Cole, a ranger under Sinclair's command. He plays a central role in the story as a loyal admirer of Sinclair. The author, Kathryn M. Drennan (the wife of B5 creator J. Michael Straczynski) writes in an eloquent and precise manner in which the characters resemble their counterparts on the show. Unlike the Star Trek novels, all the Babylon 5 books are canon and this one is no exception. Ms. Drennan constantly stresses the horrid and harsh realities of war as a not a viable solution. The only salvation is to pursue peace at all cost. This is a story about a man who finds his true self amidst an alien world and is forced to choose between his lover and duty. Hence, Sinclair begins to truly understand what it means to be a real leader. You'll enjoy this book even if you're not a B5 fan. A must read."},{"Title":"To Dream in the City of Sorrows (Babylon 5)","review":"A book worthy of the series Babylon 5, the styling fits perfectly into the series.

Michael Straczynski describes this book as &quot;a remarkable achievement . . . a breathtaking accomplishment&quot;. In fairness, however, let's remember that the novel was written by his wife about his universe!Drennan does a very good job of imagining the difficulties of Sinclair's transition from Babylon 5 commander to Earth ambassador to Entil'zha. She also fills in Marcus Cole's backstory. The problem with this type of novel is that, being backstory of familiar characters, it's very difficult to generate suspense. Any Fiver reading this novel already knows the outcome of the Shadow attack on the Arisia mining colony, for instance.However, Drennan does make Sinclair an interesting and compelling character (much more so than I found him onscreen). Other characters don't fare so well. Marcus' whole life up to his being on Arisia is summarized in a single page; his interactions with his brother William are just interesting enough to make you want a little more depth.The plot is serviceable, most interesting when it focuses on Sinclair; there's some quiet humor as he tries to adjust to life on Minbar. Action sequences are good, and we finally learn the details of the attack on Arisia and where Sinclair got that scar on his face. The climactic mission, however, lacks punch. Most dedicated Fivers will be able to predict its outcome.The prose style is competent, but pedestrian; I was ready to scream when &quot;the Minbari penchant for the half-truth&quot; was alluded to for the umpteenth time.These caveats aside, this is an enjoyable book for the &quot;Bab5&quot; fan (and also--alas!--the only one likely to feature Marcus Cole as a character). It's considered canonical for the series and does fulfill its mission of rounding out Jeffrey Sinclair's story. A &quot;breathtaking accomplishment&quot; it's not.

The novel succeeds in doing what it was intended to, and leaves the reader wanting more, as good writing should.

This story has all the right mix of fun, sex, heart wrenching insecurity, and heartwarming insights."},{"Title":"The Tormented","review":"The novel takes place in the 1920's - 1930's, and the main character, Zona, is astoundingly naive, as I suppose some young women were at that time. Still, the story of a woman's struggle with the dreaded problem of nymphomania seems quite dated.The story is sensational - affairs with married men, adultery, troubles with a corrupt vice squad, and a stint in a women's prison. I hope it is not an accurate picture of its issues at that time, because Zona truly is hopelessly lost and 'tormented.' Would have made a good pre-code women's melodrama, possibly with a young Joan Crawford."},{"Title":"The Tormented","review":"The Tormented one in Theodore Pratt's novel of the same name is Zona Dodd, a woman who suffers from nymphomania. The story follows the progression of her illness from her first sexual experience with her high school crush (her One True Love, in her opinion) to the point when she is so deeply disturbed that she is driven to murder.From the opening page, the reader is drawn into the story. We are quoted a newspaper article about a man whose body was found slumped over the vanity in the bedroom of one Frances Carver, dead of strychnine poisoning. The whole house had been wiped clean of fingerprints, and Ms Carver had fled the scene. To add to the skeevy factor, the story goes on to say that Frances was living in the apartment with the dead body for at least a week. Wow.From these auspicious beginnings, the reader is taken nine years back in time, from where the story which lead to the poisoning is told in all its prurient details. Well, maybe not all its prurient details-- this book was written in 1950, thus it contains many an ellipsis.It's hard to tell how this book is meant to be taken; whether it is deadpan or dead serious, so to speak. It is pretty campy and lurid, what with some of the subjects it covers, e.g. suicide, abortion, lesbians in prison, prostitution. Dr.Richard Hoffmann says this book is \\"an authentic picture of nymphomania... an enlightening, even educational experience\\". If Dr. Hoffmann says so, who am I to argue?While this book is nothing like Pratt's comic novel about satyriasis (Handsome, one of my top 10 books of all time), it is halfway as good in its own way. That's pretty darn good, considering how high I rate 'Handsome'! Snatch up a copy if you can find one."},{"Title":"Antigone","review":"Ok, I'm french and I'm VERY surprised AMAZON sells some of our books...

It contains hidden symbols to, at the time, both get the book past the censors and give the french audience moral and courage to stand up to the Nazi's and follow their beliefs. The characters are adapted slightly to fit his version, ie Tieresas is left out and a nurse is introduced. He also had to adapt the personalities of the characters, for instance Antigone develops a whiny habit, and Creon is seen as a \\"good guy\\". This was also done in order to get the play by the sensors. It is a well-written play with rounder characters than the original. This version would be better read after reading the original."},{"Title":"Antigone","review":"This is a modern version of Antigone that helps students relate the themes of the original version to modern times. The concepts of a higher law than man's is certainly expressed, but more importantly, the determination of the few and the role of Haemon are stressed.

It is an adaptation of the Greek play &quot;Antigone,&quot; by Sophocles, written here by a French existentialist author and playwright.

I got my frayed copy from a garage sale and have replaced it through Amazon so it will last longer. Rev. Dawley is a prominent figure in the Anglican church and Chapters in Church History is the story of the formation of the church from the very beginning all the way through to the founding of the Anglican Church and its offshoots in America. This is like sitting down with a grandfather who is interesting to listen to. He is very comfortable with his subject and makes writing history and making it interesting look easy.He covers a lot of topics I have never seen handled before - the schisms in the early church over the Gnostic beliefs, the schism over apostates, the various councils and how the Creeds got started (like the Nicene Creed),the move of the Catholic church to Avignon, the drowning of the Anabaptists, and the beginnings of other protestant religions like the Wesley's involvement with the Moravians and how his followers came to be called Methodists. He also goes into depth to explain how the Anglican church derives it authority and how that was communicated to the Americas in the Episcopal tradition. It was the first time I understood the concept of the eucharist.Very interesting, very informative, very good buy."},{"Title":"Chapters in church history (The Church's teaching)","review":"\\"Chapters in Church History\\" by Powel Mills Dawley is part of a series called \\"The Church's Teaching.\\" It's an excellent little historical introduction to Anglicanism that's aimed at the educated layperson, and not at the clergy or scholars. Dawley's main concern is to tell the story of Anglicanism against the broad sweep of Christian history, and the book is a very readable history of Anglicanism filled with excellent insights. In fact, it's a testimony to Dawley's skills that he was able to present as much information as he has in such a relatively small space. He has a knack for making church history simple and readable.The structure of the book is a little odd, but understandable. The first two chapters give a general history of the Church until the time of the Reformation, while Chapter 3 discusses Christianity in England in particular. Chapter 4 then covers the crisis of the Reformation, and the book concludes with Chapter 5, concerning Christianity in the modern world. While I understand that Dawley is trying to put Anglicanism into its historical context, I would have preferred that he discuss Anglican history in more detail and offer less information about the development of Christianity in general. Context is certainly necessary to understand Anglicanism, but in a relatively short book dedicated to Anglican history, more time on Anglican history would have been better.Having said this, Dawley manages to say a lot in a short space. While most of the information in \\"Chapters in Church History\\" is well-known to me as a student of Anglicanism, Dawley's book is a good starting point for someone who wants an easy historical introduction to Anglicanism. Even though Dawley is aiming at the layman, I was glad to find that some of his insights put things in a new light, even for someone already familiar with Anglicanism.While the book has limitations due to the nature of its intended audience, its size, and its date (it was published in 1950), \\"Chapters in Church History\\" makes for an enjoyable introduction to Anglican history. More advanced students have many equally excellent works available should they wish to delve deeper into Anglicanism."},{"Title":"Islam and the West: Conflict or Cooperation?","review":"On any given issue of importance, I like a broad overview so that things can be put into the proper perspective. Regarding Islam and the West, this provides that in less than 150 pages. Given the importance of future global political development, such a feat of concise and accurate explanation is remarkable.From the brief starting point of the origins of Judism, Christianity, and Islam as all decendents of Abraham - (where are we all going wrong in our God-centered beliefs?) to the effect of the Communism vs Free World since WWII mentality, the groundwork is laid to where we are now in US relations and understanding ofIslam. Yet to be determined is how the US is to effectively operate in the future to allow or enable alliances that can bring about more democratic and economic growth and stability in the Middle East, and elsewhere, where Islamic faith is a factor. Given a billion Muslims globally, there is a considerable opportunity for good mutual development in most parts of the globe.What Amin has done was provide a &quot;need to know&quot; book that should be required reading for anyone who has hopes for a more peaceful and just worldview. Otherwise, the same old issues of hatred and destruction will continue to flame. I am sure that such flaming is not what Abraham and his monotheistic decendents had in mind.Also, noted by Amin is that there has been centuries of positive and mutual cooperation among the West and Islam. His summary of how we got where we are, coming from a very reputable scholar, as Dr. Saikal is, at least has provided this reader with hope that there are avenues for solutions similar to past cultural relations that enhanced all sides.His review of different understandings and realizations of &quot;democracy&quot; in our modern world provided a clarity that would have otherwise gotten lost in specific events. The case of Iran's experiments in democracy is a case in point.Thanks, Dr. Saikal for this brief, accurate, and thought provoking book."},{"Title":"The Best of Families","review":"I read this book first many years ago and loved it. I must have lent it to someone who never returned it because I couldn't find it after offering to lend it to another friend. Glad to find it was still available. It arrived quickly, I can't wait to read it again. It is a really good book for understanding what life was like in the US, what influenced our parents and grandparents. The characters were well developed and the story line was gripping."},{"Title":"Gor #02 Outlaw of Gor","review":"\\"Outlaw of Gor\\" is the second book in John Norman's Gorean Saga. In \\"Outlaw of Gor\\", Tarl Cabot, the hero of the first novel, returns to the planet Gor to find out that the city Ko-ro-ba, which he arrived at in the first novel, has disappeared along with his beloved wife Talena. He sets out to discover why Ko-ro-ba has vanished and gets sidetracked in a quest to free the city Tharna from its tyrannical rule by the Tatrix of Tharna who is a woman.The book shows how when women are put in power they can be just as mean as men. In the first novel, the men are oppressing women, but in this novel, in the city of Tharna it is the other way around. The book also shows that some bad people can be changed into good people if they are shown what it is like to be victimized by others.\\"Outlaw of Gor\\" is a fast read just like \\"Tarnsman of Gor\\" is. It has lots of excitement and plot twists and it kept my interest."},{"Title":"Gor #02 Outlaw of Gor","review":"It is a nice progression from his first Gor novel and I intend to read everyone of them and hopefully on my Kindle..

Tarzan spoke multiple languages, and was a very Victorian kind of fellow. There was never anything improper about his conduct. This is the world of teenage male fantasy, a world where they have power, and can follow their hormones, you might say. I read this in high school. I think a movie was actually made of this. I did go on to research the history of cultures, to find out what Norman used in his pastiche, and the book is useful for that. Parents who want to keep their teenaged boys sheltered may not like this book. I have a cousin who kept his sons sheltered, even home schooled them. One of them went into the Army last year. I suspect he is in an unpleasant situation, which his life experience did not prepare him for. High school is painful for teenaged boys, escapist stuff like this is one way to escape the pain, without using addictive substances. The Dept of Justice estimates that 80% of American high school students regularly use drugs, alcohol, or both. My daughter agreed with this, for her high school. Now that is just not healthy. If you need addictions, the printed word at least doesn't cause physical damage. One outgrows this sort of thing, eventually. One moves to books likeThe Art of Chi Kung: Making the Most of Your Vital Energy;The Way of Energy: Mastering the Chinese Art of Internal Strength with Chi Kung Exercise (A Gaia Original),Path Notes of an American Ninja Master,Journey to the Ancestral Self: The Native Lifeway Guide to Living in Harmony with the Earth Mother (Bk.1),Redneck Shaman,The Tracker, andUltimate Guide to Wilderness Living: Surviving with Nothing But Your Bare Hands and What You Find in the Woods. Still, books like this made high school bearable. The basic story is our hero goes to a counter-earth, which has a culture any high school male would enjoy. It is swords, action, women, rather better than the Forgotten Worlds series my nephew enjoys, to my mind."},{"Title":"Letters to Penthouse XI: Where Your Wildest Fantasies Come True","review":"I've read every publication of Penthouse letters for the past five years, and this is just as hot and erotic as the rest of them. Whether these experiences happened or not, the writing is descriptive, sexy, and imaginative. The only reason I can't give this book a full five stars is because almost all the stories in this book are straight heterosexual with a few smatterings of bi female action thrown in...I personally like to see a little bit of the bi male action as well...but this is one collection that lacks it. Otherwise, the variety is great...swinging/swapping, clusters, and serendipity are all to be found in this erotic collection of great letters...so turn on the bedroom lights, grab this book, and let your imagination run wild with this!"},{"Title":"Letters to Penthouse XI: Where Your Wildest Fantasies Come True","review":"In the age of no internet the idea of a book of naughty stories probably went off well.

Even with this disadvantage, the book gives the reader the information needed to understand how XML works, what its potential is, and generally how to implement it. I have two negative comments:1. The book is a too cursory with emerging technologies which will be the mainstay of the technology: DOM, XSL, XSLT, SAX. These parts are critical for implementors and should have been discussed more thoroughly.2. For a book on markup, they should have gotten the table of contents marked up correctly.On the whole, an excellent book. Very readable."},{"Title":"Inside XML DTDs: Scientific and Technical","review":"The book does not focus on the &quot;Scientific and technical&quot; side (only 1/3 of the chapters). Maybe that is why the subtitle has disappeared from the cover. Chapters 1-9 and 21-24 are generalities about XML and XML-aware applications. These would have been much clearer if the authors omitted to present all these useless options such as PUBLIC identifiers. Chapters 10, 11 and annex A paraphrase the MathML specifications. The MathML specs, freely downloadable online, are unusually clear themselves so the book does not bring much. I would have liked a word about the XSIL format, an index for the CD, and a correct table of content. I understand that if the authors had taken the time to write a well focused and pedagogical text, it would have been obsolete before publishing. Yet I am still looking for a book on XML for scientists."},{"Title":"The Survivor","review":"\\"The Survivor\\" is the story of Eddie Hukov, a young Pole who served as a German infantrymen during WW2. Faced at war's end with the prospect of returning to his native Poland to face the brutality of the Soviet occupiers, he chooses to join the French Foreign Legion. From there, he soon finds himself fighting in the sweltering jungles of Vietnam during the dying years of the French occupation. He eventually leaves the Legion, ending up a civilian in Bangkok. We have a chance meeting with his future biographer, John Ehle, to thank that we know his story at all. Had it not been for that meeting, the story of Eddie Hukov would, like so many countless others who gave everything during the war, have been lost in the mists of time. An amazing book about an amazing survivor."},{"Title":"The opening of a door,: A novel","review":"I'm not sure how I ended up searching the web for information about George Davis and his novel The Opening of a Door, but I did. I learned that Davis was gay and ran with an artsy crowd and that this 1931 novel was one of the first to deal with homosexuality in a serious and honest way in American literature. So I gave it a try. First of all, let me say that it is gorgeously written with lots of marvelous phrases that are prose-poetry. I often went back to reread a sentence because it was more poetry than prose, although I suppose there should be a law that a writer cannot use the word \\"ineffable\\" more than three times in a novel. Also, this is a very serious work of art in the old-fashioned sense. The prose is often thick and difficult with lots of colons, semicolons, and dashes. This is not Hemingway-type stuff. This is well-written, superbly-crafted prose. Ruskin and Henry James would probably approve.The story is of a large family in downtown Chicago in the 1920s and what happens to them when the Grandfather dies. Although the various aunts and uncles all crowded into the family's apartment seem to receive more attention, it becomes obvious that young Edward is going to be the character with whom we are supposed to identify...or at least care about. Homosexuality is never mentioned or depicted outright, but there are so many subtle hints that only a careful reader will pick up on. Edward has an uncle Daniel who lives in San Francisco and collects Gide first editions, and that's just about all that is said about his orientation. Edward is young and is in doubt about his future. He wants to be a writer. Near the end, when he tells Daniel about a story he has written, it is quite obvious that Edward needs to break away from his current drab life and become the gay writer that nature impels him to be. Another uncle, Lincoln, seems to have a dark secret that his wife knows about and we often get his drunken rages about marriage. I got the feeling that Lincoln is a closeted gay; hence the importance of the title. Edward needs the door to be opened so that he doesn't have to live in a closet. \\"But will he manage to do it?\\" is the question.Among the little details that interested me was a boss-lady who gives Edward tickets to classical music events, and she gives him one to an opera performance starring Mary Garden. That's all we learn. I would love to know if Edward went to the opera, or if he scalped the ticket on the main steps, or if he just threw the ticket away. Another tiny moment is when he is followed by a stalker and ends up in a dark alley, where nothing really happens. Any other author would probably have gone overboard with scenes of homosexual encounters and flaming drama and frustrated longing, but everything in this novel is more subtle and suggested than openly portrayed. If you want to know how an artist depicted closeted homosexuality in 1931, please give this book a try."},{"Title":"Marketing","review":"Read it for a 400 level college course. Got an A and now a great marketing job."},{"Title":"The Five: A Novel of Jewish Life in Turn-of-the-Century Odessa","review":"Anyone who thinks they know a thing or two about the author's politics, philosophy and place in history and then reads this terrific Russian novel, written in a style that is masterful despite perhaps owing a tad too much to Turgenev, will be astonished. Jabotinsky the politician was the scorched earth irredentist uber nationalist of the Zionist movement, the founder of right wing Zionism. The Jabotinsky who wrote this rueful paean to a lost cosmopolitan, assimilated, multinational secular city-state reminiscent of New York or London is pretty much the other Jabotinsky's philosophical and political opposite. How the two could exist in the same skin is beyond me, but I guess in Russian Jewish culture its possible. I can see why Jabotinsky's followers suppressed and censored it, and why it did not get translated into English until 2002.If you have any interest in Zionism and the mideast, this is a must read. If you have any interest in Russian literature, this is a must read. If you just like family sagas, also a must read."},{"Title":"The Five: A Novel of Jewish Life in Turn-of-the-Century Odessa","review":"I assume that for one to properly appreciate this roman a clef memoir about pre-revolutionary Odessa, and its contemporary atmosphere of Russian-Jewish asimilation, \\"you have had to be there\\". But, of course, no one still alive can remember those years of pre-Bolshevik Odessa.Yet, despite much of the all-acclaiming academic-critcal puffery on this book's back cover, I can only regard it as a juvenile effort by someone who should not have quit his day job for that of a writer. (Z'ev Jabotinsky's day job being that of an extremist Zionist firebrand, who nearly singlehandedly divided the Zionist movement against itself, alienated its erstwhile patron Great Britain, built up a goon squad of likeminded sqadristi inside Palestine (the Irgun), and a Hitlerjugend outside Palestine (the Betar), and generally infected Zionism with neo-fascist aspirations of territorial aggrandizement that it has yet to relinquish.)The novel concerns Jabotinsky's memoir of the first years of twentieth century Odessa. His narrator, a Jewish-born journalist who works for an Odessan newspaper, but has traveled abroad extensively, both for pleasure and as part of his work.(in effect young jabotinsky, before his conversion to Zionism) This young man comes across a unique Jewish family at the opera,(along with the correct usage of the Russian langiuage, one of the narrator's/Jabotinsky's early passions) the Milgroms, and he quickly falls under their spell. In particular, he falls under the spell of the five children, and of these five, he falls hopelessly infatuated with the elder daughter, Marusya.In brief, the narrator gets to know this little family, all unique personalities, yet who reveal themselves to be, in Jabo's hands, mere caricatures of this or that phenomenon of Jewish existence in pre-revolutionary Russia. Ignats Albertovich, the father, is a leading Odessan grain-dealer, and passes his freee time reading nineteenthy century German revolutionary-Enlightenment literature, harking to a day of hopeful (yet vain) German gentile-Jewish accomodation. Anna Mikhailovna, the mother, is a gracious hostess right out of Russian literature, who apparently has little function other than to sit on her children like some glorified mother hen, exposing them to the best of Russian culture, educating them in Russian schools, and hoping to marry them to Russians. The five Milgrom children are equally caricatures, rather than being well-rounded, realistic figures. Marko is a fool who races after this or that passion in which he becomes momentarily enamored, only to reject it after a moment for a new passion. Serezha, his brother, respects nothing in life; he is a daredevil and ne'er do-well, eager to challenge every law and moral restriction, while he keeps up a lively and sustained acquaintance with the local Jewish and gentile demi-monde. His younger brother Torik has committed himself to integrating himself into Russian society and economy; he is as correct, as punctilious, as seriuous and as methodical as he needs to be in prefecting his escape from his family into Russia. The two sisters are caricatures too: Lika is a cold-blooded revolutionary, utterly committed to nothing save the revolution, sort of a mixture of Dostoevsky's \\"Devils\\" and Stalin's own thugs. And Marusya, who despite the author's/narrator's glorification from beginning to end of the book, reveals herself to be merely a flirt and an airhead. Her \\"job\\" is to dispense joy to all of humanity.Marusya lives, in short, a pointless, though cossetted, life, and dies a pointless death. The narrator is her little trained monkey-confidant, and he revels in the little sexless love she offers him as the most he will have from her, while she prepares herself to marry a Russian sailor, who in the end leaves her (or does she leave him? No matter) so that she can marry her dolt of a cousin, Samoilo Kozodoi, a local pharmacist. She dies, again, pointlessly, being burned to death in her kitchen. Her siblings all suffer equivalently horrible demises; although Lika and Torik and Serezha live on, they are lost to their family nest, as they are lost to Judaism and Jewry. (Lika is consumed in the Revolution; Serezha is blinded; Torik converts to Christianity)In short, the book is a melange of caricatures, all of whom are either vaguely, incompletely, impressionistically drawn, or just simply nauseating. The little ascetic, sexless love tale (of Marusya with the narrator, and Marusya with her Russian sailor and then with her pharmacist husband) is badly stitched onto Jabotinsky's ideological message, and I resented his narrator's constant stage managing the narrative, just so his little tale might be told. Jabotinsky's contemporary Babel writes much richer, more ambiguous and satisfying literature, and it is deeply unfortunate that Jabotinsky didn't learn more how to write from babel and his fellow contemporaries in Russian-Jewish literature, as it is that the erstwhile ideological fame of this author himself has gone on to cast ill-deserved fame on a clearly juvenile work."},{"Title":"Lambs' Tales from Great Operas","review":"The title of this book comes from Charles and Mary Lamb's Tales from Shakespeare, as Donald Elliott attempts to invite us into the world of opera the way the Lambs do for the world of Shakespeare. Lamb's Tales from Great Operas takes the name literally and is illustrated with all manner of absurd and comic ink drawings of muttons performing opera, to great effect. Arrowood's illustrations are fabulous, and Elliott always explains the scene each drawing derives from. We are introduced to seventeen operas: two from the 18th century, eleven from the 19th century, and four from the 20th century. The text is unfailingly charming, and would be suitable for both lovers of opera or the curious and sympathetic uninitiated."},{"Title":"Lambs' Tales from Great Operas","review":"As the previous reviewer implies, this is not a children's book, as was Lamb's Tales From Shakespeare. The reason for the title is that opera fans and characters are depicted as sheep (or lambs) in the illustrations. Children might like it (maybe) but the 9-12 designation above is absolutely wrong."},{"Title":"Thaddeus of Warsaw","review":"This was Porter's second work, a gothic romance that was preceded only by a children's story. A very popular early effort in the historical novel genre (first issued in 1803 and still in print), it is set in Poland in the 1790s and tells of a Polish exile and the failed struggle for independence. The novel drew on eye-witness accounts from Polish refugees and was lauded by the Polish patriot Kosciusko, an acquaintance of the author's brother, Robert. Porter (1776-1850) is best remembered for her later book, The Scottish Chiefs (1810), a work based on the life of Scotch patriot William Wallace. She was the sister of novelist Anna Maria Porter, friend of Hannah More, and others. Amazingly enough for a work first written 200 hundred years ago, Thaddeus of Warsaw reads quite well, and the characters are quite sympathetic, although men cry a bit more than in similar modern day novels."},{"Title":"Thaddeus of Warsaw","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It has inspired me to do some research. It has a very pleasant old country feel about it."},{"Title":"Thaddeus of Warsaw","review":"...it'll really pull you around emotionally. It's a great story, great history and of course a lot of treachery and tragedy. I really enjoyed it. It is very long, must be about 1000 pages and the writer, Jane Porter apparently wrote it at a very young age, apparently in her late teens. Read it on a Kindle because you are going to need a dictionary handy because you are oging to need it - their vocabulary in those days was WAY bigger than ours today. There are many words in this book that I have never even heard of before. Critically speaking the author uses 100 words when 10 would do nicely. It's one of the best \\"stories\\" I have read, only surpassed by her other book written some time later called \\"The Scottish Chiefs\\", which was a truly incredible story based on William Wallace life. In my opinion her writing style is far better on this one, so it's slightly easier to read and follow. And pretty exciting - amazing considering these books were written around 1800."},{"Title":"Thaddeus of Warsaw","review":"This is definitley the best book that I ever read. I keep reading it over and over again!"},{"Title":"Epitaph for a Peach: Four Seasons on a Family Farm.","review":"I found this book when it first came out in a Japanese bookstore. I read it and immediately sent my mom a copy, which I almost never do. The story is so zen, so Japanese. Reminded me of my grandfather, his quiet ways, his quiet determination to get things to grow, just life slowly unfolding and moving on, the reverence for nature. It's a life style that is disappearing but maybe books like this will remind us of what once was, how farming was done without poisons and being contaminated with toxins, how a family within a supportive community could live off the land. This book is a most delicious and flavorful peach."},{"Title":"Epitaph for a Peach: Four Seasons on a Family Farm.","review":"Epitaph for a Peach chronicles a year on Mas Masumoto's farm in the great Central Valley of California. If you are not familar with his work, Mas is a third generation Japanese American (Sansei) farmer, a disappearing breed. If you were raised on a family farm, Mas nails the experience right on the head. His writing is accessible; doesn't require that you have a degree in Literature to understand. He weaves a tale that keeps one engaged.The book opens with a prologue written by Mas that was published in the Los Angeles Times. Mas laments having to bulldoze his Sun Crest peach orchard in order to plant a more \\"popular\\" and profitable variety. (The article was syndicated nationally - I don't know how I missed it.) This sets the stage for Mas' effort to find a market for his peaches as well as tell his story of life on the farm. Each season brings work and change. He disputes the notion that a farmer's life is unchanging. It is also filled with symbolism - egrets, owls, ghosts - and optimism. The end leaves you with an unanswered question - does the peach orchard survive beyond the year chronicled in the book?If you are a refugee from a family farm, have spent time on a family farm or want a vignette into the life of a Sansei farmer, I highly recommend Epitaph for a Peach."},{"Title":"Epitaph for a Peach: Four Seasons on a Family Farm.","review":"I enjoyed the book and am glad that I read it, as it provided a glimpse into the life of a peach farmer's perpetual struggle with nature, weather, and markets.Masumoto has a gift for keen observation and descriptive prose. However, the book was lacking in overall coherence and seemed a bit disjointed. I got the feeling that he wanted to include some pieces he had written before he decided to write an actual book, and just inserted them into the best places he could find."},{"Title":"Epitaph for a Peach: Four Seasons on a Family Farm.","review":"This is a wonderful story of a man and his family who are in harmony with the land. This is a story of personal feelings. Mr. Masumoto writes in a poetic style, which makes you not only feel the peach juices running down your chin, but if you close your eyes you can taste the sweetness of the juice.He also presents his life as a child working with his dad on the farm. He shares his experiences on the farm as a young man who shoots his first bird, a giant barn owl that he regrets to this day. Later, he experiences an egret being shot by a cousin, which also saddens him. While I never grew up on a farm, I also remember the jack rabbit that I shot as a kid, which I still remember to this day (I am 72 years old). I also remember being with a friend who shot a red tailed hawk and I thought at the time, what a terrible waste for such a momentary pleasure.The author projects his inner feelings about life. He reflects on his own life and that of those who surround him, family, friends, laborers and the public that consumes his produce. He contemplates the life of his peach trees and vineyards, which he nurtures from small plants, to maturity and at their end of life. He thinks of the life of the weeds and insects that he has to compete with to allow his crops to survive.This short story is full of life experiences that any reader can relate to. This is a book to read during the quite moments when you want to reflect upon your personal life and contemplate what experiences have given meaning to your own life destiny. A destiny that none of us travel alone."},{"Title":"Epitaph for a Peach: Four Seasons on a Family Farm.","review":"Because I grew up with peach juice dribbling down my chin, I've been longing for that sensation for years!

Somewhat in the tradition of Dillard (Annie) and Hawthorne (Alice Deming)."},{"Title":"Epitaph for a Peach: Four Seasons on a Family Farm.","review":"This book doesn't quite live up to its promise. I found the concept of his quest to save his heirloom peaches inspiring, but the book lacks the focus and drama I expected. Instead it meanders through the agricultural seasons, without much explanation of, say, the marketing and distribution process, which is apparently the challenge with the kind of peaches he's growing. The book has a nice mood, but after a while I began to feel that he was saying the same things over and over again. I didn't finish the book, which is rare for me."},{"Title":"Epitaph for a Peach: Four Seasons on a Family Farm.","review":"&quot;Epitaph&quot; is a gem and a masterpiece. Masumoto is a good farmer, a truly dedicated family man and a gifted writer. The story is in part about his love affair with a wonderful variety of peach.City people will know why supermarket peaches disappoint and country people will recognize the sad story of a farmer who, the harder he tries the more frustration he finds. The peaches you find in the supermarket are there because the consumer/supermarket/broker/ value &quot;shelf life&quot; more than flavor.Peaches don't travel well and they don't last long. The farmer must choose the right variety, prune it exactly the right way at exactly the right time, fertilize and water at the right time, pray fervently for the right weather conditions.Only then, if the peach absorbs enough sun to fully mature, will it have the full bursting ambrosial flavor a peach should have. Only the sun can make a peach sweet and flavorful. Most really delicious peaches won't last more than three or four days after they are picked.A good peach should be eaten as it is right out of hand. Not put in a pie or jam or cake. Only a good farmer can grow a perfect peach and no supermarket want them. Where is the answer?You'll fall in love with farming and weep a bit as you read the Masumoto family story. Perhaps you won't fully appreciate what today's farmers are up against, but this book will give you more insight than you ever had before.If you are from a farming family you will fully appreciate every word of this beautiful story of a San Joaquin Valley farm."},{"Title":"Epitaph for a Peach: Four Seasons on a Family Farm.","review":"This book moves me in ways I find hard to describe. I'm from a farming family in the San Joaquin Valley in California. My father still grows grapes not terribly far from Mr. Masumoto's farm. When you grow up near the earth and smell, hear, see and touch its produce nearly every day, especially when the fruit is ripe, you can't help but be awed by nature's (and God's) miracles. Living now in a city I long for my children and my friends to understand how deeply tied we really are to the earth and what it produces for us, and how vital it is for us all to take care of our fragile earth. Organic farming requires all of us, farmers and consumers, to think a bit differently about how to grow and shop for our food. Mr. Masumoto brilliantly captured the ordinary, everyday life of a farmer. This book will be going to everyone I know for Christmas this year."},{"Title":"Epitaph for a Peach: Four Seasons on a Family Farm.","review":"When David Mas Masumoto describes how his &quot;old-fashioned&quot; Sun Crest peaches look and taste, the reader's mouth waters and the grocery store peaches of today become flavorless by comparison. When Masumoto is unable to find buyers for his peaches he describes them as &quot;homeless&quot; and the reader's heart grieves. This book strongly conveys the small family farmer's ties to the land and his crops, his lack of control before the forces of nature and the whims of market dynamics. It also taught me a few things about the hard work involved in farming. However, when I look back for a &quot;soundbite&quot; impression of this book, I get a series of poetic pictures: Masumoto's obaachan (grandmother) walking through the farm at sunset, cruel bulldozers ripping out an orchard, graceful egrets fishing in the irrigation canals. A great read for a taste of connection to the land!"},{"Title":"Epitaph for a Peach: Four Seasons on a Family Farm.","review":"It is rare to read a book where the author works miracles with his hands and his words. I highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys non-fiction but finds it dry, without humanity. David Mas Masumoto is anything but dry. His land may be at times, but his poetic prose is anything but. His relationship with his family, his family's farm and nature is a rare combination. I highly recommend this read."},{"Title":"Epitaph for a Peach: Four Seasons on a Family Farm.","review":"I live somewhat north of the area Mr. Masumoto writes about - where the San Francisco Bay Area Suburbs collide with the San Joaquin Farmlands. The Peach and Cherry Orchards and the Sweet Corn, Tomatoes and Strawberries are currently holding their own - but like Mr. Masumoto's Peaches and Grapes, only tenuously, and with great courage. If you would like to understand not only how these people live, but who and why they are, you should read this book. It is both beautifully written and thought provoking."},{"Title":"Epitaph for a Peach: Four Seasons on a Family Farm.","review":"Death is destined to come to all of creation. In this case it came to a peach but not just any peach. Sun Crest peaches died not because of their bitter taste or ugly appearance. They were a victim of a market that values a long shelf-life more than taste. They were casualties of the public's need for the red skinned variety of the fruit rather than its golden hue. Sorry, Sun Crest, you are no longer profitable or valued for your sweet and juicy taste. It is time for your demise.With moving eloquence and lyrical prose David Musumoto shares with us the story of his attempts to save a peach whose cultivation was a defining part of his life. David's story is the story of all family farmers struggling to stay alive and afloat in the vast world of the agribusiness. As one who is a resident of the &quot;peach&quot; state and has seen the destruction of its groves and dispersion of family farmers, I can readily identify with the various themes of which David shares.Walk with him through the four seasons where we learn about the preparation of the soil, pruning, watering, caring, harvesting and marketing of the peaches. You find out that farming is hard work that requires faith, patience, experimentation and a tough hide when you experience failure. David interweaves his own personal history of farming through three generations to give us an appreciation of a lifestyle that is deeply embeded in one's soul.As citizens in the 21st century we have some numerous decisions to make. Do we want agribusiness to control our food supply thus limiting our choices or we will support farmers such as David who offer us a product more satisfying? Too often we will go with cheap and quick availability without looking at the whole picture to make room for both agribusiness and small farmers. Which side will we chose? Is an epitaph for a peach in reality an epitaph for the family farm? Think about it as you read this enriching, thoughtful and engaging work."},{"Title":"Epitaph for a Peach: Four Seasons on a Family Farm.","review":"I have lived in the San Joaquin Valley for a little less then 2 years, and currently drive by Del Rey on my daily commute from Reedley to Fresno and back. For the time being, I'm still looking at grapes and peaches rather than subdivisions and scrub. Masumoto's book has helped this refugee from the lands of corn and soybeans and those of wheat and milo start to figure out what's going on in those vineyards and orchards. There are two things I like about this book. The first is the great sense of balance between the ideal and the practical, and abstract versus work-a-day concerns. For instance, the questions such as &quot;do I 'exploit' this worker or leave him unemployed?&quot;, and &quot;which is worse, using pesticide, or burning more fossil fuel and smogging up the Valley more with extra tillage?&quot;. You know; the kinds of questions that seem straightforward and clear-cut to those whose experience with organic agriculture is buying food at the co-op. The seconds is that Mr. Masumoto's prose doesn't strike me as being nearly as frilly as that of most of his blurb writers. I am reminded of Aldo Leopold or Norman MacLean; guys who can express great vistas and grand ideas with relatively sparse language."},{"Title":"Epitaph for a Peach: Four Seasons on a Family Farm.","review":"Author David Masumoto has written an excellent vignette into the year in a life of a small-scale, family farmer. His passion for his life's work, his connection to the land, and his strong family values are so clearly evident in his writing. I think a lot of readers will be envious of the life he describes. I share many of his views on the value of small family farms and the need to focus on how food should taste. Masumoto's book will reonsate deeply with those of us who know what it means to be curious about how something grows, who look forward to the first ripe peach or melon of the year, who prefer to make things from scratch and sit down with all our kids at dinner."},{"Title":"Epitaph for a Peach: Four Seasons on a Family Farm.","review":"I feel a connection with David Masumoto. Not that I've met him or anything - in fact, there's a good chance I never will (although I keep hoping that one summer day I can make it over to his farm to pick peaches). No, this feeling is based on an impression that we have both fought the same fight over different things, for the same reasons. It is also because he writes so poignantly about a landscape I grew up in. Mr. Masumoto is an organic farmer in the valley of California, and his story is becoming more and more familiar to me as I see this way of life disappearing across the country.A third generation Japanese American peach and grape farmer, David Masumoto inherited the family orchard from his father. He also had the heritage of his childhood memories of how that particular peach variety, Sun Crest, tasted and ran with juice unlike the pretty red baseballs that have passed for today's supermarket peach varieties. Mr. M wanted to show the world how delightful an old-fashioned peach could be.When he took over his father's farm, he resolved to not only continue growing his Sun Crests, but to do it organically. This would prove challenging in our day and age of cheap, quick fixes; moreover, it would test his strongly felt ideals. The land needed to heal and replenish itself after years of chemical fertilizers and toxic pest control methods. Masumoto had to take his example from research on other organic farming practices, planting wildflowers to encourage beneficial insect life and sowing \\"green manure\\" crops to act as natural mulch and compost. All this took time, patience, and faith that his hard work would eventually pay off.Epitaph for a Peach is rich in sensory descriptions, philosophy, and nostalgic flashbacks. It is a picture of the way a farmer's life is connected to the seasons, capricious weather patterns, and changing market conditions. Not incidentally, Masumoto also teaches about the obscure history of Japanese farmers in the Valley - something that even I, native to Fresno, had little idea of. Reading this book was a slow, thoughtful experience much in the same manner that one slows down to savor a rich fruit. Recommended to anybody interested in history, growing food, or the vanishing California landscape.-Andrea, aka Merribelle"},{"Title":"Epitaph for a Peach: Four Seasons on a Family Farm.","review":"Lush, fragrant peaches dangling from the branches in DavidMas Masumoto's orchard long to be picked and enjoyed for theburst of nector that surrounds your tastebuds.

The main thing motivating me to give Billy Graham's book the top rating is the combined trustworthiness of the reverend (due to his long service and sincere effort) --and the accuracy of his book.However, let me tell you in no uncertain terms, he seems to merely recite old familiar Bible stories regarding angels. This was *very* boring for me, but this is great for many who haven't read the Bible and need solid answers about the ministry of angels.He adds in just enough Angel encounters from nowadays to spice things up, which was much needed.One supposedly familiar story, however, that he recounts about Stephen the martyr, was a good read for me because I had mistakenly \\"remembered\\" the story as Stephen being stoned to produce an out of body experience for him to see the angels. However, after I read Dr. Graham's recounting of this story, I noticed that he said that Stephen saw the Lord seated in heaven with the angels around *before* he got stoned, so I checked it out, and I was glad: I had forgotten the details, and Dr. Graham's recounting of this story was right.All in all, I recommend this book, but another good book on angels (although VERY different) is the late Rev. Roland Buck's \\"Angels on Assignment.\\" The latter is much more fascinating, but, to my mind, still holds up to the Bible and does not contradict it. I hope to write a review of Pastor Buck's book, which was actually authored by Charles and Frances Hunter who (thank God) took down the pastor's account and published it right before he died of health problems.Yes, I recommend Rev Billy Graham's book, but also read your Bible, carefully consider, and read other things to stimulate your faith with the Bible as the measuring stick.Gordon Wayne Watts in Lakeland, Florida, USA"},{"Title":"Angels","review":"Very interesting and educational book.

Overall this book is an eye-opener to how powerful angels are, and that they are here to watch over and protect God's people.Graham attempts to answer questions such as:What do angels look like?Do angels get married or have children?How many angels are there?Do we have guardian angels?Do angels experience emotion?Do angels take us to heaven?What are the different types of angels?How many archangels are in the bible?"},{"Title":"Angels","review":"We know by reading the Bible that God created two different beings, Angels and Man.

Graham adds stories and illustrations from his life and ministry to further demonstrate his point.The book evaluates and answers questions such as:Are they visible or invisible?How are they different from people?What do they do?Are they for real?Are they still around today?While I cannot say for certain if I have ever seen an Angel, I believe in them because of the same reason Graham does. \\"I believe in angels because the Bible says there are angels; and I believe the Bible to be the true Word of God.\\" (page 27)Another interesting chapter was #13: Angels and Death. Believers in Christ do not need to fear death, however, it is natural for man to be afraid of the unknown. I think it is fair to say most people are a little nervous or apprehensive about death. It is comforting to know that Angels will be there to escort me to Heaven after my final breath. Those Angels that have been with me my entire life, will be there to take me to the Creator. That indeed is comforting to know.I found this book very interesting and easy to read. This is the type of book that once you start reading, it is difficult to put down.

Fortunately, the author does a great job of bringing perspective to this issue.The points made in this book are based upon Scripture.

For example, I didn't realize there were more biblical references to angels throughout the Bible than to Satan, yet we think often of Satan more than the angels who are before us to watch over us. I think anyone interested in angels would be well served to read this Biblically-based reading for more information. The reason for 4 stars is that while I enjoy the wealth of information B Graham gives, I think his writing style suits more of a 'study-approach' to reading the book...rather than a 'curl up on the couch' kind of read. I think, though, that the information in this book is worth the effort. I would suggest anyone interested in studying angels to get their Bibles out and actually reference the scriptures he mentions. Make notes and decide for yourself if angels really exist."},{"Title":"Angels","review":"Billy Graham always presents everything with the Bible as the foundation. In to days world we desperately need to the scriptures as our guide. I am deeply concerned by so many preaching only to tickle the ears of their listeners."},{"Title":"Angels","review":"My mother suggested this book and I've found it to be easy to understand and comforting to know their among us."},{"Title":"Angels","review":"I do, but I wanted to see if it was just childhood fantasies or the real deal. Well, thank goodness for Billy Graham who points out that angels are mentioned at least 300 times in the Bible. That was good to know. This book is a nice validation that angels do exist."},{"Title":"Angels","review":"Angels are not the women & babies with wings that most people think of at Christmas. They are WARRIORS with swords of fire!They can be visible or invisible (to us), 20 feet tall, watching & ready to fight, or actively fighting demons....our prayers activate them! If we saw into the spiritual realm, we would be comforted to know how much support God the Father gives us to fight our daily battles! Rev Graham's book has been around for decades...I had read it 30 years ago and found it to be Biblically correct and very comforting! Rereading it has been a joy and a blessing!I recommend ANYTHING Rev Graham wrote for the seriously spiritual reader. He will not lead you astray."},{"Title":"Angels","review":"Really marvelous work by Rev Dr Billy Graham. This product will gain wide market inside India if made available. Regards"},{"Title":"Angels","review":"I found Billy Graham's book on Angels to be very factual and informative. He backs up his statements with scripture. He also shares personal stories of personal encounters people have had with angels in their time of need. Mr. Graham states that angels are mentioned over \\"300 times in the Bible and New Testement, more than Satan or demons.\\" Unlike the \\"New Age\\" sentimental, stuff you often see on TV, Mr. Graham gives a true perspective on what angels are and how God uses them, both for blessings and punishments and their place in the realm of heavenly hosts."},{"Title":"Angels","review":"Again, Billy Graham explains in a biblically based way what angels are like. They are not cute little babies with smiles on their faces shooting love arrows around & making people fall in love....they are not humans afer we die. Angels are mighty and strong and carry out God's orders. Billy Graham also tells us about the ranking of angels and their various duties."},{"Title":"Angels","review":"MY wife and I are doing a study on Angels and find this book to be of help.

Both well written."},{"Title":"Angels","review":"Read Mr. Graham's Bible references as you go through this book. Pray for enlightenment and truth every time you open this book. It will help you get to know your angels. It will help you recognize when God has sent his angels to guide you and show you His love. There is no self promotion from Mr. Graham.Stay away from authors such as Doreen Virtue. Stay away from mysticism. There is no place in the Bible regarding mediums or contacting the dead. Mediums seek spiritual power. They seek the glory that belongs to God. They often seek to profit."},{"Title":"Angels","review":"This book was an excellent selection and talks a great deal about angels .And gives you alot of knowledge that Angels exist and there duties.After losing my 11yr son in a car accident when a drunk driver hit us .I wondered about Angels and if they really existed.God loves us and sends them as protection."},{"Title":"Angels","review":"This book is basically a layman's guide to angels. Graham uses the Bible as his only source of information on the subject, and he does a very good job of describing the heavenly hosts to readers. The book was written largely in response to the proliferation of books centering around demonology and New Age ideas in recent years; as he points out, there really aren't many satisfying treatments available of angels per se. Sadly, modern man's conception of angels has been shaped and largely determined by popular entertainment; Graham effectively delineates truth from lies and imaginative thinking. The book is meant to inspire and comfort as much as it is to inform the reader. Graham offers many penetrating insights into the subject, but, most importantly, he lays out the basic facts about angels as they are revealed in the Bible. He describes a hierarchy of angels that is more extensive that I realized--at the top is the archangel Michael, followed by Gabriel, then cherubim and seraphim, and finally a myriad of different principalities, authorities, etc. Angels, Graham argues, perform different functions but serve only to glorify God and assist man in attaining salvation.While the concept of a hierarchy among angels seems somewhat strange, given that it necessarily implies varying levels of power and authority and, thus, inequality among these divine beings, Graham does an excellent job of explaining what angels do and, more interestingly, what they cannot do. Angels, first and foremost, praise the Lord and work for Him in all things; they serve as His divine warriors and as the protective agents of every Christian in the world. Interestingly, angels cannot preach to man or take any other action to compel man to repent of his sins because each man must make his own decision for or against Christ. One of the explanations Graham suggests for angels' inability to actively win human souls is the fact that angels do not know sin and cannot relate to the miraculous conversion from sin to faith in Christ. What I find most interesting about angels, and this is a notion borne out by Graham's writing, is the fact that they will be subordinate to saved human souls in heaven. Though born wretched, those men and women who accept God's salvation will live eternally in a closer relationship with God than the sinless angels do.Many readers will find the information on Lucifer and his fall from heaven the most interesting section of the book. I certainly cannot understand how any angel, created without sin, can somehow fall victim to pride (which Graham implies is the seedbed of all sin), especially to the point where he will challenge God for His throne and, even more amazingly, convince up to one third of all angels to join with him in the revolt. Graham does a good a job as anyone at explaining the origins of Satan (as well as the inevitable defeat of the prince of lies).The true purpose of the book is to win new souls for the Lord and to offer comfort and inspiration for those already redeemed. Graham makes the case that, for Christians, angels are always over our shoulder watching out for us, that they love each of us and rejoice each time a new soul is won, and that they will be there to guide us directly to Heaven once we pass away. The only weakness of the book is, ironically, also its greatest strength--it is written so that anyone can understand it. While I might turn away from a hefty theological tome, I would very much like to see a more detailed, scholarly treatment of the subject, especially by such an authority as Billy Graham."},{"Title":"Angels","review":"The Bible tells Christians that we have angels watching over us. Billy Graham focuses on that truth in this book. In the first chapter he discusses the reality of the spirit world and goes on to offer a rationale for a book of this nature. The second chapter is a progression of that thought as he describes the reality and nature of angels. Chapter 3 goes on to look at both the visible and invisble manifestations of angels. Subsequent chapters discuss the differences between humans and angels, angelic organizational structures, angelic rebellion, the ministry of angels, angels as God's agents, and Angels and the Gospel. The book continues by discussing angels involvement in the earthly life of Jesus. From there he goes on to talk about the role of angels in prophecy. A chapter on angels and death is included, as is a section on angels as spiritual spectators. The concluding chapter has to do with angels in the lives of Christians today. I highly recommend this book. He keeps angels in proper perspective, i.e., they point to Jesus."},{"Title":"Angels","review":"Billy Graham, evangelist to millions, father, pastor, and writer has done a good job of working through a topic that has become a flashpoint of discussion and pop culture in recent years- Angels. Graham shares many amazing stories recounted by witnesses that cannot easily be explained away as nonsense. Graham takes a view that these facts need to be represented, examined and shared with other people. You are left to make your own decision about the existence of beings from the heavens, angels, but you are not left without much evidence and information to inventory and work through provided by the author. I read this book twice, once years ago, and more recently, and still cannot blow off what the Rev. has to say about angels. This is an interesting book, and one not to be taken lightly."},{"Title":"Angels","review":"If you are looking for a quick read, high level overview on the subject of angels as the occur in the Bible, this is a good choice. Billy Graham only discusses angels as they are shown in the Bible and does not draw from other sources for his discussion. Therefore, this is a good 'first read' to get an overall sense of why angels exist and what they do. Each chapter is set up as a stand alone so you can skip to sections that most interest you without missing relevant information. (I highly recommend the chapter on 'The Angels and Death' for anyone suffering from a loss.) This book is not meant to be a comprehensive analysis for the more involved student. It is more for the layperson who would like to understand the subject better, but without all the 'dry' academia that is sometimes associated with more in depth studies. Read it for enjoyement. Read it for pleasure. Read it for encouragement. And know that God is watching over you..."},{"Title":"Angels","review":"Billy Graham does in this book what he does in life......let God do the talking and instructing. So much fluff is written on this subject and it is done with the attempt to take the glory away from God. This of course, is something holy angels would never do as they were created to worship God and to obey Him. Thankfully, Mr. Graham can always be depended on to be faithful to the Word of God and this book is wonderful. For those who are fascinated with angels and want a book about them, in all honesty, this is the only book you'll ever need outside of the Bible. Discover for yourself the beauty of angels and their adoration of Christ their King."},{"Title":"Angels","review":"Billy Graham really brings home the reality of angels in this book and how they are not some imaginary beings, but mighty warriors used by God for His purposes."},{"Title":"Angels","review":"While I am not a person that has ever been intrigued with Angels, I was recommended this book by my dear and sweet aunt. So, on her recommendation, I bought it and read it. I was IMPRESSED! Dr. Graham presents a totally Biblical account of the roles Angels play and how these unseen beings play such a role in our everyday lives. In this book, Dr. Graham even discusses the Biblical account of the fall of Satan and his angels. If you are a Christian, this book should be required reading."},{"Title":"Angels","review":"This is the most amazing book i have ever read. I am a 10th grader at P. V. Moore high school.

There were hundreds of books available, however, when I saw one written by Billy Graham, I knew it was the one I needed. I was not disappointed. He touched on everything I needed to know and explained everything in such a way that it did not require additional research to understand what he was saying. I ordered the book on my Kindle and had it finished within 2 days.

And this book describes their work over the last ten years in great detail. The illustrations are superb, and the pullouts are simply spectacular. If i do have one gripe, it is the fact that they really don't go into the real process of the digital effects. They do to a point, but since i work with these type of programs, i would like to see how the masters do it."},{"Title":"Industrial Light & Magic: Into the Digital Realm","review":"For 25 years Industrial Light and Magic has woven magic into countless films, either subtle images through \`invisible' effects such as matte paintings or through eye-popping visuals that stand out vividly against the film backdrop. ILM has made it's mark on history, for not only have they been and still are the premiere effects house in Hollywood, they have innovated and invented more technology than any other studio, additionally they have won awards for the processing and compositing technology they have created. ILM had to be the best at special effects, because their flagship title - STAR WARS - demanded the best, because that's what Lucas wanted.\`Into the Digital Realm' isn't so much an abandonment of ILM of the traditional methods of special effects, rather a point of departure for the new technology and all of things that led up to it. Indeed, ILM's work on \`The Hunt For Red October' submarine work involved flying the submerged vessels from wires in a smoky room - effects do not get any more traditional than that. Released in 96, the book doesn't mention that Phantom Menace or even that the film is in production. It does have some revised images from the Star Wars special edition. As with the previous tome, this one is packed with hundreds of color photos, plus the same beautiful gate fold images.If the center piece for the previous book was Star Wars, Digital Realms' focus is obviously Jurassic Park, because it was the first film to use CG on so large a scale, even more than Terminator 2, which ILM also did. Jurassic Park was also the test bed and showcase piece that convinced Lucas that computers had finally matured enough to bring what he had in mind to the screen for the new Star Wars films. More is the pity, because I came to loathe most of the aliens in the Phantom Menace. Digital Realm clearly explains in easy to understand terms how effects - both new and old - are accomplished, be it something as simple as making it appear as if buildings are actually much taller than they or having a velociraptor walk _behind_ a plant situated in the foreground. I have both of these wonderful books, and I strongly recommend them to anyone who is curious about ILM's history and the process of how effects are made."},{"Title":"Industrial Light & Magic: Into the Digital Realm","review":"One of the greatest 'making of' writers Patricia Rose Duignan's Industrial Light & Magic: Into the Digital Realm is one of my all-time favorite books, charting the journey of ILM from fledgling company in George Lucas' garage to the No.1 Special Effects company in the world. Insightful and comprehensive, this is flawless reading and has some great accompanying images from Star Wars, Indiana Jones, and surprisingly some of their lesser-known movies like Willow and Hook. An essential movie book, I just love every page, so carefully written, so rich in detail, it leaves the reader feeling that they have experienced something very special. Fantastic and brilliant. BUY IT NOW!"},{"Title":"Industrial Light & Magic: Into the Digital Realm","review":"After having read the book &quot;The Art of Special Effects&quot; about ILM first decade it was out of the question for me not to buy this book. The book first gives a look back at the good old days at ILM. While reading the text, which is perfectly illustrated with hundreds of color pictures and drawings, the reader comprehends very quickly that the transition from optical, traditional special effects to the state-of-the-art digital effects of blockbusters like &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; was more than just switching on computers. An era ended and a new one started, giving the specialist at ILM more power to fulfill their dreams - and those of million moviegowers.The author uses a different approach to explain the special effects. In &quot;The Art of Special Effects&quot; the tricks were explained by introducing the different departments. Here the author uses different movies which have been milestones for ILM.Although the book is very detailed and informative it lacks the thrilling writing of its predecessor &quot;The Art of Special Effects&quot;.

Every single page has at least several great color photographs and it is a big book. You will love to read about ILM's ventures into the digital realm.

This is well worth looking at especially for fans of ILM or those who want to see what goes on behind the scenes or for those looking for a career in this direction. This is a good place for inspiration.Although it does not cover the more recent movies you will still get the picture here. It starts by talking about go-motion and then moves onto the first ever digital sequence and how much people slaved over it before going into detail with the evolution of that process and of the special edition of Star Wars and Speilberg's &quot;J.

For this very reason a friend of mine insisted that I read Bush Unplugged and I am so glad I finally took the literary political plunge. I was riveted from the first page,and throughout the book I could not believe what I was reading.I was blown away by what I did not know about the president and his cronies and how these stories are not reported on the evening news.Thanks to MR.

Bush","review":"If you have wondered where this administration came from, Marc Umile does a great job of answering that question. He makes it abundantly clear--with compelling arguments and persuasive evidence--that George W. Bush is neither compassionate nor conservative. It brings to mind the witticism about the meaning of \\"compassionate conservative\\": they still won't help you, but they feel really bad about it! Except this guy doesn't feel a thing. Not a thing.As you read this book, think about the principles that have defined traditional Republicanism: a commitment to balanced budgets, Constitutional government, a non-interventionist foreign policy, and keeping the government out of our personal lives. This administration--with its massive federal deficits, its promotion of the Patriot Act, its aggressive wars abroad, and its intrusion into the most intimate aspects of our privacy-- violates all four of those principles.Mussolini observed that \\"fascism\\" could be defined as corporatism, since it represents the merger of big business with big government, a coalition characterized by rampant nationalism and aggressive militarism. The leader is identified with the state, which makes criticism of the leader unpatriotic or even treasonous. Ask yourself where we find ourselves at the beginning of this new millenium. As you will discover here, the situation is more than a little frightening."},{"Title":"Bush Unplugged: The True Patriot's Guide to George W.

Lately, it seems the pendulum is beginning to swing back to normalcy and this is just the kind of read we need to inspire us to take back our country.This is not a book for leftist wackos or right wing doughheads.

A sense of seeing oneself and the world refracted, maddened beyond grief or reality? This is both the appeal and effect of Adrienne Kennedy's &quot;Funnyhouse of a Negro,&quot; a classic of 1960s African-American theatre too oft forgotten. This play projects a house of mirrors in which African diplomats, actresses and Queens all converge in the distorted consciousness of one black girl. A passionate and sly work of avant-garde drama,this play features many elements of current popular theatre: mystery, romance, melodrama, wigs . . . But its unapologetic depiction of the insanity of race reality takes it all to the next level-- think the chitlin circuit on crack!

Stowe wrote the book in an effort to preserve for future generations the life, which she had known growing up as a child and which she saw passing away under the force of industrialization. She succeeded marvelously. This work along with perhaps five or six other novels by Stowe are a neglected national treasure.

If you are a beginning C or Perl programmer, this book will help you to write useful real-world CGI scripts in a matter of days. If you have less than rudimentary knowledge of these languages, spend time learning the languages before you buy this book.Most CGI tasks are not especially complex, so you can start writing useful scripts with minimal programming knowledge. To gain that knowledge, look to books like O'Reilly's &quot;Learning Perl,&quot; which not only gives you a very solid understanding of the language, but also has a good chapter to get you started in CGI scripting.What this book is good for is learning about things like how information is passed from a web page to a CGI script, how the CGI script interprets that info, how the script connects to databases and other programs on the back end.Unlike many of the other Sam's &quot;Teach Yourself&quot; books, this one does not really start with simple scripts and lead you by the hand up to the more complex stuff. Instead, it spends more time explaining how Perl &amp; C work with CGI &amp; HTML to send, receive &amp; process information. Once you've written your first few Perl scripts, this information will be exactly what you need. Before then, however, you may just find it confusing."},{"Title":"Teach Yourself - CGI Programming in a Week","review":"I have bought 5 CGI books, only this one does teach me something from the beginning. By reading through the first chapter, I fully understand the structure of a site, what is the document root, why index page in the /usr/local/http/htdocs directory is automaticlly loaded if www.xxxx.com is used, as well as why cgi-bin is treated as in the same directory under the document root as your html document eventhough the cgi-bin is one level higher than htdocs, etc, ... These are all the questions I have in my mind since I started to learn CGI, this book enlightened me starting in the first chapter! (Certainly not only one chapter can do all). No other books take a approach as this one to teach you from the very beginning, which is very crucial to any one who is new to CGI I believe. This is a book for any one who wants to learn CGI from the very beginning. But I think if you have some html and unix knowledge, it would be much easier for you to quickly learn CGI by reading this book. I have one year html experience and know some basic unix and perl, I feel very comfortable reading through this book and finished with it just in a week.

I was a bit skeptacle about the whole &quot;Sams&quot; books and how everybody says they are crap and they have very bad editing and stuff. Well I went through this book, and there are a few misprints, but the book is still a very good and you will not be disappointed if you get this one, although if you want to get truly serious in CGI you will need to get a reference book in Perl or whatever language, but this will get you on your way making amazing and great usefull CGI programs.The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 stars was because I felt this book would have been better if they made it a &quot;Sams teach yourself CGI Programming in 21 days&quot; instead of a shorter 7 day course.

No longer do you web pages need to be static - now you can create interactive pages that breathe life into a site. This fast paced book will get you up to speed with CGI programming, teaching you both the theory and practical techniques you need to write your own CGI applications and scripts.Each chapter introduces a new topic, such as forms, scripts, server-side-includes (SSI), graphics, databases and security. As you progress from chapter to chapter, you'll be amazed at just how easy CGI programming can be. The examples in the book are clearly explained, and help demonstrate the practical applications of CGI programming. The book includes examples in Perl 5, and C, so whether you're a C or a PERL programmer, this book will be of benefit. Examples range from small pieces of code to large applications. The examples are of real ! ! practical use for webmaster such as counters, guestbooks, email gateways and WWW forms that access and record information in a database. There's even source code for a flat-file database, for those webmasters who don't have an existing database system installed on their site.Teach Yourself CGI Programming in a Week offers programmers and webmasters the opportunity to master CGI applications in a very short period of time, and to effectively deploy &quot;real-world&quot; CGI applications on their website.

Once you do that you are faced with examples that one can find on the web, no explanation of Perl code as if we are expected to know that already."},{"Title":"tales of chinatown","review":"Some of the racial stereotypes in this book are blood-curdling. Although I'm not Chinese, I'm very closely related to a few Chinese people. The casual, popular bigotry on display in these pages is chilling. At the same time, the stories themselves are generally good. The author has a sort of covert admiration of the Chinese - especially Chinese women - that seems to drive him to write about them, but in a very prejudiced way. Looking past the throwback stereotypes, the stories are uneven. Some of the stories are startlingly good, containing a well-developed sense of irony. Other stories seem to borrow too much from Arthur Conan Doyle. The anthropological window into early 20th Century views about Asia is valuable."},{"Title":"SQL: Implmenting the SQL Foundation Standard","review":"This book is good for beginners -- tells you the ins and outs of SQL.

RS is a very private person, so whatever glipse we get into his life is a rare treat. We get a little peice of Rick knowledge all through his career. Don't look for deep writing or a lot of delving.

It left so many questions unanswered in my mind and i am sure in the minds of all who read the book."},{"Title":"Rick Springfield","review":"This book is even better when you realize that Rick used no ghost writer or co author.

It took awhile to get into it because there's a great deal of expository writing at the beginning, but stick with it and you'll be introduced to some fascinating characters in the town of Middlemarch.Dorothea Brooke is a young woman about to take a much older husband, determined to find purpose in her life by assisting him with his life's work, a book which is to a definitive guide to all the mythologies of the world. When she begins to suspect her husband's work is little more than empty piffle, how will she find her way?Mr. Lydgate is a hotshot young physician determined to do great works from the small town of Middlemarch. Thwarted by small town suspicion and politics, and increasingly saddled by debt incurred by a pretty young wife, how will he cope as his life's dream slips away?Fred Vincy is the son of a town merchant determined to see him made a gentleman. He's paid for Fred to recieve a gentleman's education at Oxford with the intention that Fred will join the Church. Fred knows the Church isn't for him, but isn't sure what else to do, nor how to tell his father his education was for naught.These are just three of a huge cast of characters, all of them fascinating in their own way as their lives intersect. The book feels more like a documentary than a novel, and you grow to feel as if the characters could be your own friends and neighbors. Highly recommended, I know this is going to be one of my favorite books."},{"Title":"Middlemarch","review":"Yes, that is a strong statement, but I believe Middlemarch to be the best novel written in English. And English is a rich language, overflowing with worthy works from both sides of the Atlantic, India and beyond. The only novel as a close contender on my list is Jane Eyre, with its fearsome symmetry and romantic passion.George Eliot has been the bane of students everywhere who suffer reading Silas Marner in high school. But later on, you, like me, may develop a taste for the classics and this book will reward you richly.The story is about Dorothea, a young, idealist woman, born to a good family with a modest fortune of her own. She is a prime catch on the wife market--money, family name, good looks. Her parents are deceased and her friends and uncle seek to pair her up with a local baron as the ideal mate. But Dorothea, bookish, religious and dreamy, has other ideas. She chooses, instead, a superannuated cleric who finally decides to marry as he feels mortality and ill health upon him. Casaubon, the vicar of a nearby rural church is a good match except....he's old, ugly and what the heck is he doing marrying such a young beauty. But Dorothea, who's imagining a sort of superior father figure who could &quot;teach you even Hebrew, if you wished it&quot; wakes up to far less than a reality of marital bliss. And there's an added complication created by her unworthy husband that has dire consequences for the young Dorothea.The subsequent examination of marriage as a partnership in hell is written with stunning modernity. Eliot not only creates the disastrous marriage of Dorothea to Casaubon, but also pairs, as a comparison, Lydgate, a doctor and his frivolous, vain, uncaring wife. The relationship of marriage to society is never more well drawn, but the internal suffering of people trapped in loveless marriage is written with sympathy and cunning insight. Eliot herself had a live-in relationship with Henry Lewes, who could not divorce his wife. She undoubtedly wrote from personal experience. The insight into human nature, such as jealousy, disappointment, recrimination, loss of trust and a feeling of desperation are themes that anyone who has ever been in a relationship will recognize as truth. If you find classic literature hard going, watch the mini-series created based on the book. Then, knowing the general plot, you might enjoy the structure and language of the novel more."},{"Title":"Middlemarch","review":"I have had a copy of this book on my shelf for years without reading it. It was so very thick, the print so small, the pages so thin! It looked dauntingly long and dull.But when I finally picked it up out of a sense of obligation (after all, I majored in English, and it is a highly acclaimed classic) I was amazed to find myself laughing out loud on the very first page!Dorothea, Eliot's heroine, is SO very earnest, SO idealistic and ardent! She would never be so tawdry as to fuss with her hair and dress, or wear (gasp!) jewelry in public! She is interested only in bettering the lives of the poor in their neighborhood (you could visualize her at the fore of a modern anti-war protest). But when her sister draws her into trying on their mother's old jewelry, the pure beauty of an emerald ring inspires her to decisively choose it as her own. And she stubbbornly ignores any inconsistency between that decision and her ideals.But her idealism traps her into marriage with a man who is not at all what she believes. She sees him as a paragon of learning, questing the seas of knowledge with fearless curiousity. In actuality, he turns out to be a cautious and small-minded scholar, drily obsessed with minor points of criticism on others works. Poor Dorothea strives to find ways to hold constant in her love in the face of ugly truth. And when she meets young Will Ladislaw, a man of similar idealism and energy, she fights to stay on her moral high ground. Thank goodness the dry old scholar dies! But even after death, he manages to poison the possibility of Dorothea and Will ever making a life together.Around this couple swarm their relatives and acquaintances, and others quests for their best lives. Each couple and each character is amusing and absorbing in their own way.Eliot's characters are introduced and drawn so very well that each personality is fully believable and real. But beyond that, Eliot looks at all of them, the best and the worst, from a viewpoint of loving and gentle amusement. Her pithy comments are hilarious, but never malicious. She draws the reader into her own frame of mind, and invites us to look at the variety of our fellow humans with compassion and laughter.In spite of its length, and several dizzy plunges into despair, this is a light and lively story, very readable and heartwarming."},{"Title":"Middlemarch","review":"George Eliot, (nom de plume of Mary Ann Evans), wrote a literary masterpiece with \\"Middlemarch.\\" I was forced to read this in school at an age when term papers and grades meant more than absorbing the riches this novel contains.

Let it suffice to say, I got back to \\"Middlemarch\\" 30 years later. And it was/is so worth the re-read!Ms. Eliot created, with this book, an entire community in England in the mid-1800s and called it Middlemarch.

She crowded them together, with all their ambitions, dreams and foibles, in this magnificent literary soap opera, and wove a wonderful web of plots and subplots. Ms. Eliot also wrote scathing social commentary and used great wit.The fortunes of Middlemarch are rising in this new era when machines and trains - fast, available transportation - are changing the world, the economy, the politics. Rigid social codes, the British class system, is in danger of being breached.

And it didn't hurt at all! :))"},{"Title":"Middlemarch","review":"I must admit that I was intimidated for years by this novel. It sat on my shelf for ages, neglected in favor of \\"easier\\" books to read. Once I started it though, I couldn't put it down.I generally read really quickly, but you really should take your time with every word of this novel. Otherwise you miss sentences like the following:\\"If we had a keen vision and feeling of all ordinary human life, it would be like hearing the grass grow and the squirrel's heart beat, and we should die of that roar which lies on the other side of silence.\\" !!!!!!!!!!! AMAZING.Not to mention a lushly romantic plot that really tears you apart. I couldn't believe how breathless I was during the interactions of two of the main characters.

But the dexterity and perceptiveness of Mary Anne Evans (pen name George Elliot) makes me feel clumsy and dull. if you care about writing, don't miss this book. It's sort of like watching Cirque du Soleil and thinking, \\"Humans can do *that*? Dang, I sure have been underestimating my potential. I wonder what more I can do.\\" It's elevating.Instructiveness aside, it's a delicious and suspenseful tale of colliding personalities, each drawn such that we understand their innermost thoughts, particularly the ones they wouldn't share with others and, most fascinating of all, the ones they won't even admit to themselves. Since this book was written in England in the 1800s, it's shocking how accurately the author captures the experience of today's American 20-somethings. The oppression of women is no more, thank goodness, but the general makeup of our innermost selves apparently is unchanged.Warning:The prose may feel heavy at first, since sentences are longer and more complex than what is considered \\"good writing\\" by today's standards.

At times I was just awestruck by the brilliance of the work. Several months later, I still am.

When choosing to read a classic novel, it can be very difficult to decide which edition is the best one to read. If you're considering tackling Middlemarch, I'd recommend this edition for several reasons. First, the novel is packaged with a helpful introduction and a chronology of George Eliot's life. There are also endnotes to the text, but, unlike some editions, there aren't too many endnotes--usually about 1 for every couple pages. This will keep you from flipping back to the endnotes every paragraph, which can be very disruptive to a good reading experience. Second, the paperback is well-constructed and can stand up to some rough treatment. This is important for such a long novel that is likely to be part of your life for several weeks at least. This paperback can take a beating without falling apart. Finally, the volume is fairly compact without sacrificing paper quality. The pages are thin in order to keep the size manageable, but they can stand up to underlining and highlighting. All in all, this is a good choice of an edition if you've decided to tackle this masterpiece."},{"Title":"Middlemarch","review":"George Eliot, (nom de plume of Mary Ann Evans), wrote a literary masterpiece with \\"Middlemarch.\\" I was forced to read this novel in school at an age when term papers and grades meant more than absorbing the riches this book contains.

I cannot recommend it highly enough. 5+ Stars!JANA"},{"Title":"Middlemarch","review":"I have been wanting to read this classic for a long time, and I've finally done it. Why did I wait so long?Middlemarch is primarily the story of Dorothea Brooke - a woman who wants to make the world a better place at a time when women were not encouraged to have ideas outside of their own homes. This ardent desire leads her to make some poor choices, and some admirable ones.This book is also a story about marriage. We see how Dorothea's marriage turns out - her sister Celia's marriage (Celia is the typical woman of her day), Rosamund's (the spoiled town beauty) marriage, and the marriage prospects of Mary Garth, a poor working girl.The author helps us to get inside the minds of her characters, which helps us to decide if we like them or not, or if we've made similar choices too. Often I found myself sympathizing with a character I initially disliked, because I was helped to see their emotions.It's very much a grown up book. If I had read this in my teens I would not have gained as much from the reading. There's no \\"and they lived happily ever after\\" here - Eliot keeps the story grounded.If I had to sum up Middlemarch, I'd say Eliot gives us an inside view of the lives of women in her day. There's also quite a bit of political talk, helping us see what it must have been like to live in England while so much was starting to change.For me, this book was just about perfect. One day I'd like to re-read it because I know there are some things I missed this time around.Recommended for those who like classic literature with a lot of depth. Some have called this book \\"Jane Austen for grown-ups\\" and while I love Jane Austen very much, I think I have to agree with that."},{"Title":"Middlemarch","review":"George Eliot's colossal novel \\"Middlemarch\\" is a literary White Pages of a rural town in pre-Victorian England, portraying several of its citizens in all the glories and disgraces (mostly disgraces) regarding their lives, marriages, and personal and professional ambitions, while using the historical and political events of the time as a backdrop. This is one of the finest examples of a character-driven novel, where the plot is customized to the characters, rather than the other way around.A major theme in this novel is marrying wrong. Dorothea Brooke, a girl with ideas of social reform -- one of her occupations is designing cottages for poor villagers -- marries the scholarly but stodgy Edward Casaubon, who is old enough to be her father, because she is attracted to his disciplined, erudite mind. However, Casaubon employs her as a sort of secretary and assistant and becomes increasingly demanding of her. Then there is the seemingly fairy-tale marriage of Tertius Lydgate, a brilliant and promising young physician, to Rosamond Vincy, spoiled daughter of the mayor of Middlemarch, a wealthy manufacturer. Rosamond's expensive tastes endanger their marriage financially and romantically. On the other hand, the marriage of Dorothea's younger sister Celia to the dapper Sir James Chettam is nothing but bubble-headed bliss because they both are too superficial to care for anything deeper than peerage and pulchritude.The novel ties its characters together with a few interrelated plot threads, the most important of which concerns Casaubon's young second cousin, Will Ladislaw. Will and Casaubon have little respect for each other, and when Casaubon suspects that Will and Dorothea are attracted to each other, he places a stipulation in his will denying Dorothea his fortune upon his death if she marries Will. Moreover, Will has been cheated out of his own fortune by Middlemarch banker Nicholas Bulstrode, who finances the hospital that employs Lydgate. Lydgate's association with the dishonest Bulstrode threatens to cause him further disgrace and ostracize him from the town.Meanwhile, Rosamond's brother Fred typifies the irresponsible young man with money problems who manages to reform himself and win the respect of the girl he loves. The irony is that Fred expected a great inheritance from a rich uncle who instead, on his deathbed, offered the money to his servant Mary Garth, who happens to be Fred's beloved. Now, Fred's only options are to join the clergy, which Mary would not approve of, or get a job -- with Mary's father.More serious and intellectual than the works of her immediate forebear Dickens, Eliot's novel seems to strike out bold new territory for British fiction of the time, especially considering the progressive mindsets of characters like Dorothea and Lydgate who act in contrast to tradition-bound grunts like Casaubon and the other town doctors. Her sophisticated prose style of intricately structured sentences and deep psychological penetration appears to have been a huge influence on Henry James. Much more than the sum of its parts, though, \\"Middlemarch\\" leaves its reader with a distinct impression of a time and place and, on reflection, the rewarding feeling of having accepted the challenge of reading it."},{"Title":"Middlemarch","review":"All summaries of its fantastic characterizations & plots aside, reading Middlemarch also made me realize that the power of concentrated and careful observation of human behavior (and the ability to translate that onto the page) that was practiced to perfection by Eliot, and that is the essence of the novel, is a dying art.No one writes books like this anymore because no one observes this carefully anymore. Perhaps that is in part because novels like Eliot's laid the groundwork for a typology of characters that can now be referred to in shorthand. But I think it is also because we no longer find meaning in that kind of contemplation, rather we leap immediately to analyze, ironize, & distance.It is truly an astonishing piece of work and while I have other favorites, I can think of no better writing in English."},{"Title":"Middlemarch","review":"This is a beautiful and romantic novel not to be missed by any fan of classic literature. The thick volume (795 pages) may be an instant put-off for some readers and the story does take a little while to develop, but TRUST ME, once you get past the first 50 pages, you'll be HOOKED and finding it difficult to put down the book.I love George Eliot's style of writing - beautifully and distinctively eloquent and expressive, and with such observance and skills in depicting the depths and complexities of human relations and the demands and passions of the heart. The book also explores the issues of &quot;class&quot; (e.g. in the courtship between gentleman Fred Vincy and working class Mary Garth), &quot;money&quot; (e.g. questions raised over Featherstone's will after the old miser's death), &quot;politics&quot; (on elections and the cause promoted by the 'liberal' Middlemarchers), &quot;scandals&quot; (especially concerning the dark secrets of the respected banker, Mr Bulstrode) and even &quot;murder&quot; - all portrayed brilliantly in high drama and with engrossing suspense.My favourite character is the heroine, the virtuous Dorothea Brooke whose life is made miserable by her marriage to the old, dull, selfish academician, Casaubon. Her later acquaintance with young Will Ladislaw who is Casaubon's cousin (&quot;cousin, not nephew&quot;, as the vain Casaubon always makes a point to clarify, due to the apparent age gap between them) provides Dorothea with the companionship of someone who listens to and respects her views and who brings a ray of sunshine and cheer into her otherwise lonely life. Love soon blossoms between Dorothea and Will but they're forbidden to court/marry even after Casaubon's death due to a nasty clause put in by Casaubon in his will. It was pure heartache to read of the feelings that these two have for each other but aren't able to express due to societal constraints. Will knows rather early on that he loves her; it takes Dorothea longer to realize her true feelings. I got all teary-eyed when I read the part where Dorothea, alone in her room and in a state of inescapable anguish, moans out &quot;Oh, I did love him!&quot; [And to quote]: &quot;... But she lost energy at last even for her loud-whispered cries and moans: she subsided into helpless sobs, and on the cold floor she sobbed herself to sleep&quot;.The other main characters are no less interesting and will easily capture the reader's heart and compassion. There's Dr Lydgate, an ambitious man whose marriage to the vain, beautiful but spoilt Rosamund Vincy turns out to be a most exasperating and expensive affair (you have to read the book to find out just how SO). There's also a love triangle involving Fred Vincy, Mary Garth and Farebrother (the vicar). The other smaller characters such as Bulstrode, his wife, Mr Garth (Mary's father), a blackmailer (Raffles) and others are all well-painted and believable, each with their own story to tell.Unlike some classics, this one provides a most satisfying ending because it discloses in the 'Finale' what happens later to the main characters after the &quot;main story&quot; has ended - e.g. up to what age they live to, if the (new) marriages are successful, how many children each couple has, etc.&quot;Middlemarch&quot; is a truly remarkable classic and a wonderful, wonderful read."},{"Title":"Middlemarch","review":"My comments are related only to the electronic version/aspect of this edition of Middlemarch rather than on the classic story. While this edition is readable it's a huge disappointment. There are so many typos that the reader is easily and regularly disturbed by trying to sort out misspellings, missing periods, or mangled sentences and paragraphs. Very unprofessional of Amazon to offer books that haven't been thoroughly edited. Kindle is a wonderful device - why not make sure the books are perfect? Why should a customer expect less in an e-versions than one does in hard copy?"},{"Title":"Middlemarch","review":"\\"Middlemarch\\" is such a glorious work that even an audiobook reading that doesn't express all its astonishing fecundity can still be a more satisfying experience than a silent reading. And so it is with Kate Reading's interpretation. She has a pleasant voice and she reads the dialogue very well but obviously doesn't grasp what George Eliot is getting at much of the time. Every sentence has rapier-like point, most of it humorous, and Reading rarely seems to get the joke. She passes obliviously over the words which require the emphasis of a consummate joke-teller; it's like hearing a joke flatly told. You might get it but it needs work on your part.Reading also makes a hash of Eliot's frequent long sentences. She begins them breezily, seems to have them under control, but then starts to labour as the additional clauses make their appearance, and almost sputters to a halt before effortfully spurring them on to the bitter end. To be fair to her, sentences such as these are rarely to be found in any literature under a century old and the tradition of the Epic Sentence has foundered somewhere in Hemingwayville. Still, I think anyone attempting a reading of any work should know precisely what they're reading and not a mere approximation of it. However, I'll point out that Reading is not alone in this sin.Despite these misgivings, I still like this reading because it only requires a bit of extra concentration and inner modification of Reading's delivery to bring Eliot's magnificent novel to life. I can't think of a work that so unequivocally and consistently articulates its ideas: it comes closer to providing an education it itself than any other novel I can think of."},{"Title":"Middlemarch","review":"I bought the Barnes and Noble edition of this book back in 2004. I just got around to reading it. I enjoyed it a lot. It's a rich novel with lots of still-relevant insights regarding life. But the edition! There were spelling mistakes or typos on practically every page. It's jarring to read and it began to drive me crazy towards the end. Hopefully there is a new Barnes and Noble edition of the book and they have since corrected these mistakes."},{"Title":"Middlemarch","review":"Remember the first time you read a classic, expecting it to be hard work: dreary \\"educational\\" stories, and abstruse language? And then you read it and found out to your delight that good writing meant it was easy to read and kept your interest? Middlemarch is simply fun to read. The language is high, and for some readers perhaps \\"wordy,\\" but not the type of wordiness that has too many descriptions of things. It's thoughtful. Middlemarch is really an elevated soap opera, with completely filled out and amusing characters, angst filled situations, and lots of interesting history. If you like to read about the Victorian era, enjoy the repression they live under, and like to long for people to speak their hearts when they feel they can't, then you'll like this book. It is very long, but I always appreciate that when it's a good story, and this is definitely a good story."},{"Title":"Middlemarch","review":"It is an English classic, of course, but it is more than one of those books you only read when you are taking a course in English Literature.

It is one of my top 5 literature books.Since it is divided in short chapters, and it's a huge book, I decided to read only one or two chapters a day. It was an unforgettable experience. If you love reading, I mean really love good books, then this one is for you.Treat yourself well for a month. Read it.It's George Eliot's best work."},{"Title":"Middlemarch","review":"An astonishing accomplishment by George Eliot. I think what I really enjoy more than anything else in &quot;Middlemarch&quot; are Eliot's piercing insights into the nature of human beings, which she intertwines with the stories of Dorothea and Lydgate. Dorothea and Lydgate are both marvelously developed characters, whose idealism traps them each in marriages which hinder their ability to accomplish what each really wants in life. The metaphor of St. Theresa and Dorothea is carried throughout the book, adding a complex subtext. Finally, although some readers complain at Eliot's sometimes didactic narration, I think Eliot's strong sense of the responsibility of educating while entertaining sets her apart from her contemporaries. And it allows her to create one of the most beautful endings ever written in literature. Like Dorothea, we are all called to do good in our lifetime in the hope that it will influence other people down the road to do the same."},{"Title":"Middlemarch","review":"I love this book (I have read it before) and thought I would get it on Kindle since it is one of my favorites. Unfortunately the Kindle version must have been slapped quickly into digital format via optical character reader or something similar, with no quality check done on it. It is full of typos that would have been easily caught with a simple spellcheck, for example instead of the word \\"call\\" it said \\"cal:\\" There are numerous examples of this and it is very distracting."},{"Title":"Middlemarch","review":"Virginia Woolf once said that &quot;Middlemarch&quot; was the first novel written for adults and she is correct. With the exception of Fielding's &quot;Amelia&quot; this is one of the first books to marry off its heroine before the first 150 pages and to let the audience realize the consequences of not examining the real nature of one's future mate.The book is set in the reform period and all of the main characters are intent of carrying out some measure of reform. Dorothea Brooke wants to make poverty as appealling as wealth, Dr. Lydgate wants to reform medical care to eliminate diseases with the latest methods. Dorthea's uncle Mr. Brooke wants to get elected to parliament on the &quot;reform ticket,&quot; Mr. Casaubon, who later marries Dorothea, wants to reform scholarship by producing something called &quot;The Key to the World's Mythologies.&quot;It probably will not spoil the book by revealing that none of these reforms are realized. All are wrecked by human nature and flaws in the characters themselves. The only person who succeeds is Mary Garth who manages to reform Fred Vincey who begins as a rascal, bellowing for something called a marrow bone for breakfast and then transforms into a likable figure. This I think is key to what is afoot in Middlemarch. Before society can really be reformed, human nature needs to be so regulated as to permit a more general reform of society. Some may dismiss this as a simplistic solution, but it is no more a simplistic approach than those theories that ignore human nature as they build castles in the air, just like the people of Middlemarch.I must confess that I found this book slow going at first. I think that the key to the book is that Eliot does not consider any particular character as the mouthpiece of her ideas (for a while I thought Dorothea was meant to be Eliot herself, but she is too great an artist to make this kind of mistake). No, this is Eliot's best book and rightly so. She does not cheat in the characterization which is one of the strengths of the book. This makes her work shine through nearly 150 years later."},{"Title":"Middlemarch","review":"I really stand in awe of Ms Eliot's tremendous talent. I would not like to be classified among those modern day literary critics who indicate that a certain author's plots aren't worth much, but the books are saved by their wonderfully constructed sentences. But there is no doubt that GE is a master of the language. She is a writer of profound elegance who shows a deep understanding of human psychology. All that said I am pleased to say that she can also write a darn good story.Middlemarch is one of many Victorian novels that presents the plight of women during that period (how many other women were out there with writing talent that were stifled, I wonder). There are three plots in the novel that examine male and female relationships and the role that both sexes play during courting and marriage, and we learn how women were treated with condescension if they voiced an opinion on something. But this is not a gothic romance novel. It is a beautifully written story of the social milieu of English provincial life around 1830.There is a certain law that pertains to Victorian novels: If a character is married early in the novel, then that marriage is doomed to failure. Middlemarch follows the law scrupulously. You must be married in the book's waning pages if you want to live happily ever after. Dorothea is a wealthy young woman who marries a scholastic, elderly clergyman because she wants to gain knowledge at the feet of a master. Unfortunately he is a dried up fig with no ability to communicate wisdom. He dies but leaves Dorothea with a burdensome restriction in the will: she can not marry a man that she also loves. Dr. Lydgate marries a dim and self centered woman who sees a husband solely as a provider of a fine life style. And poor drifting Fred courts a plain, but bright commoner who will continue to reject his advances until he settles down and finds a career for himself.Now maybe that plot outline makes you yawn, but it is the way that George Eliot tells it that makes the difference. She presents a crystal clear picture of these people and their lives and society and even politics. And despite her stately language GE has an engaging, subtle humor to her writing. Mr. Crabbe, the glazier, loved joining the group for gossip, and is described as one \\"who gathered much news and then groped among it dimly.\\"My copy of Middlemarch is the Norton Critical Edition, and I highly recommend it. It contains and extra 150 pages of Ms Eliot's letters about the book; her notes laying out the story; and some interesting contemporary and current reviews and analyses of the novel. Henry James, liked it, but had some criticisms of the lead characters, which I found myself (sort of)agreeing with. It's a great supplement to a great novel."},{"Title":"Middlemarch","review":"Middlemarch by George Eliot. Highly recommended.It seems that it's nearly impossible to talk about Middlemarch without mentioning its breadth and scope. The irony is that the entire novel takes place within the confines of this small community and within the sometimes-small minds of its various citizens.Although a vast number of characters populate Middlemarch and its environs, each who speaks has a distinctive voice, yet does not fall into being mere type only. The horse dealer sounds like a horse dealer-but one with a particular background and perspective. The setting itself represents every type of town, suburb, village, or neighborhood where you'll find the complacent, the critical, the aspiring, the intellectual, the earthy, the wealthy, the poor, and the worker in between. As with many English novels, the setting, in this case Middlemarch, becomes as much a central character as any other, whether it's Dorothea or Lydgate.The tapestry Eliot weaves is complex; one character's actions can affect the lives of others he or she may rarely meet, while the unknown behavior and works of Bulstrode in his youth decades ago eventually touch nearly all.How the characters come together is sometimes obvious, sometimes subtle. Dorothy's interest in Causabon, although a puzzle to her friends and family, is painted in broad strokes to the reader; her later interest in Will Ladislaw, grows somewhat more delicately if based in the same altruistic roots. Mary Garth and Fred Vincy have, in their way, come together in their childhoods; they are still struggling with mutually agreeable terms that will allow both to acknowledge the love and affection that are already there. Lydgate and Rosamond are both more of a puzzle and less of one-a case of two opposed personalities with opposing views, opposing goals, and opposing personalities drawn together by that most capricious of matchmakers, proximity and circumstance, to form a union that will frustrate both and satisfy neither.Against the background of these four sometimes difficult relationships (Dorothea and Causabon with its lack of love or eros, Dorothea and Will with the barriers set by Causabon's will and that of the Middlemarch society who frown on Will and Dorothea's association with him, Fred and Mary with her imposed restrictions to set him on the correct course in life before she can make a commitment to him, and Lydgate and Rosamond with their diametrical oppositions) is the long, happy marriage of Nicholas Bulstrode and his Vincy wife Harriet. Unlike the others, there are no visible barriers to their happiness, and they are happy as a couple-except for the events in Bulstrode's past that haunt him in the back of his mind and then at the front with the appearance of Raffles. The marriage survives the ensuing scandal, but the individuals-Nicholas and Harriet-become poor shadow of their former selves.It is in a town like Middlemarch that a woman like Dorothea will find it impossible to find approbation for her plans and Bulstrode will find the antagonism of those who have come to terms with their own worldly desires. It is in a town like Middlemarch that merely the raving words of a delirium tremens-afflicted Raffles can upset the respectable work of a respectable lifetime. The downfall of Bulstrode validates the town and its modernizing secular culture.Middlemarch is a novel of insight into personality, motivations, social behaviours, and history. In the end, even the happiest characters have failed at most if not all of their youthful aspirations and have become variations on the Middlemarch theme-husbands, wives, fathers, mothers, sons, daughters, day-to-day toilers rather than dreamers and achievers. Middlemarch is Everytown, where you will find an example or two of Everyone-and their dreams or lack thereof.If you intend to glean the utmost from it, begin with an annotated, critical edition; while Eliot enjoyed a high enough level of erudition to reference the current events of 1830s England along with mythology, religion, quotations, and developments in science and medicine, most of us today cannot begin to follow them without assistance. Knowledge of these references will enrich the rich text of a rich mind.Diane L. Schirf, 1 September 2002."},{"Title":"Middlemarch","review":"This novel by Mary Ann Evans - nom de plume, George Eliot - who lived with a man out of wedlock for most of her life and who throughout her adult life was a confirmed nonbeliever - or \\"nullifidian\\" as she would say - proved a difficult one for me to spend a week rereading. I am, no doubt, overly impressionable about literature and oversensitive to the world in which I inhabit whilst in an author's grasp. But I was clinically depressed through, say, the last few hundred pages of the book, and then felt my eyes tear in tender exultation through the final thirty. Those few hundred pages are necessary, I see again now, for making this book into a true work of art rather than a soap opera or soap box speech, but the strain on the reader - or this reader - is well-nigh unbearable. What Ms. Evans does here is to build up a moralistic universe in her provincial Middlemarch filled with humbug and cant and then bring it crashing down around the sometimes tawdry cast of characters which she deftly creates.For, make no mistake, the true heroes of this book are Dorothea (\\"Gift of the gods\\" in Greek) and Ladislaw (an obviously somewhat domesticated version of the poet Shelley). They are the hub of the wheel around which all the other spokes revolve. They are, with their ardent natures and spiritual longings, the characters that linger - at times like guttering candles - in the back of the reader's mind all through this heavy weave of a novel. We are conscious all along of the \\"real\\" life going on as it does in the \\"pallid quaintness\\" of Dorothea's \\"blue-green boudoir\\":\\"Nothing had been outwardly altered there; but while the summer had gradually advanced over the western fields beyond the avenue of the elms, the bare room had gathered within it those memories of an inward life which fill the air as with a cloud of good or bad angels, the invisible yet active forms of our spiritual triumphs or spiritual falls.\\"In the meantime (i.e., through the greater part of the novel) Ms. Evans painfully yet deftly guides us through what she at one point calls \\"the irony of events.\\" So immersed do we become in the tedious banalities of the inward lives of the characters, the human misery and spiritual stolidness of these village worthies that the entire world comes to seem a very washed-out realm indeed. So that when things finally do come around for Dorothea and Ladislaw, the cosmos of Middlemarch is turned upside-down in a wondrous moment:\\"The wind was dashing against the window-panes as if an angry spirit were within it, and behind it was the great swoop of the wind: it was one of those moments in which both the busy and the idle pause with a certain awe.\\"----For Lo! The two soul-mates of the novel have - the ultimate taboo in a world ruled by class, money fears and concerns, petty gossip and scandal that can ruin one - tremblingly, kissed!The reader can have no idea how breathtaking and world-shattering this moment is from this review. It comes after hundreds of pages in which the one has been dragged through the spiritual wasteland of Middlemarch, in which men and women have had their souls and livelihoods crushed by the mundane and quotidian, described by Ms Evans with Inquisitorial detail. One has begun to wonder if love, yes love, exists at all in the world.For, again, it is exalted, Romantic love with which Ms. Evans is primarily concerned, thrown into sublime relief by her detailed, plodding description of the drab world. To lift a phrase from the last sentence in the book, it is for those who have \\"lived faithfully a hidden life\\" - much as Ms. Evans did - which the rest of the world scorns, for whom this book is written."},{"Title":"Middlemarch","review":"My girlfriend recommended we take a class together,and had she not, I most likely would not have ever read this book. I am so glad she did! It is not the easiest read, after years of mainly reading contemporary literature, it took my brain a minute to adjust to the use of language, and also the way the Eliot writes. This is a book about ordinary people, and though nothing \\"major\\" happens ( no hurricane tears the town apart, there are no distinct villians, monsters, or massive catastrophes), the book is full of interesting events. And though it takes place in the 1830's, and the characters must obey the constraints of their time, they are still timeless, and Eliot proves herself to be a master of human behavior. I am still reading, since the class covers a book a week, and I don't want to peek ahead-I am enjoying reading this much in the same way as it was published, as a serial, anticipating each week that I get to dive forward in the story.On a separate note, I ordered 2 copies of this book, one for me and one for my friend. One of copies showed up in a pretty beat up condition. I called Amazon's customer service and they were great-apologized for the condition and gave me a courtesy refund. That was totally unexpected, as in the past, they have simply offered me a free return/exchange. I love Amazon!"},{"Title":"Middlemarch","review":"Middlemarch is a justifiably world-famous classic. However, this edition frequently sapped all the joy I experienced from George Eliot's witty dialogues and colloquies. It is full of misspellings, paragraph indentations that actually interrupt sentences, and even missing words, so that there were points when I could barely come to understand what had been Eliot's original meaning. When I was choosing which edition to buy, I read reviews of several other editions that mentioned poorly edited copies, but this one had no comment on the actual edition itself, just on the content (which I took to mean the path was safe). Nobody will dispute what a great read is Eliot's perception of the inner mind -- this is an early psychological thriller, if you are interested in people living in ambiguity and conflict and if you choose to read it that way. But I wanted to hurl this edition at the wall on numerous occasions. Considering that it was not one of the cheapest on the market, this product is shameless. Come on, Digireads, get a copy editor! You should refund people's money for such a shoddy job!"},{"Title":"Middlemarch","review":"My dad believes this is the greatest novel written in the nineteenth century and the second greatest novel of all time. The number one spot he gives to Ernest Hemingway's THE SUN ALSO RISES. He made me read this when I was in junior high school and because I was kind of being forced, I didn't like it so much.But last night I went back to this story about life in a provincial English town and now I see what I didn't see back then and that my dad was right, when he said about this book, \\"You can't consider yourself educated if you haven't read it.\\""},{"Title":"Middlemarch","review":"I'll give you my favorite quote. Will Ladislaw, a devoted admirer of the book's lead- Dorothea, is caught by her in what appears to be a precarious situation with another woman (I won't reveal who). This woman flippanty tells Will he can follow Dorothea (who fled the scene), and \\"explain his preference\\":'He found another vent for his rage by snatching up [her] words again, as if they were reptiles to be throttled and flung off. \\"Explain!

I would rather touch her hand if it were dead, than I would touch any other woman's living.\\"'Quick review: one aspect of this novel is about unwise choices in marraige, HOWEVER, this novel is NOT anti-marraige (as the most popular positive review seems to allude). In fact, at its core is the idea of marraige for love and, in several cases, this novel examplifies the need of pushing through trials with your spouse (Lydgate, Garth, and even creepy Bulstrode). No character walks away from their marraige in this novel, and ultimately it has happy endings.What I love most about Dorothea is that she LEARNS throughout the novel. That she changes. In the beginning she is prudish, opinionated, and spurns romance to marry a man under a disillusioned ideal it will broaden her usefulness. At first I didn't care for her, I liked her sister better (who becomes somewhat silly later on). Through her trials, Dorothea softens. She is humbled. She sees the value in others and spurns viscious gossip and judgments. By the end of the book, my opinion of her has managed to rotate 180 degrees.I've already said more than I intended, but I hope you give this novel a chance."},{"Title":"Middlemarch","review":"George Eliot has woven a wonderful story here about marriage, rural life, and reputations in 19th century England. The characters are all flawed but I enjoyed them nonetheless. Life is full of decisions, and, unfortunately our decisions can come back to haunt us all our lives. Still we must make the best of things and the characters here do (in their own ways). I was impressed with the author's (Ms. Eliot?) wit and searing intelligence. She doesn't overwhelm with details and descriptions - there is rarely a wasted word - hard to imagine over this many pages. The volume has lots of helpful footnotes. It is a great bargain for anyone who wants to see what a truly great novel is."},{"Title":"Middlemarch","review":"Some people had warned me that the writing of George Eliot (the pen name of Mary Ann Evans, 1819-80) was heavy and uninteresting, but that only piqued my interest in her writing all the more. I am very, very glad I took up the challenge of reading this 890-page story, and I look forward to reading everything else George Eliot has written.Although the inhabitants of the rural English town of Middlemarch live in a time now vanished (the 1830s), their thoughts and feelings are timeless representations of human nature. I was amazed at George Eliot's mastery of observation. She has a way of describing in precise detail complicated human emotions, and the (often irrational) motivations behind them, that I've never encountered in any other writer. Psychologically, she was definitely ahead of her time in her ability to understand and analyze these emotions.It's true that the book is not without heaviness; for instance, I could have enjoyed experiencing the characters' live just as much without the political essays that Eliot weaves throughout the narrative, but these tangents were just a small annoyance and did not at all spoil my enjoyment of her rich descriptions of the many memorable individuals of Middlemarch.On finishing this book, I was most affected by Eliot's observations that the drama of daily life often is not what we perceive (and often is not as bad as we think) and that even if we feel insignificant, this does not mean that our lives have no positive effect on those around us. As she so expertly puts it, &quot;...the growing good of the world is partly dependent on un-historic acts [and is] owing to the number who lived faithfully a hidden life...&quot;."},{"Title":"Middlemarch","review":"This is a must read book considering all the references to it in literature. But why? The dialog and narrative direction are remarkably similar to that of Jane Austin books and neither is especially relevant from anything but a historical perspective. I suspect that apart from those values there are the wonderfully insightful lines such as these:\\"Souls have complexions too: what will suit one will not suit another.\\"\\"A man's mind - what there is of it - has always the advantage of being masculine, - as the smallest birch-tree is of a higher kind than the most soaring palm, - and even his ignorance is of a sounder quality.\\"\\"...when a woman is not contradicted, she has no motive for obstinacy in her absurdities.\\"\\"Pride helps us; and pride is not a bad thing when it only urges us to hide our own hurts - not to hurt others.\\"\\"...the mistakes that we male and female mortals make when we have our own way might fairly raise some wonder that we are so fond of it.\\"\\"The difficult task of knowing another soul is not for young gentlemen whose consciousness is chiefly made up of their own wishes.\\"\\"But Aquinas, now - he was a little too subtle, wasn't he? Does anybody read Aquinas?\\"\\"...it is seldom a medical man has true religious views, - there is too much pride of intellect.\\""},{"Title":"Middlemarch","review":"Dorothea Brooke is young, beautiful and idealistic. She is also unfashionable, bookish and, much to her younger sister's annoyance, pious and opinionated. Miss Brooke is considered a great catch in the provincial town of Middlemarch. She and her younger sister Celia are orphans, under their uncle's care, and the oldest has a sensible dowry in her favor. She has her choice of suitors, including Sir James Chettam, whom everyone approves of. But it is Mr. Casaubon, a local cleric, who catches Dorothea's eye -- much to Celia's confusion. After all, Mr. Casaubon is old and hideous, not to mention boring! Alas, Miss Brooke, with her romantic impulses, marries her chosen one. She later realizes the error of her ways, of course, and when her husband dies, she later remarries. Another mistake. Mr. Lydgate, a jaded doctor, proves to be worse than the predecessor. And so, with a number of interesting (some even unlikable) characters, and subplots centered on relationships, politics, academia, religion and small town intrigue, Middlemarch is a beautiful and readable book, one of the finest in the English language.George Eliot has once again wowed me. Daniel Deronda was a favorite of mine, but Middlemarch has replaced it in my estimations. There is so much to find here, so many potential book discussions, that I wouldn't be able to talk about it all in one single paragraph. One of those things is, of course, centered on the parallels between Dorothea Brooke and George Elliot herself. Many believe that this character is based on the author. I am sure that real-life experiences had inspired Eliot to write this book. Dorothea also reminds me a great deal of Gwendolen from Daniel Deronda. She, too, is somewhat impulsive and unthinking. Of course, Dorothea is not quite as spoiled or as irritating as Gwendolen. Still, the similarities are there. Anyway, small town intrigue plays a major role here as well, and we get to know the characters as though you were from Middlemarch and they were your neighbors. Another thing that stands out in this book is the psychological aspect of the relationships between the characters, not only with those who are married, but also with those who long for someone/something unobtainable and the heartaches that come with it. Eliot did some deep character study for this novel, and modern-day readers might relate to this book. First published in 1871, but set in 1829 and onward, Middlemarch is one of the biggest and most moving classics. This is the first time I read it, and it definitely won't be the last."},{"Title":"Middlemarch","review":"As young people grew up in England in the 1800s, there was much excitement and interest in their prospects for marriage. In this story, there are several young people on the brink of joining the married population of the town.Dorothea, beautiful and religiously devout, with some money of her own and no parents, is considered quite a catch, and is pursued by the nearby baronet landowner. She feels her life's purpose, though, is to marry the much older religious scholar Casaubon, and dreams that she will help him with his work and gain a deeper understanding of the world.Rosamond, a gorgeous girl accomplished in music and fine manners, has rejected all of the eligible young men in town. She would like a life more glamorous. When a new doctor comes to town, she makes her decision that this will be the husband for her.Fred, a loafer and gambler, would like to settle down with his childhood friend, the dependable Mary. His prospects for independence seem to keep slipping away from him, though, along with the possibility of his winning Mary.I enjoyed reading these varied accounts of love, desire, and marriage, and thought the treatment of the marriages was realistic and well written. Dorothea's marriage was especially painful, as was the continued miscommunication in Rosamond's marriage. Both women came to the difficult realization that what they had imagined and what marriage was actually like were two very different things.I really liked the supplementary characters, too, especially Farebrother, who continues to be honest and true to himself even in the most difficult circumstances. Bulstrode is also a fascinating side character, with a compelling backstory and an interesting role to play in ruining lives in this story.There were enough intertwined plotlines in this story to keep me fascinated with Middlemarch right up until the end."},{"Title":"Middlemarch","review":"This is a wonderfully sophisticated, intelligent book with sharp commentary on multiple social issues of her time.(and ours in certain aspects) All of the characters are wonderfully imperfect, restrained and original and are caught in the intriguing webs of dilemmas but their behviors are very coherent with their characters and subcultures. This author truly deserves our utmost respect."},{"Title":"Middlemarch","review":"George Eliot (pseudonym for Mary Ann Evans) penned a masterpiece when she wrote Middlemarch. This mid-19th century tale of the lives and loves of a variety of British townspeople is skillfully and intricately woven. Perhaps its most compelling character is Dorothea, who is intense in her religious duty and in her deep emotional sensibility; two characteristics that interplay with turmoil as she faces marriage and remarriage. Her first husband, Mr. Casaubon, is an ancient and crusty scholar, who attempts to win her promise of eternal devotion even after his death. Both her marriage and widowhood are complicated by her deep connection to her husband's cousin, the irresistible Mr. Ladislaw, whom she eventually marries at the expense of her late husband's fortune.Rosamond Vincy is a much shallower woman, who, in spite of her outward loveliness, has a soul that is priggish and bent on absolute self-service. She effectively ruins her husband, Dr. Lydgate, both financially and relationally. Mary Garth is perhaps the most admirable woman in the book; she is sensible, steadfast, and self-sacrificing. She will not allow herself to be swayed by romantic whimsy; yet she does retain a deep devotion to her first and only true love, Fred Vincy - an irresponsible but well-meaning young man who eventually, through Mary's love, is able to make something of himself.Numerous other characters people the fascinating landscape of Middlemarch - among them Mr. Bulstrode, a pious but tortured soul, whose transgressions and hypocrisy lead him to a wretched end; Mr. Farebrother, a kindly and faithful rector who helps everyone he can, even when it means giving up his own chance for happiness; Sir James Chettam, Dorothea's suitor and then her sister Celia's husband, and the strongest opponent to both of Dorothea's marriages; Celia herself, who plays a significant role in the early chapters but then fades to not much more than a foil to Dorothea; and Mr. Featherstone, the cantankerous old bachelor who holds sway over his entire extended family by keeping them guessing as to the contents of his will - a will which eventually affects many other aspects of the story as well.How Mary Ann Evans was able to create such a fascinating, intriguing, and moving story, I can only begin to guess. In spite of its dry-at-times (yet undeniably intelligent) political wrangling and references that are now unfamiliar to most readers, the book is filled with literary excellence, a masterful plotline, and vivid characterization. And moreover, it is enlivened, Austen-like, with pungent and poignant little insights into humanity. What is said of Dorothea at the end of the book can be said of the general events of the story itself - \\"Certainly those determining acts of her life were not ideally beautiful... But the effect of her being on those around her was incalculably diffusive: for the growing good of the world is partly dependent on unhistoric acts.\\"Middlemarch is not an epic; it is not the most world-renowned novel ever written. It is a little religiously sardonic; some have called it humanistic. Yet in its faithful depiction of a set of very real characters and the choices and chances that defined their lives, it can contribute a little something to our understanding of ourselves and of the world. In that way, it is indeed not ideally beautiful; but without a doubt, it can be incalculably diffusive."},{"Title":"Middlemarch","review":"I read this as part of my studies but it is a beautifully set and written piece by Eliot. It is an 800 odd page book but is one that musn't be rushed, it is a book that must be savoured and lingered over as it truly is a work of art in its own right. Even if you are not a fan of literary works, this book is a must because Eliot is a genius of her age and many of her ponderings are things that even we as people of the 21st century can find relevant. I can only say read it because this book is worth the many hours of toiling, even worth the time bearing the ghastly Casaubon."},{"Title":"Middlemarch","review":"This book is better than Pride and Prejudice, Emma, Madame Bovary or even Anna Karennia. Sentence structure is wonderful. And depth of character is seldom equaled. Magnificent!"},{"Title":"Middlemarch","review":"great book I loved reading it its written so beatifully, I definately recomended it brings you back to england in the 1800's ."},{"Title":"Middlemarch","review":"Middlemarch is a challenging book to read for several reasons. One, it is too long. Two, the author has a tendency to go off on philosophical tangents. Three, the author will sometimes spend several paragraphs on the inner workings of the mind of a very minor character who is hardly pertinent to the story. These flaws aside, I will say that I enjoyed Middlemarch very much. It is easy to get caught up in the lives of Dorthea, Will, Fred, Mary, Dr.Lydgate and Rosamond and many others. George Eliot wrote wonderful dialogue in this book--the conversations between characters are very interesting. I thought Dr. Lydgate was the most compelling person in the book. He had such high hopes and was a good and honorable man. Yet, he let himself be ensnared in a silly marriage and here the author is very insightful in portraying Dr.Lydgates trapped, disappointed existence with Rosamond. What he wants in a wife and marriage and what she wants in a husband and marriage are miles apart and so, in the end, they resign themselves to one another. I also liked the character of Mary. She's a strong woman who knows what she wants. Although Dorthea can be irritating at times, with her insistence that everyone see things the way she does, she is good and goodness is appealing in a central character. Her relationship with Will Ladislaw is portrayed well. Their love for one another was truly believable. While reading Middlemarch, there were a few times in which I felt as if I were slogging through, but there were many more times when I didn't want to put it down. So, all in all, a good read and worth the effort."},{"Title":"Middlemarch","review":"The version of MIDDLEMARCH I read was the Modern Library edition with an introduction by A.S. Byatt. Ms. Byatt mentions that Eliot was the great English novelist of \\"ideas\\", and as such was the progenitor of Proust and Mann. Reading MIDDLEMARCH, I can understand her point. As far as Victorian novelists go, George Eliot was Dickens with a finer sense of wit, and a subtler intelligence.MIDDLEMARCH centers on Dorothea Brooke, a young woman with fervent and noble ideas and ideals, and a hunger for intellectual enrichment. Unfortunately, she lives in a time and place which is not conducive to the attainment of her aspirations, and winds up in an unfulfilling marriage to Casaubon, a sickly cleric much older than herself, a pedantic scholar of theology and antiquity, who wanted an obedient secretary for his life's work as well as a dedicated and subservient wife, more than (as she had hoped) a life partner on the road to discovery. While married to him, she meets his cousin Wil Ladislaw, a young man of keen intellect and a passion for art, but with a dubious past and unsettled future.Another key character is Tertius Lydgate, a young doctor who comes to the provincial town of Middlemarch to do research, make great discoveries for the benefit of mankind, run a hospital and practice that will utilize his knowledge for good more than for personal financial gain. He falls in love with, and marries the mayor's daughter Rosamund Vincy, a very pretty but shallow woman. Related to the Vincys through marriage is Peter Featherstone, a miserly old landowner in failing health whose demise might benefit Rosamund's brother, and Nicholas Bulstrode, a wealthy banker (with an overly pious attitude) and influential member of the town council, who has many important enemies in Middlemarch, as well as an awful secret to hide.MIDDLEMARCH is a novel about relationships and about human aspirations and how society (in this case provincial 18th century English society), conspires to thwart those aspirations. Unlike Dickens, who likes to paint in broad strokes and vivid colors, Eliot is much subtler in her craft. Her characters have complex tones to their personalities. MIDDLEMARCH is a finely wrought study of these characters and of the times that nurtured them, influenced them, and ultimately affected their fortunes.George Eliot is a keen observer of her environment, and beyond the people themselves, of the religious, social, and political factors which complicate interpersonal relationships. All this done with a wit and wisdom as well as a sense of understanding and compassion that exude from every page."},{"Title":"Middlemarch","review":"This is an excellent historical novel which has everything. George Elliot's wonderfully expressive prose, excellent character analysis, and insightful observations make this is a book a treasure to read. Her sensitive descriptions of the motivation behind each of the characters actions was incredibly insightful and convincing. I was captivated by the large variety of colorful characters. Each character was well-developed, and I saw myself and others around me in so many of their feelings and motivations that the characters seemed uncannily real, something few authors have been able to achieve.In addition to the character development, George Elliot captured the political and societal tensions and norms of the time. She showed how these tensions and opinions influenced the motivations, aspirations, and decisions of her characters. So much of &quot;who we are&quot; is shaped by the political and societal pressures of the time-period we live in, and George Ell! iot captured this better than any author I have read. Yet she didn't lose track of the fact that every person reacts to these political and societal pressures differently. The spirit and development of the characters was engrossing.This is truly a work of literature. George Elliot is a talented author and I look forward to reading more of her works."},{"Title":"Middlemarch","review":"This is a review for the CD Audio book only, as read by Harriet Walker, issued by Penguin Classics.

This is a story about three couples - Fred and Mary, Dorothea and Ladislaw and Rosamund and Lyndgate.

Every bit of gossip is laid out and every substantial movement of a main character dissected and looked at from all angles.In short, this was the longest book I've ever read. And I'm sad to say I just did not like it all that much.I often remarked to my family as I was trudging my way through this novel that, at times, it felt as if I was sitting and watching a snail decide which direction to move in. Now, don't get me wrong - the characters were vibrant. They could have sprung off the page, full of life if Eliot (to borrow a Tolkien term here) had not the patience of an Ent. So. Much. Detail. Ugh. I cannot get over how long this book took to read.I loved the Epilogue though (and for more reasons than it just signifying the end!) and I'm proud of myself for sticking it through and for grasping the story and understanding the significance of why she wrote it the way she did. It had to be done that way - the actual \\"action\\" in the book would have been disappointing on its own without all of the build-up. But instead of feeling a triumphant release at the ending I felt more a calm sigh of relief and had a \\"thank God\\" moment (both for it being the end and for getting what I wanted at the end of the book).I would not have read this book if I hadn't been involved in the 1001 Books to Read Before you Die challenge. And honestly, I'm dreading the next George Eliot I pick up, but at least I've armed myself with some knowledge and know how to approach it now. Bits at a time with plenty of action-filled books in between."},{"Title":"Middlemarch","review":"This is an extraordinary novel and I like to refer to many passages over and over again. First, I love the texture of the novel. The way George Eliot describes her characters is bold and delicate at the same time. I like the subject matter immensely as I recall the earliest days of the Women's Liberation era. We called it, Womens' Lib. for short, that is, those of us who supported the cause of equality. With Middlemarch, Eliot gives us a view of love and marriage we moderns are happy to call social history. Written in the nineteenth century, we are introduced to women whose pervasive disadvantage in life was to be brainwashed that they were inferior to men. They were anything but inferior and Eliot captures the mentality of her women with compassion and artistry. She is descriptive without being overly critical. Today we refer to these martyred women with clinical terms; masochistic, depressed, borderline. The idea here is that seeing and accepting a one down position suggests that one's ego and personality are regressed. These may or may not be accurate diagnosis but its not about the label anyway. Its about the humanity Eliot is in touch with. Middlemarch truly is about the metaphysics of morals (Iris Murdoch). This particular version does not provide enough background information or insights into the life and times of Eliot. Since I care about those times from a social and literary standpoint, I plan to order an expanded version on Amazon. What were those factors that influenced Eliot's sensibility and unique style of writing? She was way ahead of her time. I want to know, how come?"},{"Title":"Middlemarch","review":"I've been buying Norton Critical Editions for years, I guess because I got used to them in college, but this will probably be the last one.The paper is superthin and has too much show-through, making it a strain to read the very small, cramped, long-lined type. The text had a surprising number of typos--not historical misspellings left in because they were in Eliot's original version, but outright stupid mistakes that the proofreader should have caught. The cover stock is soft and flimsy and dogeared instantly; the jacket is ugly.I would have enjoyed reading this excellent book a lot more if the physical object itself had been less disappointing. Treat yourself to a nicer edition (which will probably cost a lot less, anyway), and borrow the library's copy if you want to read the critical articles."},{"Title":"Middlemarch","review":"...although I think she does more interesting novelistically that are prescient about modernism in what I think is her greatest novel about an English Jew wanting to return to Palestine."},{"Title":"Middlemarch","review":"Having searched on Amazon for the the audiobook version of Middlemarch, I finally came upon this MP3 version on 2 CDs, which costs much less than others. The narrator Nadia May is a capable and experienced reader that knows how to capture the essence of words and sentences. The novel itself I would rate a 5-star, and in my humble opinion, the only novel in existence that could be equally compared to Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre. The only slight downside to this MP3 edition is that Nadia May's voice is a bit crackly; well, that's to be expected since she's an old woman. But other than that, her reading speed is just right and she pronounces very clearly."},{"Title":"Middlemarch","review":"this is quite simply, the best novel in the English language.

I'm giving this five stars, as you're not allowed to give no stars at all."},{"Title":"Middlemarch","review":"I have persisted for far too long with this dreary, long winded novel and have decided to stop torturing myself in this worthless effort, and closed the book once and for all on page 460 of 896.I still do so reluctantly, as I cannot remember a book so bad that I could not finish it, by one means or another, either by 'skimming' or jumping ahead.For my 'two cents' worth, don't waste your time, unless you have lots and lots to spare and don't mind meandering around with Dorothea (and the provincials) as George Elliot tries to provide a 'study' of Provincial life.In fairness to others, perhaps if it is approached and read as a 'study', it could be bearable, perhaps even an interesting one - I feel sorry for any schoolchild who had this as a set-book!"},{"Title":"Middlemarch","review":"A surviving photo of George Eliot illustrates why Herbert Spencer expressed the view, apparently to all of Victorian London, that she was \\"too ugly\\" to marry. Her crushes on Spencer and others were unreciprocated, and she eventually went off with a married man in an unconventional arrangement. In Middlemarch she has written a book in which the ugly girl has not one, but two, ardent and faithful lifelong suitors; and the man who marries only for looks and deprecates female intelligence (Lydgate) gets his comeuppance by dying young, a failure, stuck with a wife who doesn't understand him. Moreover, the girl who brushes off her community's disapproval, goes off with a man of uncertain pedigree and willingly gives up her fortune as a result (Dorothea), is presented as an undisputed heroine. The fact that Dorothea manages to do very little with her life of real value to society doesn't matter, while Lydgate gets his comeuppance even though he has substantially contributed to his community. The essentials of this book are George Eliot's personal feminist fantasy. While this is certainly an enjoyable read, it's hard to take this as seriously as do the critics, and comparisons to Tolstoy etc. seem, on the whole, misguided."},{"Title":"Middlemarch","review":"I am an avid reader of many different types of literature, and am used alot of different styles of prose.

All of the characters are flawed (as in real life) which would have been OK if there were any who were sympathetic. But after reading 331 of 771 pages in my edition, I came across the following passage (Chap. 40): &quot;Mr. Farebrother left the house soon after, and seeing Mary in the orchard with Letty, went to say good-bye to her. They made a pretty picture in the western light which brought out the brightness of the apples on the old scant-leaved boughs -- Mary in her lavender gingham and black ribbons holding a basket, while Letty in her well-worn nankin picked up the fallen apples. If you want to know more particularly how Mary looked, ten to one you will see a face like hers in the crowded street to-morrow, if you are there on the watch: she will not be among those daughters of Zion who are haughty, and walk with stretched-out necks and wanton eyes, mincing as they go: let all those pass, and fix your eyes on some small plump brownish person of firm but quiet carriage,....&quot; These words of Eliot's (not of a character) are vile. Who would want to read a book with hateful racial slanders like this, written from the point of view of an author a part of whose moral nature is racial animosity? Any author whose moral frame of reference is so small-minded could not write a book of any real artistic value, all the professors of literature and their hollow praises notwithstanding. Character development and other technical accomplishments do not a work of art make."},{"Title":"Middlemarch","review":"My mother described reading this book like jogging through Jell-o and I am inclined to agree.

The book is OK, but i think getting old wrongly. Compared to Austen novels it is a heavy, bored, intellectual, pretentious book. The characters are good, but somehow, by the slowness of her style you star to not care about them. The politics and religion are a nuissance.

I saw many people praising this as one of the greatest books of all time so I bought it and was excited to get into it. In all honesty, I had a hard time keeping awake. The story line was good. My problem was with the writing. I LOVE descriptive writing. Thomas Hardy is one of my favorite authors. He takes me to the village and I become part of it. I never cared about Middlemarch. I was disappointed with the character development. I only cared for a few of the main characters. There was too much philosophy, excessively LONG sentences and filler that distracted my interest. I found it very odd that in this lengthy book three weddings took place but she never wrote about even one of them. One chapter the wedding was close and the next chapter it was a month later. But we got details of medical theory, politics and went through the bidding process of many items at an auction (when only one item had a connection to the story), etc. I also found it interesting that each \\"book\\" of the book was 100(+/-1) pages long. Did she get paid by the word? I think an editor could shorten some of the sentences, take a couple hundred pages of filler out and make it much better."},{"Title":"Middlemarch","review":"The book itself is fine. However, the font style and formatting used by the Oxford press is really unattractive, and there is no way to change the font style. You can change the size of the font but not the actual font style itself. It is a very old style and looks like something from the 1800s. I'm sure this was fine for printed books in the 1800s, but it looks horrible on a Kindle 2 screen in the 2000s. Come on Oxford, when you convert your books to an e-reader format, you need to put some thought into how the work will be displayed on e-readers. When given a choice, I always use the Oxford edition of classics, but for this book I switched over to the Penguin edition just because of the way the work is displayed on the Kindle 2 screen.

High society British, set in days of old stuffy society. Dorthea, so full of her intelligence, decided to marry a self acclaimed writer, who was putting together research for a never to be written book. In fact Mr. Cassobaun did nothing but research. Dorthea, realizing a woman of those times could not write and be taken seriously, would do the next best thing by assisting the great man with his building of a great book. Like a sponge, she married this stuffy \\"intelligent\\" man, and found he didn't really want an eager assistant, but he thought his research was over her head. Meanwhile, her likeable sister married and had a great life. Of course, she eventually sees that she made a mistake and blah, blah, blah, you know how it goes.

Don't waste your time downloading it."},{"Title":"Middlemarch","review":"Eliot in all her work from epic masterpieces like Middlemarch to small novellas like The Lifted Veil has the ability to make intelligent readers stop and re-read lines. However, while occassionally we may stop to marvel at the complexity, spohistication, or elegance of her language it is more often than not the philosophical depths with she is able to illuminate in her most simple phrases and candid characters. The characters in Middlemarch, specifically, are indeed well developed but they are not complex-- rather they play off each other to illustrate to the reader a human composite. Each one seems to have a dominant theme about them that when combined with each other draws a picture of true humanity-- complete with its contradictions and dichotomies. This is the beauty of the novel and why we reread certain sections-- Eliot makes us care about everyone in the piece and all their stories as all are essential in determining our own instrinsic emotional reaction.Middlemarch is not a page turner-- it does require an emotional committment. . .however, it is worth all a reader's energy."},{"Title":"Middlemarch","review":"I have enjoyed this book. I'll save everyone the time and not comment on the characters, (although intriguing and realistic) or the themes and situations (all of which impact the reader). I would only add that the language and rhetoric George Eliot uses is consummate. Truly I didn't know anyone could write THIS WELL until I read THIS BOOK. Others come close in style - Dickens perhaps, but only George Eliot offers clever descriptions and beautiful language which add to the flow of this book. Coming from an 18 year old male, I wasn't sure I would like this book. However, George Eliot offered me a new love for Victorian Literature, and presented characters who are timeless.&quot;Our deeds still travel with us from afar, And what we have been makes us what we are.&quot;&quot;Even if a man has been acquitted by a jury, they'll talk, and nod and wink - and as far as the world goes, a man might often as well be guilty as not.&quot;&quot;Scenes which make vittal changes in our neighbours' lot are but the background of our own, yet, like a particular aspect of the fields and trees, they become associated for us with the epochs of our own history, and make a part of that unity which lies in the selection of our keenest consciousness.&quot;"},{"Title":"Middlemarch","review":"The BBC miniseries was my first exposure to the world of Middlemarch; then, of course, the novel had to be read. The author was a woman, Mary Ann Evans, writing under a man's penname. And sure, the language is very archaic - this was written in the mid-1800's! At times the density of the prose tried my patience, and the many references to old literature/quotes quite puzzling. But I'm glad I stayed with this Classic (sometimes skipping over very obscure-to-me passages) - why? Because the characterizations and \\"asides\\" made me laugh aloud. The insights are just too jewel-like, sprinkled throughout this tale of the complex (and the simple) people of Middlemarch, their friends and mentors, enemies, losses and gains, marriages; their various Loves.The sort-of Epilogue was very satisfying also, to see what \\"ends\\" our beloved Middlemarchers come to in the course of their lives - some happy, some not so happy. The last line, describing Dorothea, is a poignant statement of all those who \\"live hidden lives\\" - outwardly insignificant, perhaps, but nonetheless as worthy as gold."},{"Title":"Middlemarch","review":"Can't complain about the price--it's free--but the formatting could be better, and there are a lot of typos (or scannos, assuming they're from a scanner)."},{"Title":"Middlemarch","review":"Middlemarch is not an \\"easy\\" read as it requires attention to the footnotes, and is 800 pages.

After that happens, it is impossible to put down this wonderful book. It's an in-depth discovery of the lives of several people in Middlemarch -- small town rural England during the time of reforms being planned in the 1880s. A time not altogether too different than our own, except for the predicament of women.Dorothea is a fascinating woman, and a window into the lives of the women of those times, and -- through the various men who intersect with her, comes a picture of life as it was, the politics as they were, and the classes as they existed.The talent of this author blazes across the many pages, bringing character after character which is beautifully developed and worked in among the various happenings, all wrapped around an epic design that, time after time, take one's breath. The (female) author chose the name George Eliot with the intention she be taken seriously as a writer. Even with the passage of time and changing of styles, it is impossible not to take seriously this amazing, wonderful book and its creator.Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Middlemarch","review":"One of the joys of reading great works of literature, indeed of reading in general, is RE-READING, seeing all the wonderful things you missed the first time around. _Middlemarch_ is such a book, so much so that I have been astounded upon rereading it. I was assigned this book twice in college, and while I can certainly understand why this book would be studied in literature courses because of the value it contributed to the form of novel writing in general, I firmly believe this book can only be appreciated fully by someone with a little more experience under their belt than the average college co-ed. So, if you remember trudging through this large tome in the early morning hours of your college days, finding it unbearable, give it another go once you're 30 or 40 -- I think you'll be more than pleasantly surprised. I can honestly say this is one of the books that is closest to my heart now. Truly moving."},{"Title":"Middlemarch","review":"Middlemarch is probably the best example of nineteenth century British literature. I felt the first book called &quot;Miss Brooke&quot; was long and laborious to read, however after the setting was established and the characters were thoroughly introduced, I had trouble putting the book down! I am a graduate student and I was able to read the novel in 4 nights. George Eliot shows all degrees of human nature and circumstances in this tale. Love does not always beget love and vice versa. Love does not always conquer all. This book will keep you interested from cover to cover with a vast array of characters and situations and you will swear you know some of the people involved! I highly recommend this book for anyone who loves nineteenth century literature!"},{"Title":"Middlemarch","review":"The most important thing to remember about Middlemarch is that marriage is a noose! Seriously, Eliot engages the problem of marriage in Victorian England, namely that marriage can be a trap and yet humans have a need for marriage-type relationships. (Can't live with 'em--can't live without 'em attitude) Eliot determines that often the reasons for entering into marriage usually determine the success or failure of it. For example Dorthea Brooke marries a man old enough to be her father in a misguided attempt to do something important with her life. Mr. Casaubon, Dorothea's husband, is a religious scholar who's in the process of writing a great religious treatise. The problem is, however, that Mr. Casaubon doesn't think he needs a woman's help (this is Victorian England, after all) and Dorothea's marriage soon becomes a living hell. Another character, the spoiled yet charming Rosamund marries the local doctor in an attempt to escape her father's house. The problem here is that the doctor doesn't quite make as much money as Rosamund's father and can't keep her in the style that she's been accustomed to. Rosamund's relationship with her husband deteriorates rapidly as her frustration with their income level drives her to torment him. However, a few successful marriages are balanced against this view of domestic torture. Mary and Fred, the two local sweethearts, court for the entire novel, marrying in the last chapter. They work out their differences before their marriage and seem to be fairly happy. After Dorothea's husband mercifully dies, she remarries a man nearer her age and they are fairly happy as well.This novel tends to be a bit melodramatic in places, but ends with an optimistic outlook overall. I recommend this book for anyone who's interested in the Victorian period, women's issues, or human relationships. This is a great book to curl up with next to a fireplace! Other books dealing with similar issues are &quot;The Mill on the Floss&quot; by George Eliot, &quot;A Vindication of the Rights of Woman&quot; by Mary Wollstonecraft, and &quot;Persuasion&quot; by Jane Austen."},{"Title":"Middlemarch","review":"What to say about a book like \\"Middlemarch\\"? It is needless to say, at 800+ pages, a little heavy, and might very well try the casual reader's patience. I fancy myself a fairly quick and discerning reader - but; this took me over two weeks to read, and I found my interest waning in and out for most of the novel. It is therefor, not something I would quickly recommend to just anyone.However; I adress this to the student of Victorian literature,the student of history, and the aspiring novelist. To you, \\"Middlemarch\\" is a goldmine. The subtitle:\\"A study of provincial life\\" says it all. George Eliott touches on Religion, politics, Business dealings, and above all marriage; all set in the late 1820's early 1830's, before the Reform bill. Though it encompasses the lives of several families and individuals in the Middlemarch county, it centers around two in particular: Dorothea Brooke, the idealist woman, who traps herself in a loveless marriage; and Lydgate, an ambitious young doctor, who finds his marriage to a selfish and vain woman, the chief factor that causes the loss of his medical ambitions and his financial and personal ruin. It is the study of human nature, and emphasizes the role that chance plays in everyone's lives. It is also valuable to the aspiring novelist, to study for the characteration, and plot twists alone. And though it is a rather thick book, and at times can become a little dry by the long pages of narrative rambling, it is a great example of the intellectual depth of one of the great woman novelists of the nineteenth century."},{"Title":"Middlemarch","review":"I've written a review on this somewhere under another edition, but I wanted to comment on the Barnes and Noble Classic Series edition. It's very nice with an introduction by someone scholarly, and footnotes that are included at the very end, but the cover has that filmy stuff over it that tends to start curling off pretty quickly.The story itself is wonderful."},{"Title":"Middlemarch","review":"I am in awe of George Eliot. She has constructed a narrative that is uncommonly perceptive and literate about both the subtle and quirky level of individual motivation and the larger forces of society which form the arena in which human lives play themselves out. Middlemarch is a provincial English town during Victorian times and Eliot selects a broad range of characters from every level of society to illustrate her themes. Prominent among these themes are the way in which the ambitions of potentially extraordinary achievers can be constrained by a poor choice of affiliation, most notably bad marraiges. She also addresses the role of women, the way that wealthy landowners determine the quality of life for the poor, and presents insightful portraits of a number of personality types. It is often a very funny book as well, as she exposes the foibles of the pompous and self-deluded with subtle and unerring accuracy.This is not a light read. This is a long, dense novel, but I found something fascinating on nearly every page."},{"Title":"Middlemarch","review":"I remember finding this conservative and space-efficient paperback on the shelves at Waldenbooks and deciding to give it a try since I had heard of it through a copy of Anna Karenina. The essay had compared the two, but didn't say that George Eliot acheived five times more with this book than Tolstoy did with Anna. I have never read such superb writing or been lead through such a meaningful story. Everything in this book is absolutely neccessary to Eliot's main idea. The realistic and honestly depicted characters' babbling even holds weight in her plot. This book shows so many different plots and how they parallel eachother, that it is almost mosaic (except every little piece is as splendid and brilliant as the other). Eliot teaches us through her characters and the dilemas she so craftily places them in, about reverance for life and community. If you pay attention to the narrative of this sage, you will find yourself believing &quot;no man is an island&quot;, if you already don't, and your sense of responsibility and duty will become ven more apparent to you. This is the book that remains closest to my heart; this is the author who, time after time, I have never been disappointed in. I won't give a single thing away. If you enjoy a good intellectual novel, then you won't be disappointed. I promise, you will be amazed 6 chapters through the book and astounded at the end. There aren't any notes for this book; you'll enjoy it uninterrupted. Reward yourself with this book or any other by George Eliot ( the Mill on the Floss is almost as good)."},{"Title":"Middlemarch","review":"This is not for the faint of heart. I'll be the first to admit that Eliot is no day-in-the-park author. She's regal, she's massive, she's intense. She's the Titanic, the way it was meant to be. The upside of all this is that you enter a world of literature so engrossing and pungent, it will be hard to pick up a less involved book afterwards. Eliot is an aquired taste for some, but, oh, what a taste! I began her books with Middlemarch and it has been my ultimate favorite ever since. It even surpasses Pride and Prejudice in my estimation, no small concession.Middlemarch isn't a glamourous town, but it *is* full of strangely fascinating normal people. They're deliciously human, understandably flawed, and believably redeemed. Love, life, and death are not sugar-coated, but shown in all their respective glory and shabbiness. The characters, however minor, are honestly portrayed, making you feel like one of them. Idealistic Dorothea could have lived in any age, in any place. Lydgate is another. They are mirrored by the sad realism of the Bulstrode and Casaubon among others. All the other Middlemarchers fall in between these common extremes. With as broad a brush as Eliot paints with (covering religion, provincial politics, social mores, business, romance), there are also many (relevant) commentaries that have her wielding as fine as brush as an ivory-painter (intricacies of human nature, society, and the ironies of life). Eliot was an unabashed intellectual, but persuasive and logical, making it a pleasure to delve into her mind. Her works are diamonds in English Lit - captivating from afar as they are breathtaking up close. Read her for the fun plots, as well as the brilliant insights.The characters are true, the settings are used to perfection, and the complexity is amazing. The characters may not endear themselves to you on paper, but they become so lifelike through details that they will compel feelings through reason - reaching your heart through your brain. Not a likely arrangement, but one that Eliot pulls off uncannily.Eliot made a masterpiece of town life with Middlemarch. The same is done for pastoral life with Mill on the Floss and Adam Bede. For a shorter, sweeter story, read Silas Marner. And never lump her with Dickens, who gracelessly and grotesquely inflates life in order to make a point."},{"Title":"Middlemarch","review":"I can do little but agree with all of the positive comments from previous posters. George Eliot puts human lives under a microscope and examines them with wisdom and compassion. The town of Middlemarch, with all of its human drama, could be any community at any time, and its people are just like our friends and neighbors. But we get to know Eliot's characters so much better than we ever get to know our friends and neighbors. These characters are some of the most fully formed in all of literature -- Dorothea Brooke, the idealistic young woman who marries the wrong man for the best of reasons; Tertius Lydgate, the young physician who sets out to change the world but finds his own weakness his biggest obstacle; Caleb Garth, the humble man who knows when and how to take a stand; Nicholas Bulstrode, the prosperous businessman whose reputation is endangered by some questionable past dealings. No situation is trivialized and no character is or decision is portrayed as one-dimensionally &quot;good&quot; or &quot;evil&quot; -- Eliot does each character justice, showing us their thought processes and letting us understand exactly why they do what they do. I entitled my review &quot;perhaps the best novel ever written,&quot; but I know of none better. I urge you to jump into the world that George Eliot creates and enjoy her intelligence, wit and wisdom."},{"Title":"Middlemarch","review":"One of the things that strikes me again and again when I read &quot;literature&quot; of past centuries is how men and women are so much the same today as they were then.Basically, &quot;Middlemarch&quot; is a novel about making bad choices, enduring those choices (OK, that is where it departs from modernity: today, people would probably entice Dorothea to divorce Causabon), and managing to live despite tragedy and sadness.This is one of the few books I have ever read where I laughed out loud at some passages, and yet started to cry at others (particularly affecting is the one where, after saying goodby to Will for what she thinks is the last time, Dorothea takes a miniature portrait of his grandmother and cradles it in her hand).This book is utterly amazing. It is not for the drenched-in-modernity people who want a quick, direct read - there are lots of characters to follow and many digressions. It's not a quick read. Yes, parts of it do drag. But the parts that don't, speak to the heart. You can think of Middle march as life in miniature: there are heartbreaking times, amusing times, good times, bad times, times you simply have to endure. And you learn from it, too.I think a lot of negative reviews of classic novels come from people who were made to read them in school. I, too, complained about some of the books I had to read. But try them again - when you have time to savor them, or when greater maturity makes them more accessible to you. I know I would not have enjoyed Middlemarch at 16; I was too callow and had no understanding of the real pain people go through when they make the wrong decisions in life. Now, at 30, and having made some bad decisions, the book is deeply meaningful to me."},{"Title":"Middlemarch","review":"I missed the chance to read this in college, but enjoyed it greatly now (in middle age). Eliot is so intelligent and insightful about how adults make choices with unintended consequences. Everyone considering marriage should read this book. The setting may be out of date but her understanding of the human heart is timeless."},{"Title":"Middlemarch","review":"Having been slightly bored by \\"Silas Marner,\\" I was not expecting much gratification from this massive tome. But I had heard good things about \\"Middlemarch\\" from others, so I steeled myself and dug in. I was quite figuratively blown-away by the quality of writing.It is not just that Eliot is an excellent satirist, but that she makes penetrating psychological insights and crafts very well-developed, imminently human characters, who are sympathetic despite their faults. She also exhibits a brilliant mastery of the English language, describing both internal and external scenes in the most beautiful of terms.\\"Middlemarch\\" is not an easy read; there are multiple characters with complex relationships to one another, and the threads of their singular lives are eventually thoroughly tied up into one another. I found that keeping note cards on the family trees of the various characters was of assistance when reading. But once you have established who everyone is, the complexity of the novel is no longer a hindrance, and it may be read as lightly and quickly as any work of fiction.The plot line is interesting enough, but it is the personalities of the characters that are truly gripping. I cannot recall a single novel that has stimulated my intellect as deeply, or drawn upon my emotions as expertly, or commanded my respect as fully as \\"Middlemarch.\\" I cannot issue a higher recommendation."},{"Title":"Middlemarch","review":"A real pleasure to recently discover this classic for the first time, \\"Middlemarch\\" is a fine example of the English style of writing from that period, a long book of almost 900 pages, with a large cast of characters and several main plot lines, novels like this are a reminder of the richness of the English language. This is a soap opera set in the fictional town of Middlemarch with descriptions of every walk of life, George Eliot's perceptions of human nature make this a timeless piece of fiction, though there is no doubt that she describes a way of life gone forever.A main theme in this novel would seem to be possessing Utopian visions and the difficulty of putting them into practice in reality. One of the main characters is Dorothea, a young woman with great social ideals, she \\"thinks too much for a woman\\" and is under constant pressure from well-meaning realtives who want her to marry safely and give up her goals of saving the world. Dr. Lydgate is someone else we come to know quite well, another individual who has lofty ideas but trouble coping with the real world because he tries to ignore it. Mr. Brooke and Bulstrode also have certain visions of themselves not shared by an informed public.Some reviewers seem to feel this book is too long, that the story could have been told in half the words, but I would not change one bit of this, the beautiful use of words helps me to escape into the world of Middlemarch when life was slower moving and people had more time for reflection."},{"Title":"Middlemarch","review":"I had to read \\"Middlemarch\\" for a Victorian literature course, and I approached it with certain trepidation: it's a tome, for a start, and by the time I braved it, I'd heard pretty much everyone in the class muttering about how dense and difficult it was. I had that reaction, too, for about 100, or even 200 pages. But I fell in love with it slowly. You have to almost re-learn how to read when you approach a novel like Middlemarch; it was not written to cater to short, wandering attention spans. But the brilliance of this book gradually reveals itself. Eliot is subtle and serious, but she is also witty and very humane, and in \\"Middlemarch\\" she tackles so much: science, art, religion, politics, love, morality.I noticed by the end of the course that everyone who had previously been whining about this book had come to feel a certain sense of awe toward it. \\"Middlemarch\\" certainly demands a lot of time and thought to fully appreciate, but it's not difficult to understand why this is considered the great Victorian novel."},{"Title":"Middlemarch","review":"Once again, thanks to Amazon for making these classics FREE on the Kindle. I love it. Now to the book - I believe the other reviewers here have covered it quite well so I will just add a few words of comment. First of all, it is wonderful - totally engrossing. I think it was originally several novels that George Elliot (pen name of Mary Ann Evans) ultimately combined into one novel and serialized it. The serialization must have driven the readers mad because the tension builds almost unbearably. I could not wait to get back to it - and it is a long book. Elliot skillfully weaves so many stories into one long thread and they all work together so well. I don't recall ever reading it (at least I could not remember the plot line) but I did see the Masterpiece Theater version (1994) and recalled the story of the severe preacher/scholar Edward Casaubon and his innocent wife but not much else, so that put all the more pressure on me to keep reading. It was such a release to get all the issues more or less resolved at the end! Whew. Netflix has the Masterpiece Theater series on two DVDs and I can't decide if I am going to look at it again or not. It would be nice to see how they handled the characters but I don't know if I could bear all the tensions again! By all means read this wonderful novel."},{"Title":"Middlemarch","review":"Well, not every classic is really \`classic', but I'm so glad I stumbled across this in a local 2nd hand store. Wow. I don't think I've read anything like it before - and I don't think it'd get past a publisher these days. It's so loose, it's almost like a soap opera: she feels no need to tie everything tightly around one major plot, with maybe a couple of sub-plots. The uniting thing is the town (well, generally some of the wealthier elements of the town - although there is some range of class), and the gaze moves here and there among various residents. The characters are really potent. Not necessarily multi-layered and complex, but striking, and Eliot seems to have a gift for finding something authentic to focus on without becoming a mere stereotype. I am reminded of some ofC.S. Lewis'characters, having some essential moral point about them: I know he enjoyed this book, and definitely he could have drawn something of that Screwtape notion of the profound implications of seemingly small actions, interactions, attitudes and choices. Particularly by the end of the book Eliot is quite philosophically didactic, with true heroism painted as the generous life of someone quietly forgotten.This book also leads me to an odd comparison - with Fred Saberhagen's'Swords'series, based around a dozen god-forged blades, each with a particular, if you like, super-power (e.g. healing wounds, cutting stone, bringing luck, drawing loyalty etc.). The fun is watching the way they interact, enhancing, neutralising, antagonising, inflaming each other. Eliot manages that with her characters - she creates such strong personalities I came away with a renewed sense of how valuable each of us are, the significance of everyday choices, the tragedy and triumph of the mundane. Each of Eliot's main characters has the presence of one of these god-forged swords, yet can be influenced well or ill by interplay. Context and personality both work on each other: neither nature nor nurture makes something inevitable - but they are both also hugely powerful. I loved the way that, for example, Dorothea's naively optimistic egocentrism - that she is made to improve the lot of the unfortunate - is not merely dismissed nor endorsed. Her strong personality works both for and against her. There are elements of this in some of Austen's characters, and doubtless Eliot was across Austen, but Eliot feels no obligation to have fairy-tale endings. Dorothea's zeal can both trap and free her - and this despite the purity of her intentions.It's also a delight that the story doesn't stop with a wedding, but follows the course of marriage (or two). There's also wonderful room to move: even characters that you are made to think should end up together won't necessarily. And even that won't necessarily be a bad thing.The book is hugely psychological, constantly highlighting the gaps between why people act the way they do, and the reasons they think they behave that way. Self-awareness is a rare commodity. There is also a huge amount of pride behind actions: I know it's still a huge motivator, but at times in the book I wondered if in that society at that time there was a far greater need to be seen a certain way by your neighbours. At times I lost myself in the torturous logic of why these young (or even not so young) swains with burning passions could never admit to them - but I do live in a time and place where our mythology so strongly condemns (theoretically anyway) money being admitted as a reasonable obstacle to romance. But there are other reasons why people, even well meaning people, can get caught up in destructive conversational patterns that make a hell out of a potential heaven (a point well made in Ann Tyler's painfully insightful,'Breathing Lessons').I'm not completely convinced by all of Eliot's characters, and I'm also separated from some of the potency of some of the conventions she's playing with by time and my own context's assumptions. But I'm still mightily impressed and will definitely seek out some more of her books. And this one goes straight onto my, \\"To be read again,\\" shelf."},{"Title":"Middlemarch","review":"Reading this masterpiece will broaden your vocabulary, enrich your insight, heighten your appreciation of our language, and sharpen your observations of human nature. Wholly satisfying."},{"Title":"Middlemarch","review":"Glad to have had an on line dictionary available as there are plenty of archaic and/or rarely used words. A true classic...and the on line price was too good to pass on."},{"Title":"Middlemarch","review":"Eliot (the pen name of Mary Anne Evans) dazzles with the life in the simple nineteenth century English town of Middlemarch. Eliot's work shines in many ways. Human behavior and life and motivations are told in both amazingly perceptive observation and pinpoint accuracy language. She tells a good story and has engaging characters. This reader found the opening chapter, describing sisters Dorothea and Celia of such luminous descriptive power that its sheer overwhelming quality overshadowed the meanings. Only after settling into the book could one enjoy the characters and events because the awe-inspiring writing became a given. The rich characters are drawn from a variety of the times' social strata, wealthy and poor, young and old, wise and uh, not so wise. They're humans who face the challenges of life, misfortune, the consequences of divergent thinking/acting contrary to public opinion, gambling, secrets, and of facing romance and matrimonial commitment with its varied turns, and many issues of growing up and making choices. Yes, there's more than one good love story going on and it's none too surprising finding out that Eliot is a woman given the depth and insights she elaborates about women's relationships, internal thoughts, and roles with men in this society still very much male dominated. Eliot's magic with words necessarily means keeping a dictionary handy. The principal characters draw one in well, for this reader, particularly Dorothea and Lydgate, and even lesser characters such as Mr. Garth and his family, the dynamics of the Vincy family, and the Farebrother family. Religion and politics and relationships all add to the mix, are written well, and only deepen the reader's enjoyment. Simply terrific. Worthy of its status as a classic and great book."},{"Title":"Middlemarch","review":"This story is somewhat off my usual fayre. Ostensibly it is a romance story, or rather three romance stories that are intertwined. As such it is a book I never before bothered to read as I would not want my cool macho image to be dented by the sight of me flicking through a romance! But I managed to get a copy for my e-reader from \\"Manybooks\\" and thus read it in secret!And I am very glad I did so. Of course, this is a classic so the judgement of history is already there as to the worth of this book, and nothing I add here can change that. Without a doubt this is a book that can be read and enjoyed by many many people. What I can add to this is that it can also be enjoyed by people who do not go in for icky romances! And the reason I can say that is that the real strength of this story does not lie in the romances themselves, but in the wonderful observation ad depiction of life in the 1830s of rural England.From the opening pages where you have people namedropping Wilberforce and other such luminaries in their social circles, you are drawn into experiencing life amongst the tight Victorian social circles. You see how people wish to better not just themselves but others, but are often frustrated by the cages of convention. You see characters reform themselves, and others ruin themselves. You see people who are not evil and yet do evil deeds for human reasons. You see a mirror on the souls of the characters and ultimately ourselves as readers.George Eliot's characterisations are wonderful. Her writing is still accessible to the modern reader, and whilst she makes some use of techniques where the narrator knows all and can moralise on the reader's behalf - something you would not find in a modern work - these techniques do not wholly detract from the work, and were - of course - quite common in Victorian fiction. One plot element also reminded me of Dickens in the unfolding coincidences in the background of two characters. But whilst the work is therefore clearly Victorian, it remains very readable. The auction scene and some other scenes were very funny, and as you recognise the types of characters being portrayed in real people - past and present - you will be amused by this work.So if, like me, you don't do romances - don't skip this work. It is well worth reading."},{"Title":"Middlemarch","review":"I enjoyed Middlemarch. In fact, the more I read it, the more I enjoyed it. However, I can't really say that it is one of the 100 best novels of all time - I hope not anyways, or I am going to be a pretty disappointed reader if this is as good as it gets. Here is what I liked: The character development is really good. There are multiple story lines that get intertwined and it makes for a nice mix of characters and stories. It truly is a \\"study of provincial life\\", and Elliot does a nice job of portraying different types of people, marital discord, gender issues and societal issues - and much of the topics are still relevant today - quite impressive since the story was written in the 1800s. Elliot also has a nice way of inserting her point of view, or endowing little \\"tidbits of advice\\" that I found \\"highlight worthy\\". It is the type of book where I might go back and just read the quotes I highlighted - as I found them quite relevant and eloquently put. The story held my attention until the end.That being said - I still have trouble giving it a 5 star rating - just not sure it is worth the legendary hype. I kept waiting for something a bit more dramatic to occur. Was waiting for the really big shoe to drop or bomb to hit, and it never happened. I guess that is in keeping with \\"provincial life\\" - it just sort of plodded along. I'm not even certain I could pinpoint the climax of the book although maybe that reflects my shortcomings as a reader :-). And while I appreciated the \\"Finale\\", to learn what became of everybody, it did seem a little contrived to me - a bit too neat and tidy. I was a little disappointed by the end in that regard.In sum - I think it's a good book if you want to tackle one of the lengthier classics. Having a Kindle was key for me, in that I could look up all the words I didn't know (which were many - again - maybe my shortcoming). Clearly a talented writer, I think she achieved her goal of exploring different types of people, marriages, and \\"midlife crises\\". That being said, I would not say it was a life changing book for me - just an interesting read."},{"Title":"Middlemarch","review":"Juliet Stevenson does a fantastic job recreating the various characters in this incredibly long Victorian novel. Her diction is beautiful and she brings to life what can otherwise be a laborious novel to read.

Now, as to the writing; as I read the first two chapters, I was taken in as to the intense descriptions of the characters.

It is a little slow at times, but even worth re-reading. I would say more, but I read the book a long time ago."},{"Title":"Middlemarch","review":"Middlemarch is a town in early nineteenth century England and serves as a microcosm of English life at that time. And it's not just about the landed gentry. It covers many walks of life and includes a kaleidoscope of characters who are not comfortable with their wealth or lack thereof, their choice of spouses, their family history--you name it. There's Fred Vincy, who's been educated for the clergy but doesn't feel he's cut out for preaching. He fancies Mary Garth, who's pleasant and plucky but plain. Mary loves Fred but can't abide his aimlessness or his financial follies. Of course, Fred and Mary can't come right out and express their feelings for each other. Dorothea Brooke has it all--beauty, thoughtfulness, sufficient resources--but chooses to marry an older, unappealing, wealthy scholar. She realizes her mistake during the honeymoon but does her best to make it work until he conveniently dies. She has a penchant for her husband's cousin Will but can't admit this, even to herself. Her husband was obviously more attuned to the situation than Dorothea or Will, as his will makes it impractical for the two to marry. In fact, there are lots of scandals involving Will's heritage and relationship to Bulstrode, an unsavory, overly pious character, who is being blackmailed by an old acquaintance. Tertius Lydgate is the new doctor in town who hopes to make his mark in medicine and is Dorothea's male counterpart in the altruistic department. His reputation, however, suffers from his liaison with Bulstrode, and he finds himself buried in debt and married to a beautiful but frivolous woman who can't appreciate his aspirations. This is sort of a Victoria soap opera with lots of misunderstandings and even some political turmoil, which was lost on me, even with the assistance of the notes at the end."},{"Title":"Middlemarch","review":"The greatest classic I have ever read, a mature psychological work. But it is long, which take a lot of time to read"},{"Title":"Middlemarch","review":"I read this Bantam text from cover to cover in anguish.George Eliot 's language is very hard for a foreigner to read,she used too many clauses and rare usage of words.As a matter of fact,I don't find the book very engrossing or impressive,it was just a story of six young people who at last came to matrimony and some led a happy life(Fred and Mary),some led sort of a bad one(like Lydgate and Vincy).Rather,Eliot's witty comments at the beginning or ending of chapters interested me a lot.I don't understand why Dorothea cared so much about Christianity,and why Lydgate chose to put up with Rosamond for decades until he died,(he should pursue his dream in science.)If Rosamond was very selfish in character,it seemed to me,that at the end of the novel,Eliot delineated her as someone with goodness.She never spoke anything bad towards Dorothea since she went to live in London,and when Lydgate died,she married a wealthy old physician who was good to her kids.These are indeed virtues.So what on earth did the author think of Rosamond?Bad,not likely;good,she ruined Lydgate's career."},{"Title":"Middlemarch","review":"George Eliot was one of England's finest 19th century authors, and Middlemarch one of Eliot's finest novels. It's the story of the blighted marriage of Dorothea, a young and idealistic woman, and Lyd Gate, who is betrayed by his wife's egoism. Middlemarch is a complex work concerning social interrelationships and the struggle to hold fast to personal integrity in a materialistic and mean spirited age. Eliot is unsurpassed in her vivid presentation of England during the 1830s. Superbly narrated by Carole Boyd, this unabridged, six cassette, five hour, Naxos AudioBooks edition is technically flawless and wonderfully enhanced with 19th Century symphonic music. Middlemarch is also available in a CD format."},{"Title":"Middlemarch","review":"For those who come to MIDDLEMARCH for the first time and wonder what to make up the more than 900 pages of text, they might look at the clue that George Eliot provides both in the subtitle \\"A Study of Provincial Life\\" and in her Prelude. The former suggests indeed a study of life within the narrow confines of middle class life in England before the passage of the Reform Bill of 1832, yet the massive weight of the text implies that it will be a telescoped examination of that life. It is almost as if Eliot wished to place Middlemarch on a microscopic slide and then blow up the image to fit an IMAX screen, from which the reader could see, hear, and feel the images jump off the pages in unforgettably realistic power. In her Prelude, Eliot writes of a hypothetical woman that prefigures Dorothea Brooke: \\"Many Theresas have been born who found for themselves no epic life wherein there was a constant unfolding of far-resonant action; perhaps only a life of mistakes, the offspring of a certain spiritual grandeur ill-matched with the meanness of opportunity.\\" Such a \\"life of mistakes\\" of the book's major and minor characters when combined with the epic sweep vision of a small slice of English society produce the book's essential theme: no one in the book is meant to be seen as heroic or even tragic because Eliot's deterministic philosophy does not allow them to overcome the stifling hand of a vision of life that hints at only the wispy illusion of success but delivers only the inevitability of failure. In such a climate, neither heroes nor tragic figures can thrive.Part of the reason that readers have trouble keeping straight the huge cast of characters is due to Eliot's original means of publishing. MIDDLEMARCH did not start out as a fully-conceived nor finished product. Eliot had planned to write a series of connected novels, beginning with Dorothea Brooke, but after simultaneously writing two of them, she saw that their tightly interlocking themes would complement one another if they were presented as a continuous whole, so she began to publish them as a serial. She was quite successful, so much so that her publisher reminded her that in order not to let her panting public forget who was who, she had to include--or at least mention--each character on a regular basis.Eliot divides the book into four storylines. The first deals with the aspirations of Dorothea Brooke and her disastrous marriage to Edward Casaubon. The second relates the attempt by Dr. Lydgate to establish a successful medical career that also is demolished by an unwise marriage. The third tells of the many travails of Mary Garth. And the final explains the rise and fall of the banker Bulstrode. Each of these main characters represents types of the middle class that made up the social strata with which George Eliot was so familiar. As they interact with each other, Eliot depicts their respective struggles to achieve success or happiness. These attempts usually begin with marriage or high hopes. Dorothea Brooke suffers disillusion with her husband after only a few months. Casaubon, for his part, endures the agony of knowing that his Great Book is truly the piece of trash that Dorothea rightfully suspects it to be. What emerges in the reader after completing the book is a sense of knowledge of the inner lives of the book's characters and of accrued impressions of life on a vast scale, but what is lacking is the realization that no one in MIDDLEMARCH has learned anything of value except perhaps that fate is a game of chance with the deck stacked against humanity. The reader further acknowledges that God has pulled a disappearing act, leaving the residents of Eliot's world to fend for themselves. And since the characters of MIDDLEMARCH do not change, then neither does its readers. The final judgment on MIDDLEMARCH is that it shows in a universe of detail and character delineation the interlocking lives of characters who suffer mightily, but in whose suffering fall short either of heroism or tragedy."},{"Title":"Middlemarch","review":"I spent two months with Middlemarch. It is not a particularly difficult book to read, but it must be read without distractions. It is a very dense novel and requires great concentration to read it because of the tremendous amount of details contained within it. The astonishing ability of Elliot to create both characters and the setting of the book makes it an astonishing work of fiction.In particular, the character of Rosamond Vincy is one of the elegant pieces of dissection of any character in English literature. Her failed relationship with Lydgate is at times almost painful reading as it either reflects either oneself or people you know. Like all good reading, it becomes a commentary on your own life and makes you reconsider your views.I read the Penguin classics version with some commentary and I found the notes to be invaluable as well as the bibliography."},{"Title":"Middlemarch","review":"George Eliot was the greatest sculptor of characters. She could do grand magic with words. Through the words of George Eliot, we know each and everyone of the characters in her novel with intimate details and deep sympathy - we could see their faces up close: now they blushed, or darkened, or twitched, or pouted, or lighted up, or looked bewildered. She expressed the most difficult, the most ambiguous, and the most awkward feelings with precision, charm and force. In Middlemarch, the story had a simple, rambling plot, put together to support the cast of characters Eliot lovingly sculpted. Many argue that Middlemarch is one of the greatest novels of all times. Yes, I agree."},{"Title":"Middlemarch","review":"I'm no smarter than you if your reading this review. I thought MIDDLEMARCH was GREAT. DO NOT be intimidated by a 19'th century 800 page novel, it is very easy to read and the story becomes interesting very quickly. If your common folk like me who likes to read good classics pick this up, you will really enjoy it....and keep me updated!"},{"Title":"Middlemarch","review":"This classic Victorian novel was on my list of books to read, and I had heard good things about it.This epic novel (880 pages, lots of characters) begins with the story of Dorothea Brooke, a kind-hearted young woman who gets stuck in an unfulfilling marriage. Eventually, she is able to find love. The rest of the story (and there are multiple subplots) is filled by the intricacies of the townspeople of Middlemarch. Here you will wade through stories of gambling debs, family scandal, and various other estate affairs.If this sounds intriguing to you, then have at it. Eliot is wonderful at Victorian prose, and although she was often criticized for being \\"depressing,\\" it's great stuff. If you thought \\"Emma\\" or \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" was a little slow, however, then it is likely you will not be impressed.The main problem I can see with a book like this is that there is something in it for everybody to complain about. Victorian romance novel fans will complain that the book is not happy enough, and that Eliot doesn't talk enough about love. Epic novel fans will complain that there isn't enough going on and some things are only hinted at.This book is notable in that Eliot was trying to write a much more serious novel than other women writers of the day, and in that she succeeded. Readers who are interested in women writers should read this book, and it is important in the history of English literature. I guess I wasn't able to see as much there as others could."},{"Title":"Middlemarch","review":"I have often wanted to read Middlemarch but was intimidated by the length. The first few chapters are tedious and overwritten; I nearly gave up at some points but I always thought, \\"I got this far, I might as well go further.\\" I was generously rewarded: by the end of the book, I was sorry I had finished it and sad that I would no longer read about these characters who had become so intimate to me. That's my measure of a masterpiece. I felt as if I'd lost some friends in the main characters when I closed the book -- friends who taught me some things about life.The main reason I was bored in the first few chapters was because I found Dorothea Brooke so unbelievably \\"good\\" and \\"pious.\\" I could not relate at all to the character who seemed one-dimensional. And I was not surprised or sympathetic when she had deluded herself into marriage with Mr. Causabon, the epitome of \\"ivy tower\\" arrogance. But I believe now that George Eliot's early depiction of Dorothea sets us up to realize that we all often are youthful and idealistic when we are young and believe passionately in \\"saving the world\\" -- and to parents we probably seemed irritatingly naive. Even with the best of intentions, as Eliot shows, we often fall short because of societal restrictions and mistakes we make in life; and then we \\"grow up.\\" In the final analysis, George Eliot makes her point well: we can inspire people and change their lives with one act of kindness and by doing good in our community in our quiet ways. I started out rolling my eyes at Dorothea and ended up wanting to emulate her in my own life.I am surprised that so many people think the story centers around Dorothea. What makes this novel so compelling and fascinating is George Eliot's extraordinary accomplishment in creating an entire village with complex characters so different and yet so similar to each other. I would say this story is as much about Lydgate, Rosamond, the Vincys, Fred and Mary, the Garths, Mr. Causabon, the Chettams, Will Ladislaw et al as it is about Dorothea.In my copy of the book, there is a quote by Virginia Woolfe that says, to paraphrase, that this book is a great English novel written for adults. This is so true! I am a die-hard Jane Austen fan, but the one major flaw I see with Austen is that her novels are about courtship and end at marriage and thus are easier to write (though in my wildest dreams I could never write as brilliantly as Jane Austen). Courtship is often exciting, romantic, and idealistic. But marriage, and any long-term relationship, involves compromise, trials and tribulations, tests of a couple's strength, or the events that reveal the weakness of their bond. This novel examines the full range from courtship through all the peaks and valleys of marriage and the difficulties within all relationships. Along the way, you find yourself sympathizing with each character, even while you realize you loathe what he/she is doing, his/her point of view. What's amazing is that within this complex set of characters lies complexity within each person.There is so much to comment on, but the novel is so rich I can't do it justice so I recommend everyone to read it just once."},{"Title":"Middlemarch","review":"George Eliot hasn't yet gained the modern pop success of Jane Austen or Edith Wharton, but I think its only a matter of time before she catches on in a big way and we see a big. lush movie version of Middlemarch.For now, dont be put off by her novels of great Victorian size. If you are used to the broad comic brushstrokes of Charles Dickens, you will find Eliot a much subtler artist. She paints very subtle shades of emotion and morality.If you have already read Middlemarch, you should seek out Virginia Woolf's essay on Eliot in her book, The Common Reader. Also, Eliot figures highly in Sandra Gilbert's study of Victorian literature, The Madwoman in the Attic."},{"Title":"Middlemarch","review":"I read Middlemarch 30 years ago for a highschool assignment. It was over my young head. Making it through the 900 pages was like climbing a mountain and back. It took me about 600 pages to get into the book, and hundreds of pages were devoted to the politics and goings on of the time - something I had little interest in. A more mature reader would probably have found that fascinating.YET - Of all the books I have read and heard through the years, it is a few sentences in this book that captured my heart more than any other anywhere. See what you think:\\"That element of tragedy which lies in the very fact of frequency, has not yet wrought itself into the coarse emotion of mankind; and perhaps our frames could hardly bear much of it. If we had a keen vision and feeling of all ordinary human life, it would be like hearing the grass grow and the squirrel's heart beat, and we should die of that roar which lies on the other side of silence. As it is, the quickest of us walk about well wadded with stupidity.\\"(Middlemarch, a few paragraphs into Chapter 20.)For writing and insight like that, people make pilgrimages. Eliot's writing has thousands of brilliant paragraphs that are stunning in their eloquence and clarity."},{"Title":"Middlemarch","review":"George Eliot, (nom de plume of Mary Ann Evans), wrote a literary masterpiece with \\"Middlemarch.\\" This Barnes and Noble hard cover edition is a good one, however I would recommend their newer, paperback publication with an Introduction by author and poet Lynn Sharon Schwartz, or the Penguin Classic version. There is also a brief biography of George Eliot included in the B&N; paperback. This superb novel will always rate 5+ Stars for me, but this particular edition is not the best.Ms. Eliot created here, an entire community in England in the mid-1800s and called it Middlemarch. She populated this provincial town with people of every station, local squires and their families, tradespeople, the rising middle class, (Middlemarch, right?), & the poor and destitute, ruthless and honest. She crowded them together, with all their ambitions, dreams and foibles, in this magnificent literary soap opera, and wove a wonderful web of plots and subplots. Ms. Eliot also wrote scathing social commentary and used great wit.The fortunes of Middlemarch are rising in this new era when machines and trains - fast, available transportation - are changing the world, the economy, the politics. Rigid social codes, the British class system, is in danger of being breached. Folks are out to make a quick buck, or a shilling - anything to acquire wealth and enhance social position.Dorothea Brooks lives in Middlemarch. She is an intelligent, sensitive young woman, who wants to dedicate her life to important endeavors. She does not want to settle for a typical marriage and family, but looks toward a more noble cause. As a woman, a professional life is not open to her, nor is the pursuit of intellect, outside of marriage. She weds the elderly Rev. Casaubon, a cold, narcissistic man, thinking that by assisting him with his scholarly research and writing, she will find happiness.Dr. Lydgate comes to Middlemarch to begin his medical practice there. He is an idealist, who has dreams of finding a cure for cholera and opening a free clinic. He meets blonde and beautiful Rosamund Vincie, who fancies him for a spouse...along with a new house, new furniture, an extensive wardrobe, etc.A dashing, romantic Will Ladislaw, nephew of Rev. Casaubon, enters the story, as does Rosie's brother Fred, who wants desperately to marry his Mary, but is out of work and in debt. This cast of richly drawn characters continues to grow with the introduction of Mary's family, the Garths, the banker Bulstrode, friends, relations, and an evil villain or two.This complex novel and portrait of the times, is one of the best reading experiences I have had in a long while. I cannot recommend it highly enough.JANA"},{"Title":"Middlemarch","review":"It would be interesting to plot a trajectory of women's novels from Austen to Wharton. Austen looks at marriage as the goal, the consummation; Eliot follows it through its problematic stages; and in The House of Mirth its absence fills the novel. The view of marriage darkens with each step. Every marriage in Middlemarch is blighted, except for those that take place at the very end of the book, which seem almost like dreams compared to the unpleasantly realistic situations that have preceded them. Eliot's even, slightly sardonic tone is rarely bitter or bleak; when she steps back and comments on her characters it's always a delight to hear her sane interjections. Yet she is hardly unbiased. She has little sympathy with Rosamond or Casaubon, and a little too much patience with Dorothea, whose piety I found grating, and Will, whose ticklish pride and unwillingness to compromise seem a bit silly. The way she handles Lydgate's irritability, on the other hand, is perfect: &quot;To the last [he] occasionally let slip a bitter speech which was more memorable than the signs he made of his repentance. He once called her his basil plant; and when she asked for a explanation, said the basil was a plant which had flourished wonderfully on a murdered man's brains.&quot;"},{"Title":"Middlemarch","review":"I used to own a bookstore and when people would ask me my favorite book, I always named \\"Middlemarch.\\" In my opinion, this is the greatest book written. George Eliot was a towering intellect and a masterful observer of humanity. Sure, you have to really focus on this book while you're reading it, but it's worth it. Dickens was a piker compared to Mary Anne Evans (the author's real name). Make the time to read this novel someday (along with Moby Dick, Ulysses and War & Peace)."},{"Title":"Middlemarch","review":"I first read this book as an undergraduate -- and I still pick it up now and again for inspiration. This is Eliot's best novel -- you may go on to read Daniel Deronda, Adam Bede and The Mill on the Floss, but this is the one to start with. It has it all: the love story, the quest for fulfillment, an Italy honeymoon, allusions to John Milton, and financial struggles.Tolstoy, Trollope and Dickens also capture the rich panoramic vision of humanity that Eliot shows -- but her view is so much warmer, so much more optimistic and expresses a strong undercurrent of benevolence. After you read Middlemarch, you will feel renewed and optimistic about the possibility in the world.If you are at all interested in realism or nineteenth century life, you will really enjoy Eliot's portrayals of both Dorothea Brooke and Tertius Lydgate. Dorothea is the quintessential Eliot heroine who seeks to do good and be perfect in an imperfect world. She marries a much older man because he is a scholar -- however, he doesn't understand her spirit or her youthfulness. Tertius Lydgate is the idealistic doctor whose major character flaw is that he falls in love with women who don't see the value of the medical profession. Eliot traces the development of both Dorothea and Lydgate, as well as other characters in the community: Mary Garth and Fred Vincy are just one example.If you are up for a challenge of a mixture of a nineteenth century novel, a mastery of realism, and some unexpected philosophy, you will gain something from reading this work. It may be enjoyed on many levels, but I think the most important one is that it shows portraits of the people who still inhabit our world --- the unsung heroes and the quietly talented."},{"Title":"Middlemarch","review":"I'm a huge fan of George Eliot, and this was the first of her works I read. I actually cried when I turned the last page. The story is truly several stories in one. Perhaps it centers around two motherless sisters who have been raised by their uncle, an estate owner in the habit of turning a blind eye to the concerns of his tenants. Dorothea, his eldest niece, is humble young woman, beautiful and unaware of it, and self-denying to a fault. Her sister is somewhat more trivial but her admonitions to her sister to lighten up and enjoy herself are not without merit. Amidst the vast pool of characters are also the idol youth Fred Vincey, who might just turn right if the woman he loves would give him any encouragement. Mr. Lydgate is a new doctor in town, anxious to introduce new reforms in medicine and hospital management, and he, a sworn bachelor, soon finds himself in the clutches of the adventuring, but all in all well meaning Rosamond Vincey. In the background scandal and conflict are brewing and our dear Mr. Lydgate must keep himself above water. To me, however, the story is about Dorothea. Her self denying ways land her in an unhappy marriage to a man who will not be pleased (the self-important prig.) In the mean time, she becomes acquainted with his young nephew and they form a rather intense friendship. When the husband dies, and he wills away all of her inheritance should she form any kind of alliance with Mr. Ladislaw, it seems she is doomed never to find happiness, despite her enduring endeavours to be a good influence to all around her.This book, to me, is a testament to the power of good influences. Dorothea is quite possibly my favourite heroine of all time."},{"Title":"Middlemarch","review":"REALITY:It took me probably 5 months to slog through the first 442 pages. So much detail. Stuff about the local politics that I didn't understand. Booor-ing. But because everyone, including my best friend, said this was such a great book, I persevered. After page 442, the pace picked up. Once Raffles entered the picture and the truth about Mr. Bulstrode came to light, then everything suddenly came together into a spell-binding last 250 pages that I whipped through in 2 days.If you can somehow force yourself through the first 2/3 of the book, you will be rewarded with what turns out to be one of the finest stories ever written (in my opinion).ESPECIALLY LIKED:I appreciated the realism shown in the romances and marriages of the young couples. How many stories portray marriage as the most wonderful institution on earth instead of what it more often is, the most difficult, particularly in the beginning? I was comforted to see what really went on behind the scenes.There was nothing contrived or flakey about the characters. Even the worst of them was believable and acted in ways that were consistent with expectations.The development and twists and turns of Dorothea's romance with Ladislaw was exquisitely portrayed. It all seemed completely impossible, and it was completely impossible, but somehow it all worked out in the end.WHY? WHY? WHY?In these old novels, so many times the young beautiful girl marries some louse or jerk and is miserable. The author dreams up a convenient way to remove him. The girl then gets a second chance at happiness with someone who is wild about her, and they live happily ever after. How many people wish their lives could be rewritten so easily? Well, it is nice to escape into a fantasy world where everything turns out well. Then we put down the book and resume our wacky lives of hardship and never resolved problems."},{"Title":"Middlemarch","review":"This classic is a wonderful experience to read, as I expected it would be. The story gets 5 stars.Like other new Kindle owners (apparently) I downloaded an assortment of free books - mostly literature I did not read in school and want to read now. I have seen reviews of Kindle books that complained of formatting glitches in various publications, and this is one that has them. It's a little jarring and disruptive to the flow of the story when lines are truncated and paragraphs are chopped up into smaller segments. If I had paid for this book I would want a refund. 3 stars for the Kindle version."},{"Title":"Middlemarch","review":"That is high praise, I know, but I couldn't think of any better superlatives. George Eliot writes with such keen insight into such diverse lives, it staggers the imagination. Virginia Woolfe wrote that Eliot was one of the few nineteenth century authors who wrote for grown up people, and I couldn't agree more. She never insults her readers by telling them what their opinion should be of any of her characters. They are all intricately drawn with an even hand, good traits and bad. Just when you think you've found a character that it is impossible to sympathize with, Eliot debunks your opinion in a single poignant paragraph.I read and loved this book in college, and I've read it every two or three years since. It never wears thin. Anyone who wants to know how perfectly seamless a novel can be must read this masterpiece."},{"Title":"Middlemarch","review":"I just this book as a required reading for a philosophy and thematic discussion class, and while I have found all the books asigned worthwhile reading, I didn't know what to expect with this book, having never read any Eliot and also having heard it described as a &quot;chick book&quot;. While it does often read like an extremely ellaborate 19th century soap opera, I cannot recommend this book highly enough, whatever your reading preferences. This book cuts across genre lines not just as a result of the witty storylines and sharp dialogue but as a legitimate and inciteful case study of human nature and human interactions, both social and romantic.Set in and around the town of Middlemarch, somewhere in England, the story encomasses the lives of a slew of dilightful and diverse townspeople, tending to focus on and revolve the story around three couples: Dorothea/Ladislaw, Rosamond/Lydgate, and Mary Garth/Ted. The entire story is very complicated and impossible to give a summary of here, but sufice it to say that Dorothea is an aristocratic, idealistic, religious girl of twenty who wants to do something great and has an inquiring mind, so she marries a man named Casaubon, but he turns out not to be so great as she had hoped and he has a young cousin named Ladislaw who has been supported by Casaubon and doesn't understand how Dorothea could be attracted to him, and is convinced that Casaubon will make her as wretched as he is so Ladislaw must protect her... And that's just one of the many inter-weaving subplots.The real genious of this novel is the complex realistic characters that George Eliot fills her book with. These characters are all real and presented in such a svmpthetic light that though you will likely come to care for some and despise others, you find it difficult to judge them as being good or bad. The role that human relationships plays in our lives and the problems caused by common miscommunications are all dealt with realistically and sympathetically. Questions such as, what makes a good marriage?, what does it mean to be great?, and how should one treat ones fellow man? are all featured genuinly a promonently.This is not to say that this is necessarilly a philosophic novel, it can be read just for the real pleasure of reading, but it is one of those rare great books that never fails to entertain while engaging the mind and the spirit throughout. A must read for anyone, regardless of taste, who likes to read for the sheer pleasure of it."},{"Title":"Middlemarch","review":"There is no question that this novel is a work of fine literature and an unusually in-depth portrait of the lives of a few characters. On this merit alone, it is worth reading. But . . .I found the book, despite its astuteness, to be rather dull and dry, and ultimately boring. While I appreciate detail, I also appreciate aesthetic description, and her ongoing passages were simply not amusing enough to keep me interested. Don't get me wrong: I understand that literature is not all about feel-good entertainment. But this novel is as lacking in the aesthetic department as it is brilliant in the technical/analytical. And when a book truly bores you, what difference does it make how fine a novel it is?"},{"Title":"Middlemarch","review":"This one deserves 10 stars, it is really one of the most incredible books I've ever read. I think I've only given a brilliant rating to the Count of Monte Cristo and Bleak House. This is a fascinating character study of the people of Middlemarch, a town in Victorian England. I can't even begin to try to describe the story -- there is Dorothea who makes a dreadful first marriage to an older man, Dr. Lydgate and his disastrous relationship and marriage to the self-centered Rosamund, Fred Vincy and Mary, and much much more.The way the author pulls her story and characters together is incredible, and the insight into the characters is nothing short of brilliant. To quote from the book jacket and Virginia Wolf \\"one of the few English novels written for grown-up people.\\"Just be warned, this is not a sit on the edge of your seat, can't put it down until it's finished type of novel. This is a story to savour and enjoy the multi-faceted characters and the author's glorious prose like a fine red wine or a box of chocolates (or both). If you are looking for high action and adventure, this is not the book for you. Highly recommended for any lover of 19th century English literature, not as dark and brooding as Hardy can be, but the prose is just as lovely, if not better."},{"Title":"Middlemarch","review":"This book is very high on my list of favourite books of all time, and it is thought to be George Eliots' masterpiece. It is wonderfully grand novel that covers a lot of territory in a lot of pages. There are four main plotlines in the book, and Ms. Eliot develops each of them to the fullest without letting any of them get lost in the shuffle. There is the story of Dorothea Brooke, the story of Lydgate's marriage, the history of Mary Garth and the fall of the banker, Bulstrode. The book is a masterpiece because of the storyline and the characters which she does so very well, but it's also a masterpiece because it is a very substantial work of great psychological and moral penetration. I can't say anymore about the book, since my words cannot hope to convey the grandeur of it, but it is a \\"Must Read\\" for anyone who loves great literature and purity of the English language. Definitely another \\"desert island\\" book for me."},{"Title":"Middlemarch","review":"I was enchanted with Dorotha who had to overcome those typical barriers on females in the Victorian age. Timeless story in all aspects, you begin to take in the ways of life in the past, the bust and the corsets, the quiet gossip behind others backs.George Eliot is a wonder of a writer, she needs more attention in high schools and colleges, her books entertain as well as challenge."},{"Title":"Middlemarch","review":"Middlemarch offers something for everyone: politics and history, crime and punishment, and three romances of different sorts. George Eliot grants us a panoramic view of life in the English Midlands during a period of reform. She offers us the large bustling town of Middlemarch as a place where dreams are made and broken whether they involve money, elections or the eternal business between man and woman.Dorothea Brooke is a heroine I rank only second to Elizabeth Bennet ( and I want to be Elizabeth Bennet) and slightly ahead of Emma Woodhouse. Her groping to define the terms for her life gives the novel its sturdy spine which Eliot uses as a frame for her tale of life in a mercantile town.Read Middlemarch and if you want to talk about it contact me, CassiaV@usa.net."},{"Title":"Middlemarch","review":"Got this in anticipation of the holidays. The cover and materials are very pleasing. I am so glad the classics are presented this way for new readers."},{"Title":"Middlemarch","review":"Middlemarch is, simply, the best book I have ever read. The story itself is absorbing (following a rather long, but necessary, period of exposition at the beginning of the book), but what I found most engaging were George Eliot's sense of humor and the total relevance of Middlemarch's themes to life 150 years later. What an amazing work!"},{"Title":"Middlemarch","review":"This delightful and intriguing novel, which takes place in the small town of Middlemarch, is far more than a trio of love stories, personal entanglements, and breeding ground of secrets. Middlemarch is also an interesting commentary on period views on gender and class issues. A pleasure to read and you will be wiser!"},{"Title":"Middlemarch","review":"I don't like abridged books, and didn't notice it was an abridged edition. Am disappointed. I realize it said it was abridged, but didn't notice it."},{"Title":"Middlemarch","review":"This was a monster of a book. Not recommended if you are a flaky reader. Luckily I was forced to read this giant in about a week or so. However, I must admit that I lost track of a few of the characters throughout the book, which is why a family tree is helpful. But I suppose it just takes a matter of getting used to something and then it becomes second nature.I felt the same way about shows like Lost and Heroes. I was a little turned off by how many characters there were. However, the more I watched the show, the easier it became for me to figure out each of the characters back stories and how they were connected. Middlemarch should be given the same chance and learning curve. It takes time. Overall, it's a good read if you are into a long book. I usually don't have the patience for a book this long, but at least I can add it to my impressive reading list of books."},{"Title":"Middlemarch","review":"George Eliot (actually Mary Ann Evans) created a remarkable story. One would think a 794 page story would have to contain a fair amount of filler. Yet Mary Ann Evans had so much to say, so much humor to share, insight to express, and story to relate that no less than 794 pages would have sufficed. This is a tremendous book."},{"Title":"Middlemarch","review":"This is absolutely one of my favorite books ever. George Eliot is a genius -- I wouldn't change a thing. This edition is nice and sturdy, and reasonably priced too."},{"Title":"Middlemarch","review":"I'll add my own impressions that every prospective husband and wife, and every husband and wife should read this book. It's been noted that Middlemarch contains some of the finest scenes of married life written. Criticism serves to place this work with the greatest of classics. In that perspective I only felt Middlemarch short of Shakespearean omnicience and less sweeping and broad in power than some of the Russian stuff. Elliot's machine gun intellect, present in every word, sentence and page, requires intense concentration reducing a little my ability to reflect and enjoy as I read. But the code word here is &quot;brilliant&quot; or substitute any similar adjective for this most enjoyable and worthwhile book."},{"Title":"Middlemarch","review":"I have just started reading Middlemarch and have finished the first 200 pages. It is a wonderful book, and Eliot is a superb writer. Every sentence contains such depth of insight and imagery. I am reading the book for pleasure but with the insight of a lover of literature. I have found that Middlemarch has to be read at least twice: once to appreciate the story of Dorothea, Lydgate, Rosamond, etc and another to truly appreciate Eliot's poetic prose."},{"Title":"Middlemarch","review":"I would like to refer the reader from Boston to Isaiah 3:16 &quot;Moreover the daughters of Zion are haughty, and walk with stretched forth necks and wanton eyes, walking and mincing as they go, and making a tinkling with their feet.&quot; Whether Eliot was racist I cannot say, although I suspect no more than any of her culture or time. I have no opinion on Isaiah's racism either...Middlemarch is a glorious book, a bit of a challenge for many modern readers but well worth it."},{"Title":"Middlemarch","review":"Middlemarch was a wonderful book. Being in a highschool english class, reading an assigned author's book can sometimes be hard, depending on your taste in books. I was truly surprised and enthused when I read Middlemarch by Eliot/Evans. Her style of writing makes it easy to read all 800 pages. I can't wait to find the PBS movie to compare the book too. This is a book that I would recommend to anyone!!"},{"Title":"Middlemarch","review":"Middlemarch is a superior example of that overused superlative, page turner. You absolutely do not want to put it down. What will Dorothea decide? What will happen to the doctor? Will people find out the secrets of one of the town's most prominent citizens? The beauty of the book is the &quot;dark side&quot; that it shows of English country life, the side that is coyly hinted at in all the beloved Jane Austen novels. Indeed, Middlemarch is the work that best highlights the place that Eliot occupies between Austen and the pull-no-punches cynicism of Edith Wharton."},{"Title":"Middlemarch","review":"You know how there are those movies based on books that just don't measure up to the original? This is not one of them.Middlemarch is a novel that can better be appreciated upon watching the superlative BBC production from PBS. After makinga date with my TV set for eight weeks in a row, never missing an episode, I enjoyed the series so much that I made my fatherbuy me the specific Modern Library edition of Middlemarch. It was only this edition that had the actors' pictures on the coverand they were characters I had come to know. I fear that I would not have been able to get through the gargantuan length of thisclassic if it had not been for the wonderful series; I doubt I would have been able to keep all the characters straight. Havingalready known the story and the characters, I was better able to concentrate on George Eliot's mastery of languageand atmosphere. As Virginia Woolfe noted, with Middlemarch, George Eliot was the first writer to acknowledge that characters thinkas well as feel. Dorothea is a far cry from the emotional excesses of heroines like Catherine of Wuthering Heights. Sensible,concerned, and possesing a deep heart, Dorothea is a character to which the reader can more easily relate than a histrionic consumptivelike Catherine and so many other contemporary literary heroines. Yet she is not the overiding character of the novel, and instead of astory revolving around one character, all the many characters of Middlemarch revolve around a story. A story of forgiveness, retribution,true love, career goals - in short, a story about the eternal questions and concerns of all humanity."},{"Title":"Middlemarch","review":"This review is of the 2011 edition published by Simon & Brown. I got this edition from Amazon and was completely shocked at the atrocious editing. There are numerous typos and transpositions, so numerous and egregious that they are completely distracting and make the book unreadable. Furthermore, the chapter headings are completely mangled. Eliot began each chapter with a quotation or poem, or piece of a poem (many of which she wrote herself), and in this edition, the lines of poetry are all run together so you don't even know it's a poem! I ask you! Avoid, avoid, avoid. Wonderful novel, read it in ANY OTHER edition. Edition to avoid is:Middlemarch"},{"Title":"Middlemarch","review":"George Eliot (Mary Ann Evans)ranksin the top rungs of Victorian and world literature. This brilliant woman has written a flawless masterpiece in Middlemarch (1871), The novel is amicroscopic detailed examination of life in a midlands towncaught in the transition from a rural to an industrial age.The characters are memorable and all too human in their complexity. There are three major love stories:1. Dorthea who weds the cold ineffective scholar Causobon onlyto fall in love with his cousin the artistic newspaper editorWill Ladislaw. One of the great love stories told in English.2. Dr. Tertius Lydgate who weds the belle of the village Rosamund Vincy. They are poorly matched with Lydgate being a reforming doctor and Rosamund a materialistic and shallow person.3. Fred Vincy and Mary Garth. Fred is a young man who drops out of school, gambles and is reformed by his love for Mary who comes from yeoman stock.Along the way you will become involved in local politics; small town prejudices and how life was lived in England justprior to the Reform Act of 1832. Eliot knew rural life and herpen is a beautiful crayon of color as she draws with aplomb theEnglish countryside in all its seasonal glory. There is even a mystery tale concerning the supposedly pious banker Bulstrode.This is one of the greatest if not the greatest of all Englishnovels. I concur with Virginia Woolf it said it is one of the few Victorian novels written for adults.I have read the book four times and watched the excellent PBSminiseries on \\"Middlemarch.\\" Each time I have gained new insights into the \\"web of humanity\\" masterfully drawn by GeorgeEliot.This classic work deserves to be read, appreciated and savored by anyone who loves a good story, beautiful languageand psychological insight."},{"Title":"Middlemarch","review":"It's easy to see why Middlemarch is a classic. The theme of reality not living up to one's ideals is a thread that runs through the lives of most of the major characters, and is instantly recognizable and relevant nearly a century and a half after the book was written.Idealism is most evident in Dorothea Brooke. She wants to lead a learned life of service to others, but Casaubon is not interested in teaching her much, and the great work she initially believes he is writing is an irrelevant, disorganized bunch of notes. Tertius Lydate is also an idealist whose ambition is to make contributions to the medical field. Before he marries Rosamund Vincy, he sees her as the feminine ideal, a woman who will provide unquestioning support and an emotional haven. Instead, she turns out to be a self-centered spendthrift who ennervates him. He ends up with no money or energy for his research, and must concentrate on making enough money to support his wife's extravagance. Interestingly, the characters who end up the happiest, Mary Garth and Fred Vincy, lack such lofty ideals.One of Eliot's strengths is her sympathy and compassion for her characters, despite their faults. However, she is no stylist, and I found her prose to be awkward and stilted. The reader needs to be patient with this book, because Eliot's style makes it somewhat difficult to get through."},{"Title":"Middlemarch","review":"&quot;Middlemarch,&quot; George Eliot's magnum opus, is a work that should have had the firm hand of an editor. Coming in at 838 pages, it is really about a 450 page work. Heavily padded with the author's observations and philosophizing, and interminable detail on sometimes minor characters,it reminds me of slogging through a rain-soaked, ploughed field until the final one-third of the novel.One main plot thread is that of the fatally flawed Nicholas Bulstrode who, though drawn to Christian religious sentiment, has feet of clay that ultimately destroy his plans for fame and honor. It is the destruction of Bulstrode that provides the most interesting story line in the novel. Bulstrode has, in his nefarious past, deeply wronged Will Ladislaw who comes to the town in the form of a cousin to the man, the Reverend Edward Casaubon, who will become Dorothea's first husband. Dorothea Brooke, the other main plot thread, is a super virtuous, moderately wealthy woman of puritan values and a naive zeal for service to some great cause. unfortunately,Dorothea's zeal overcomes her good sense, in spite of considerable advice from friends, and she marries Casaubon who she sees as a man with a mission. Unfortunately, Casaubon has not the ability to carry out the mission that he has chosen but he will be resolutely supported by the virtuous Dorothea in spite of her recognition of his short-comings. Fortunately, the Reverend dies early in the story, leaving Dorothea rather impressive wealth to carry out good intentions. Unfortunately, the Reverend puts a poison pill in his will that seems at first to thwart the virtuous Dorothea's desire to take the also virtuous Will Ladislaw for her second husband. Fortunately, Dorothea's virtue has no bounds and the Reverend's poison pill will have little ultimate effect.Mingled with these threads and bulking up the novel, not always to its benefit, are a number of other threads of miscellaneous colors. There is the young physician, Dr. Lydgate, who is newly arrived and thus jealously regarded by the established physicians of the town. Lydgate is of good character but poor judgement and so is deservedly punished by becoming inextricably snarled in the destruction of Bulstrode, giving the virtuous Dorothea a chance to demonstrate her virtue by saving Lydgate from total destruction. There is the Vincy family which has produced a son, Fred, and daughter, Rosamond (who marries Lydgate in the course of the novel), of imperfect character who thus impact other persons in the story to their detriment. Again the virtuous Dorothea rides to the rescue by demonstrating to Rosamond what the true character of a wife should be. An almost entirely separate story is that of Caleb Garth and his family who represent the Victorian ideal, hard-working, pastoral people of the earth whose morality exceeds that of the wealthy (except, of course, for the virtuous Dorothea.) Caleb and his daughter, Mary, demonstrate that pastoral virtue by saving Fred Vincy from himself. There is the struggling parson, Mr Farebrother, supporting his sister, mother and aunt who resorts to penny-ante gambling to eke out his finances; the virtuous Dorothea saves him from himself. There are many other minor characters, one of which is instrumental in the downfall of Bulstrode, but the ones discussed above represent the bulk of the story lines in the novel.Eliot chose to write her novel as the omniscient observer, giving her the chance to comment on anything she chose to and this is probably the weakness of the novel and the cause of its excessive length. She gives her readers little chance to form their own judgements, carefully analyzing her characters' faults and mistakes in judgements and adding extensive philosophical commentary. Take for example her description of Mr Farebrother's reaction to another man of the cloth who has bested him in getting a position which would have greatly reduced Mr Farebrother's need for outside income:&quot;But Mr Farebrother met him with the same friendliness as before. The character of the publican and sinner is not always practically incompatible with that of the modern Pharisee, for the majority of us scarcely see more distinctly the faultiness of our own conduct than the faultiness of our own arguments or the dulness of our own jokes. But the Vicar of St Botolph's had certainly escaped the slightest tincture of the Pharisee, and by dint of admitting to himself that he was too much as other men were, he had become remarkably unlike them in this - that he could escuse others for thinking slightly of him, and could judge impartially of their conduct even when it told against him.&quot;Eliot has to some extent defeated her own moralizing in this novel. Although Dorothea is a viruous woman, in the end it is always the fact that she has wealth that enables her to carry out solutions to problems.Eliot had not the ability of her contemporary, Charles Dickens, to draw memorable characters such as Fagin and the Artful Dodger but she included a much wider social swath and intensity of emotion than that of her predecessor, Jane Austen. Jane Austen, however, gave her readers more room for their own judgements and could write with an intoxicating style - for days after reading &quot;Emma&quot; I caught myself thinking in Austen's modality and tempo. Although Harold Bloom has included Eliot in his Western Canon, I could not bring myself to give her that status on the basis of &quot;Middlemarch&quot; as he seems to do. In my opinion, a reader would spend time to better effect by reading two or three of Eliot's shorter works such as &quot;Adam Bede&quot; and &quot;Silas Marner.&quot;"},{"Title":"Middlemarch","review":"This is my all time favorite novel. Eliot perfectly captures, the internal argument we carry within ourselves. This is the third time I read Middlemarch, but the first time with an e-reader."},{"Title":"Middlemarch","review":"Considered Eliot's masterpiece, Middlemarch is an extremely well-written slice of Victorian life in a fictious English town. The story is well-woven, and characters are very believable. Brilliant.However the book is lengthy and, like Eliot's other novels, the first half is slow-moving. Not for the impatient."},{"Title":"Middlemarch","review":"This book is an epic for the common people. It sheds the tradition of typical epic characters but keeps the epic form. This is a major work, and while I would be hard pressed to find any stylitically inferior passage, I still feel that it is too long. This is what will drive away many potential readers, and that's a shame. The book is a realist character study and an ethical treatise. It's hard for me to think of a superior stylist to Eliot. The story is a collage of characters, their ambitions, loves, and disappointments. It is the story of provincial British life. I have always had a problem with artificial literary beautification of plain things, but I think Eliot makes a good case for common characters - not merely simple but kind people, but people who might have been great if not for the extraneous factors surrounding their lives and clashing with their aspirations."},{"Title":"Middlemarch","review":"While I wouldn't place Middlemarch on a level with Jane Eryre or Tess of the Durbervilles as far as gut wrenching goes, it is well worth the effort. (and it was an effort!) I would suggest reading this as an adult when time, experience & patience will make the Victorian gems of wisdom and beauty within this novel more readily appreciated and understood. The characters are well developed and as I neared the end i could not put it down. Eliot's insights into humanity are timeless as well as convicting at times and I promise you'll have plenty of quotes to jot down in your journals for further reference & reflection.And of course the penguin hardback version is worth buying if only to adorn your bookshelf. Mine did wear a bit from over handling but it's still beautiful with its apparent use."},{"Title":"Middlemarch","review":"Middlemarch is one of my favourite books but the experience of reading it on Kindle is marred by poor formatting. When looking at the sample on the Amazon store the bad formatting is not obvious. Why is it the kindle editions of books give no contents pages. I am uncertain whether I want to buy an edition of this book because I cannot tell if the formatting will be any more worth it in the paid for editions. If I did not know the book really well I am not sure if I would be able to follow it with the often confusing format. The quotations at the beginning of each chapter are presented just as part of the text and their is no space between chapters which is really very bad."},{"Title":"Middlemarch","review":"Great novel. However, this edition is riddled with typos. Misplaced words, faulty paragraphing, and incorrect punctuation pop up continuously when compared to an Oxford edition I have. The good news is it's free. So really can't complain too vigorously about such things. And the story is a superior one."},{"Title":"Middlemarch","review":"This was the first book I read on my Kindle. Overall, I thought it excellent. The author portrays the innermost thoughts and reasonings of the characters very well. The 19th century writing style made it a little hard at first to become absorbed, and just when I was getting involved in the lives of Dorothea and Casaubon, part one ends and different characters are suddenly given center stage, with Dorothea and Casaubon seemingly left behind. This annoyed me at first, making it difficult to get into the characters of Rosamond and Lydgate. It felt like I was starting a new book. However, I slowly became absorbed again and was rewarded with the previous characters being woven back into the story. It all comes together, resulting in many times not wanting to put the book down. I'm glad I chose this as my first Kindle book and, after finishing it, I think I might want to read more from \\"George Eliot.\\""},{"Title":"Middlemarch","review":"Masterpiece? Greatest English novel? Well, I don't know about that -- it's very good, but it's not perfect. But it is funny, and it's a page-turner. Our heroine, Dorothea, is an intellectual stuck in a very provincial town, and she just wants someone she can have an intelligent conversation with, and whom she can help do some kind of serious work. A very marriageble but not especially bright gentleman courts her, and brings her a puppy as a present. Dorothea doesn't _mean_ to be rude, but she speaks her mind, that she doesn't approve of having pets just to pet them -- she thinks dogs are happiest when they have some serious work to do. I laughed out loud at this point, as at so many others. I know just how she feels! And I also understand the sighs that her friends sighed as they rolled their eyes. That's our Dorothea! The gentleman caller eventually marries Dorothea's sister, and they (and the puppy) live happily ever after. Dorothea lives happily ever after, too, but only after being very, very serious about things for several hundred pages. You'll love her, and you'll laugh all the way."},{"Title":"Middlemarch","review":"I bought the Penguin Classics edition (1994 version) because of the copious notes explaining language and references likely unfamiliar to reader's of today. These notes made reading Middlemarch a little more cumbersome, since they are at the end, but the added understanding made it worth the effort. Those interested in researching George Eliot's life and her other works should consider finding a copy of the Oxford Reader's Companion to George Eliot, John Rignall ed., Oxford University Press.Middlemarch, recommended by a friend who knew that I enjoyed reading 18th and 19th century literature, was a difficult book to put down. I had just finished Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre, and prior to that all of Jane Austen's work. In comparison, Middlemarch seems to hold a middle ground between Bronte and Austin in terms of style. Where Jane Austen's text tends to be light and simple, Bronte's a bit heavy and complex, Eliot's Middlemarch is also complex but it flows like Austen's best works. Middlemarch isn't perfect - Eliot actually revised the ending because it contradicted earlier assertions. But it is definitely a great read and worthy of being on everyone's bookshelf.Whether or not her depiction of early 19th century England is accurate I don't know. What I do know is that her characters are endearing in spite, or perhaps because, of all their faults, misunderstandings, and sometimes downright childish behavior. Eliot try's not to judge the actions of her characters by occasionally halting the story line and explaining them in what seems to be a neutral \\"scientific\\" manner; and I often found those explanations insightful and worth remembering (if only my memory would cooperate). Middlemarch, for me, stands with Jane Austin's work as one of the best novels I have read in a very long time."},{"Title":"Middlemarch","review":"Eliot really delves deeply into her characters' psyches, and this makes her writings so powerful. She presents more realism than most modern readers are used to; and, I'm personally grateful for the little appendix of notes at the end of my book.. they helped me understand the social/political climate of the day, and some of Eliot's historical references (which would otherwise be over the heads of the avg. American). Sadly, she lacks the hopefulness that comes across in Dickens' works, or in C. Bronte's Jane Eyre. Still, this is a brilliant work which deserves it's place among the greats of English literature."},{"Title":"Middlemarch","review":"For its cutting insight into her character's minds and her ability to keep true to each of their personalities, George Eliot's Middlemarch is unmatched. She gets to the heart of the matter with such sensitivity to the myriad ways her characters come to know themselves, their restrictions and their admissions both painful and happy, that it is often breathtaking for the reader. Maybe the first novel I've read whose characters are so engaging you wish you could meet each in person-- a novel which I don't want to end. I very much recommend it."},{"Title":"Middlemarch","review":"Rarely have I enjoyed a classic with more surprise than Middlemarch. It looks to be an endless and boring morality tale from the plot summary, but reads like a work of high psychological art.The only other writer who has taken me so convincingly inside the thoughts of so many characters is Shakespeare. A strong compliment, but Eliot shows that she had the goods and somehow weaves an epic and beguilingly entertaining tale out of a quite depressing subject and period.I recall not wanting this book to end; for an 800-pager, that's strong praise indeed.They don't write 'em like this anymore!I love this Penguin edition; they've been doing it right for so long that their versions of the classics have all the right, simple touches.Truly great writing makes you feel ennobled for having read it; Middlemarch is most decidedly one of those books."},{"Title":"Middlemarch","review":"A confession: I'm a bit cynical about classics, and have no particular fondness for 19th century British lit. I was genuinely surprised at how much I loved Middlemarch. The first time I read it, I plowed through it in about 48 hours (my professional editor of an aunt made the mistake of telling me I couldn't do it) - and, actually, while that may sound like a terrible idea, this is a book that would be easy to start and stop and start and stop and give up on because you've forgotten everything. I found myself truly immersed in these character's lives, rooting for them and groaning at them and feeling like I really know them - and you do, because George Eliot was truly a master. While Jane Austen shows human quirks through... less flattering, often irritating means (I confess that I usually find myself driven away by my desire to punch her characters), Eliot observes the characters honestly (\\"study\\" is indeed the right description) but in a way that makes you love them more, not less. And, of course, Eliot's writing is nearly flawless, with countless descriptions and moments that I had to go back and reread out of sheer awe and that History Boys feeling of a hand reaching out and holding yours.You can read Middlemarch without a care about English literature or history (though the latter will help), you can read it if you hate Eliot's contemporaries and have never read a 500+ page book in your life, you can read it if you're a teenager or an adult, optimistic or jaded. It really is one of the best things I've ever read, and I'd recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"Middlemarch","review":"This novel doesn't need my praise. But this edition needs censure. I have found over fifty typos and legitimate mistakes, the kind of thing you almost never see except in translations. \\"Unconquerable\\" is rendered \\"conquerable,\\" \\"in\\" becomes \\"is\\" (so you get things like \\"All force is twain is one\\"). You can't read more than a few pages without being distracted.It's embarrassing that this edition slipped by even a single editor."},{"Title":"Middlemarch","review":"I first read this book in a college course about self-deception as a theme in literature. This was by far my favorite of the things we read (we read such other things as Vanity Fair, The Ring and the Book).This is really a long book about ordinary circumstances in a 19th century rural area in England. So why is a book such as this one considered such a classic even though not many particularly grand events happen?The book is the study of the ordinary in many ways. You end up seeing how different people live and deal with different situations and what kinds of people they are. At the same time that the reader comes to judgments about the people in the book, George Eliot manages to portray most of her characters sympathetically. Even the worst people in the book are rounded out in some ways and Eliot tries to imbue a sense of humanity. It portrays an &quot;adult&quot; view of the world instead of the simplistic view of the child. In fact, Dorothea makes a journey during the book from a child with a romanticized view to an adult with a more rich understanding through life experience and wisdom.If you're looking for a book about exciting events, with high drama, with a fast pace, don't bother picking this book up since you'll probably dislike it. This is a book written by a woman and expressing some criticisms of a woman's place in the world of her time. It is also a book that explores a more ordinary setting and viewpoint than perhaps most male authors of the time would write in such depth about. She brings a different experience than most male or female authors of the 19th century. Male authors focused on grander events (their characters often fighting to get somewhere in life) while many female authors showed a romanticized view of life and love. Look at the romances of Jane Austin in which a good marriage seems to be the ultimate goal, or the stormy loves of Emily Bronte in which some strange control/love dynamic becomes magnified to almost heroic proportions. The author is showing something unique, more restrainted, less extreme, more &quot;middle&quot; or ordinary. She manages to pull off a more balanced or &quot;middle&quot; view, also. I noticed some other readers mentioned that it was slow, that they thought events were predictable, or other similar criticisms. These criticisms are valid as far as they go--but they miss the point since these elements aren't really the center of this book.In fact, Middlemarch is really about a somewhat mundane existance that is inhabited by many people in the real world. We aren't immune to a mundane existance today: work; TV; having enough money to get by; domestic squabbles; eating; relating to other people; perhaps dreaming of something grand but not accomplishing it. There are many events of a mostly ordinary nature that gradually lead one way or another in the lives of people (both ourselves and others around us).Really this book is about gradual changes, about good acts and bad acts. It's about coming to some state of acceptance and a kind of enlightenment in life. It's about making the unexceptional life one of meaning even when circumstances prevent many large or great things. It's about a hard-to-define quality called &quot;goodness&quot; even absent huge acts or events.In any case, give this book a read if you like 19th century English literature since it's one of the greats of the period. It's also one of my favorites since I feel as though the author is treating the reader as an adult, without pulling punches, while explaining something about the life that most actual people experience."},{"Title":"Middlemarch","review":"There are several wonderful, astute customer comments below so I will just add one thing. In addition to being an astonishingly well-crafted portrait of society, of marriage, of individual dreams and disappointments, I believe that Eliot wrote Middlemarch as a mirror for the reader to examine his or her own life--somewhere in this vast novel, if we are honest, we can all find someone like ourselves--and to realize that each choice we make, each of our relationships, provides us with the opportunity to affect the lives of those around us in either positive or negative ways. So often readers hold books at arms' length; it is easy to pass judgment on others, whether on characters in a book, or on our neighbors. Few books combine brilliant story-telling with profound moral value. Middlemarch is one such book. Do not hesitate to read it!"},{"Title":"Middlemarch","review":"It's daunting to dare to attempt a review of one of the world's great classics, but just a few words from an admirer. Middlemarch is the engrossing story of an intellectual woman's marriage to a straight-laced, traditional blue-nose of an English cleric. Poor Dorothea. Eliot captures her mind and feelings, her confusion, her drive to be true to herself, and her dilemma about how to do so, with sensitivity and clarity. Poor Casubon, who hasn't a clue what to do with this headstrong woman. Middlemarch also provides deep insight into small-town English society at mid 19th century. This is not easy reading, but neither is it overwhelming. This is a jewel of a novel that should be savored, worth every minute of the time it takes to appreciate in all its fullness. Definitely a stop and smell the roses sort of experience."},{"Title":"Middlemarch","review":"The author is a mindreader. The book is readable and funny and the descriptions and dialogue and ideas are great. It has all kinds of stories in it, and many different people."},{"Title":"Middlemarch","review":"Most people consider Dickens the greatest English novelist or the greatest Victorian novelist at the very least. While I admire Dickens' abilities, none of his novels that I've read comes close to MIDDLEMARCH in terms of accessibility, wisdom, character development or coherant plotting.This is not to argue that MIDDLEMARCH is a perfect work of literary art, or at least not in the eyes of today's readers. Many a modern reader will be put off by its length, the challenging vocabulary and complex sentences, Eliot's frequent allusions to political, religious, literary, artistic and philosophical esoterica, her characters' hyperbolic fear of \\"scandals\\" (laughable by today's standards), their views on the place of women in society, and Eliot's fussy Victorian \\"not\\" phrases that overflow throughout. (A random turn of the pages yields the following examples: \\"One fine morning a young man whose hair was not immoderately long ....\\" Same paragraph: \\"He was sufficiently absorbed not to notice ....\\" Next paragraph: \\"... a breathing blooming girl whose form, not shamed by ....\\") These begin to NOT thrill the reader before too long.But my litany of minor criticisms aside (and they are minor), Eliot's masterwork certainly challenges GREAT EXPECTATIONS, BLEAK HOUSE and DAVID COPPERFIELD for sheer reading pleasure, and far exceeds Dickens' novels in seriousness of topic and tone. As Virginia Woolf famously observed, MIDDLEMARCH was written for grownups.The one area in which Eliot clearly cannot challenge Dickens is humor. Dickens was a gifted humorist and created many a character simply to make his readers laugh, whereas Eliot appears to have been mostly uninterested in such trivial pursuits. Perhaps serious Victorian grownups weren't supposed to laugh?But fear not, if you give it a chance, you too will be swept up into Eliot's MIDDLEMARCH world, and you will find yourself caring a great deal about the fate of Dorothea Brooke, Tertius Lydgate, Will Ladislaw, Mary Garth, and the rest of her pantheon of characters, all of whom, far more than any of Dickens' creations, seem of flesh and blood rather than caricatures on a page.So, to answer the title question: is MIDDLEMARCH the best Victorian novel? Hard to say, but it gives GREAT EXPECTATIONS an excellent run for the money.High on my lengthy soon-to-read list: Eliot's DANIEL DERONDA, THE MILL ON THE FLOSS and ADAM BEDE."},{"Title":"Middlemarch","review":"I was extremely hesitant about reviewing George Eliot'sMiddlemarch, as it's been ten years or so since I've read it, but inthe end I couldn't resist adding my comments to those of others. Quite simply, it is the greatest novel yet written by an English author: Middlemarch is the fullest realisation of George Eliot's ideas on social philosophy combined with her utterly convincing characterisation and remarkable moral insight.The novel's 'heroine' is Dorothea Brooke, a young woman of excellent virtue who is passionately idealistic about the good that can be achieved in life. The provincial setting of Middlemarch is the environment in which Dorothea's struggle to fulfil her ideals takes place, and the novel's central theme is how the petty politics of provincial 19th century England are largely accountable for her failure. In parallel with Dorothea's story is the story of Lydgate, an intelligent and ambitious doctor who also runs up against the obstructive forces of provincial life and finds them severely restrictive of his goals.Eliot is supremely compassionate, yet never blind to the faults of her characters. Dorothea's ideas of social reform are naive, while her high opinion of Casaubon's work proves to be a major mistake. But Eliot is never cynical when the motives of her characters are pure, and does not censure them for failure. What she is critical of is the narrow minded self-seeking attitude which forces Dorothea and Lydgate to come to terms with the fact that often good does not win out over circumstance. The subtext to this is the fact that the high ideals and sense of responsibility intrinsic in both Dorothea and Lydgate means that there is no question of them ever finding love together. In essence, Middlemarch is simply about life and how things don't always work out, despite our best intentions, but are often the product of negative forces. In other novels Eliot's didacticism can sometimes jar, but it is impossible to ignore the depth of her wisdom in Middlemarch.Middlemarch is the best novel of our greatest novelist - of the major Victorian writers only Tolstoy can really compare with her - and I cannot recommend it highly enough."},{"Title":"Middlemarch","review":"Middlemarch is an enduring classic and I will always love it. I know the book is long, but it's one of those books that you will be proud to display on your bookshelf. This particular edition was really helpful; the editor's notes were illuminating and the book provided translations and context where needed. I have read the book before without editor's notes and having those explanatory notes really name a big difference. Also, this particular edition was really affordable."},{"Title":"Middlemarch","review":"Virginia Woolf called Middlemarch &quot;one of the few English novels written for grown-up peole&quot;, and I could not agree with her more. In contrast to her male contemporaries such as Dickens or Thackeray with their sentimentality and their clean stories, Eliot comes as close to facing the &quot;boredom, the horror and the glory&quot; as a C19 novelist can.Middlemarch is essentially about how lives can go wrong. It starts out with idealistic Dorothea Brooke wanting to reform the world and young Tertius Lydgate being about to rock the medical world with striking new discoveries. Eliot shows what life does to those two. Or better say, she points out how it is essentially each person himself or herself who is responisble for what happens. &quot;Time will say nothing but I told you so.&quot;No reader can fail to be touched by the wake-up call of this book: We must face what we are about to to with our lives and not take important decisions lightly."},{"Title":"Middlemarch","review":"I began reading Middlemarch to hate it. Although I had enjoyed other period dramas such as Jane Eyre (despite the often ridiculous plot), I couldn't help but feel that any book that was dragged out to over 900 pages was long-winded at best. I am pleased to say that I proved myself wrong, after I had a startling revelation about chapter 10 that I had actually enjoyed the book thus far. The charcters, whilst not all particularly likeable, are no doubt believable &amp;, in some cases, such that we can sympathise &amp; even relate to them. I should think that any reader would judge Dorothea's fascination with Casaubon to be misguided, but George Eliot herself asks us to be sympathetic, as lots of people, even in this day &amp; age, make the same mistakes.I have heard it said that Middlemarch is boring. Far from it. In fact, Middlemarch relates to modern society much in the same way that the Chrisitan principles of the Bible can still be practised. For example, the book says a lot about the nature of marriage &amp; love, as well as politics &amp; even such personal issues as integrity &amp; honour. You simply have to read the book with an open mind.For me, the book was mainly about Dorothea Brooke &amp; Dr Tertius Lydgate, as we follow both characters from courtship, into marriage, and from there, unhappiness. Both marry for the wrong reasons - Dorothea to be some sort of secretary to the father-figure she lacked in her upbringing, and Lydgate because he sees Rosamond as an ornament that looks good with him. In both cases, even if we do not agree with the descisions of the charcters, we can at least take an interest in their lives, as well as sympathise with them, identify with them, and such forth.Whilst I would not recommend Middlemarch to just anyone it is definately a good book, and well worth a read for more than the fact that it is one of the great recognised literary works."},{"Title":"Middlemarch","review":"I realize I'm in the minority, but I can't agree that this is the best, greatest, most wonderful (etc.) novel ever written. It's well-crafted, to say the least, but is it really enjoyable? At over 700 pages, and much of that social commentary, it can take quite a lot of dedication to get through.There's nothing wrong with social commentary in a novel; we could do with more of it. The problem is, it quickly becomes dated. There are entire chapters of &quot;Middlemarch&quot; devoted to discussions of 19th century politics -- which you do need a foundation of knowledge to appreciate. There are other chapters regarding the machinations in selecting a pastor for the new hospital, long rambles about the treatment methods of city and country doctors, and so on. As part of a study of English history, with a knowledgeable instructor to provide background information, this might be interesting... but to the casual reader it's dry, dry, dry.Aside from that, George Eliot goes to great lengths to explain events from everyone's point of view. Hardly a thing goes by without the reader knowing what everyone thinks about it, from the main characters to the people in the local pub. It's fascinating that she was able to flesh out not only her main characters but also the minor characters with whom they come into contact. It can drag on a bit, though.Finally, the main characters themselves: I won't be the first to note that &quot;hearing&quot; everyone extol Dorothea's overabundance of virtue is a chore, but the other characters do have their flaws; they are all too human, and very interesting, as are the relationships between them. The chapters where people interacted with each other and the story progressed were fantastic, but it still took weeks for me to finally put the book down.It's definitely worth reading if you like this type of historical fiction, but I wouldn't think less of anyone who found it not to their taste."},{"Title":"Middlemarch","review":"I jumped into Middlemarch and it became my meaning in life until I closed the book on the final page. Brilliant character development, stunning details (notice the little dog), amusing scenes, and a certain amount of suspense. Considering all that goes on and could go on, the ending is more of a fizzle than a bang, but overall the novel is very satisfying. I won't go on because there are so many reviews here.I read this book along with a friend, and we emailed our impressions and what we thought might happen. If you find the book a bit \\"intense\\" it can be fun to share it with another person and each of you will get insights. Note: Anything by George Eliot is fabulous and everyone should read at least a few of her novels. Middlemarch is often said to be the \\"best\\" perhaps because of its great detail. While it's wonderful I don't agree. I would give that place to Adam Bede or The Mill on the Floss."},{"Title":"Middlemarch","review":"Everyone should read this book before they get married. George Eliot is a master at rendering human character. She is a true sympathizer with the human condition, and merciless at the same time. Beautiful."},{"Title":"Middlemarch","review":"This book is wonderful from start to finish. Eliot deserves rank with the great classic writers. She has created fully realized characters about whom one comes to care. Her writing is pure 19th century--long descriptions and careful, insightful observations. I realize in today's world that we want things presented with &quot;more matter and less art&quot; but to find the art of Eliot, it is well worth wading through the 800-plus pages. This ranks up there with the best books I have ever read."},{"Title":"Middlemarch","review":"There are numerous reasons why you should not read George Eliot's epic novel of 19th century life in England, Middlemarch. First of all the book is quite long--700 plus pages depending on the edition. More significantly, the novel largely deals with the romantic, social, cultural and political life of a small English country town during the three years 1829 to 1832, with particular reference to the efforts to pass a Reform Bill. This subject is not likely to be everyone's cup of tea. Thirdly, the book is, to quote Virginia Woolf, \\"one of the few English novels written for grown up people.\\" It is certainly erudite, but to a large degree it is esoteric as well. The grown up person should also be an English major concentrating on 18th and 19th century British and European literature, with a graduate degree in world history, a familiarity with Greek and Latin literary history, a firm grounding in British 19th century political history, be an expert Trivial Pursuit player and be on intimate terms with at least four George Eliot scholars! The book reads like a college student's term paper in English Lit 101 in which the student tries to impress the professor by using a big word where a small one will do nicely and by using every name and obscure reference the professor alluded to in the lecture in hopes of getting an A. Granted there are footnotes (some 300) in the back of the book to explain the more obscure references, but it is a pain to have to keep flipping back and forth to learn that Tully Veolan is a Perthshire estate in Sir Walter Scott's novel, Waverly, or that Grinling Gibbons was a 17th century sculptor and painter. Finally, given the large cast of characters and the fact that many of them are related to each other it is difficult to keep track of who is who and their relationship to each other. The book would have benefited from a listing of the characters (a practice with many such books of this scope, as for example the works of Dickens).To be fair, the last half of the novel, when Eliot develops the human drama of the story and moves away from the social and political issues foci is gripping and compelling reading. Some people have criticized this part as being too negative, but it is when people are trying to deal with adversity, in real life and in fiction, that we most associate with them.The plot centers around the comings and goings of various characters in the community of Middlemarch, but focuses on two main characters. Dorothea Brooke is a young (19), idealistic, religiously devote girl who chooses to marry the Rev. Edward Casaubon, a much older religious scholar of sorts inspired by the idea of developing mentally under the guidance of her wise husband. But Casaubon is a prig, set in his ways, and ultimately the marriage flounders as he is revealed as a venial and jealous man.The second focus is on Dr. Tertius Lyngate, a young idealist surgeon who comes to Middlemarch and is installed, despite local opposition, as the head of a hospital by a wealthy banker with a dark past which comes back to haunt him. Dr. Lyngate marries Rosamond Vincy, the beautiful daughter of the mayor but that marriage also flounders because of her shallowness and material desires.Sub plots abound: the affairs of Sir James Chettam, a wealthy neighbor of Dorothea who, after being disappointed in seeking her hand, marries her sister Celia; the political aspirations of Dorothea's uncle; the aspirations of Will Ladislaw, a seeming upstart with an attachment to Dorothea; the affairs of Fred Vincy, a likable but profligate young man who loves Mary Garth an unattractive but good hearted girl; the actions of Peter Featherstone, a rich old man whose money and estate many people aspire to, and ultimately the appearance of his mysterious son; the belated appearance of Mr. Raffles, an unscrupulous man with knowledge of the past that affects several of the characters.Money and religion seem to be at the heart of most folks in Middlemarch and small town gossip abounds. If this sort of thing, wrapped in eloquent language, is enjoyable reading for you then Eliot's novel will give you hours of pleasure. But given the comments above, I really cannot give it more than three stars."},{"Title":"Middlemarch","review":"I really enjoyed this very long book, with its intricate plot weavings and army of characters. Even though its language was very old-fashioned, stilted and at times hard to figure out just what were the words saying, still it was all marvelous, and I was sorry to put it down. Lydgate was truly a tragic figure in the best meaning of the word, for the world would have judged him successful. How many authors have turned out such a figure, in just those terms? Rosamund was a hateful creature. The PBS series justified itself in every way, everyone very well cast, especially Mr. Brooke. The theme of disenchantment is seen in the marriages of Dorothea and Lydgate, in Bulstrode and Fred Vincy. All these people were so alive on the pages! The plot details, connecting so many people, was wonderful."},{"Title":"Middlemarch","review":"\\"Middlemarch\\" is, doubtlessly, a brilliant masterpiece. George Eliot shows what a profound and original mind. Her skills in narration and characterization are among the very best of English writers. However, the Modern Library Edition, despite the nice binding and paper quality, is plagued with little errors which ought to be easily resolved by one more round of careful proofreading. These little nuisances tend to get in the way of reading, I find, and I do hope that Modern Library will deliver a proof-read edition sometime in the near future."},{"Title":"Middlemarch","review":"Middlemarch has been described as the one Victorian novel written for grownups. Here, Eliot combines the multiple and interlocking plot lines so beloved by the Victorians with adult characters facing real problems. Particularly engaging is Dorothea Brooke's efforts to find a way to serve, if not achieve, greatness. Rather than undertake some great work herself -- something that Victorian women were not encouraged to do -- she chooses to dedicate herself to supporting a man that she mistakenly believes to be creating a major work. Similarly, Lydgate's slow downfall is realistically portrayed. Unlike many of the works of Dickens, Middlemarch's multiple plots work well together. If you have not read anything by George Eliot, this is the book to begin with."},{"Title":"Middlemarch","review":"This is such a classic novel, fascinating characters, interesting story lines! I might read it again in a few years"},{"Title":"Middlemarch","review":"Yes, much of this novel is slow going, but the characters have a complex authenticity sometimes absent from the \\"marriage as ideal\\" type of narratives. I admit I had to quit a few times and read other books before finishing this, but it was worth it. The last paragraph is gorgeous."},{"Title":"Middlemarch","review":"I now understand why people think Middlemarch is one of the great books. It encompasses all the human emotions and foibles in an absorbing story. Impressive use of language. George Eliot tells a wonderfully complete story. Thoroughly recommend."},{"Title":"Middlemarch","review":"It is hard for a modern reader to appreciate \\"Middlemarch\\" the way that contemporary readers must have appreciated the book. First, the book is written in a most convoluted and roundabout style, with long elaborate sentences conveying the simplest of meanings and emotions. Second, the plot and characters of the book have found themselves copied and pasted shamelessly by some many modern best-selling romance authors that the book no longer retains the striking originality and depth it had when it was first published. Third, the world that the book describes and lives in -- the provincial mindset, the unbreakable sanctity of marriage life, the honor code, the gentleman's conduct -- are no longer ironclad ways of life, and thus difficult for us to fully appreciate the emotional lives of the major characters. Then there is the length and pace of the book -- at almost 800 pages the book's plot does not start moving until two-thirds into the book, trying the patience of the reader who breathes and lives with his smartphone.George Eliot's most famous book (although I think \\"Daniel Deronda\\" to be her masterpiece) concerns itself with resolving three love stories. There is Dorothea, a young wealthy orphan who has her sights on making a significant moral and intellectual contribution to humanity and who thought she has found the perfect mate in her pursuing her idealism in a wealthy preacher twice her age and already at death's door, as everyone around her is quick to remark. There is Tertius Lydgate, a young doctor whose pride and idealism are just as burdensome as his name and as his modern medical education, but who is actually fell by his marriage to a spoilt princess determined to crush her husband's pride the way no one else could. And finally there is Fred Vincy, born into a wealthy family but who suffers from what the British nobility considers the worst affliction: laziness. The book drifts back and forth among these three characters, and it does so in a lazy and haphazard manner so that we fail to see what connects the three, and what the book's ultimate themes are. Indeed, there are many themes in this book, but none really lack the substance and integrity to stand out; inter-generational struggle (how the elders are determined to bind the young to their wishes and plans) and the hypocrisy of a provincial life (when a banker is discovered to have come to his wealth through ill-gotten means the entire town turns on him even though many in the town have benefited from the banker's wealth, and so much of the sanctimonious religious piety of Middlemarch has been in fact been bankrolled by ill-gotten wealth) must readily stand out, but even these two themes aren't strong enough to sate us with a shallow understanding of the book. What messages are we supposed to leave the book with? \\"Watch who you marry\\"? \\"It's better to be rich than to be poor\\"? \\"The young will make mistakes that they'll regret for the rest of their lives\\"?What interested me most about this book (and what probably interests most readers) are the love stories in this book, particularly Dorothea's story, and it is in her story and in her character that I found most wanting. Her character isn't fully developed, and there's a crass simplicity to her idealism. The book wants us to believe that in pursuing noble goals all of Dorothea's thoughts and actions are noble, and that's simply not credible to believe in a twenty-one year old. Dorothea's simple-minded idealism makes it difficult for us to sympathize with her, but what makes it nearly impossible is her ideal circumstances. Yes, she does marry a man twice her age, but this man also happens to be kind and generous if pseudo-intellectual and aloof -- he makes no demands of Dorothea, which she finds annoying but which also makes her comfortable. And when he departs he leaves her a fortune, making her instantly the matriarch of Middlemarch, and allowing her to conjure up the wildest schemes to spend her vast fortune. And all this while she is pursued by good noble men, and is doted on by the all the people around her. If Middlemarch had a longer time frame in which Dorothea is forced to suffer some loneliness for her bad choices then this would be a stronger, more compelling book."},{"Title":"Middlemarch","review":"I've read so many great reviews of Middlemarch that I can't really hope to compete but I have to say something. I had watched the mini series on NetFlix a while back and decided that I had to read this book. I bought the dead tree version and couldn't quite get through it even though I knew and loved the characters from the mini series. I recently purchased this as an audiobook and can't put it down. Middlemarch is easily the best novel ever written for its complexity of characters and sheer simplicity of every day life and struggles. As has been mentioned many times, this is not a tale of high drama, but the characters and what they go through are very accessible. Even though this book was written in the language of the time which I can imagine many readers will struggle with, keep reading anyway. I liked the audio version better for that reason. Although I know how it ends, I just don't want to finish it. I want to keep all of these characters with all of their flaws with me forever. This is not Gothic fiction, and Wuthering Heights still stirs me much more on an emotional and passionate level, but if we're just talking quality in literature and in painting the human portrait this is it, no question. Although I wouldn't rank this as my all time favorite book, I have nothing but respect, admiration and a great sense of awe for the writing ability of George Eliot and the intimate stories told within the pages of this book. Anyone who is literate and lives as an adult with all of the day to day decisions and struggles should absolutely read this book. Ms. Eliot was a true literary genius, few artists of any interpretation have succeeded in doing what she did so adroitly. This book is almost like a painting-a vast lush landscape where the characters make their lives. I think the author basically captured TV almost 100 years before it was invented, this book certainly puts our modern day reality shows to shame. With that being stated, there is a voyeuristic element to this novel that I think compels many many people to read it. Same thing that drives many folks now to watch the reality shows. We're all observers in Middlemarch and you probably won't come away from this book any more intelligent nor stupid than you were at the beginning, but you will have experienced the true power of literary genius and have found yourself entertained along the extensive, winding, intersecting journey."},{"Title":"Middlemarch","review":"Any reader can see why \`Middlemarch' is regarded as one of the greatest works of fiction in English Literature. The mere thickness of the book tells (and warns) the reader not to expect a simple, light, and cheerful view of Victorian life (not that there are many Victorian novels out there that are \`cheerful' or \`light'). And while the book turned a corner-stone for English fiction, it is by no means without faults. I was really impressed and fascinated with \`Middlemarch', but I cannot say that it cast the same spell over me as other Victorian novels like \`Wuthering Heights' or \`Jane Eyre'.First published in 1872, \`Middlemarch' takes place in the fictional town of the same name (based on Coventry, where Eliot lived as a young woman) during the late 1820's and early 1830's. It was during this period that numerous political and social changes were taking place in England, which led to the First Reform Bill: clearing society from Romanticism and paving the way for the Victorian period.There are several major characters in the novel: Dorothea Brooke, who makes a disastrous marriage to the ice-cold scholar Casaubon; his unsteady cousin, Will Ladislaw, who becomes greatly attracted to Dorothea; Lydgate, an inspiring doctor who fells in love with Rosamond, a beautiful but vain woman; her undisciplined brother Fred and his struggles with money, making it more and more difficult for him to win the heart and respect of his childhood friend, Mary Garth. These are just a few of the book's population; numerous other personages occur and interact with the main characters. As their stories become connected with each other, the political uncertainties in the background change their outlook on life, and leave them with feelings of both hope and despair. One of the major themes that they all face can be put in a question: what does the future hold in store for them and their destinies?I felt that the biggest fault in Middlemarch was its huge cast of characters: there really are just too many people in the book. Some of them say one or two lines, and then just disappear for several chapters; others are mentioned, but never make their appearance. Of course, it is important to have minor characters in any novel and play, but to have so many at such an extent as in \`Middlemarch' can simply baffle the reader. I really felt that the minor characters needed to play bigger roles in order to succeed more and confuse less.The second (and only other) flaw with the book lies with Eliot's intellect: personally I think that she was just too \`intelligent'. Her ideas for this novel are brilliant, but at the same time she tries to say just too many things at once. \`Middlemarch' is one of the most important works of Realism, and clearly the \`real life' portrayed in the book is thoroughly convincing and well executed. But at the same time, Eliot makes numerous references to other historical and literary aspects, some of which are set decades before the story's events. Most of these references are important to the novel's themes, but they are as numerous as the characters. I strongly recommend an annotated edition of the book, such as those published by Oxford and Penguin, to fully understand these references and how they fit into the context of the story.A year ago, I had seen the whole BBC adaptation of \`Middlemarch', made in 1994. It is a great and faithful adaptation. However, I regret seeing it due to the fact that most of the time I prefer reading a book first before seeing an adaptation of it. On the other hand, the series greatly helped me to understand some of the numerous characters a bit better. So it's a win-lose situation on all grounds.However, there are many great parts from start to finish. \`Middlemarch' is truly a remarkable book, written in a beautiful and compelling style. While it is a novel that you can't skim through (you'll have to read each sentence slowly and carefully), Eliot's use of language is superb, and keeps her hold on the reader, even if there are some parts that come across as dull.For most of the time, the plot moves on in a fast and thrilling pace. True, it frequently comes to a pause and gives the reader time to reflect over the events. Also, the political themes in the book are not the most exciting ones, but they play an important role, and give an interesting insight into how the views of English society changed with the Reform Bill.Despite the monstrous cast, all of the characters are masterfully crafted and drawn. Probably the most striking technique used with the characters is Eliot's psychological insight into their minds and feelings. This allows readers to love some of the people, pity the rest, and get downright infuriated by others. Eliot also makes use of this to allow her characters to develop to their full potential. It is undoubtedly one of the book's greatest strengths.\`Middlemarch' is by no means an easy read, nor is it faultless. But I do not hesitate in saying that it was one of the best books I've read this year, and at the same time it is one of the greatest and most important novels in the English language. It truly deserves to be ranked as the most ambitious novel that George Eliot ever wrote, and is a must-read for students and enthusiasts of Victorian Literature."},{"Title":"Middlemarch","review":"I have read Middlemarch three times before using a paperback copy. (The first time I read it was for a class at the University of Chicago. I finished reading it and I was so impressed with it, I immediately started reading it again!!). However when I started reading it the 4th time my paperback edition was so full of my previous notes that I decided to buy a hardcopy edition.This edition is very good. The margins allow enough room for notes, and there is a helpful Introduction and Explanatory Notes however, they are not nearly as strong at the Oxford paperback edition with D. Carroll and F. Bonaparte doing the Introduction, etc.I have spent over 45 years reading and rereading novels (among a lot of other types of works) but after reading George Eliot's Middlemarch I think she is the greatest author who ever lived and I consider Middlemarch the best book I have ever read.Although the pictures I have seen of G.E. would not indicate the below, this is what Henry James had to say about her,&#34;She had a low forehead, a dull grey eye, a vast pendulous nose, a huge mouth full of uneven teeth and a chin and jawbone 'qui n'en finissent pas'... Now in this vast ugliness resides a most powerful beauty which, in a very few minutes, steals forth and charms the mind, so that you end, as I ended, in falling in love with her. Yes, behold me in love with this great horse-faced bluestocking&#34;. Henry James, in a letter to his father, published in Edel, Leon (ed.) Henry James: Selected Letters (1990)&#34; (I took this from the Wikipedia entry for G.E.)The below is a quote from the Introduction to the Oxford edition. &#34;She could speak with authority on history, music, art, theology, anthropology, philosophy, sociology, psychology,.....; she was an excellent mathematician and had a love of all the sciences, especially physics, geology, chemistry, and astronomy; entomology and biology....Literature was her deepest love, the literature of many countries, and having made herself proficient, by the end of her life, in eight tongues (English, French, Italian, German, Spanish, Hebrew, Latin and Greek), she knew a good deal of Western literature in its original languages.&#34;If you would like to see one aspect of her abilities in another area, Amazon has for sale her translation of David Strauss's Life of Jesus Critically Examined translated from the German. I am quite sure, having read this work, that she had also to know Greek, Hebrew, and Latin in order to do this translation. Oh- by the way. From what I can tell she did this translation when she was 25 years old!!!One last note. For those of you who are interested in philosophy she was an Editor of the Westminster Review. This publication was the first publication to awaken Europe to Arthur Schopenhauer the great philosopher. I have purchased many books by Schopenhauer on Amazon and after studying many many philosophers over decades I have found him to be the greatest.Hope this has been helpful."},{"Title":"Middlemarch","review":"What makes one of the best books ever written even better?

Unfortunately, that is not the case. Compared to a typical free edition (Project Gutenberg, for instance) this edition has the advantage of an introduction and chapter links. However, the typography has amateurish mistakes. The font size changes from chapter to chapter (it appears than when verse is quoted, there is a tendency for the typeface to change size permanently). The text is sometimes justified, sometimes not. I have noted these irregularities both on a Kindle device and on the Kindle for PC program. The edition seems to be free errors in the text itself, and the formatting irregularities are a relatively minor distraction.Given the resources that Amazon has at its disposal, I still find it surprising that formatting of Kindle editions is generally so awkward and inconsistent."},{"Title":"Middlemarch","review":"This is a rich reading experience -- from a time when the written word was the only word. And Eliot draws from a far richer vocabulary than most of us have today. So this is an experience that is as challenging and enlightening as it is heart-breaking."},{"Title":"Middlemarch","review":"I read many of the reviews before I read this book. One woman said that her mom complained that reading it was like \\"jogging through Jello.\\" I thought that this was a very apt description because even though I really got into the story there were times when I felt overwhelmed by the many ideas and the excessive words. I even considered giving you a sample sentence (page 137) but didn't want to scare anyone off because basically it's such an interesting take on 19th-century rural life in England. I was so amused by the conversations among the simple folk--the gossip, the trivialities. But more importantly, I was so moved by some of the scenes--I cried buckets! And not just at love scenes. There is an interaction between two women which is extremely moving. I have noticed before that in Eliot's novels the characters show incredible forgiveness and compassion in some of their relationships.I had gathered from the reviews that there were no happy endings. This is not true. They weren't fairy-tale endings, but they were realistic which, to me, is better. The descriptions of the people, both their insides and outsides, are done so beautifully. I really felt as though I knew these people, and I wanted the best for them. Dorothea, I thought, was a perfect angel! Rosamond, on the other hand, seemed like a spoiled child. Lydgate and Ladislaw were both interesting characters and admirable in their own ways. I like Eliot because her characters almost always have something to recommend them--the main characters are rarely evil through and through. She shows her compassion for them in the way she describes their inner souls. She doesn't seem to completely condemn anyone. She sees the humanity in her characters and so we do too.I did feel like giving Rosamond a scolding and also the townspeople en masse are mean and you'll want to give them all a good slap, but they made me aware of the comments so many of us make behind others' backs without thinking about the harm we are causing.This book made me chuckle and cry, but it also made me yawn--hence four stars rather than five. If you have the time, try to jog (actually slog) through the Jello and then there will come a time when you know that you're in it for the duration--that you really want to know what happens to these characters and this to me is the hallmark of good writing."},{"Title":"Middlemarch","review":"Wow, what a book. Eliot created such absorbing characters in Dorthea Brooke and Will Ladislaw. A great humanitarian novel, complete with love, suspense, reality, all told in Eliot's powerful writing."},{"Title":"Middlemarch","review":"I will say that I love 800+ novels. This one took much patience on my behalf. I don't feel that the story has any true purpose or direction until chapter 15. This novel is about many things, perhaps too many: love, marriage, debt, character, the common good, a changing society. The three main stories which articulate the author's ideas are of varying degrees of interest and some characters are 'built' in better ways than others. My particular favorites are the Garths, Lydgate and Mr. Farebrother. The main character, Dorothea, is interesting but a bit too perfect-she's compared to the Virgn Mary, so that may give you an idea of how morally superior she is. The character of Fred Vincy annoyed me so much that I felt the many pages devoted to him were almost wasteful.The novel has wonderful aspects, the best being an attention to the moral and intellectual concerns of everyday people. The pages where Lydgate's innner turmoil about his debt are desrcibed showhow little things change.What is frustrating to me about this book is the intrusive voice of the narrator; I dislike being told things in a novel that should be shown instead. Plus, there is a long-winded style to Eliot's writing that I did not find in two of her books that I truly loved: The Mill on the Floss and Silas Marner.This book will appeal to you most if you want to read about marriage and the tolls it can take on men and women, especially men and women who think. The scenes between Lydgate and Dorothea are fantastic and chapter 81 between Rosamund and Dorothea is a rare thing in fiction: an honest scene between women."},{"Title":"Middlemarch","review":"I have been reading Dickens, Austen, Blackmore, Maugham, James and others and have enjoyed their works. To read more classics I ordered Middlemarch after seeing so many 5-star reviews. Although a majority of reviewers claimed to have sensed some profound depth in the book, the only thing I sensed was that it is a driveling tale. I forced myself to finish the book to make sure I wouldn't miss where the supposed depth was, but even with a whopping 800 + pages, I found it to be nonexistent.First of all, Eliot is too literary for my taste. She goes off on philosophical tangents and ends up speaking to the clouds instead of to her readers--more a display, in my opinion, of self-gratification with fancy words than of fine storytelling. Many people revel on her splendid philosophical allusions written in what they describe as fine, stylized prose. I don't appreciate her style at all. Her long-winded passages describing characters' thoughts through a maze of literary, historical and mythological references hijacked the storyline instead of adding to it. The result was too much baggage that gets lost on the average reader like me. If you want a gripping story written in poignant but down-to-earth language, read 'Of Human Bondage' by Maugham.Originally, Eliot had started two separate novels: one about Dorothea and the other about Lydgate. Then she heaped these two characters together with a plethora of others into one hodgepodge that ended up as the over-rated Middlemarch. The pasting together of bits from the two proposed novels is evident in Middlemarch, as the story comes out choppy, jumping from persons to places to episodes to where you wonder what business they have being bound between the covers of a single book. For example, the prologue, which talks of St. Theresa, is something she wrote for the Dorothea-based novel but kept it needlessly intact. We obviously relate Dorothea, who is portrayed as (and assumed to be at the book's beginning) the main character. After the first 100 pages or so Eliot attaches her Lydgate-based story and adds a myriad of other characters thereby shoving aside Dorothea. She ends up with such a cumbersome congregation that we are distracted from the solid storyline she was building around Dorothea. So I ask, what business does the St. Theresa part have to do with Lydgate, Rosamond, Bulstrode, etc. anyway?Eliot's characters seem fake in many respects, as I could not relate to them as people who could ever exist in our real world. One example out of many is the whiny, boneless Fred Vincy, a spoiled, spoon-feed grown-man who never ended up at the school of hard knocks. Everybody coddled him and made excuses for him; and yes, he was a nice guy, but real people wouldn't have come out totally unscathed as Fred did.The beginning of the novel held my interest, and I started to enjoy it when Eliot was describing the growing tension, despair and suffering--all the harsh realities of married life--that are building while Dorothea was on her honeymoon trip to Rome. Later, however, I became totally frustrated, as Eliot has Dorothea continually treat her dysfunctional marriage as if it were a lovely tea party. Dorothea's passivity, civility and subservience in her marriage started off as frustrating to me, but that was the character that Eliot created so I accepted it at first. After a while, though, the same monotonous tone of continuous passivity and subservience started to grate on my nerves until it finally transcended into the absurd: nobody would act like that in real life.Eliot never included any heated disputes between Dorothea and her husband. We were spoon-fed a few milquetoast disagreements between them: you know, everything was all so very prim and proper but of course, but oh so unnatural too. And also, Dorothea and her husband's atypical and stoic inter-actions and dialogue as a couple were more becoming of lifeless stick figures (think of Gumby dolls) in a silent-movie melodrama. Eliot wrote paragraphs infinitum of philosophical mishmash in lieu of writing normal and human drama depicting real behavior, real conversations, and real reactions between the couple. In other words, she leaves out all the good stuff that makes an intense novel. Lacking this, Eliot's story is neither credible nor a page-turner, differing completely from Henry James' \\"Portrait of a Lady\\" that has a similar theme but which is so brilliantly handled it creates a much more realistic and engrossing story.In the end, I just don't get it in terms of all the fuss about this book. What I do get is that Middlemarch by no means merits 'classic' status in my opinion. Adding further superlative praises about Eliot's writing sounds to me like getting onboard the bandwagon of literary snobbery, and although I am in the minority here, I will pass on getting onboard Eliot's bandwagon. I instead will seek much more enjoyable reading elsewhere; it does abound if you read the right authors, a couple of whom I have previously mentioned."},{"Title":"Middlemarch","review":"Middlemarch is treated as a classic: it shouldn't be. While it has some amusing stock characters and portrays some of the great disappointments of life, its moralizing is overt and its plot is boring.The characterization is thorough and and frequently good.

One can see the ending a mile off, and one begins to shift in one's seat after only 200 pages.However, one hopes that the end would have some twist that would dispell the reader's suspicions of a transparent march to an inexorable ending.

If I had the chance to do that then this is the book I would want to have in my hands.There are a lot of algebra textbooks out there. A lot of them seem to be stuck back in the 1980's or worse. It's not just using color graphics such as is done in the Discovering Algebra book, but using color graphics well. It's not just building learning around a project, but designing a project around which to learn. I think anyone can come up with a project, but designing projects to get the maximum learning out of each project is what I think the authors of this textbook accomplished.This is the textbook I would like to see translated and adopted for use in Israeli schools. It is exciting to read through and I think it would take away one of the key barriers to learning math for many students; that is that they don't see how any of what they learn in class relates to life outside of the math classroom.

The authors have good intentions and their aim was to create an effective textbook that focuses on Discovery learning. The Common Core Standards mandate mathematics to be taught this way. The problem with these textbooks is they focus too much on the means and not enough on the end.Most lessons are structured around an \\"investigation\\" where the students complete an activity ultimately leading them to a new conjecture, formula, or theorem. Next, one or two difficult examples in the form of a word problem is explained to illustrate the new concept. Finally, a challenging problem follows. My biggest issue is the textbook does not explicitly state the new content to be learned. If students are absent, they cannot stay caught up in class by reading the textbook unless they complete the investigation. The examples in the book are too difficult for students to comprehend without doing easier problems first, which do not exist. The textbook also emphasizes the use of calculators and frequently asks questions in terms of calculator lingo which detracts from actual learning occurring.The discovering series does its best to get students interested and excited about math, but it ultimately leaves them confused and frustrated. The textbooks do not prepare students for standardized tests or college math. Look elsewhere."},{"Title":"Discovering Algebra: An Investigative Approach","review":"The book doesn't necessarily explain in depth the why's of algebra; however, it does break it down into very small and simple steps with many examples to help your understanding. The textbook is definitely user friendly, which doesn't always happen. The investigations in the units are wonderful hands-on and real-life context problems. Wonderful for learning and implenting in a classroom for students!"},{"Title":"Discovering Algebra: An Investigative Approach","review":"I had to use this book when I taught a large class of high school Algebra students. I soon found that the examples and exercises were very poorly done. I had to work twice as hard as a teacher to prepare meaningful lessons and assignments because the book was so poorly written."},{"Title":"Discovering Algebra: An Investigative Approach","review":"I expect that a book with a subtitle of \\"An Investigative Approach\\" would teach concepts through discovery learning. That is the trend for learning/teaching nowadays. In fact, this book teaches math concepts like every other math book, it just has little activities to reinforce the concepts. I wasn't that impressed by the activities, either.What I want and can't find is a math book of discovery learning activities that help students uncover the ideas by connecting previous knowledge in a new way. I also want a book that provides meaningful, real-world applications to the concepts learned. This book isn't it."},{"Title":"Discovering Algebra: An Investigative Approach","review":"I strive to instill a love of learning in my students. The Key Curriculum press books also encourage students to enjoy the learning process, to explore, to discover patterns and mathematical relationships. The book is engaging and involves the learner on every lesson."},{"Title":"Discovering Algebra: An Investigative Approach","review":"I wanted to purchase a copy of my son's math text so that he wouldn't need to carry his school copy back and forth. (The book is quite heavy.) So this was a great find with an excellent price and the seller shipped very quickly."},{"Title":"Discovering Algebra: An Investigative Approach","review":"The book arrived quickly and it was in amazing shape.I had a question about what was included and they responded right away.I bought a second one, pristine condition as well, just like the first one."},{"Title":"Discovering Algebra: An Investigative Approach","review":"I had a 4.0 GPA in my math major at a top 20 private university in the U.S. and have loved solving math problems my entire life. My eighth grade son currently has the misfortune of being required by his prep school to use this book. The book is plain awful, full stop. This is the very first year my son's school has used this book, and I am going to do all I can to ensure it is the last."},{"Title":"The Second Wave: A Reader in Feminist Theory","review":"This superb collection of seminal texts from the so-called \\"second wave\\" of feminism is perhpas the best introduction to feminist thought I've come across. From Simone DeBeauvoir's famous statement \\"one is not born a woman...\\" to Gayatri Spivak's ruminations on \\"strategic essentialism\\" and Third World representation in American academia, literally every text is exceptional. The reader will find (almost) everything, from revolutionary African-American and Latina responses to the purported Eurocentrism in early feminist studies, to French feminists' (Irigaray and Wittig, specifically) provocative interrogations of the phallocentric culture, to mention a few. My only complaint is Nicholson's introductions to each section-- they could be a bit longer and more comprehensive; readers with a cursory knowledge of feminist thought should consider reading a basic introduction, not the texts themselves, before delving into this collection. Regardless, this book is a must-have for anyone interested in women's studies/feminism."},{"Title":"The Second Wave: A Reader in Feminist Theory","review":"I got this book for my Feminist Theory class, taught by one of the contributors, Uma Narayan, and have found it to be an excellent representation of the diversity of feminist theory: Radical Lesbian Feminists, Marxist Feminists, Liberal Feminists, Third-World Feminists and more all contribute powerful pieces. It really is a great way to expand your knowledge of feminism... you learn it's a complicated and controversial topic--many of the essays disagree with each other. I highly recommend this book for a diverse array of accounts in feminist history."},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"I just finished the book at 5am this morning. It took me a couple of days to get off and running but once I got started I could not put it down. The fact that I am a minister's wife made the reading even more interesting. There are women who act like Adrienne and ministers who act like Curtis. All in all, he got exactly what he deserved. I am not at all pleased with the choice that Tanya made in bringing a &quot;man of her own&quot; into the picture. I know that she felt alone, because she was. However, James should have never become a part of her life until after the divorce was final. This is an excellent read. Fast paced and believeable. It is about time that truth is told about men who want to be God."},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"This book had me up and jumping. Pastor Custis, was just like a pastor I knew 3yrs. ago. Mr. Man, chose to follow only his laws, and had forgot all about the commitment he made with GOD. I'm not saying all pastor are like this Pastor Curtis Black. However if your lost your way this book will also help you see your own short coming. I can not judge Pastor Black -but- it sure was funny reading how he actually thought he was doing this for the church. THIS BOOK WAS A TRIP! I don't have a clue, why some women know a man is married they believe he's going to leave his marrage to marry them &quot;WAKE-UP LADIES.&quot;I'm truly happy sister Black got out of that abusive relationship, because it wasn't go for her nor her dauther...no women worthy of treatment like that. Over all THIS BOOK WILL KEEP YOUR ATTENTION.... I CAN'T WAIT FOR HER NEXT MASTER PIECE-4 STARS"},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"High five and some for Kimberla. You are a gifted author. &quot;Casting the First Stone&quot; is a well written true to life story. I love this novel just as I did &quot;Behind Closed Doors&quot; and &quot;Here and Now&quot;.Rev. Black was just too much. How long did he think he could continue to do the work of the devil? Over and over Tanya was giving her husband a chance. He took his family and church for granted.The discussion questions are really good. I know that everyone can relate to the novel. Kimberla, I wish you all the best. Be Blessed!"},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"Casting the First Stone is one of the most realistic works of fiction I have ever read. The characters are very real, and I applaud Ms. Roby for having the courage to finally write what we are all whispering about at our own churches. The Rev. Curtis Black never ceased to amaze me, and I simply could not put this book down. I definitely recommend it to anyone who enjoys a thought-provoking and entertaining read. Thank you Ms. Roby for bringing the truth into perspective where corruption in the church is concerned. It was so needed."},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"This book captured me from the first page. I was fascinated at the inside look of a greed ridden preacher and his loyal family. I found myself drawn into his wife's dilemma of how to deal with a supposed &quot;man of God&quot; and his greedy, cheating, ways. Ms. Roby brought this story full circle, showing consequences AND rewards, thank you for such an entertaining read. Also, we look forward to you being our very special guest author in June for Ebony Expressions Book Club"},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"I wanted to like these characters, I wanted to feel sorry for their stupidity, but all I kept thinking was 'give me a break!' Yeah, we know situations like this one exist - men supposedly of God falling so short. But was this brother dumb or what? And his wife? Oh, but boyfriend would have been out on his behind. The pretense was the daughter, sheltering her from all the hurt of a broken home. The home was already broken. I couldn't buy into this one. Then again, Ms. Roby's choppy telling has continuously left me wanting. Peace and love, Breezee"},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"Thank you Kimberly for another novel very well done. This novel was just as great...no better than Behind Closed Doors. I couldn't put this book down. Curtis was beginning to drive me crazy with all of his cheating and lies and Tanya was a very patient woman. Kimberly, I really enjoyed this book and like Behind Closed Doors, I am passing this book along to my sisters, my mom and my girlfriends. Keep up the good work and I can't wait to read your next book, I hope that there will be one soon."},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"this is a novel that i never thought i'll be able to pick up and just read straight through. ive been waiting for someone to write about how money doesnt make you a happy man. so to speak. its ok to have enough to be comfortable but not greedy. the main character were so strong that at one time i just wanted to jump up and say 'you go girl'. this is a book for everybody, man or lady, to see that money isnt power. you have to learn to love and enjoy what you have before its too late. the only thing you'll get out of for being as money hungry as curtis is being by yourself and miserable and believe me when i say curtis got what was coming to him!"},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"I absolutely loved the book HERE and NOW and couldn't wait to purchase and read CAST THE FIRST STONE. I found the book quite disappointing, however. It lacked the depth of HERE and NOW and though the theme could have made for an interesting read, the book droned. I read it until the end (although I'm not sure why), but would not recommend it. If you want to read it, I would suggest you borrow it from a friend."},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"I was very disappointed in this book. I found the character development poor and I was tired of Tanya in each chapter discussing her desire to leave Curtis but why she couldn't. She also spent a great deal of time discussing abused women and too much detail on clothing, cars, coach bags, etc.. which was unnecessary for me. Overall, I was not impressed. I also did not find the writing challenging. This is no J. California Cooper or Toni Morrison."},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"Will the real Curtis Black please stand up! I had never heard of all this type of church drama in real life but apparently other viewers had. I was so disappointed with Curtis. If there is ever a reason a person had any doubts about finding a church home and a great pastor, please don't read this book. If you can take this book as just a fictional, and entertaining reward then read it. It's an awesome storyline about a preacher falling short of his glory. Curtis has a beautiful and faithful wife but chose to live on the edge with woman and money. The congregation found out in an odd way but in the end Curtis loses his wife but gained a powerful lesson after transforming his life from worldly actions. AWESOME!!!!"},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"This book was actually pretty good. As I begin to read it I didn't think it would be that good but it was. Tanya was a good woman and she deserved better. I'm glad she found the evidence that she need to get rid of Curtis. He was a terible man, he really was. He was very sneaky and decitful and had way to many women. He was a preacher and acted like a xrated star. The book was full of juicy details, I really enjoyed it."},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"I read all three parts of this story. I just finished the lastest installment of Reverend Curtis. However, this one, the one that started it all, is my favorite. I start to question my pastor after reading this book."},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"Like most of the books on my shelf, I started this book years ago and just went back to finish (not because they aren't good, but because I keep buying new books!). I thoroughly enjoyed Kimberla's storytelling style. The characters were vidid enough and the story kept me turning the pages. Great read!"},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"I enjoyed this book. It was a little slow at times, but the more I read the more I enjoyed it. By the time I got towards the end of the book I didn't want to stop. The basis of the book is about Tanya trying to believe and wait on Pastor Black her husband to become the husband he should be. Pastor Black says one thing in the pulpit and does the opposite as soon as he says amen. The book is a trip. How long will Tanya wait on Pastor Black? Will his ways finally catch up to him? You'll have to read it. The book is really good!"},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"This is a wonderful book, I couldn't put it down. It keeps your attention from cover to cover! You will definitely want to read \\"Too Much of a Good Thing\\" when you are done! A MUST READ!"},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"A real page turner. A book that will raise a lot of questions in your mind. Tanya Black has taken a back seat to her husbands career goals long enough, especially when she feels that the good Rev.Black (her husband) is up to no good. She soon learns a lot about her husbands scadalous ways. Will she hang in their or will she summon the courage she needs to walk away? A must read and then pick up the sequel \\"To much of a good thing\\"."},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"A good book. It's a book that will have thinking about your values in life and (your pastor.) I see the sequel is out and I can't wait to read it. I hope you purchase this book and enjoy it as much as I did."},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"Once you start reading this book, you won't be able to put it down. Mrs. Roby did a great job with this book. A must read."},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"I couldn't get into it because the plot was dragged and dragged intil you just say no more. I finished reading the book, on the advantage I finish a book in a day or two. But with this one I slowly got done with it. But I give a A+ for writing the book, because it's very hard to be an author."},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"I thought that I could no longer be surprised at the depths a man would sink in order to satisfy his own adultrous needs, but this book puts that notion to rest. This book proves that everything that looks good only appears that way because mostlikely you're standing outside looking in. We tend to hold preachers to a higher moral standard than others, but &quot;Casting The First Stone&quot; proves that when all is said and done, we're just &quot;flesh&quot; and &quot;bone&quot;. &quot;Casting The First Stone&quot; is the first novel I've read by Kimberla Lawson Roby, but I must say that it will not be the last."},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"This was a book club selection of our book club. I read it in two days because it was such a page turner. The story is one that I could relate to because it was definitely real life. Although some of the characters were not as well developed as I would have liked, the book was definitely a good read. It was also very well written in terms of choice of words, etc. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"this was a good book. it really shows that you have to really know who you are with because even if they are repesenting God it could be trouble"},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"This book was incredible, It brought out all of my emotions, it made me mad, sad and glad. It was definitely a page turner and it kept me wondering what in the world would Curtis do next. I wanted to yell at Tanya for not leaving this is how into this book I was. Having been involved in the church brought all the characters to life for me. Kim is very talented and I'm looking forward to reading her new book."},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"This book was surely a page turner for me from the time I read the prolouge it was on.The characters and situations depicted were so real and people can relate is what captured my attention through-out the whole book. CASTING THE FIRST STONE is surely a book I would recommend. MS ROBY did make this one an enjoyable read and can't wait to read THIN LINE."},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"At first a friend told me about the book. I complete the book with 48 hours. For a moment, I thought I was at a locate church in the Dallas, Texas area. I really enjoyed the book!! The book just goes to show, make sure that you know God for yourself and don't get so wrapped up in the preacher because you don't know what goes on behind close doors. If you haven't read the book go buy it and read it."},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"After reading &quot;Here and Now&quot;, I wasnt too sure how I would like Casting the First Stone, because &quot;Here&quot; had alittle too much drama for me. But this book was really good. The characters were realistic, (except maybe James!) and the story moved along at a comfortable speed. I guess I'll check out &quot;Thin Line&quot; and see how it is. Overall, good job Ms. Roby!"},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"Casting the First Stone strikes a chord in every woman's heart. If a woman hasn't experienced the issues covered in this book first hand, they know someone who has, or secretly wonders when it will happen to them.The strange thing is: the title is true to form, I found myself judging the characters according to my own personal standards, and hurled a stone at almost each one--even the main character as she struggled to find her way.Allowing people to learn from their mistakes is an important lesson for the reader as well. The book tests the reader's ability to allow the story to play out and the characters to sink or swim without getting angry, impatient, or letting your own emotions get the best of you while every aspect of your belief system and morals are tried.When all is said and done, one thing holds true to form: Let (she or) he who is without sin...cast the first stone.Congratulations, Ms. Roby on another wonderful novel."},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"This book sheds a new light on religion and how some heads of the pulpit take their ministry. Reverend Curtis Black is cut from a very tarnished cloth, and he is dragging his wife and child thru the wringer with his constant infidelities and need to feed the greed of the money flowing in the church. Tanya must find the strength to keep her marriage and her faith intact while trying to combat the forces that threaten to tear them all apart. The forces being her backsliding husband and his hustle of the congregation and his own wife's well-being. The novel will have you thinking twice about the individuals in your own church and wondering where the 10% is actually going. Excellent, Ms. Roby!"},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"You truly outdid yourself. Once again an issue that plagues the Black family, and seeps deep in to the community. What really goes on in a Black Church? Pastor does this and does that, always in the face of other women and probing on children, and always steppin and fetchin for more. I am so glad you wrote this book. IT happens. The things Black women go through to keep their household together is remarkabe. First Lady needed an award for what her stinkin' husband/pastor/mate/trifling brother did. Once again issues of domestic violence, abuse, neglect are things we battle all day, everyday. Sexual scandal by preachers (heterosexual and homosexual) with adults and children. IT happpens and you rocked it, you really did Ms. Roby."},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"I've never read anything by Ms. Roby and I picked this up because I needed to lose myself....and I did just that. The author took me back to a time and place where so many things were happening in my own life, that while reading I was yelling at Tanya, &quot;Watch out Girl....He's a lying scum ball.....! Been there done that! I could feel Tanya's heart beat, ebb and flow and then stop, when the man she had loved better than she loved herself betrayed her. I could she her James/my James being patient waiting, I could feel her guilt and her shame because all the signals were in front of her but she couldn't not see them.... If you want a touch of reality, a little bit of everything, this is a must read!"},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"This book was so good from the first chapter. I was totally captivated with the story and plotlines. It is a shame that there are probably ministers all over the country who defame religion the way this this character did. This book is a must read. I think that any one could really enjoy this book. It was written so well that it was a breeze to read. It was not predictable either that is also what I enjoyed about the book. Can wait to read another one Kimberla.!"},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"I enjoyed reading Casting The First Stone. I read numerous of reviews and saw the many different opinions of the characters, Tonya and Curtis. Most people thought that Curtis was very deceitful, including myself. But no one said anything about Tonya, she was just as bad as Curtis, even though she had every right to be. Tonya was not only a Preacher's Wife but she was a Christian Woman first. She was supposed to have set an example just as well as Curtis. Overall this is an excellent book."},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"I was referred to your books by a friend and I thank her tremendously. Casting the First Stone is a great book. I'm a 37 year old student that has been reading nothing but class books, but since I'm out for the summer I thought I would get back into my pleasure reading and what a pleasure it was to select this book as my first. I read some of the reviews and felt compelled to buy it. I bought it Tuesday evening and completed it Thursday morning. It is definitely a page turner and I couldn't put it down. Every page is interesting and thought provoking; the characters are real to life and easy to relate to. My hat is off to you Ms. Roby and I look forward to reading Here and Now and future writings by you."},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"Once again, Kimberla Lawson Roby has out done herself! I thoroughly enjoyed this novel and would recommend it to anyone who wants a fiction novel that they CANNOT put down. Ms. Roby makes you want to read while youre sleeping to see the outcome of the story's plot. Although I could not put this book down, I did not want to see it end :( Ms. Roby, keep up the excellent work and please, continue to write fiction novels worth reading. Hope to see you at the African Spectrum Bookstore in Georgia again soon."},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"I really enjoyed this book. I read it in one sitting because it was such a page turner. Tanya is such a memorable character with whom you will have great empathy and compassion. Her journey of self-discovery will leave you with a smile once you finish the book. I look forward to reading other books by Mrs. Roby."},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"If anything this book should teach you to be patient because things will eventally fall to show the truth. This book reminds me of the old times that I hear older women talking about, how they stuck with there husbands no matter what, and how they let go and let God. Which is what Tanya HAD to do? Not just because of her husband, but because who her husband was. This book will definitely bring out all of your emotions. You will laugh, be angry, and sad. This is really a must read!"},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"Kimberla Lawson Roby did an excellent job with this book. Although at times it seemed Tanya was a bit complacent, her actions were very realistic. Tanya endured alot of pain and suffering, mental as well as physical that most black women do put up with. I thought Curtis' character was very realistic. Although I am aware personally of a few preachers who teach and follow Curtis' way of life, I think Ms. Roby did a fabulous job making us all understand that God is a just God and handles all matters accordingly. I am looking forward to Ms. Roby's next novel."},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"This book takes a look at both personal relationships and church relationships. The first family of the church - Curtis and Tanya Black - start out on the right foot from college. Unfortunately, as years go bye Curtis loses sight of the real goal and begins focusing on the boastful pride of life. While Tanya disapproves of her husband's focus, she does not want to shatter the &quot;perfect family picture&quot;. Well, the picture gets shattered and oh how it gets shattered.This book is well written, tells an excellent story and captivates right from the start. The book demonstrates the strength and weaknesses of those professing versus those possessing."},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"This was a terrific read. The author tells a superb story. The heroine did get on my nerves a few times because she was so incredibly complacent.However, I do want to point out that the author holds her own in presenting her material. One of the reviews on the book cover compares her work to that of Terry McMillan. I just want to go on record and say that there is no comparison needed. This author sets her own standards (very high I might add) and delivers. I look forward to more from her."},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"This book was really good. I totally enjoyed the way Kimberla kept the drama unfolding. My only complaint was the ending. The pot keeps thickening but Kimberla never really brought it to a full boil. I was expecting a big bang at the end but all I got was a little pop. But overall this is a really good book with a hidden lesson for avid church goers. I truly enjoyed it. Happy Reading!"},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"I think this was a great book. I had the opportunity to meet Ms. Roby who encouraged me to read the book. I read the book in 1 night. I could not put the book down. I chose this book for our book club. It is going to be a good discussion piece because so much of the situations the author addressed are TRUE!"},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"This book is a must read for all women. The realistic characters and plot are great. I want to read more novels like this one. Kimberla...Please keep writing and I will keep reading. P.S. When will the movie be out?"},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"This was a excellent novel about the deceptions of the married christian couples who hold positions in churches and other organizations. It was very easy to feel as if you were apart of this story. This novel proves true the saying: &quot;What so ever a man soweth, that shall he also reap.&quot; I would give this 10 stars if I could!"},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"I enjoyed this book. It did take a few chapters for me to really get into the book, but eventually I could not put the book down. This book is a definite must read. It's about time someone told this story. Much success and blessings to Kim Roby. I'm waiting for the next one. Peace!"},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"This is my first book by Kimberla Lawson Roby. Once I started to read it, I never put it down. I couln't wait to see how Tanya was going go deal with her husband. The book was well written and I recommend it highly."},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"This was one of the worst books i have ever attempted to read. I could not finish it. The characters were boring. I was tired of Tanya putting up with Curtis day in and day out, and complaining about it all the time. I just kept finding myself, drifting off and having to force myself back into finishing a chapter. I finally decided to stop punishing myself and return the book. I also decided to return \\"To much of a good thing\\" because it couldnt be much better. I would suggest, \\"let the church say amen\\" by reshonda tate billingsley. Or any michele andrea bowen books. Much better reads. If you still want to try this book i would also suggest you borrow it from the library."},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"I really enjoyed this book very much from the beginning to the end. I experience in my life time about priest who have it all but feel like it's not enough. That's why I could relate to this book. This book had a lot of love, distrust, and faith. Without faith in yourself and God you will not get far. I have had preachers approach me to talk to me while they are married. That hurted me a lot and still do this day I don't understand why when you have something good in your life your abuse it and you loose it. Thank you very much for writing this book and hopefully there are people out there who will wake up and use there head right."},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"300PgsThe Rev. Curtis Black is introduced. You have no other choice but to fall in Love with him. He is successful, handsome, tall, smart and a God fearing Pastor or so we imagine from the story. His family is also very adorable.This story is a high-speed heartwarming drama that you will want to finish before you put down!I strongly recommend this book. It was truly a great read."},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"A used book for dirt cheap and it didnt look as if it was ever touched. Awesome service."},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"After reading this book, I went back and read the reviews. I totally disagree with the bad reviews of this book. I found that this book may not have captivated Curtis' reason for all of his lies and betrayal, but why does a man cheat we will never know. I thought that Kimberly brought to the forefront the issues surrounding the church and its pastors. We should not worship the man behind the pulpit but the spirit and son of God. I enjoyed this book from cover to cover as well as all of her books. It makes you think whether you are a man or women. Why do we make decisions to stay in bad relationships? Why do we let another person control us? Maybe the bad reviews were the result of some of the characters hitting to close to home. Thanks Kim for the happy ending!"},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"Ms. Roby has truly outdone herself. I mean Lord have mercy I just could not put this book down. I have recommended it to everyone and I plan to start a book club and this will be the first book we read. Oprah needs this on her &quot;TO READ&quot; list. Thank you for addressing the concerns of the church that many people are aware of but are afraid to speak on. You hit the nail right on the head and then some. Curtis was slimy &amp; grimy and what goes around comes around. Tanya was a victim and God always takes care of His own so she ended up right where she was supposed to be. Poor little Alicia had to suffer for her father's selfishness. When will we ever learn how to be good to each other and love each other? Its sad really. A wonderfully written book by a wonderfully talented author. I applaud you for having the courage to write about this VERY sensitive but very REAL issue. It does NOT apply to all pastors but it does apply to many of them. Trust me I know from whence I speak. Will there be a sequel? I would LOVE to know what happened to Curtis, Tanya, Alicia and the rest of the characters. HINT HINT. Whatever you do I will be on the lookout for it and I will get it as soon as its available. I am and forever will be an avid fan. By the way I saw you on Cable TV (The Unblinking Eye) talking about this book. Very good. May God continue to bless you and your family and keep you forever in His loving care."},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"After reading this book and the earlier works of this author, I can understand why she was originally self-published after being told that she had some talent by publishers she approached. She weaves a good tale, but unfortunately lacks the skills to carry it off. Her editor was not much help; the writing is still amateurish.I've personally never been a fan of the all-knowing narrator who tells what the characters are thinking, i.e., &quot;she asked, remembering what day it was&quot; or &quot;he commented, obviously shocked to hear that her husband was a minister.&quot; As a writer she is supposed to paint a visual picture of the shock, not merely narrate; anyone can do that. I also got tired of sentence fragments beginning with the word &quot;which.&quot; She's also quite fond of the word &quot;and.&quot;Another big issue was that of character development. The man Tanya flirted with had no personality whatsoever; I suspect his only purpose was the part he played in the end of the story. I thought the book started out with a bang, with Tanya and Curtis being so happy after his proposal and then fast forwarding eight years to her glaring at him in church. I expected to learn what happened in those eight years to change their feelings via flashbacks, but nothing was explained. It's not as interesting when you have no idea why characters behave the way they do. I thought Curtis was merely a raving lunatic.In my opinion, this writer needs to learn her craft. I expected to see improvement when she was picked up by a major house, but I guess the editors feel that it will sell, no matter how badly executed it is, and they're probably right. I'll continue to check out her books from the library and hope they get better."},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"I was truly sorry to read that the topic matter was of a Baptist Minister with a promising congregation, but the story was good because it could be true. I was proud of the main character, Tanya, for sticking to her guns and looking out for herself and her daughter, because they are who matters. Curtis, who is no-good anyway, got what he deserved. The ending was surprising and had a good finale. I was intrigued througout the entire story and was hoping and praying for James the whole way through. This is a worthwhile book and a good weekender if you want something to keep your attention and is easy to read."},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"Although I commend the author for tackling an important issue of hypocracy within the Baptist church, I felt the author spent much to much time on mundane details and repetitive concepts which ultimately detracted from the novel. More significantly however, I think the author should have spent time discussing the factors and issues which led Curtis to be the person we see throughout the novel. The authors failure to discuss or give any insight whatsoever into what happened during the 8( eight) intervening years left a significant 'hole' in the storyline. At the conclusion of the novel, I didn't feel that I had anymore insight into the characters or storyline than I did when I started the novel.The discussion of situations faced by the characters seemed to be incredibly disjointed. I did not feel the author took the time to develop the characters and/or situations in a meaningful and significant manner. All in all, very disappointed"},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"I never considered the happenings in the church would make such a great storyline! &quot;Casting the First Stone&quot; is listed as fiction but could easily be nonfiction by making a few name changes! This book hit close to home! I was &quot;reeled&quot; in by the first paragraph of Chaper 1 as the &quot;preacher's wife&quot; described her feelings while watching her husband in the pulpit. In my own experience, I would often look over at the &quot;preacher's wife&quot; and wonder what's going on in her mind or did &quot;he&quot; have her fooled too! Maybe her thoughts were similiar to Tanya's!&quot;Casting&quot; will have thoughts racing through your mind the next time you enter the doors of the church! It may even have you reflect on how much power we are giving our church leaders and remind us of Who we are really supposed to be worshipping!What a fantastic story! I enjoyed the book from cover to cover! I was surprised and pleased that someone took the courage to write about this very controversial topic, one that is making headlines in our world today! The characters were incredible and unpredictable! This book is an excellent choice for book clubs! I appreciated the Reading Group Discussion Guide at the end of the book. Ms. Roby definitely deserves the praise for this one!"},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"I was very disappointed with this book. I consider myself to be a great fan of Lawson-Roby's previous novels, but this book left a lot to be desired. The same points and ideas were belabored again and again and it took away from the interest of the book. While I LOVED 'Behind Closed Doors' and 'Here and Now' I wonder why the wit and skill reflected in those books was not seen in this one. And if I had to read one more insignificant detail...To the Editor or whoever advised her to add more scenery or bulk to scenes: READERS DO NOT LIKE INSIGNIFICANT DETAILS THAT DO NOT CONTRIBUTE TO THE PACE OF THE STORYLINE. Kimberla, get a new editor.."},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"This could have been a better book if the author spent more time on character development. For example, Tanya's boyfriend was not a well developed character. He was just thrown in for a happy ending. Curtis was far more interesting. I wanted to know what made him tick."},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"Kimberla Roby has set her place in contemporary fiction as a 'master storyteller' with 'Casting the First Stone'.This novel jumps out at the reader and grabs you from page one. The African-American church as a time honored institution, very rarely comes under scrutiny. Roby reminds us that there is a distinction between the establishment and the man who runs the establishment. This novel is not just another sistah-girl piece of fiction. The characters are strong and revealing. The underlying message, though subtle, will rock the reader to his foundation. This novel is an enjoyable story with substance. I highly recommend it as a selection for any bookclub."},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"To me Casting The First Stone is a story that covers many aspects of marriage, choices, actions, and consequences. The pastor of a prominent church has a wife and adoring daughter but it doesn't appear to be enough as he makes one reckless decision after enough that affects his life and his ministry. At times I found myself laughing at some of the drama that unfolded, but I must say by the time I read the last paragraph, I honestly felt sadness in my heart for the pastor. What happened to the Black family isn't anything I'd wish on anybody. They went thru much hell. I don't want to give the ending away but I think it's worth it for people to read, enjoy and maybe learn something from this story."},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"This was the most exciting book I have read in a while. I could relate events in this book to stories I have heard from friends about the goings on in their churches. I tried desperately to put the book down last night, but after &quot;Curtis got busted by the Deacon&quot;, I just had to find out what was going to happen next. I wonder if Ms. Roby will do a spin-off of &quot;Casting the First Stone&quot; to follow-up on Tanya and James? I'd really like to know how that worked or did not work. Keep up the good work, and I can't wait for the next novel....."},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"Kim Roby's books always touch my heart and make me think. This one touched my heart and soul. I could not put it down. We have all been in situations where we have been disillusioned by leaders and have lost our way and our faith and may have been taken advantage of by the &quot;Preacher&quot; or church folk. We discussed this last Sunday in my Sunday School Class - whether some of the evangelists we see on television are in it for the money. We all have to give an account of our actions to God. We have to learn as the character did in the book to worship and keep our faith in God and not man. If not we are going to lose our way for sure.I could not put this book down from sentence one. I kept thinking what is Curtis going to do next and he couldn't possibly get any worse. It is real life. People get caught up in money, sex,and power and will get the mentality you do as I say, not as I do and when you wake up it is too late. Look at the Henry Lyons situation, they still wanted to keep him as President even after he was found guilty. It is a MUST READ FOR EVERYONE! I even had some of my students to read it and I can see this happening in some of the churches in and around my community, we have to be ever prayerful. Tanya was indeed a strong black woman who always wanted to do what was right for her daughter and her and she kept praying through those dark ours. I loved that her friend Nicole supported her with whatever decision she made and did not interfere and say, &quot;if I was you I would do this, etc.&quot;, James was a strong black man - a real man. Tanya's dad was great. Curtis, the devil, was a TRIP, I never knew what he was going to say or do next. There is always positive and negative in life and it was shown through this story. It was GREAT! I can't wait to see what the author comes up with in 2001!"},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"This one was hard to put down.

It is worth every penny you spend for it !"},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"Roby has an interesting plot line, although it leans toward the predictable and sometimes turns preachy. Still, it's a good story with a logical plot and a significant message. Mrs. Roby has the potential to be a terrific writer, but she needs to develop her craft to reach beyond the amateur technique, sentence construction, and punctuation errors that plague her novel and distract from her story. Her natural ability provides a good outline, but her lack of knowledge in the art of telling a good story well proves to be a crippling flaw. In an interview with Mrs. Roby, she proudly said she had never attended a writing course or worked with a writing group. Investing herself in such opportunities for critique would polish her natural ability and challenge her to strive for excellence and craftsmanship. With the odds she's beaten already, what is there to fear from an opportunity to sharpen her skills?"},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"Can I give it negative stars?The topic that this book attempts to takcle is relevant and real in today's society, but this author writes like an 8th grade English paper. HORRIBLE BOOK. Here is my summary:My name is Tanya and I know my husband is a cheater, but I can't seem to get it through my thick skull that I need to leave him. I just ate a ceaser salad and mozzerella sticks. I always speak in complete sentences and never use contractions or slang. James is so attractive. OOOH I drank wine I'm going to hell. Boink boink boink threesome on video. Public humiliation. Finally I leave my scumbag husband. Now I'm married to James.The end."},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"\\"Casting The First Stone\\" encouraged a very intellectual and informative book club discussion amongst the Regal Sisters. We discussed the various problems religion is facing today. We all agreed that the main problem is the fact that many ministers are going into the profession for the wrong reasons. They look at it as a career move with enormous financial benefits. In many cases they are nothing more than well read, motivational speakers. We also determined that the ministers are not acting alone, in many cases thrill seeking, disrespectful women who approach them for their own gain and allow themselves to be used as mistresses are to blame as well. While this book brought out the negatives that religion has to offer, as a group, we also remembered and discussed the positives that remain in churches today. This was a great read with an intriguing storyline which gave birth to the now famous Rev. Curtis Black.* The views expressed in this review are purely for informational purposes, provided by The Regal Sisterhood Book Club - Dallas.

Opened the book, loved the first page, when page 2, and 3, and eventually I'm at 203 when I can no longer ignore the fact that I'm thinking Valley of the Dolls.Won't spool out a yarn of a review on this one, being 8-years after-the-fact, but will comment that this is a very polite Christian romance tale. The dainty voices... \\"Are you upset?\\" \\"No. Disappointed...\\" \\"...I'm so confused.\\" ...just ring in my ears! They hold each other firmly. Everyone but Curtis Black speaks truthfully... and must I leave out how they all also speak correctly, intelligently, thoughtfully, deservingly, occasionally drolly... did I leave anything out!?!But at least I now KNOW. Casting the First Stone definitely is well-written, painting a picture that is all too real, which had me turning pages as fast as I could turn them to find out when Tanya would do something other than suspect; Was she ever going to give in to what sounded like the next man coming to turn her head backwards and then forward; What was the crazy-a$$ed receptionist going to do to fix Curtis; And just how in the world was giving Curtis more money going to resolve his issue?There was so much going on in this novel, and appropriately so, that I honestly couldn't put it down. Loved how Roby was able to wheel me in, despite wanting to rip out some of the pages because it was taking so long to get my questions answered.There's no way this one deserves ANY LESS than 5 Ever-glowing Stars!"},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"I really loved this book. I couldn't put it down Pastor Black was something else. There was so much drama you couldn't just read one chapter you had to keep going until the very end."},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"Wow, this book was one of those that I just couldn't put down. The writer starts the story as a loving and caring story between a man and a woman. The writer richly dipicts how money, power and lust can ruin a marriage, career and everything that many of us hold so dear to our hearts. If you have never read a Kim Roby book, this is the book to read then you'll go back and read her others, I promise you."},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"I came across Ms. Roby's book on the New Fiction stand at a local bookstore. Reading only the synopsis of the story line is what sparked my interest in purchasing her book.I am the type of reader that generally reads the synopsis and the last few pages of the end of the book. (I like to find out the ending first, BEFORE I purchase it I know it's crazy, but I do!) But, after reading the synopsis I found I was generally excited by the story line which was enough for me to purchase it and actually be surprised by the ending.CASTING THE FIRST STONE, is so well written, that even though the book focuses on African American characters, it could have been any race or religion. (now that's good reading!)I actually felt as though I personally knew Tanya (having been cheated on) and could identify with Adrienne as well, (having been the other woman.) Being an entrepreneur myself, witnessing first hand the jealousy that your mate or significant other feels about your business, I could relate to Nicole as well.All in all, it was a wonderful book. Ms. Roby's books, will be this years gifts for all birthdays, anniversaries, and graduations this year!Thank You Ms. Roby for renewing the spark in me to enjoy reading again!"},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"The author did a good job at capturing the reader's attention even though the story did begin to span at various points. The going back and forth trying to decide whether or not to stay or leave her husband, got kind of tiring and very boring. However, the author did enlist a surprise twist at the end of the story. Ms. Lawson may well be on her way to adding a little mystery or intrigue into her storylines. I wonder how the author would rate as a mystery novelist."},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"I enjoyed Casting The First Stone very much. It was a quick read for me, couldn't put it down. I liked all the characters, even flawed Curtis. I was happy, however, when he got is just desserts. As a divorced single parent, I certainly can identify with a rotten husband. I noticed many of you reviewed this novel and either hated it or loved it. The reviews were either &quot;over the top&quot; wonderful or awful. Makes me wonder how we could have all been reading the same book? While we all have different tastes in books, it really bothers me when I read someone ripping someone's work apart. It's fine to say you didn't like it, that it wasn't one of your favorites, but some of you went way overboard in knocking it.I think that old rule that says &quot;If you can't say something nice about someone, don't say anything&quot; is a smart one to follow. She certainly didn't deserve some of your words and thoughts. I find it a bit ironic that the title reminds us not to judge......remember, He Who Casts The First Stone from the bible. Well, isn't that just what some of you are doing?If you don't like her forum for telling a story, don't read her books. For the rest of us.....we'll just keep on enjoying what she does. Thanks Kim,keep writing!"},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"After reading the first chapter I could not put the book down. I finished it in one night. However, the book climaxed and just fizzled out. The best way to describe it is like holding a stick of lit dynamite and it turns out to be a dud! Overall, I was disappointed."},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"Again you have done it! After I read the first chapter, I was unable to put the book down. Ms. Roby embarked upon an area that many have viewed as an &quot;upright, straight, nothing to hide&quot; existence, only to reveal that secrets and indiscretions can exist in the most seemingly perfect place--the church. Tanya Black despite what she felt deep down, stood when most would have bowed out. Casting the First Stone is definitely a must read. Kimberla has a style and flair that is truly commendable. I look forward to more of the same."},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"'Casting the First Stone' exposes the rise and fall of man called by God to lead Saints, but succombs to the temptations of this world. The novel simultaneously refreshes you with a strong female character who resists temptation. If you are looking for an honest story, with colorful characters, and situations that propel you through the pages, 'Casting the First Stone', is the novel you need to read. You won't be able to put the book down...and even at the last page, you'll long for more."},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"I was so amazed at how well this book was written.The characters were people you could relate to. Tanya was a &quot;Very Strong Lady.&quot; I admire her for putting her daughter first in all her decisions. I would also like to compliment Nicole for not butting in, but remaining a true friend. Hats off to James for being a real man."},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"This book totally blew me away! The story of the Black family was long overdue. I know a few Curtis Blacks myself, so I know where Kimberla was coming from in telling this story. I'm usually very wordy in my reviews, but I'm really left without words after reading this book. It was THAT good! I was totally stunned by the ending, and, though Curtis's story was extreme, I think anyone who claims to be a Christian can learn a lesson from his fall from grace. This is the second book I've read by Roby, and she has truly grown as a writer in comparison to her first book, Behind Closed Doors. She's really a great storyteller. I'm now reading Here and Now. I can't wait to see what new controversial issue Roby will tackle in her next novel. Hurry up with your next book, Kim!"},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"I really enjoy the writings of Kimberla Lawson Roby so I must say I was pleased again. This is the story of Rev and Ms Black. Power, money and women become the Rev. downfall. Ms Roby was able to take us upclose and personal with the corrupt preacher and Ms Black, who with her own faults, struggles to maintain a marriage that was not there. I especially like the Pastor's Appreciation Day."},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"I enjoyed this book from cover to cover, there was no stone left unturned"},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"I think that this book was excellent. I love the way Kimberla described so precise each move that the character made. This gave me a feeling of being there. I love the idea for the discussion questions in the back. All and all this book was excellent. I am looking forward to reading Here and Now and Behind Closed Doors and will read anything else that she writes. She is an excellent writer and an inspiration to me."},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"We got the Black Family, The Black Church, The Black First Lady, and The Prominent Black Minister and Now Can I Get An Amen! Casting The First Stone is a story about comtemporary issues that affect the family and the church today and portrays a realistic as well as behind the scene view of the church. Tanya Black, the wife and First Lady of the story, is torn between keeping her family together or moving on and severing the ties to her husband, the minister Curtis Black. It seems the good Rev. Black has had a few too many dalliances and he seems to be changing from a loving husband to someone Tanya used to know. In fact, Rev. Black has become so enthralled with himself, lust, power, greed and wealth that he appears to have forgotten why he became a minister in the first place. Casting The First Stone was wonderfully written and the storyline/plot depicted the ups and downs many couples face when one partner decides to seek there own agenda and does not consider the needs/feelings of the rest of the family. Ms. Roby did a wonderful job of bringing her characters to life in the minds of readers. She included characters that were relatable and ones you could easily identify with. Situations were included which tested all of your emotions and made you cry, laugh, seek revenge, and get upset but also made you keep turning the pages to find out the ultimate outcome. My only disappointment with Casting The First Stone, was that Ms. Roby did not explain Rev. Curtis Black more. I wanted to know more about what made him tick and why he did some of the things he did. However, I also realize that in real life there a number of Curtis Blacks who act the same way. No Ryhthm or Reason but Just Because. Casting The First Stone is a books which shows that all of us have flaws and faults and none of us are exempt. And sometimes even the best of us fall to temptation(The First Lady--Tanya included); however there are always consequences or rewards associated with what ever decisions we decide to make. With Faith and Committment, We Can Turn Around Any Situations And Start Anew."},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"I enjoyed this book tremendously. Anything that Kimberla wrote I have read and enjoyed, but this book topped them. It just makes you think, does actions like this carry on in your church? But it goes to show you that people put to much faith in the pastor instead of the one they should put their faith in. Pastors are human and make mistakes and can fall short of glory. Tanya was a better person than me, because as soon as I suspected I would have left, because the first lady takes on as much responsibility as the pastor. This book is a must read, and a good book club selection. Keep up the good work, Kimberla, and keep them coming?"},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"This book was fantastic! There is so much crookedness happening in the church that this story could very well have been classified as nonfiction. My only regret is that Tanya stayed as long as she did and allowed Curtis to go so far in abusing her out of guilt for his own sins. That Adrienne was so pathetic, she deserved her humiliation."},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"Kimberla does an excellent job of presenting a realistic view of the dark side of the ministry. I actuallyfelt sorry for the pastor; I wanted to offer to get him some psychological help."},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"Kim has got it going on. This is another winner. Her characters are so real.She really shows that if led astray anyone can fall. I wonder how many church leaders find themselves in Tanya's and Curtis' shoes? I wonder how Adrienne would've explained to her unable to have children husband that she was having his baby? Curtis had time to sort it out, but money being the root of all evil kept him going. Curtis really had a lot of nerve to preach and who more than him was being more hypocritical than he. Tanya really stood by her man.Kim, I can't wait to see your name on another book cover."},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"Casting the First Stone is an excellent book. It captures alot of important facts about the &quot;church&quot; such as business meetings and the importance of deacons and elders, but then there is the excitement that you would hate to think that happens in churches today. Just think, if it was in the book, it can happen at your church too. Anyone who reads this book will enjoy it."},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"This is a big improvement from Ms. Roby's first book. I still found the beginning a bit laborious, but the story-line and tempo picks up after chapter 13. This book definitely needs a part II. And a little more character development to make you feel and understand all the characters, not just the strong characters in the story."},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"Choose ye this day who you serve! After reading this book I began to Pray, because it's easy for us to look at other sins, but we must look at ourselves and find out where do we stand with the Lord. I'm just glad I serve a forgiving God! Thanks Kimberla for another great book."},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"I highly recommend this book. The characters will make you laugh and cry and the situations are real.BUY THIS BOOK NOW!"},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"Kimberly Roby churns out another formula story about a woman's self-discovery. Tanya Black abhors her husband Curtis. Everything he now stands for disgusts her. Regardless of Curtis' very powerful position as the head pastor of a prominent black Chicago church, Tanya can't stand the sight of him and starts to think about not only ending their relationship, but also Curtis' tenure as senior pastor, since Curtis had to maintain his marriage in order to keep his position at the church.This novel begins promising, but lets down by the end of the first chapter. Her character's actions are unbelievable from page one. The notion that any church would confine marriage to a job requirement is prosperous. Casting the First Stone not only throws stones at organized black religion, but at Christ's purpose for marriage.Moreover, Roby's writing style is bland and contrived and never address the real questions she presents. Why in the world does Tanya Black continue to live in this dead marriage never comes to full view. If there is a Christian message it is clouded by clich&eacute; plot points and clich&eacute; characters. It's just once escapade after another the story cheapens into a tawdry soap opera with a church setting.For those whose guilty pleasure is reading super dramas; then this book is for you. But if you're looking for a book that will help you understand how your romantic relationship relates to your spiritual relationship with God, pass.Dee StewartR.E.A.L.

I thought the soap opera plot was built upon stereotypes of the one dimensional characters who I found completely lacking in depth.

I am very involved in my church and we had a similar situation a few years ago, so I know it is &quot;real.&quot; It is very sad when these things happen with supposedly &quot;spiritual&quot; individuals, but some people aren't able to handle &quot;fame&quot; and the responsibilities that go with it. It is unfortunate that some pastors of large churches have to be strong and able to avoid temptations that are so easy available. NOt only did Curtis do wrong, but he didn't seem to be able to distinguish the difference. He had too much &quot;going on&quot; in his life and he got exactly what he deserved in the end. I read with baited breath, hoping that his wife wasn't going to give in, in the end. I'm glad she went on with her life. Kimberla did an excellent job. I e-mailed her to let her know and she responded the very next day. A wonderful person!"},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"After writing &quot;Here and Now&quot;, Roby continued to write about real African American characters in &quot;Casting the First Stone&quot;. In this one, the book dives into a touchy subject - black churches and corruption. It also is about how a marriage can fall apart. You can't put the book down. This would be a great movie. It's definitely a great book. I'm a faithful Roby fan now forever."},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"Oh my goodness!!! This book is da bomb!!!

I looooooooooved it and so did everyone i knew that read it. I recommend it to everyone."},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"All I can say is that the book was on point. Ms. Roby's writing style is very free flowing and easy to read. This is the second book that I've read by Ms. Roby, and all I have to say is her books keep getting better and better. Ms Roby shed light on the problems that the Babtist Church has been expriencing for sometime, concerning adulterous affairs. Many congregations prefer to keep that kind of information hush-hush. Tanya, the central character, had to constantly battle the issue of whether she was going to stay with her coniving husband, or keep the family together. I'm just glad the story ended with Curtis coming to terms with his problems and Tonya making the right decision to leave her husband. Again I praise Ms. Roby for writing an outstanding piece of work."},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"Casting the First Stone could not be truer to the expression of 'double-edged' sword. This book demonstrates that when contemplating revenge, one had better think twice because it can be a bitter-sweet pill and/or a double-edged sword. Tanya did what she felt she was pushed to do and while she achieved her goal of getting back at cheating, preaching husband, Curtis, that accomplishment came at a very high cost. What was meant to be a bullet (so to speak) aimed at Curtis, shattered and the effects were felt by an entire church congregation, an unsuspecting husband/deacon, and an innocent daughter. Curtis played a dangerous game -- he played with God and thought he would be the exception; but God plays no favors and Curtis, unfortunately, found that out the hard way!"},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"I enjoyed this book from cover to cover, there was no stone left unturned"},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"The characters you can identify with. If you've had any misgivings about pastors and their devotion to their church and church members, this story will prove all true. You have to keep reminding yourself that not all churches are ran this way. When a person has so much power, it's amazing how they handle it. Once you pick this book up you will not want to put it down. I found myself reading until 2 or 3am when I know I had to be up at 6am for work the next morning. The story grips you from the very beginning. I've already put it in the mail to my sister as she could not find it in the library. I've read all three of Ms. Lawson's books and I cannot wait for the next one to come out. A serious &quot;Must Read&quot;!"},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"This book was excellent! Unfortunately, our church recently went through a similar situation, so I was easily able to relate. The book was very &quot;real&quot; and the characters made you want to get right into the book and help them out. Five stars for sure!"},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"I think this book could have been between fiction and nonfiction. This kind of stuff actually happens. Everyone is not called by God to preach. They just use God as an excuse. I just love this book. I highly recommend it. It take all kind of people to make the world go round. The good-James and the bad-Curtis. When is the movie coming out?"},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"Kimberla Lawson Roby put her best foot forward in &quot;Casting the First Stone&quot;. Not only did she address an issue that is very real not only in African-American churches, but all churches. I found it very interesting that Tanya stood by her man and she knew he was cheating and doing everything else under the sun. The saying what you do in the dark always comes to the light, applies to this story.... The characters were real and life-like with emotions and feelings. I completed the book in 3 evenings, I was shooting for one day, but I have bills to pay. Good Job Kimberla Lawson Roby"},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"I received this book as a Christmas gift and couldn't put it down. I was finished with it by December 26. I am now reading it for a second time and am beginning to notice a lot of things I wished Ms. Roby would of done with the book. Don't get me wrong, I am not trying to trash her abilities as a writer, for the book was very good. But I wished she had been more in depth and started from the beginning of Curtis and Tanya's marriage. The prologue talks about his proposal and they seemed so happy together. Then the next chapter, Tanya seems to despise her husband and for the duration of the book they just can't seem to get along. You can't help but wonder Whoa, what happened? Then there seems to be a lot of drawn out analyzation of relationships and a deep narration of Tanya's thoughts on almost every other page which sometimes makes the book seem tedious. I wished Curtis and Tanya would have managed to get along during some point of the story. All it seemed like they did was argue and even I got fed up with that so I don't know how Tanya endured it for so long. (laugh) But trust me it was a very good book. I'm just pointing out a couple of factors that would have made it better. Mrs. Roby you be encouraged and continue to sell them novels. Hope to see another one of your books on the shelves of the book stores real soon!"},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"Superb, Mrs. Roby!!!!!!!! Your book was excellent!!!!!!!! I've recommended this book to everyone. This is the greatest book I've read in a very long time. What a great movie production or audio presentation this would make.I found myself getting nervous jitters because of your character, &quot;Curtis.&quot; No other novel has ever had that type of affect on me. Just at the time when you think he (Curtis) can't stoop any lower, with his lies, greed and infidelity, he definitely does.Not only did I feel sorry for Curtis' family and congregation, I felt sorry for him as well. Unfortunately, power, money and greed can get the best of any of us. Some may argue and say everything was exagerated, this being a fictional book; nonetheless, these things do happen.I find your writing very encouraging as I begin the journey as a writer currently working on my first novel.I await your next novel, although this novel (Casting the First Stone) may be difficult to surpass.Sincerely, Wanda C. Scott"},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"This book was good but it was very slow.

An excellent, well-written book, Casting the First Stone, centers around the rise and fall of a Southern-born minister who is overcome by power, money and women. Because money and power rule his life, God, his family, and others are placed on the back burner.Calvin's meager beginnings as a dedicated minister, his gradual rise to fame and fortune, and his ultimate fall will affect the reader as much as his loved ones, his congregation, and the 'other' women he used and abused are affected.This excellent, well-written book contains well-developed characters that the reader will both love and hate. They are believable people with personalities of their own. I found myself discussing portions of the book with others who had not read it, remarking about the characters as though they were real people.An excellent read, sums up my opinion of this well-written, attention-commanding book. Kudos to you, Ms. Roby."},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"This book takes a look at both personal relationships and church relationships. The first family of the church - Curtis and Tanya Black - start out on the right foot from college. Unfortunately, as years go bye Curtis loses sight of the real goal and begins focusing on the boastful pride of life. While Tanya disapproves of her husband's focus, she does not want to shatter the &quot;perfect family picture&quot;. Well, the picture gets shattered and oh how it gets shattered.This book is well written, tells an excellent story and captivates right from the start. The book demonstrates the strength and weaknesses of those professing versus those possessing."},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"This book is a real page turner. This novel tells a story of a family and the local church members who put too much faith in their pastor. This novel reveals the trueness of a family caught up in facade. I recommended this book to anyone who's attended church at least one day in their life!"},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"Kimberly Roby captures the audience with the reality of deceptions that Christians face in today's churches. She depicts how the love and obsession with power, fame,sex, and money can eventually destroy the soul, family, and church. This book takes an inside look at the struggles of a prominent African-American family within the setting of an influential and powerful African-American Church. Curtis Black, a charismatic and powerful minister, is involved in many ungodly escpades that ultimately cost the demise of his family, church, and personal gain. Tanya Black, his devoted wife and first lady, believes in the institution of marriage. Thus, she is empowered by her faith in God to keep her family together despite the many trials and struggles within her marriage to Curtis. This is truly a novel worth reading and sharing by all. Casting the First Stone is a revelation for church goers to behold."},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"I absolutely loved this book. Even though this book is fictional, it is very &quot;real&quot; in many aspects. Ms. Roby's writing depicts the ups and downs many couples face when one partner is torn between family and greed. It is absolutely amazing what a person is willing to sacrifice for the love of material things. In many instances, I felt the varied emotions that the characters in the book were experiencing. I laughed and cried. This book should be on Oprah's book club list."},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"The subject matter and theme of this novel is REAL and needs to be explored. The author was on the right track, however, she got caught up in a lot of unnecessary repetition. In just a few pages, readers were introduced to Curtis, who was obviously a liar with many issues. What could have been more interesting and enlightening is WHY...? Had she gone into more depth about what was going on in Curtis' life emotionally and spiritually, this book would have been a real page-turner. Additionally, it would have been nice to expound on Adrienne. Just how did she get so caught up and why? Charlotte was young and impressionable, and so the handwriting was on the wall as it relates to her. The church community has been haunted by the spirit of lust for years, esp. when it comes to women who look to their pastoral and ministerial leadership as more than human vessels. A lot could have been contributed and divulged on those pages, but unfortunately they were not. The storyline was glossed over and lacked depth, yet I commend Ms. Roby for attempting to tackle REAL LIFE issues that reside in the Churches all over the country and in the world."},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"Before purchasing this book, I read every single review &amp; I was discouraged! I decided to purchase it against all the odds of the other viewers! Just a little friendly advice to those who &quot;ONLY&quot; depend on reviews, &quot;DONT&quot; any longer! It was an absolute page turner &amp; I was happy with the ending! I have been enjoying giving other African American authors a try without the opinions of others &amp; enjoy them much more than ever! If you depend on others for reviews, you may be denying yourself a treat to one of the best books you will ever indulge in! You will enjoy Casting The First Stone, do enjoy :O) All I have to say to Ms. Roby is that &quot;YOU GO GIRL&quot; Keep on enlightening us!"},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"This book starts off &quot;slow&quot; but explodes into bone tingling excitement. The author carefully leads the reader to wonder if there will ever be an end to the &quot;madness&quot;.Eventually there is a long awaited unvailing of the obvious, along with the twist of a couple of unexpected events."},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"This is the story of Tanya who is married to a preacher who is a cheater, and fooling his church members. Tanya was at crossroads about what to do about her cheating husband. I felt a little bad when Tanya took it to the next level with James, because she was suppose to be a chrisitan also, and didn't have to stoop to Curtis's level. &quot;Casting the fist stone&quot; gives you a look of some of the bad things that goes on in church these day. I have a friend who don't trust any preachers because of the ones like Curtis."},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"This book was captivating and although i enjoyed the author's other books, i felt that this book was an improvement over the others. I lent it to my hairdresser who also could not put it down. I think that the pastor was a good example of how money and power can get to your head and how giving a Devil a foot in the door can be one's undoing. I am sorry that the wife yielded to temptation as well though. two worngs don't make a right and while she should have called him on his infidelity, going out and hooking up was not the answer.Good job Ms. Roby!"},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"This was a pretty good book. The story was very real, but it dragged....just a bit. It could have been a little more exciting. Even though I enjoyed it, I didn't have a hard time putting it down like when I read Sistah Souljah's &quot;The Coldest Winter Ever&quot;.I would reccomend this book, because it was interesting, but it just didn't have that wave of excitement that I was looking for."},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"Kimberla has done it again. This book is excellent. It deals with today's ministers in our society. Life is a lesson learned and sometime you must loose everything before you realize it. I believe we all can learn from this book about faith in God and where to place our trust. Can't wait to read her next book."},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"Kimberla is an excellent, driven &quot;authoress&quot;. She not only puts you right into the book and its characters, but she carries you throughout their story until the end, where you say, oh my goodness, that's it? I want MORE! She makes you feel as though she could write another book to accompany this one. With everything going on in the church world today, she's right on target with this one! I especially loved the way she made you feel as though you were a part of her book and could say, girl, I know how she's feelin'! I actually got a little upset because I had to go to work and wouldn't be able to read 'Casting The First Stone' for at least 7 hours of the day! It was that fabulous! Keep up the good work, my sista!"},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"Castin The First Stone is the best book I have read in a long time. I started reading it and could not put it down. I had to keep looking at the book to realize this is only fiction. Anyone having religious beliefs and are Church members know that our main purpose of attending church is focusing on Jesus Christ and not the Minister. Ministers are only human and that is why we shouldn't put our tust in man. I can't say what I would have done if I was Curtis's wife, because until you are in a position don't say what you would do.I have recommended this book to over 25 people."},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed Ms. Roby's book. It speaks to several issues going on in several (but not all) churches today, which is very sad and unfortunate. I think every african american church going-member who is STRONG IN THEIR WALK should read this book. However, for the sake of a realistic plot and story, I loved it. Our book club, The F.I.R.M., gave it rave overall reviews. Thanks for being bold enough to tackle this subject. I must now backtrack and read previous novels to see how Ms. Roby's writing has developed over time. I look forward to future works and subjects."},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"All I can say is thank you Kimberla for such an exciting story. The story was filled with so much drama that I could not stand to put it down. The villain, Reverend Curtis Black, was so horrible that I couldn't help but feel sorry for him. But on the other hand, it was hard for me to give his wife Tanya Black, the supposed victim, any sympathy. This made reading this book that much more enjoyable. This one will be hard to beat."},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"The book started off good, but then quickly got on my last nerve. Tanya for the first 130 pages did nothing but repeat herself over and over and over and over (you get my point) again. This was a serious case of 'piss or get off the pot'. All the characters were pretty one dimensional and I think the popularly of this book stems from it being about a corrupted Reverend. (And we all know the church is filled with drama) I lost a lot of respect for Tanya because she acted like she couldn't leave when she was sitting on fifty thousand dollars in savings. That's right-fifty thousand. Give me a break. She kept asking--'where would we go?' Did I mention she still had parents and a good job, too? Then she was supposed to be counselor for abused women but when it came right down to it she was just as much a hypocrite as her husband. Preaching to others on what they should do but when they themselves couldn't listen to their own sermons. The only person I had respect for was Nicole. She wouldn't jump in and tell her friend what to do and she handle her business with her man-quick and to the point. No, Tanya couldn't leave until she had another MAN lined up. She didn't make the decision to leave Curtis--everyone else made the decision for her. She didn't confront Curtis with her proof--Deacon Jackson handled that for her. For the first hundred so pages, I kept thinking, if she was so sure he was cheating why didn't she hire someone to follow him? Lord knows she had enough money.My point is I couldn't completely root for Tanya like I should have been doing. I lost even more respect for this pastor's wife to stoop to Curtis's level and sleep with another man while she was still married. Handle your business first. And WHY on earth did she keep confronting Curtis alone after time and time again, he showed how violent he could get? It made no sense. Yes, Curtis got what he had coming to him, but Tanya wasn't winning in brownie points.All this doesn't make Casting a bad book...Ms. Roby's writing style does--it does absolutely nothing for me."},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"Kimberely, I thought I was really reading someones' true story. I enjoyed this book tremendously. It was something else. What can I say, &quot;only that it was a good one.&quot; I want to say more, however, the book says it all. I have read and enjoyed all your books."},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"&quot;Casting The First Stone&quot; was very realistic and also entertaining. I can certainly relate to the church situations addressed in this book. I found myself picking out parts of the story that coincided with real life incidents that we have experienced or others in the community. Ms. Roby really brought out the truth in this one. In my opinion, its one of the best book I have ever read and I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"Kimberla Lawson Roby's novels are wonderful and each surpasses the first. I highly recommend her books and usually complete them in one sitting- they are so hard to put them down. She's very detailed and has the ability to hold your attention with each new page. This is definitely a sign of an author that will be around for a while. She makes an aspiring novelist want to emmulate her works. I can't wait till the next one comes out!"},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"I just couldn't put this book down when I first started to read it. I fact I finished it about 12 hours ago. I stayed up untiol 1:30am to finish it. The storyline was exceptional and the charaters were so real. I really felt for Tayna who was going through a lot in her marriage to Curtis. I also know what it is like to go through church crisises so the point really hit home. I can't say enough about this book except to say in the words of Siskel and Ebert-'Two thumbs up!' Way to go Mrs. Lawson-Roby."},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"We are introduced to the infamous Reverend Curtis Black, his family, their church family and all of the drama that comes along with it. I enjoyed this book, because it proves that Christians should keep their eyes on God,not on man, because man is human, too."},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"I did not rec book when I suppose to and then when I got it it was the wrong book"},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"The book was missing the jacket and had a little stains, however that was not the reason for the 2 stars. I did not like the story line and I can't imagine reading all 7 or 8 books.I gave the book to my daughter, I don't think she have read it yet. I will give her other books a try."},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"I enjoyed the book. The only negative thing that I have to say is that the Rev. CurtisBlack character was not realistic."},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"I chose this rating because I haven't read the book yet. I enjoy Ms. Roby's books. I have a few more that I haven't read yet."},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"I enjoyed this book. It was a little slow at times, but the more I read the more I enjoyed it. By the time I got towards the end of the book I didn't want to stop. The basis of the book is about Tanya trying to believe and wait on Pastor Black her husband to become the husband he should be. Pastor Black says one thing in the pulpit and does the opposite as soon as he says amen. The book is a trip. How long will Tanya wait on Pastor Black? Will his ways finally catch up to him? You'll have to read it. The book is really good!"},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"I liked Casting the First Stone by Kimberly Lawson Roby, and it was definately a page turner, but I did not favor the way the novel ended. It was very interesting, and brought to life the very negative aspects of the abuse of power when it comes to ministers in today's society, but the novel to me did not concentrate fully on the notion of forgiveness as it relates to a Christian lifestyle, neither the sanctity of marriage and the vows made before God. I think marriage is very important, and there seemed to be the constant theme of ending a marriage rather than going before God and soliciting not only the Lord's help, but professional help to save the one thing that the Lord holds sacred in this earth: the union of two people as one. Overall, the novel was well written, but nevertheless it casted a shadow over trying to make a marriage work, and exemplfied the alternative, in the long run taking the easy route of divorce."},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"I usually don't read books out of sequence. But I did and both the novels were good.I was very impressed with this book because of course Curtis Black was a mess as per usual. The book was comical at times. But there were also serious issues that were touched upon like Domestic Violence. Besides all the Adultery Pastor Black was doing. Anyway to make a long story short Kimberla is now on my list of aspiring authors. As soon as I hit the bookstore I will have to pick up some more of her work. Because after two books I am still very much hyped over Ms.Roby's work."},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"This book is real! These things are happening right now right under all of our noses.My mother is married to a minister and this man has been my step-father for over twenty years. I remember so many things that my mother had to go through when I was little girl. I also remember finding evidence of him cheating and he came up with some of the same lies and excuses as Curtis did. And of course my mother believed him.Still to this day there are many unanswered questions to my step-father's whereabouts most of the day and night. I mean just like Curtis he's gone all the time, and most of the time he has no explanation for his whereabouts.I will definitely give this book to my mother to read. Maybe she will finally wake up and smell the coffee after over twenty years (I doubt it).In addition to my step-father, I have also worked with many ministers in my line of work as a radio broadcaster, and I have meet many so called &quot;jack legged&quot; preachers. I have been flirted with by married men who were supposed to be men of God. One time one actually came up and kissed me right smack in the mouth.Reading this book brings back memories. And it should alert any woman who is married to someone envolved in a ministry who has shifty ways.Always remember God is first, but your wife should be your number one priority after that. This is another reason to have been suspicious of Curtis in the first place. Why was he always the minister who had to go and pray for all the sick and shut in? A church as large as the one he was over had to have many more ministers and of course a prayer team. The church that I attend at the present does.The bottom line is that all first ladies should watch their man. The flesh is definitely weak. Especially for a man who doesn't stay prayed up."},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"That Reverend Curtis is sum'n else! These preachers are greedy dogs (so says Isaiah). They can never get enuf satisfaction. They want Sister Sally and Sister Sally's momma and her grandmomma too. They just can't get enuf of that funky stuff. This book told the naked truth about these so-called Reverends. It was a well-written, entertaining novel and deserves 4.5 stars. I recommend it especially to those of you that knows that y'alls pastor ain't no-good! Maybe it'll wake you and shake you to leave that vulture of a preacher. But if you know that your pastor ain't no good and you choose to stay under his teachings, then all I can say is that birds of a feather, flock together."},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"This book is too good about a preacher who's skelton's come running out of the closet. I had men reading this book and wanting to meet this preacher in real life becasue they couldn't believe how he conducted himself. A must read for a great shocking ending."},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"It's been a while since I have read a fiction book but I really enjoyed this one. I agree with some of the earlier writers who said that the characters needed some more development. Why was Curtis acting that way? Had something happened to make him cheat? Why was James there at all? What about her parents? They came in then no more contact with them.The book was VERY slow in the beginning. 304 pages of listening to Tanya whine about a man she didn't have the guts to leave. Curtis acted that way because quite frankly he could. He knew she was just bluffing and wouldn't leave so he just kept doing what he wanted. Why not? Most of us would show out too if we know we could get away with something without any consequence. I was sick of Tanya towards the end. In fact while I read page after page of her fake divorce decrees and Curtis' manipulation and philandering I kept screaming,&quot;STUPID, STUPID!&quot; Even after she had proof he was cheating she STILL didn't leave so busy trying to plot the perfect revenge and keep it together for her daughter. The climax was hillariuos but then just dropped. I would have like to see Tanya leave James alone and instead be the Christian she claimed to be and allow God to have His vengence. Overall though the book was good. A real page turner. In fact I stayed up until 5am this morning to finish it. Definitely worth the read!"},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"What a wake up call? if you stripped a man of clothes, cars and occupation, he is simply a man with the ability to love, lie and cheat. Tanya finds out that her loving and caring preacher of husband, Curtis has the ability to do all three. It is an excellent book to read. Warning! Warning! There might be times when you want to thump Tanya in the middle of her forehead for allowing things to go on as long as it did. It is only so much a sister can take..."},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"This book was so good. I was truly captivated from the very first page to the very last page. This book was well written, with great characters. Highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"Curtis was a preacher but was knee deep in scandal. With a wife that he abused, video tapes that he tried to keep hidden, affairs and of course the baby with the young grl, I don't know when he had time to preach.This was one preacher that had you wonder what would be his next &quot;ungodly&quot; move.Very good read. Keeps you wanting more."},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"I read Here and Now first then Behind Closed Doors, I wasn't that enthused about Casting the First Stone. Many of the chapters seemed to be long and boring and reiterating the same dialogue. However I do comend Kim on choosing a very touchy topic, but her approach wasn't that clever."},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"the book could've been better. I wish the author would work on her writing skills before attempting another book. The repetitive use of words and ideas, as well as the number of totally distinct ideas joined by the word &quot;and&quot; was distracting from the storyline. The story was interesting but it failed to flow as the characters backtracked over the same ground."},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"Casting the First Stone, a novel which supposedly exposes corruption in the church family, failed miserably. It really exposes corruption in the literary community by passing itself off as quality literature and ripping off hundreds of readers looking for substance and quality. Kimberla Roby has not mastered the writing craft and this book shows it. The words don't sing, they huddle together like a clumps of gooey mess staining over two hundred pages. The characters are shallow, the writing is repetitive, and the writer insists on telling the reader information they already know. Page after page after page, the writer tortured her readers with needless nonsense, perpetrating the myth of keeping a family together and then she turns around and commits adultery. Do two wrongs make a right? The topic of the book is a worthy subject, but this author does it no justice."},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"Kimberlea L. Roby has a winner on her hands with Casting the First Stone, a tale that provides a realistic look into temptation & church corruption along with true life lessons that we currently face today.Curtis and Tanya Black are the pastor and first lady of a prominent Baptist church. While they seem to have it all, behind the scenes their marriage is the brink of destruction with Curtis' deception, and selfishness being the forefront of their problems. While Tanya struggles to keep their marriage together she goes on a personal journey of her own, one that not only challenges her faith but leads to personal revelations that are both compelling and powerful.If there is ever a story that is so sad but true regarding temptation and church corruption this is it. Even in the midst of our brothers & sisters that are truly doing great things for Christ (and are sincere :)) you do have your \\"wolves in sheeps clothing\\", those who are out for themselves and not God. I have seen quite a few Curtis Blacks myself and in most cases it does take a fall from grace to bring them back to earth. While some don't want to address this issue it is one that is a reality and Ms. Roby does a fine job of addressing it and its effects in this book. It is a pageturner that I recommend to all."},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"&quot;Casting the First Stone&quot; is a book that I would rank in my top ten for the year. Tanya is trying snd praying every day to keep her marriage to Curtis together. She tends to keep it all inside but when things start to affect her child she realizes that she has to get out. This is the story of a strong black woman who's faith in God gets her through some pretty rough times. I can't wait for Ms.roby,s next book"},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"This book was o.k. Nothing to write home about. It took 267 pages before the GOOD REVEREND got what was coming to him. Every chapter Tanya talked about how she should leave him, BUT she wanted to do what was best for her daughter. If a man is cheating on you and trying to play you for a fool AND you have ALLLL the evidence you need than WHAT is the hold up. She prolonged the story ...Better luck next time."},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"'Casting the First Stone' was supposed to be my companion during the week's commute; however, the 20 minutes on Monday morning lead to nothing getting done on Tuesday. I was captured by the superb writing and ease of presentation. With each chapter I anticipated the next because I could not wait for the good preacher to be exposed. This is a must read! What's next?"},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"I enjoyed reading the book because it was interesting. I enjoyed the suspense of what was going to happen in the relationship next. It was also helpful in a way because I have experienced a similar sitation myself. It came to be quite beneficial because now that I have experienced something like this,and read about it as well, it should never happen again. It was hard trying to believe that a man of God would do such dirty things. The bad part about the whole thing is that after he commits his sins, he'll get in the pulpit and tell his congregation that these things are sins, then ask for more money. This is exactly why righteous preachers are upset becuase perpetrator preachers steer members in the wrong direction, which will lead them into later condemnation.This part of the whole book I didn't agree with,especially all the heartaches and pain he took his wife through and made everything seem like it wasn all her fault. Another thing is that he got what was rightfully coming to him, even though it took alot of people who got hurt through it all."},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"Kimberla has once again written a novel that had me drawn in from the first chapter. While the reader may think he/she has the characters figured out, you may get surprised--I definitely did. This novel is a candid story of the dark side of &quot;ministers&quot;. Although a work of fiction, it is true to life given the nature of sin. The book shows exactly who shady people are and teaches you that no one is beyond sin."},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"Whew this book was absolutely OFF THE HOOK!!!!!!!!!! I read this book in exactly two day. Nope nothing got done. I started late Friday night and was finished Sunday by 6pm. It was sooooooooooooo goooooood. It rea;;y peaked my couriosity. I loved it. Where do I begin: Curtis that lowdown, snakedog, nymphomaniac, wanna be preaching, selfish, self centered heathen. I could find a few more choice words but for the sake of readers. The Bible says \\"many are called but only a few are choosen\\", and we can agree that Curtis certainly was not choosen. And the schemes and schames he ran we don't know if he was really called. It's really sad when he take the Lord's house in vain, let alone his responsibility as a leader. And to think he was the one who got played on the end. At one point I disliked him then the next minute I hated him. But I kept wondering when was Tanya was gonna wake up. I know she knew something was wrong. I would have suspected something. And when she found out she still tried to protect him. Hew was so demonic. I kept thinking to myself how stupid can you be. Wake up. Somebody slap her. Her own daughter was wiser than her. I don't mean to put her down so much I know it has a lot to do with her being raised but my goodness. I can also relate because I went through a lot in my life and my friends probably were saying the same about me. Angela wake up and smell the coffee. But I was thinking just like Tanya of my commitment to God, my committed to the marriage, the church, would people think it's my fault? Who can I talk to that would really understand? All sort of question were going through my mind, so I can imagine what Tanya was thinking. I can also imagine how she also was trying to protect her little girl and her mother and father. And to think how he lied and lied and lied and lied et cetera. I can remember feeling like Tanya too, listening to my husband when he had to get up the next Sunday to minister to the church on a mens day program (after a long night of physical and emotional abuse). I kept looking right through him and wanting to get up and leave, but couldn't because \\"what would everybody think\\", \\"they might know we're having problems\\", so I just sat there and stuck it out.But it was then after all I went through with my husband, and now being on my own I began to learn the value of my relationship with God and my future husband. I made a commitment to work on myself so that when I get married again, things would be different. Oh yes I will get married again. I loved being married. I can hardly wait. I thank God now because he allowed me to go through what I went through and to learn at an early age about things of life. It brings me back to a scripture in proverbs; \\"many women have done nobly, well, but none have excelled such as I.\\" I gained a lot of wisdom through it all and I'm not bitter, to say the least. As far as my husband - let's just say God is not through with him yet. Sincerely. Keep up the excellent work. It was truly awesome all your books are though. Maybe one day we can do brunch I got a bunch of ideas your readers probably would love to hear. Call me sometimes. Loved to hear from you. I recommend this books to EVERYBODY."},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"i read this book years ago, but i remember it being a page turner to me. i was kind of shocked by the actions of the pastor, but then again that all may happen in real life. i still tell people that if they want to read something good, this is the one to read."},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"I liked the premise, and I also like that the character seemed to be able to see through her husband's lies. The problem was that for the whole first half of the book, Tanya seems to do nothing but mull--over and over again. I wanted to yell at her to just follow the man instead of confronting him for the umpteenth time and doing nothing.As previous readers say, the book takes way too long make small progressions, yet seems to skip over important details--especially like how Curtis became the man he is and started his life of deception; and Tanya's relationship with Rebound Man seems too rushed.The premise of the book, I like, I just really dislike the pacing."},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"This is a very wordy novel. But I thought this book was a great read. The characters were believable. There was alot of humor and drama. It definitely kept me entertained."},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"I give this book 3.5 stars. Its part of a five book series. Well its a tale that reminds us that the love of money can lead even the best intentioned minister on a road to hell. The only thing I thought the story dragged on too long and was a bit repetitive in places. It would have helped to have a chapter that detailed Curtis first steps in giving into temptation. The topic is a serious one about marital abuse amongst the clergy and women stupidity in chasing married men especially clergy.Plus I did think the James character was a bit one dimensional, as if he was added to just to give Tanya some romance. I found their relationship hard to believe, if it was potrayed as a fling that would make more sense. However still worth reading."},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"Ooo Wee! Curtis Black is totally off the hinges!! This book is full of drama and deceit. It really makes you wonder what really goes on pastors chambers. It was definitely worth my time."},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"This was an okay read. It took me a long time to finish this book because in certain spots the book was downright boring. I really got tired of Tanya going back and forth on the seesaw trying to decide if she should stay or leave Curtis. And the whole idea of staying in a marriage where the husband lies & disrespects you daily and you know he's cheating but you choose to stay for the sake of your daughter was too much for me to comprehend (I lost interest at that point). Curtis was a terrible person and demonstrated many of the negative attributes associated with \\"Black\\" churches. This one was okay, not interested in reading the sequels"},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"Tanya Black has everything a woman could want: a fulfilling career, a beautiful daughter, an elegant home, and a handsome, charismatic husband who is pastor at a prominent Baptist church. And yet, none of it can hide the growing turbulence in her marriage.Her husband Curtis's remoteness, his selfisheness where she and their daughter are concerned, and his corruption when it comes to the church are making Tanya doubt what she once cherished. How can she respect a man who's preaching simple values while he's grabbing money and power behind the scenes?Then Curtis goes too far, and Tanya's confronted with the worst betrayal a woman can face. Plunged into a bittersweet journey of discovery, she suddenly finds herself learning painful new lessons about love, loyalty, and sensual temptation...and discovering the wisdom to celebrate the victories that are hers alone.Casting the First Stone started off with a bang. The way Curtis treated his wife infuriated me. I didn't care for Curtis and his deceptive ways, because he reminded me of some preachers I've encountered...living a double life. While reading Casting the First Stone, I thought Tanya should've left her poor excuse for a husband a long time ago. Unfortunately, that took a while to happen. I understand the frustration of some of the readers about that, but I think Tanya waited because the decision to leave a marriage is a tough one--regardless of the circumstances. I think she stuck around for appearances as well as insecurities. I enjoyed this book because justice was served. I recommend this book."},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"Very good book. I am facinated by Rev. Curtis Black and his escapades. Would like to read more about him."},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"Is a man with some serious issues, I really enjoyed this book and I am looking forward to future books on the Good 'Ole Rev."},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"\\"Casting the First Stone,\\" was a masterpiece, a clear depiction of a corrupt minister. Curtis Black was placed on a pedastal by his family and congregation, glorified to no end. However, he didn't live by the words he preached, which is very realistic in our own lives. Lesson learned, never glorify the man on the pulpit. Hear the pastors words and look up to God for guidance.~LeBlanc author of \\"Characters of Lust\\""},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"&quot;Casting the First Stone&quot; is an excellent book!! The characters in the book are very realistic. Although this is a fictional story, any reader should be able to relate. This story also depicts that even a pastor of a church is not beyond mistakes. The story also shows that the congregation of any church should not idolize the pastor, but should worship God. Did Curtis have a conscious? His downfall was inevitable. It was good to know that Tanya found happiness with James. Keep them coming, Kimberla!!!"},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"I felt that Kimberly Roby (author) did an outstaning job. This book was too real. I found myself not being able to put the book down. It covered just about everything that happens in the real world."},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"This book kept me captivated. The unfortunate part is that there are people in the church just like this. I, too, agree that this needs to be presented in an open forum at every church. I was entertained throughout this book. It brought real church issues to the forefront. It is definitely a must read! Good job, Kim."},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"A friend of mine allowed me to borrow this book around 3:00 p.m. on a Wednesday. I completed the book around 10:57 a.m. on Thursday. I could not put it down. This is the best fiction book I have read in a long time. Kim L. Roby has written a fiction book with real life situations. A novel which many people can relate to. This is what causes you not to be able to put the book down. It's truly more than fiction, it is reality. This book is a must for your bookshelf."},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"Every man and woman can relate to this novel. Whether they have been in the same or similar situation. This book will bring tears to your eyes and fill your heart with laughter.I haven't read a book that struck me with so much force in years. It will make you think about it when you're not reading it. You'll wonder what is going to happen at all times. You'll find yourself angry for being interrupted. And when it's all over, you will be saying, &quot;Now why won't they make a movie of this book.&quot;Have fun reading.Sincerely, Sherry McCreary"},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"This book is an excellent portrayal and I agree with Tray when he said that every church needs to read this and have an open discussion. Although, this is a fictional book, its sad to say, but things like this are real typical in churches throughout America. Kimberla made this an interesting and very entertaining story with a twist and spice in it. It kept you on your toes, and I could barely put the book down at my job. Creative piece of work for men and women to pick up and just read. Great work, Kimberla."},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"This was definitely a great book. I've read all of her books, however this one was exceptionally one of the best books that I have read. The characters were so life like and the end was actioned packed. Casting the First Stone is definitely a must read. I finished the book in two days, that's how good it was."},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"&quot;Casting The First Stone&quot; (CTFS) is an outstanding novel that is well worth recommending to family, friends, and reading groups. I will most definitely recommend it to my reading group-Rare Essence Book Club. Ms. Roby's writing is getting better and better. I thoroughly enjoyed &quot;Here and Now.&quot; CTFS is very real in regards to the downfall of many ministers who get caught up in greed, power and sex, and totally disregard their spiritual being. The book was hard to put down. I'v glad Tanya found the love and happiness she deserves. I truly hope Ms. Roby keep up the good work, and I'm looking forward to reading her next novel."},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"This book kept my attention the entire time. I received my book to review for my bookclub. When I finally was able to read this book it was great. I couldnt wait to see what happened to the characters. It really makes you question some of the big churches that are more a place of who's who as opposed to a place of worship. the book was good and I strongly recommend this book. I like Behind Closed Doors but this was way better."},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"Mrs. Lawson Roby really did it this time! Casting The First Stone is book you want to read to the end without putting it down. Her work is fascinating and divine! I can't wait to get my hand on her next masterpiece.YOU GO GIRL!"},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"This was such a great book, I did not want it to end.Once I started this book I could not put it down.The book was well written and fast paced. As a matter of fact, I brought the Millennium in by reading this book. Kimberla Lawson Roby work speaks for herself. She is an excellent writer."},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"Kimberla Lawson Roby has written another wonderful book. This is a story about family, greed, betrayal, and faith. The pastor husband seemed to have it all, but it just wasn't enough for him. His wife heard the rumors going around in church, but wouldn't believe them to be true. When she can no longer deny what is happening in her life, her faith in God is what helps her through. Her faith gives her the courage to do what she must do. This is definately a book I would recommend. The truly sad part is knowing that this kind of thing happens every day in the real world."},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"This is a great read! Keep up the good work Kimberla! I really liked this book because it realistically discussed controversial yet relevant issues of relationships today.... It takes a chapter or two to pick up...but DO NOT put it down! This talented author pulls you into the story and the main characters' lives.... The ONLY thing that I would have liked to see was a little more background information on Curtis Black... There is also a discussion group guide at the back of the book which has some really provocative questions.....I highly recommend this book...This would be great for a Jack and Jill book meeting! You won't be disappointed!"},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"I just finish reading this book, and it was so realistic. The characters were alive and you could feel the pain of Tanya and Curtis.It was well written and showed how greed could lead to nothing but trouble, that only God could fix.This family went through hell and faith is what brought the family through.I was very happy how the story ended, even though it was sad, but Tanya is now happy. Curtis on the other hand took Greed to whole new level. Greed destroyed their marriage and his ability to Pastor. I won't tell the whole story. But this is definitely a very good book to read."},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"&quot;Casting the First Stone&quot; has them all. Ms. Roby took a true topic and turned it into a novel. Reading this book really drives home that sometimes &quot;things or people are not always what they appear to be&quot;. Tanya did very well trying to stick it out with hopes that her husband, Curtis (a minister), would come to his senses and stop womanizing and focus on their marriage. Unfortunately, Curtis is so blinded by the money, the power and the women that he realizes his ordeal too late. Ms. Roby does a good job with the two main characters and focusing on their parts in the marriage. As I was reading Curtis' thoughts, I would wonder how he could be so self-centered. Everything was about his needs and wants without regards to who gets hurt in the process. This book is a good read because of its religious backdrops and the breath of reality you feel while reading it. This is a book that can be related to in some way."},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"This is the first book I have read by Kimberla Lawson Roby and probably the last. I was not a fan of her writing style. While the book started off pretty well it went down hill from there. Tanya took forever going over the same things over and over again just to make up her mind to leave her husband Curtis. Then to add insult to injury she kept challenging Curtis when she was alone and he reacted like a nut. At least 150 pages of this book was a repeat of everything over and over again. There was no suspense for me as I finally didn't care how it ended. Although I completed reading the novel I won't repeat this exercise with any of her other books."},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"I believe the main reason this book was a page turner to me was because it hit too close to home with an extrememly similiar incident in a church I once belonged to. Unfortunately, it is also the main reason I no longer attend church, too hypocritical.In any case, I did get a little tired of Tanya's prolonged excuses to do something about the situation and using her precious daughter as one excuse. There were many instances where I thought she could have been doing some detective work on her own instead of sitting home on her butt wondering. As for Curtis, he finally gets what he deserves...no mercy! I'm waiting for Too Much of a Good Thing to be delivered, I'd like to keep up with how this ends up."},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"This is the first book that I read of Kimberla Lawson Roby. This book was excellent!! Rev. Curtis Black was really someeee kind of preacher, but luckily the first lady of the church,his wife Tanya,was a real Christian. Rev. Black did not deserve to be the \\"shepard\\" of his church or any other church for that fact. Tanya was my favorite character and she does come out on top. Kimberla , I really enjoyed this book. I would definitely recommend it to others. It keeps your interest the entire time!!"},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"this book was okay. the subject matter was intriquing, however the book was very slow. i was very disappointed when tanya started out somewhat strong then turned around and let her husband play a head game on her. i really did not like what she ultimately did to satisfy herself. she keep saying that she was a preacher's wife - which was contradictory to what she keep saying about the congregation- (that they looked up to curtis as if he was God) well she should have heeded her own message and stayed true to God and not emphasize that she's a preacher's wife. that disturbed me b/c it was more about image than God. curtis' character did not surprise me at all. it was typical-- sad but typical. the book should have been shorter - had it not focused on tanya's insecurities that were not brought to light. her naivete really urked me. especailly since she was counselling abused women. a lot more upset me as well but that's all i'll talk about for now."},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"Like always, Kimberla Lawson Roby, you have outdid yourself again. I just love the way your write! .Casting the First Stone was truly a remarkable read. And there are truly people like Curtis.Now, Tonya, my heart went out too. To endure so much pain! The Man had a lot of NERVES!This is a MUST READ ! You Don't want to pass this book up... You will never forgive yourself, if you do! Exceptional READ....."},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"This is my second book by Kimberla Lawson Roby! I started off with \\"Behind Closed Doors\\" which was awesome and I decided to read the series! I also wanted to start from the beginning to avoid missing characters and story lines.

Her books will NOT disappoint!"},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"I read this book years ago, as well as the entire Curtis Black Series! I love Kimberla's style of writing and I really enjoyed reading about that low down Curtis Black. Read the series in order! Go to Ms. Roby's website to get the order of the series! Curtis Black is a mess that I love reading about!!!"},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"After reading casting the First Stone, a book written by Kimberly Roby Lawson, I believe this saying is true. This author is a young African-American woman who took my reading to a whole different level. The book left me with a lot of critical thinking about life in general. This book was about a person who was so selfish, controlling, rude, aggressive and more toward his wife and others. I chose this book because I read the cover and it was very interested in it. After I finished the book, I began to think about being a Christian. I know I'm not perfect; I make mistakes sometimes and ask for forgiveness. But I don't understand how pastors live the lives they live. Are they really wolves in sheep clothing? Do they realize they are our leaders? I believe in God, and give him much respect. And that's the way I want to do my pastor, love him and give him respect. But in order to get respect you got to give respect. I even question my belief in him as a pastor, why should we respect a person doing wrong. But of course he has to live and die for his self. I go to church to listen to the message and learn for them. If you have a problem with your pastor, and it bothers you too much, you should get a new pastor. We can't judge other people, live your own life. I think the author did a good job on this book, and I can't wait to finish reading part two. I would love to see if Curtis change his life around."},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"I've read this book and it made me hunger for more. it maybe fiction, but the bottom line in reality its true. I've witness it first hand. therefore it can happen will happen and have happen. Curtis black was a mess, but i think it was about the fourth book he changed, thank God. I've read all of them and have a couple more to read.the one where the daughter Alecia has grown up and gotten married follwing the same pattern as the father. Hopefully when I finish reading this, there will be some good that comes out all this like it did for Curtis, her father.kimberly I love your books and keep on letting God use you, though it maybe fiction, the truth is the light."},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"This book was recommended by several people. Upon reading it, I found the language to be inappropriate for a christian book club. I was amazed at the necessity for the language that was used. I believe the story could have been told without the use of obscene language. I was unable to read the entire book. It was very disappointing. After ordering 35 copies, I had to return and order 35 other books which were more appropriate."},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"This author is a wonderful writer. She gives you meat to chew on and I spend late nights reading which is my thing to do to soothe me. Wonderful story line also. My favorite author was Terry McMillan but now she shares top billing with Kimerla L Roby."},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"Kimberla Lawson Roby is a wonderful writer. The Curtis Black series is a must read for anyone who enjoys reading. Add Kimberla books to your book collection and you will not be disappointed.

Predictable story and outcome. My biggest gripe was the typeface. Not appealing at all. 2.5 stars."},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"This was an excellent book very well written and not a boring moment!!

I will be sure to tell all my friends about this book."},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"All too true about these no good preachers. You hypocrites can say what you want. Casting the First Stone was a good and easy read. I read another good book called &quot;Waiting to Exit Hell.&quot; It was absolutely the best book I've read in this category. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"Kimberla I loved this book, I just couldn't put it down."},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"This was my first novel my Kimberla Roby and it was a very intertesting read. I really enjoyed the story! Casting The First Stone was about a man name Curtis who was called to preach. He was the pastor of a large church. Curtis took his position and turned it around to fit his needs and wants. He got up in the puplit every Sunday preaching the word and behind closed doors he was having not one, but two affairs on his wife, he was physically abusive to her and he was using the money of the church to do UNGODLY things for his mistresses.Tanya his wife tried to put up with Curtis for as long as she could then she herself lost faith in God and also did some things that God would not be pleased with.Even though this book was fiction I truly believe some of the things are happening in churches today. This novel was between and a 4.0 and 4.5. Thank you Kiimberla for a insightful read! I will be reading more work from you in the future!"},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"This is my second raeding of a Kimberla Lawson Roby book,and it was good. This book kept me on the edge wanting to know what was going to happen in it.Curtis was a lying no good cheat of a husband and pastor to his wife and child,along with the congregation.Tonya had serious choices to make regarding her marriage what she was going to do to end it, but at the end she made the right choice. Curtis got what was coming to him.I'm not going to give away the book,but it really had me going. It was good ya'll only a dummy would pass a chance to read it."},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"I truly enjoyed reading this book (quick read). And it is a true indication of how some of these &quot;preachers&quot; can lose sight of everything (i.e Jesse Jackson). I can understand everything that Tanya had to come to terms with and how difficult her decisions had to be. We can often offer advise to others about their relationships, but never can take our own advise, often trying to show how our situation is &quot;a little&quot; different. And when you are the &quot;first lady&quot; of the church, not only is your marriage considered the sacrament but representation of the entire church family. So no matter what happens Monday - Saturday on Sunday you still have to look like a happy church family. With the growing number of 'called' preachers, reverands, evangelists and Bishops, I'm certain there will be many Tanya's to come. Overall the book offers a great story with a strong spiritual background. And it also shows how our deep roots and upbringing in the church affects how we deal with our marital relationship, the decisions we make and why we sometimes endure so much."},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"I have not, in a long time, been able to sit down and read a book of 300 pages. &quot;Casting the First Stone&quot; was very exciting and I felt like a major part of Tanya's life. I enjoyed how the author portrayed each of the characters and the church. For the past three years I have not been a member of any church, because of the Curtis' that exist. I believe that if I were to write a book today, it would be entitled &quot;And Let the Truth Be Told&quot; focusing on today's Black churches and the powers within.I enjoyed the writer's book because she used stores and places that I could relate to today. I am planning to read her other books, but I hope that they will not have the same story line. But I like enjoying what was going to happen every minute that I read the book. Roby, keep up the good work."},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"Excellent portrayal of real life issues faced by many. The complexities of relationships, balancing your own self worth against the desire to be loved... Following your own instincts -generally if something feels wrong, it is!...and what happens tous when we ignore all of the danger signs in a relationship.One of my favorite authors!"},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"&#8220;Casting the First Stone&#8221; by Kimberla Lawson Roby is a masterful presentation of creative writing. Ms. Roby is very inventive and uses great imagination in portraying the characters and situations of her story. In this novel, she vividly described the fraught lives of a married couple who struggles to remain faithful to each other in their Christian walk. Tanya, who is presupposed to have achieved a degree of life success, is married to Curtis, a charismatic pastoral husband who is laden with some obvious spiritual weaknesses. As their marriage suffered, Tanya&#8217;s serene and beautiful love of life began to turn sour and her affection for the things she once admired began to grow cold. And like a woman who was abducted for marriage falls in love with her abductor, she learns of her husband&#8217;s infidelity and succumbs to the same weaknesses that plagued his life. It is an interesting read."},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"The book started off a little boring but it soon caught and sustained my attention. It has a great suspense down to the last page."},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"This book kept me reading. It was hard to put down. I think they should have outed Curtis a different way but he got what he deserved. Very good book."},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"Read Casting the First Stone as a book club selection. It created a lively discussion. Want to read her other books with some of the same characters."},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"This was the very first book that I read by Roby. She has held my attention for the very beginning. this book could be about anyone, though it is fictional.My mother is eighty years old and we both have read all of Roby's witings."},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"Casting the First Stone is a total rollercoaster ride from beginning to end! Curtis Black is something else with himself. For a Baptist preacher, Curtis is an expert at breaking all the commandments. Curtis is living the American dream, career, family, and a lavish lifestyle. His wife Tanya is so patient with Curtis even though she is constantly hearing rumors of his infidelity. Curtis has everyone fooled with his slick talk and smoothe words. Curtis has more than his share of women and a bank account to back his lifestyle.Tanya soon begins to grow tired of sleeping alone at night while her husband lives like a single man. His lies are becoming inconsistent and the man she thought she married no longer exists. Curtis double life soon catches up with him because he is promising everyone the world but he cannot deliver. After listening to the lies for so long, Tanya decides to divorce Curtis. At that point Curtis completely loses his grasp on reality since his world is slowly crashing in.This story will keep you in suspense and you won't put it down, not even to sleep lol. At one point I decided I was going to stop reading at a certain chapter and when I made it there something so unexpectant happened and I ended up staying awake for hours reading! Fantastic story and very entertaining!"},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"I really enjoyed this book. It's relatable on so many different levels. I always wondered how clergy can preach the word yet live a life that isn't representative of the word. But this book breaks it down. And is simply put. So people, regardless of their responsibilities, in this case Curtis Black as the head of the church, are human and commit sins just like everyone else. This is the first book I ever read that touches on what goes on in the black church. Always heard stories about what goes on but Curtis Black takes the cake. Needless to say I ordered books 2-4 of the series because its just that addictive."},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"I bought 'Casting The First Stone' several months ago (January 2012), and it is now April 19th. I am still trying to get through this book. First of all, the author spent way too much time on Tanya. This character decides she is going to leave Curtis, her husband. And then, she decides that she'll stay with him because she wants to make the marriage work. That's pretty much it. She decides to stay, she decides to leave, she decides to stay, she decides to leave. Second, the author did not spend nearly enough time on the character, Curtis. The author could have done so much more in terms of the character of Curtis. I also wish she had written about 'how' Curtis became the man he'd become. I'm sure there is a reason why the author decided to write about the subject of a minister and the obssession with greed. We all know they exist in 'real life.' Had she done it, 'Casting The First Stone' would have been a much more interesting book. I am almost done with this particular book, and I plan on reading \\"Too Much Of A Good Thing.\\" I hope it is a much better read than 'Casting The First Stone.' I also hope it gives more details about Curtis. The character of Curtis may be deceitful, but it makes the story a bit more interesting."},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"I just started reading this series and I am hooked. This book is definitely a page turner. Great read to say the least. I am not sure why I hadn't come across this book/series much sooner. I stumbled on some of the more recent books when a bookstore was going out of business and I didn't want to read them out of order so I started with this one. I was not disappointed. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"So far I have only read the epilogue and first 3 chapters of this book.

It is serious yet humorous to some degree. It illustrates to its reader the fact that no one is free from sin! I encourage everyone to get a copy of this book!!"},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"I enjoyed reading this book because it reflects ...the church. I think it points out how some people go about representing God and his teaching the way they want instead of how it is written. The 3 evils lust,greed, and power all play big parts in this book and shows how God condemns those who thrive on these evils."},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"While I appreciate Ms. Roby's ability to hook me in and keep me engaged throughout the novel, I'm afraid to admit that this novel is VERY predictable. I couldn't help but think that this was yet another edition off of the assembly line of African-American novels that have appeared on shelves in recent years. It's time for us to write about more than men cheating on their wives - as an African-American, I feel that our experience is SO MUCH more varied than that. Just an opinion."},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"While I appreciate Ms. Roby's ability to hook me in and keep me engaged throughout the novel, I'm afraid to admit that this novel is VERY predictable.

I was very tired of Tanya's indecisiveness when it came to her leaving Curtis. But after I decided to give the book another chance, it began to pick up.

As a life long church member, it so easy at times to put a pastor or minister on a pedestal. Pastors and Ministers are special because they've been called by God, but they are still men. But even though everybody falls short of the glory of God, Curtis is the extreme. I really enjoyed reading this book and I highly recommend it to everyone."},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"casting the first stone was very good.i loved it a lot. it's a story of a husband is having an afair.your probably thinking \\" yeah so, there are lots of books when husbands cheat\\" . and your right, but this husband preaches the word of GOD. he gets caught up infidelity. and when his secret is out. that's when all the sh$% hits the fan."},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"Kimberla, I enjoyed your book.

Kimberla is fast becoming one of my favorite writers. Her writing style is easy to read and message was so clear, we do tend to worship the messenger and money and power is the root of all evil. The characters were portrayed very realistically. This was quick read because I needed to know what Curtis's problems were. Closure was needed and it was there!"},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"A year or so ago, I picked up Roby's novel, &quot;Behind Closed Doors&quot; and read it in one sitting...it was just that good. I interviewed her last November, my very first interview, before her latest novel CASTING THE FIRST STONE was to drop. When her publicist e-mailed me for another interview, I was too thrilled and quickly went to purchase and devour her latest literary treat...and I was NOT disappointed. What better topic to tackle seriously in a novel but corruption of the black church?CTFS introduces us to Tanya and Curtis Black, the first family of a prominent Baptist church in Chicago. Tanya knew that life was perfect when 8 years earlier, Curtis proposed marriage to her, and to his calling by God to lead a religious life in the church. The Black family moves from Atlanta to a growing congregation in Chicago, and this move instantly changes Tanya and her life and family forever.I read CTFS in one sitting, about three hours, so enthralled by Tanya and the incredible going ons of the characters that I couldn't put the book down. Revenge, greed, lust, corruption, and lies are all destruction mechanisms in Tanya's life, and it's not until she's able to deal with the shocking truths about herself and her husband, that she is able to realize that revenge isn't sweet and negative solutions for negative situations will not make her happy. Roby has proven herself prolific with her first two novels, &quot;Behind Closed Doors&quot; and &quot;Here and Now&quot;, and with Casting The First Stone, Roby proves that her literary talents will continue for a long time to come.Shonell Bacon, author of &quot;Luvalwayz: The Opposite Sex &amp; Relationships&quot;"},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"Ms. Roby's book Casting the First Stone was a page turner. She bought to life real issues that are affecting the black church community everyday. While I was reading I couldn't help but think that there are a lot of Tanya's in the world. The Tanya's of the world are woman who find it hard or impossible to get out of abusive relationships. After all this man did to her it took her more than a little while to finally get the courage to leave the marriage behind. I admired her character and integrity in the beginning of the book. However, towards the end she was just as guilty as Curtis of infidelity. The one thing that I can say is that I am glad she finally put one foot in front of the other and kept going.Now for Curtis. This man represents all that I find vile and nasty in any man, but especially a man who was &quot;called&quot; to the ministry. He was a liar, maanipulator, and just downright fraud! There almost seemed to be no limits to his self-destructive ways. The fact that he kept blaming all the wrong in his life on the &quot;devil&quot; was just too much. Then he had the nerve to get up on Sunday and preach to thousands of people on how they should be living for God. I found him to be just too funny because he was just so unbelievable. Everytime he did something else I kept saying to myself &quot;oh no he didn't&quot;. The characters in this book were real, and they showed the whole range of emotions that take place when a relationship is just beyond repair. I think it will also remind Christians of the fact that we must always be aware of wolves in sheep's clothing. I truly feel that if you pick up this book you will not be disappointed. Ms. Roby has bought to the light an issue that definitely needs to be discussed. Congratulations Ms. Roby on a job well done !"},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"We got the Black Family, The Black Church, The Black First Lady, and The Prominent Black Minister and Now Can I Get An Amen! Casting The First Stone is a story about comtemporary issues that affect the family and the church today and portrays a realistic as well as and behind the scene view of the church. Tanya Black, the wife and First Lady of the story, is torn between keeping her family together or moving on and severing the ties to her husband, the minister Curtis Black. It seems the good Rev. Black has had a few too many dalliances and he seems to be changing from a loving husband to someone Tanya used to know. In fact, Rev. Black has become so enthralled with himself, lust, power, greed and wealth that he appears to have forgotten why he became a minister in the first place. Casting The First Stone was wonderfully written and the storyline/plot depicted the ups and downs many couples face when one partner decides to seek there own agenda and does not consider the needs/feelings of the rest of the family. Ms. Roby did a wonderful job of bringing her characters to life in the minds of readers. She included characters that were relatable and ones you could easily identify with. Situations were included which tested all of your emotions and made you cry, laugh, seek revenge, and get upset but also made you keep turning the pages to find out the ultimate outcome. My only disappointment with Casting The First Stone, was that Ms. Roby did not explain Rev. Curtis Black more. I wanted to know more about what made him tick and why he did some of the things he did. However, I also realize that in real life there a number of Curtis Blacks who act the same way. No Ryhthm or Reason but Just Because. Casting The First Stone is a books which shows that all of us have flaws and faults and none of us are exempt. And sometimes even the best of us fall to temptation(The First Lady--Tanya included); however there are always consequences or rewards associated with what ever decisions we decide to make."},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"This book was a superb read! It is a must for all women especially women who are married to men in the ministry. It's a must for our &quot;First Ladies&quot;. Kimberla out did herself this time. I have read all her books and I didn't think that they could get any better. Boy was I wrong! She does an exemplary job with the characters. She doesn't overload us with too many of them. She sticks to telling the story of the main characters which is filled with suspense, anger, humor, real life stories and thought provoking situations. It made me do some self evaulation and appreciate a God who loves me in spite of. This is a must read for all men and women. It's a page turner. I finished the book in two days. I highly reccommend this book. I just heard that her next one will be out in March 2001 . . .I don't know how I'll be able to wait that long. Keep up the good work Kimberla!"},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"The novel opens to a world of hopefullness with a young couple starting on a journey of togetherness and spirituality, but eight years later all this is turned around. I have to admit because I read so much I cannot remember the main character's name but her lack of naivete' and trust is what alot of women do today. I was with her all the way with trying to give her marriage all that she could but I was also with her when she said enough was enough. Now the only thing I didnt like about the book was her reasoning to stray when her married life wasnt taken care of--when she hadnt made any concrete moves to end it.What this book also echoed is that spirtuality is in the heart not a church/building/man/tithe. I dont even think it is worth mentioning the souless display of her husband Curtis!Without a doubt I recommend this book and it is now being circulated throughout my friends list to finally be read again by me!"},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"Ms. Roby's latest novel is absolutely superlative. A timeless story of good versus evil are often classics in the making and this is no exception. The protagonist, Tanya Black is truly an everywoman and easily indentified with.

Bravo Ms.Roby. Bravo!"},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"I enjoyed reading &quot;Casting the First Stone.&quot; It is a very fast and fun read!

It was absolutely wonderful! I enjoyed it to the utmost! I would highly suggest this book to anyone that enjoys books by African American Authors. I had already read her earlier works, &quot;Here And Now&quot; and &quot;Behind Closed Doors&quot; and that's why I didn't hesitate purchasing her new novel. I didn't even read the cover description of what the book was about, that's how much I enjoy her writing. So, pass the word along, that Ms. Roby is an absolutely superb author and I will sing her praises and anxiously await the release of another novel.

But this one took me like a week. I would read a sentence and then my mind would wander off and I would start thinking about something else. The first half is EXTREMELY boring. I didn't show any emotion (a laugh/a cry/a gasp) until about page 323-mind you the book is only like 360 pages. I ordered this book, Too Much of a Good Thing and The Best Kept Secret so I could read them in order, and I hope that the other 2 aren't going to be as boring as the first. I don't see what all the hype was about...was it because he was a pastor and was big-doin' it with everybody?....YAWN."},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"I really enjoyed this book.Although this story is sad but true because it deals with how some of our ministers are today.Tanya Black is married to Curtis Black who is a preacher.He is cheating on her and begging the congregation for money...more money.It is all about Curtis,his women and material things.The more I read about Curtis the more I hated him but he was what made the book a page turner!!!Now Tanya on the other hand there were times when I actually wish I could jump into the book and slap some sense into Tanya for putting up with Curtis behavior.I wish she could have been a bit more aggressive.I understand she loved Curtis and wanted to try and work things out but come on now Curtis was always on the go.That should have told her he ain't trying to hear it.He wanted to do what he wanted end of story.She should have left a long time ago.He probaly figured she should be happy with the material things and let him be.Two wrongs don't make a right BUT I am glad she met James.If she didn't meet James she probaly would have still been with Curtis.I wish the author could have told us more about James.She should have been divorced Curtis but maybe she felt like there was still hope.I felt sorry for Alicia,their 9 year old daughter.I mean she just wanted to have a happy family.I think the main person who was hurt in the story was her.Adrienne who was one of the women that Curtis was seeing,he manipulated her.I mean it was about control with Curtis.He paid for her abortion and she was married to deacon Jackson.She really did love Curtis but she got hurt in the end too.Although the book dragged at the beginning it started getting good.Curtis got what was coming to him and I don't feel sorry for someone like that because he knew better.He was good at manipulating people and making them feel guilty.It was a good read.I will be reading \\"TOO MUCH OF A GOOD THING\\" to see what else Curtis Black is up to!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"This book was just too true to life. I enjoyed this book so much that I was willing to talk about to anyone that would listen. The storyline hit so close to &quot;home&quot;. I have recommended this book to all of my friends. It only goes to show us that no matter how &quot;holy&quot; one seems on the outside there is usually something lying within that person that isn't &quot;all that&quot;. Curtis was a prime example, sticking to his &quot;do as I say and not as I do&quot; philosophy. We should never lose sight of the main one in control (The Almighty Lord Jesus) because he knows our heart and he will give you so much rope and then it up to you what you do with it.

I have been reading novels for alot of years and I think this was a great topic to write about. This book has a very defining message, if you feel in your heart that something wrong than perhaps it is wrong, you must stand for what you believe in or you will fall for anything. I would recommend Casting the First Stone to all readers. Casting the First Stone talked about the Pros and Cons in marriage and spirtual upbringing. Tanya was portrayed excellent as being very level-headed and trying to hold on to her family and troubled marriage and not to mention her test of faith in God and her vows. I was impressed how this book bring out so many issues that affect us daily. Thanks to Kimberla Lawson Roby for writing this type of storyline that truly affect our race."},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"Kim Roby's CASTING THE FIRST STONE was the best novel I have read in a very long time.

Kimberlae Lawson Roby definitely gets 5 stars for CASTING THE FIRST STONE!! I'd recommend it to anyone that likes GOOD QUALITY NOVELS!"},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"Let me start by saying I did enjoy reading this novel. Sadly this tpye of behavior does sometime happens in God's house. The book started off good, but it gave no background on Tayna and Curtis relationship, it jumped from them dating in college to eight years and a child later in their marriage. What happened in between those years? Tayna, after awhile started to get on my nervous, she was conistantly complaining about what Curtis was and was not doing, she allowed Curtis to walk all over her. One other thing I could not understand, Tayna thought her husband was having an affair, and for two years she did nothing about it, other than complain. Being a preacher wife, Tayna's charactor should have been a bit more agressivie and a lot less shallow. Ms. Roby used the phrase &quot;matter of factly a little to much for me, they are other words that can be used. What was this James person all about? Other than the fact he was divorced, no other details were introduced, which made James charactor rather boring."},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"I say this is a must read, Ms. Roby did a very good job. It makes you take a double take sometimes and it makes you wonder if this pastor was called, but who was he called by satan himself. Tonya was a little too good to be true because Curtis would have had something really bad done to him. I guess in the end he got what was coming to him.(nasty,greedy dog) All I can say preachers,pastors,bishops and all those religious leader they have to be watched really close, but all religious leaders are not as Curtis was.(this was a fiction book) Yet and still purchase this book it was worth the money."},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"Although, the storyline of this book can be taken from real life experiences, it is somewhat unbelievable. What is unbelievable is the low self-esteem of the heroine, Tanya. The reason for her continuous naivete considering that she was educated enough to know better. The book did not touch on her problems. And how she was not a good example for her daughter. She let things happen to her, instead of taking control of her life. I wish that there was a stronger male figure that counteracted Curtis' weakness and that Tanya's issues were dealt with."},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"I started this book on Thanksgiving eve. Since I was expecting company for the holiday I didn't expect to really get into the book this weekend. However, once I started reading I couldn't put it down!

I didn't read Here and Now but NOW I will! Great reading."},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"I recently finished reading &quot; Casting The First Stone&quot;. This book was simply amazing. This was my first time reading a book by Kimberla Lawson Roby. I have seen her name around, but I never read one of her books before. I am a member of the Black Expressions book club, and that is where I ordered this book. Pastor Curtis Black was a trip and half. That man was so low down. I didn't think he could get any lower, but I was wrong. Although I enjoyed the book, it would've been nice to know why Curtis did all that cheating. The book could've used some background information on Curtis. But I must say that Kimberla has captured my interest, and now I'll be on the lookout for more of her books. I don't really have a favorite female author. I can read anything by anyone, be it male or female. But I will certainly be looking out for her.

Casting The First Stone is a must read for every human being interested in taking some time out of their day in, day out world, to sit back and let Kimberla Lawson Roby steal their mind and body and take them into the lives of Tanya and Curtis Black. This story is not only about greed and betrayal but about how often, too many of us lose sight of just how precious life is and what's most important to us. Often when we do come to terms and realize that faith and committment are valuable, many times it's too late.Everyone who reads this latest selection, will know or have heard of many if not all of the characters in this page turner.Kimberla Lawson Roby is such a wonderful story tell and I commend her on her choice of subject matter for her latest best seller and look forward to her next work of fiction.For those of you who are not familiar with this great author, you are indeed missing out on some of the most heart felt works of fiction to hit our 21st century.Bookclubs.........you will lose sleep over trying to finish this one!"},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"I don't know what gave Kimberla L. Roby the notion to write this book but I think every church near and far need to read this book and have an open church discussion. The people in this book became so real to me everyday that I would read it I grew closer to the situations that were erupting. Alicia, was the one person that really suffered in the whole thing but as it turns out she'll be able to overcome and enjoy her child hood without being so sad all the time. I don't feel Tanya did anything wrong in starting a friendship with James because if she didn't have him in her corner I wonder what she would have done mentally. A girlfriend(Nicole) can only understand so much when she's got her own problems to deal with. Everything Pastor Black got he asked for it and that's an open and close chapter.

As some of the readers said Tanya took forever to make her mind up as to what she was going to do about her cheating husband. Although I never expected the to find out those other things the Pastor did, it was still a little slow for me. I read one of Mrs, Roby other books and that was better than this one (Changing Faces)I purchased Too much of a good thing, and The best kept secret at the same time hoping that they all would be good books to read. From the looks of Casting the first stone, I'm not looking forward to reading the other ones.Overall I could have save my time and money, I killed time reading it but I would have rather reading the newspaper.Sorry!"},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"This is not great literature, but a fun read. It took me a couple of days to finish. Something light for an airplane ride or vacation. The ironic thing is I &quot;dated&quot; someone who was like the main character - a minister and a dog! So I can say &quot;it is real&quot;."},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"At our book club meeting yesterday, my mother quoted the bible (John 8:7-11) &quot;He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her...And they which heard it, being convicted by their own conscience, went out one by one, beginning at the eldest, even unto the last: and Jesus was left alone, and the woman standing in the midst. When Jesus had lifted up himself, and saw none but the woman, he said unto her, Woman, where are those thine accusers? hath no man condemned thee? She said, No man, Lord. And Jesus said unto her, Neither do I condemn thee: go, and sin no more.&quot; Her point was this: in the bible, no one cast a stone. Yet the title of this book is &quot;Casting the First Stone&quot; as if there is a character in this book who is without sin. There is none. Remotely, Alicia could be without sin, but basically, everyone in the book is a sinner. I did not like this book. I felt that as a Pastor's wife and such a woman of God steeped in the Word (as she initially tried to make herself out to be) she should have been on her knees praying every chance she had. Instead, she is worrying and wondering who she should turn to, who she could talk to, what she should do. From my research, she only prayed one time in the book (p. 78) and that prayer asked God to remove any love she felt for her husband. How about praying for God's will in her marriage? Further, this one prayer in the book could have been so much more effective if it had been set out as text instead of narrated by the author. To top it all off, she was just plain silly to subsequently have unprotected contact with this cheating husband of hers. The other characters are so thinly represented that they are not even worthy of mention. This book was poorly written (seemingly in a hurry) and is full of unnecessary commercial references (Coach, Lexus, Mercedes-Benz, etc). I was slightly offended that Roby took worldly themes and put it in a novel that was supposed to be about the church. But then again, this book was not *really* about the church, now was it?"},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"I really enjoyed reading Casting The Firt Stone. Roby really showed the actuality of what goes on in the personal lives of some religious leaders. The characters were like people in everyone's hometown as well as church. This was the first book of Mrs. Roby's, but it won't be my last."},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"I had read the reviews and everyone seem to had a good time with it and I am so happy that I did. Kim Roby's books always touch my heart and make me think. This one touched my heart and soul. I could not put it down. We have all been in situations where we have been disillusioned by leaders and have lost our way and our faith and may have been taken advantage of by the \\"Preacher\\" or church folk. We discussed this last Sunday in my Sunday School Class - whether some of the evangelists we see on television are in it for the money. We all have to give an account of our actions to God. We have to learn as the character did in the book to worship and keep our faith in God and not man. If not we are going to lose our way for sure.I could not put this book down from sentence one. I kept thinking what is Curtis going to do next and he couldn't possibly get any worse. It is real life. People get caught up in money, sex,and power and will get the mentality you do as I say, not as I do and when you wake up it is too late.I can see this happening in some of the churches in and around my community, we have to be ever prayerful. Tanya was indeed a strong black woman who always wanted to do what was right for her daughter and her and she kept praying through those dark ours. I loved that her friend Nicole supported her with whatever decision she made and did not interfere and say, \\"if I was you I would do this, etc.\\", James was a strong black man - a real man. Tanya's dad was great. Curtis, the devil, was a TRIP, I never knew what he was going to say or do next. There is always positive and negative in life and it was shown through this story. It was great and have to give Kim Roby a lot of credit."},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"I heard about this book a while back but didn't want to read it because of the subject matter. I'm so glad that I didn't let that stop me. It's one of the best books I've read all year. Ms. Lawson has a way with the written word that left me hysterically laughing at one point and breathless in others. Curtis and Tanya could be people YOU live next door to. Curtis could be the &quot;wolf in sheep's clothing&quot; pastoring the church you belong to. That's just how real this story was to me. This is the perfect example of what happens when you forget WHO YOU ARE and more importantly WHOSE YOU ARE. So compelling was this story written that I actually found myself feeling sorry for Curtis. There was no other way for the story to end, but it was still a sad ending to his downward spiral of excess addiction. Excess money and excess women. I avidly await her next story!

The Pastor was terrible and he did terrible things to his family and the church, but in the end it all caught up with him and his mistress.

I enjoyed you at the Chicago Women Who Love To Read Retreat/May 2000. I started reading your book this morning and I was done by 1000pm the same day. I could not put it down. I had no idea that your book would be so powerful. I truly enjoyed every twist of it. It made me reflect on my own life and relationship with GOD. It was very deep, spiritual and yet spicy. I look forward to more of your work.Rhonda Gibson Founder, 1st Annual African American Book Clubs &amp; Readers Retreat"},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"Yes indeed! Kimberla Lawson Roby has really done it with this one! She has earned the &quot;Dramatic Scene Queen&quot; crown! The fight, the staircase scene and the Appreciation Day scene along with others had my heart beating fast and my mouth wide open reciting &quot;Oh My God!&quot; Curtis definitely knows he is a pro at getting himself intangled in some stuff! When will we learn, everything done in the dark will eventually be brought to light? Everything!Casting the First Stone is truly a WINNER!"},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"Casting the First Stone is sermonic without being &quot;preachy&quot;. Ms. Roby is a gifted writer and delivers a page-turning novel that will leave the reader with something to think about. ALL of Ms Roby's novels are excellent. However, this one is a little different in approach and execution of her subject matter. In the beginning, it seems that she hesitates as if though unsure as to whether or not she should be writing about religious folks &quot;acting out&quot;... but do stay tuned... because she soon drops the over editorializing of her characters actions and starts readily dealing with the depth of their individual issues. Ms. Roby is AWESOME and I look forward to her next work."},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"KIMBERLA LAWSON ROBY HAS BEEN A FAVORITE OF MINE SCINCE BEHIND CLOSED DOORS!

I initially was sceptical about purchasing her book, but I read the insert and heard Mrs. Roby speak on her book tour and I was sold. I was very impressed with her courageous and very vivid details of corruption in some churches. This novel had me barely sleeping because I was so anxious to get to the next chapter and see what happens next. I also enjoyed that fact that she made her characters so real and even Tanya, the &quot;heroine&quot; was not exempt from faults or flaws. Her reactions and acts of impulse were totally human. Without giving to much away from the entire novel, all I have to say is READ THIS BOOK, it will be totally worth it. Kimberla L. Roby has done an exceptional job with this novel and I anxiously await her next novel."},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"From the moment I picked up this book in the and read the cover I was captured. Ms. Roby has done a wonderful job of making her characters real in the minds of readers. I felt the emotions that Tanya Black experienced as she dealt with making the transition from a &quot;Picture Perfect&quot; life into what unfortunately is reality for many. I thouroughly enjoyed this book from start to finish and found it to be a must read!"},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"I just finished the book at 5am this morning. It took me a couple of days to get off and running but once I got started I could not put it down. The fact that I am a minister's wife made the reading even more interesting. There are women who act like Adrienne and ministers who act like Curtis. All in all, he got exactly what he deserved. I am not at all pleased with the choice that Tanya made in bringing a &quot;man of her own&quot; into the picture. I know that she felt alone, because she was. However, James should have never become a part of her life until after the divorce was final. This is an excellent read. Fast paced and believeable. It is about time that truth is told about men who want to be God."},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"Kim Roby has done it! this book is such a gripping look into one woman's pain filled struggle with her husband that just happens to be a man of the cloth. Man of the Flesh would have been more apporpriate. Tanya Black is an strong, successful woman with a husband that can't be faithful if he tried. This novel spins the web of decit, pain and plenty of get back. The writing is clear and vivid. I could see the emotion laced within the words and I could feel the pain, fear and faith of each character. Kim, you've done it. This is the first of your works that my bookclub has read, but with writing like this, IT WON'T BE THE LAST! The Eye of RA Bookclub."},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"I cannot believe it has taken this long for someone to finally tell the truth about these jack-leg ministers!This book should be &quot;required&quot; reading for congregations around the country.Congrats, Ms. Roby for doing a great job, and telling a story that was long overdue."},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"Casting the First Stone is a well crafted novel that was as blatantly shocking as it was humors. Anything that could have been violated was in this captivating, jaw dropping novel that leaves heads nodding \`yes' to the truth we gleaned from Tanya's and Curtis' lives. In the midst of havoc, actions and consequences are the moral conclusion. Casting the First Stone teaches the readers life changing lesson of dedication, greed and faithfulness to God."},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"Casting the First Stone is one of the most realistic works of fiction I have ever read.

I knew that Curtis was going to get was coming to him, it was just a matter of when and by whom!I have already e-mailed my friends about this book and told them that they must put it on their list to read.Keep up the good work Kimberla Lawson Roby - I look forward to your next publication."},{"Title":"Casting the First Stone","review":"Casting the First Stone is one of the most realistic works of fiction I have ever read.

Hansen's research focuses on several families and how they care for their children, and make family life work. The end result is a book that demonstrates that American families rely on networks of care to perform the basic daily functions of family life. This is important for anyone examining society and the structures and institutions that exist within it.In American society we take pride in our emphasis on individualism; Hansen's book reveals that we are not who we are, or in the position we are in, without the assistance of others within our networks of care. This book is a must read for anyone interested in society, gender, class and the institution of the family in modern America."},{"Title":"Successful interventions with sex offenders: Learning what works","review":"Gombrich's book has a very specific purpose: he wants to tell the history of art as a continuous story, focusing on Western art and its gradual approach to the visual world. In strong contrast to most other art history texts, Gombrich's book has a thesis, and therefore an argument. In choosing among the various alternates (Janson, Gardner, Stokstad, etc.) it is important to bear this in mind. The size and compression of his book is not its salient feature from aphilosophic standpoint: it is the presence of an authorial voice, and a continuous narrative. Most other survey texts give up the ideal of coherent exposition in favor of a neutral descriptive voice and a fragmented &quot;story&quot; thatcontinuously interrupts itself in order not to lose any essential historical detail."},{"Title":"Successful interventions with sex offenders: Learning what works","review":"Having already been exposed to art history and criticism, I felt at times that this book was overly simplistic. (It was originally written for \\"young people\\" after all...) What was harder for me to appreciate were the frequent passages in which Gombrich gives vent to his own personal opinions (gushing on about Rubens for instance.) He makes a token effort to be objective but his Eurocentric bias toward the superiority of Classically-inspired Renaissance art is clear.However, as an introduction to Art History and Art Appreciation, you could do a lot worse. Gombrich is easy to read, he states himself clearly, he presents the history of art (in Europe) as a steady evolution of ideas, rather than a compartmentalized series of Eras & Styles as so many academic textbooks do. He selected illustrations that most effectively elucidate his point. Useful as his book is, it would be a mistake to treat him as a final authority on the subject. _The Story of Art_ is merely an INTRODUCTION to art. Once Dr. Gombrich has opened the door for you, you should leave him behind and continue your explorations on your own, or at least with a different guide. Form your own opinions; that's part of the experience of art.About the Pocket Edition specifically: The text is in the front (printed on very thin \\"Bible\\" paper) and the illustrations are in the back. Phaidon has provided two built-in ribbon bookmarks so you can keep your place in both sections. It's an interesting solution for making the book smaller. I can vouch for the fact that it's easy to carry around, since I took it with me on two trips while reading it, but the arrangement does have its drawbacks. Having to flip back & forth to look at the pictures as they are referred to in the text, and having to hold two places simultaneously while reading means that you have to use both hands. I like to read while I eat (yeah, I'm one of THOSE people) but found it was impossible with this edition. If portability and price are your top concerns, then this is the edition to get. Otherwise, shell out the extra $$ for the full-sized version."},{"Title":"Successful interventions with sex offenders: Learning what works","review":"Originally, Dr. Gombrich intended (in the 1940s) for this book to be read by high school students; or as he writes \\"young people.\\" Since then, The Story of Art became popular and his book mushroomed into several languages and editions. Because his language is non-fussy and non-scholarly, I have recommended this book to many non-artist friends; none of whom could get beyond the first few pages. So the reader may need some art background. But if you want to know why the Egyptians chose to draw as they did, or why Gothic art and architecture looks as it does (or \\"what's THAT all about?\\"), then this is the book for you. I have reread the book three times and may reread it one or two times more before I go to that great studio in the sky."},{"Title":"Successful interventions with sex offenders: Learning what works","review":"Originally, Dr. Gombrich intended (in the 1940s) for this book to be read by high school students; or as he writes \\"young people.\\" Since then, The Story of Art became popular and his book mushroomed into several languages and editions.

From the Stone Age to Picasso, *The Story of Art* is a lively and accessible survey of the products of mankind's urge to create. E.H. Gombrich does a stellar job of selecting those art-works--paintings, sculptures, and architecture--that he feels best exemplify the major movements in art and therefore tell a \`story' that continues to unfold so long as artists make art.This book was supposedly written for young people, but don't let that fool you into thinking *The Story of Art* is not a sophisticated and informative text that practically anyone will find rewarding. Gombrich's insights are easy-to-grasp but surprisingly illuminating. He deftly mixes history, religion, and biographical detail into his discussions which serve to help provide readers with a better understanding of what questions the artists of any given period were trying to answer with their art. For as Gombrich points out, art is a kind of ongoing conversation ((or story)) between the artists of different generations and the problems one group of artists solves creates a whole new set of problems for those who come after. To really understand art beyond the point of simply knowing what paintings you like illustrating your wall calendar, it's important to have some idea where an artwork fits into the grand scheme of things. It is the thread of this story that Gombrich follows in *The Story of Art* and it's his genius to pick out the essential plot-line with such lucidity and relative brevity.Although he died in 2001, *The Story of Art* effectively ends sometime in the early 1960s. There is some passing discussion of Lucien Freud and Hockney, but no mention of such seminal figures as Warhol, Lichtenstein, Rothko, deKooning, Bacon, or anyone after them. It's a little surprising inasmuch as Gombrich certainly had to be familiar with these artists, and its clear that someone like Warhol, for instance, is not just a passing fad. Still, one can find other, more detailed, not to mention more up-to-date books, about contemporary artists and art movements. Perhaps the greatest value of a book like *The Story of Art* is that it brings to life precisely the parts of the \\"art story\\" that aren't as familiar, or as often told. Those long centuries of Church-commissioned art or those weird-looking portraits of kids with the heads of middle-aged adults...they're also important chapters in the story of art and to understand where we are today it's important to know what happened back then. Where does El Greco fit in? Van Gogh? Why is Raphael important? To really understand art, you need to have an idea of where each artist fits into history's big picture-book and Gombrich's *The Story of Art* does exactly that.I highly recommend this book to art lovers and artists alike. Witty, entertaining, always informative, its like having an urbane and kindly grandfather lead you through a museum of mankind's most important art...and opportunity, in other words, not to be missed."},{"Title":"Successful interventions with sex offenders: Learning what works","review":"Five stars because Gombrich's text has all the virtues attributed to it by reviewers here and elsewhere, and because Phaidon has done a fine job of making the book it set out to make--a cheap, easily portable version. But in my opinion the reproductions are much too small; in many cases it is quite impossible (for these eyes, at least) to see in the pictures what Gombrich is talking about or to check with any confidence the plausibility of his statements. My advice would be to forget about portability and buy the full-size version."},{"Title":"Successful interventions with sex offenders: Learning what works","review":"My comment regards the pocket edition. The value of the book in general is widely known. But I was amazed by the splendid pocket edition. It is very handy, has very thin pages for the text and the images are all in the last section of the book. The letters are not too smal. There are two bookmarks, one for the text and one for the images which is very useful and cuuute at the same time. A handy guide in a handy size."},{"Title":"Successful interventions with sex offenders: Learning what works","review":"Gombrich's text is, of course, a classic. The size of the book and its price are huge benefits. The are, however, two catches that make it less than perfect. First, the text pages are amazingly thin. I'm worried that they might tear and it's possible to see the text on the other side, which is distracting. Second, the text all goes first and THEN all of the plates together at the end. I understand the necessity of this strategy but it does mean that one has to flip back and forth between the text and the plates. Otherwise, it's a wonderful book and an ideal introduction to art. Given the exceptional price, the drawbacks become trivial. As such, it's an ideal text."},{"Title":"Successful interventions with sex offenders: Learning what works","review":"This is a beautiful book with comprehensive text. It is written in common English that anyone should understand. I already have a copy I received as a gift and bought this copy for my grandaughter who will enter college this year to study Art History."},{"Title":"Successful interventions with sex offenders: Learning what works","review":"As many people have already reviewed this book, I will only say that from the beginning to the end, that is from the prehistoric period to late XXth century, it manages to give a clear idea of what masterpieces are, why they are considered masterpieces, who the great artists are and why they are considered great. Gombrich has a unique gift as an art historian: a concise, pedagogical, unpretentious style that appeals to the amateur reader and the broad public. The text constantly refers to the illustrations, which makes the reading even easier and entertaining."},{"Title":"Successful interventions with sex offenders: Learning what works","review":"Great read and I have no complaints about the seller. The book is a little bare, but its enough to get you very interested. It focuses a lot on the Italian Renaissance."},{"Title":"Successful interventions with sex offenders: Learning what works","review":"I purchased this book as an introduction to art history before taking a more comprehensive course and I have not been disappointed. With clear simple prose the author delivers his story of art, and the pictures accompanying the text are sharply reproduced. My only caveat is that the book would be more accurately titled \\"A Story of Western Visual Art\\" and I note that the author writes from a distinctively Western viewpoint."},{"Title":"Successful interventions with sex offenders: Learning what works","review":"For somebody interested in art, a book with many pictures is easy to read and enjoy."},{"Title":"Successful interventions with sex offenders: Learning what works","review":"The convenience of the pocket edition is incredible and the quality of the images and analysis is excellent."},{"Title":"Successful interventions with sex offenders: Learning what works","review":"The Story of Art is a classic introduction to the history of fine art.

The text comes up front, and all the plates are at the back. In my opinion, a terrible idea, mostly because the author refers CONSTANTLY to the plates.The publishers apparently realized there was a problem with this misorganization, because they supplied two ribbon book-markers -- one to mark your place in the text, and the other to mark your place in the plates.The result is a study in frustration, trying to keep both markers in place while trying to follow the author's discussion. In my case, updating the markers actually caused me to lose the thread of the discussion.How much better it is, to have the illustrations printed right alongside the text, which is the way the book has always been printed.Get the 16th edition and save your money."},{"Title":"Successful interventions with sex offenders: Learning what works","review":"Appreciate the \\"personal introduction\\" type of writing style. Enjoyed it myself, also as a great bed-time story telling choice for young kids."},{"Title":"Successful interventions with sex offenders: Learning what works","review":"This book was a happy surprise, I bought it used, and It looks like a book well kept by my mother. Its edition is from 1978, but it is in great shape, and having it feels like having a treasure. Could't be more satisfy if it was new."},{"Title":"Successful interventions with sex offenders: Learning what works","review":"This book does not only tell the history of art, at the same time, the history of architecture, since the two are so much interrelated. Therefore, as an architecture student, I recommend you guys to read this book to gain the knowledge of how art and architecture evolve throughout history."},{"Title":"Successful interventions with sex offenders: Learning what works","review":"This book is a great introductory tool. The overview is easy to read and gives you a good bird's eye view of the history of art from cave paintings down to the present. It also does a nice job of clear up much of the confusion about what is \\"Art\\" and tries to open up your senses to not being snobby about the subject. The strongest feature of the book is that half of it is actual plates that are referred to as the book goes on. An example might be how the author tries to show you the difference between Egyptian art during the Hyksos dynasty and its change during Akenaten. In the appendix, side by side, there will be reliefs or statuary of both that has been referenced in the text. It makes the work so much more interesting and meaningful to actually see examples of what the author is talking about. No more boring, dry art history. Highly recommend."},{"Title":"Successful interventions with sex offenders: Learning what works","review":"That may sound a bit strange, but this is a great book to take on the plane or train with you -- or even to the beach.It is a compact volume (though about 1 1/2 inches thick). Because of this compact format the text is in front (thin paper) with the plates in back. Phaidon provides two ribbon bookmarks. That also means that it is easiest to read using both hands.That said, Gombrich leads the reader along with a style somewhere between a conversation and a lecture -- more like what you might expect from a learned uncle or family friend. Pleasant delivery, but leaving you no doubts about the value of the information that is to be passed along.There may even be an advantage to having the plates in the back. I found myself dwelling on them perhaps a little longer than if they had been in with the text -- and the text calling for my attention.You can read this book in long sessions, or in little bits. It doesn't matter, because the information is always there, and in the case of this book, the journey itself is important.Enjoy."},{"Title":"Successful interventions with sex offenders: Learning what works","review":"This is a classic art history book, written in very clear, no-nonsense language, it's a really good starter for someone who has been scared away from museums by some art critics' cryptic aproach to art appreciation.Nice pocket edition. The paper is rather thin and needs to be treated carefully. All the pictures are in the back of the book and it requires you to go back and for from the text calls to the picture pages."},{"Title":"Successful interventions with sex offenders: Learning what works","review":"Perhaps there is a better one-volume overview of the history of art in the West, but I have not seen it yet.Professor Gombrich's work is already a classic, and it will forever remain one for a few simple reasons. It is written in a straight-forward and clear style, so it is accessible by young and old alike. His enthusiasm and utter command of his subject are infectious, and he gives the reader many insights into the different periods and movements of art.For example, he makes a compelling argument that Cezanne, Gauguin, and Van Gogh were the fore-fathers of modern art as we know it.When he makes comparisons to art movements over the centuries, the book is simply astounding. The plates are carefully selected by the author and serve as very telling samples. My only minor complaint: the paperback edition is somewhat flimsy and can easily tear apart for reasons unknown to me. But get this book and read it---your only regret will be that you didn't devour it sooner."},{"Title":"Successful interventions with sex offenders: Learning what works","review":"I've read a few \\"art 101\\" style histories, and this stands out as by far the best. The problem with most comprehensive histories is that each chapter is usually written by a different author. Consequently, they end up reading like encyclopedias rather than smooth narratives. Volumes like Gardner and Janson are big, impressive, authoritative, and richly illustrated, but reading them cover to cover tends to be a painful and boring labor. Not so with Gombrich, whose \\"Story of Art\\" truly reads like a story. Each chapter progresses nicely from the last, making reference to material already covered. The 400+ full page illustrations mean you know exactly what he's describing.It's worth noting that, with the exception of one chapter on Islamic and Chinese art, Gombrich covers western art almost exclusively. While this might be unsatisfying to some, I think sacrificing comprehensiveness is worth maintaining narrative flow.My only complaint is that all the illustrations are lumped together in the back of the pocket edition. This necessitates constant flipping back and forth while reading. I suppose the publisher had to do this to keep the price low and the size small, but it becomes tiresome pretty quickly."}]`),M={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:A},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:C,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},E={class:"card-container"},x=["disabled"],q={key:0},B={key:1};function D(n,o,s,u,r,i){const c=f("PoemCard");return e(),t("section",null,[o[1]||(o[1]=a("div",{class:"top-banner"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),a("div",E,[(e(!0),t(g,null,w(i.visiblePoems,(h,m)=>(e(),y(c,{key:m,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(e(),t("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:o[0]||(o[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(e(),t("span",B,"Loading...")):(e(),t("span",q,"See more"))],8,x)):p("",!0)])}const H=d(M,[["render",D],["__scopeId","data-v-c49a819f"]]),j=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"library/4.md","filePath":"library/4.md"}'),L={name:"library/4.md"},F=Object.assign(L,{setup(n){return(o,s)=>(e(),t("div",null,[b(H)]))}});export{j as __pageData,F as default};
