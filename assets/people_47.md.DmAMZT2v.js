Hopefully his satisfying work on BATMAN-NO MAN'S LAND, will (as it did me) lead people to his novels of Atticus Kodiak.Rucka's protaganist, Atticus Kodiak, is hired on to bodyguard a doctor at an abortion clinic and tries to get to the bottom of a series of threats against her. Ok. Enough plot. What makes this book satisfying and gripping are involving characters (sketched just enough to intrigue but leaving enough mystery to keep us interested), a nicely moving plot, as well as the best use of New York City since Lawrence Block. Fans of Spenser, Burke, and Elvis Cole will find a happy home here.And best of all? It's a series.A brief note: The subject of abortion is part and parcel of the story, and while the author clearly seems pro-choice, he takes special efforts not to demonize the other side save in depicting certain extemists drawn right from the headlines. Sensitively done."},{"Title":"Keeper","review":"Greg Rucka's prose is fluid and fine-edged, reminiscent of Lawrence Block's work in his Matthew Scudder series of novels minus the New York City grit that Block does so well.Atticus Kodiak, Rucka's protagonist is, if seemingly a little too young at 28, an engaging character with an interesting supporting cast, and his chosen profession, bodyguard, is vividly depicted. Rucka seems to be known for his research and he's apparently done his homework here as the overall scenario rings true.The story's backdrop, New York City at the height of the mid-90s anti-abortion protests and clinic bombings makes for a enthralling plot as Kodiak is charged with the protection of a pro-choice doctor. Rucka unself-consciously tackles the sticky politics of the situation, offering welcome shades of gray in what is often a black and white topic, while delivering a taut thriller that kept me on the edge of my seat through the end. An excellent first novel and I'm looking forward to reading the next one in the series."},{"Title":"Keeper","review":"Another private-eye type thriller with a difference, Keeper is a very entertaining debut novel that introduces Atticus Kodiak. Kodiak is a bodyguard, but specialises in the business, running his own company and employing his own team of professionals. It's an interesting take on the mystery theme that strays just far enough from the pack to make it unusually interesting reading.In his first outing, Kodiak and his employees are hired to protect a doctor who performs abortions. She is constantly harassed by protestors and the situation provides numerous difficulties for Kodiak to overcome. To top things off, she's due to speak at a conference in a couple of days where she will be left wide open for attack. It quickly becomes clear the danger she faces is most certainly real and Kodiak is going to be stretched to the limit if he's going to keep her safe.This is an excellent debut that comes across as very fresh. The bodyguard angle puts a new slant on the protection caper that is usually covered by police or FBI. The characters are likable and realistic and the action rolls along at great pace."},{"Title":"Keeper","review":"I can't believe I just discovered this author. I read this book, the first in the Atticus Kodiak series, in one sitting, and I bought exta copies to pass on to friends. I also bought all the other books in the series. I can't wait to read them!Keeper is a fast-paced, absorbing tale of a professional bodyguard and his efforts at protecting his latest client from fanatics who want to kill her. Kodiak is a believable modern hero, imperfect but doing his best to survive with integrity. The book should appeal to fans of the hard-edged thriller because the action sequences are exciting and plausible. Fans of the genre who insist on well-written characters and dialog will also be pleased with this book."},{"Title":"Keeper","review":"First in the series of &quot;bodyguard&quot; books starring Atticus Kodiak as the protagnist. Enough plot twists to keep my attention. Enjoyed plot line around abortion-definitely different - Would definitely recommend to any mystery fan!"},{"Title":"Keeper","review":"Given that the author was only 25 when he wrote this book, it's impressive for many reasons--not the least of which is his control of the characters (they're all highly original, particularly Bridgett, a PI unlike any other) and of the narrative. I've truly enjoyed the Atticus Kodiak series and recommend the books wholeheartedly."},{"Title":"Keeper","review":"Greg Rucka is a great writer. I loved this book. The characters are perfectly developed, the plot is engrossing and the pace is perfect. For the first time ever, I read past my bus stop, and I've been reading on the bus for ten years. A wonderful fast read."},{"Title":"Keeper","review":"Greg Rucka spun an interesting novel about bodyguarding a doctor who performs abortions in New York. While the right to choose/right to life subject is very touchy with most people, Rucka uses great care to acknowledge both sides without sermonizing either of them. This book also helps introduce many characters that resurface in his other books. While the end was somewhat predictable, 'Keeper' was overalla intense and great read."},{"Title":"Keeper","review":"I picked up Keeper out of curiosity and was hooked from the first chapter. It read quickly, but not for lack of substance. The plot was put together well, leaving you guessing right up to the end. The characters, especially Kodiak, were not unbelievable supermen, and were susceptable to pain and anguish. Rucka's story of a young man doing an ugly job was a great one, and a great debut. It wasn't just a mystery/suspense story. It also handled an extremely sensitive issue with the professionalism of a seasoned author. I applaude him for that and rank him right up there with Robert Parker and Ross Macdonald. I am anxiously awaiting his next book, Finder, and hope for many more Atticus Kodiak novels"},{"Title":"Keeper","review":"Keeper is the second novel I've read that deals with the issues involved in America's abortion debate. The first, Insomnia by Stephen King, dealt with the issues in a way that I found surprisingly insightful and somewhat even-handed. Insomnia was, like most of Mr. King's work, very character driven and it worked on many fronts--mostly those not dealing with the abortion debate. It got bogged down and seemed to throw the abortion issues into an already full pot.On the other hand, Keeper's drama centers on and stems from the abortion debate. Keeper is also somewhat even-handed (in the end, both Insomnia and Keeper tend more towards the pro-abortion side of things). Keeper is just as Character driven, but somewhat less engrossing than Insomnia (not to compare the two--they are really apples and oranges in all respects but the abortion).Keeper's main character is Atticus Kodiak--a bodyguard. He is the only fully drawn character in the book. Another character, a private eye named Bridget, almost comes to life as well, but only almost.We are drawn (first person narration) into Atticus's world. The strength and the hook of Keeper is our fascination with Atticus's life. Mine wasn't that strong for the first half of the book; yet he grew on me.Keeper is not really a whodunnit. Its a wedamnwellknowwhodunnit for most of its length. Keeper is more of a can-he-stop-it than a mystery.It is what it is with some hardbitten prose and dialogue torn from the pages of Elmore Leonard. I found it entertaining enough that I'll read the next book of the series (O God please let it not be about abortion this time) and report back here.Till then, this one gets more of a nod than a recommendation.(As a grim postscript and an aside--if, for some reason, you are interested in further aborti-fiction and want a piece from the opposing side of the debate, check out F. Paul Wilson's story Foet in the Borderlands 2 anthology. It is quite a nasty little piece, but well done--very well done)."},{"Title":"The Haccp Food Safety Manual","review":"This book is in bad need of updating. If I had known, I would not have bought it.

And what requirements do you suggest for safe in house catering."},{"Title":"p-adic Numbers: An Introduction (Universitext)","review":"This book really grabbed me on a number of points. First, in addressing a rather abstract topic (often not included in a basic undergraduate curriculum) it does a good job trying to compute concrete examples. It stays broad, as not to lose the reader on the messy details of any particular part of the theory. Hence the book is good even for students who are a little weak on their background. It is well-organized and exposed for an introductory-level text.In particular, its proofs are rather clear, concise, and meaningful. There are only a couple points where Gouvea uses trickery (a la Rudin) to prove things, and he is honest enough to warn before they come. Indeed, the footnotes are quite entertaining, especially for one who has read enough math books to catch his jokes. Overall, the read is casual. It is good for independent reading.The problems in the book are also worthy of praise. They are interspersed after proofs and in the middle of exposition, as ways to make sure the reader is following. Indeed, they are always pertinent and carefully planned. In addition, they point out ways in which mathematics authors often skip over details which the reader should actually verify for him/herself. Specifically, they perpare a student for reading graduate-level texts (which are notoriously full of this occurrence). Pedagogically, therefore, this is a very important tool, and useful book for a budding math student.Finally, for the graduate student who wants to go down the path of p-adics, Gouvea does a good job of pointing the reader in the several different directions the literature can guide him/her. He gives references to other texts, giving just a taste of their contents, throughout. His eye towards further study is keen.I must point out again that it is a joyful and entertaining read, in addition to being an exposition of a deeply fascinating (and deeply odd) area of math. This book, because of its clarity, its organization, its promotion of good mathematical reading skills, and its wonderful style occupies a spot on the very exclusive shelf of highest-quality texts in mathematics."},{"Title":"p-adic Numbers: An Introduction (Universitext)","review":"This is the best introduction-level mathematics textbook I have ever read, and I have read (and own) many. Every theorem and definition is well-motivated, and problems for the reader are interspersed within the text to make sure that every subtle nuance of the exposition is understood. Though introductory, Gouvea manages to incorporate some relatively advanced topics, (as far as undergraduate mathematics goes) such as the Weierstrass Preparation Theorem, local rings, and analysis in C_p. All this and the topic at hand is fascinating to boot. p-adic numbers are perfect for anyone wishing to pick up an amazingly interesting topic not found in most undergraduate or graduate courses. In conclusion, I recommend this book to the set of people interested in p-adic numbers, and its complement."},{"Title":"p-adic Numbers: An Introduction (Universitext)","review":"You're curious about beautifull topics in math, but reading a classical texbook, browsing through a list of lemma and therorems just get you sleep ? Read this one. The idea behind theorems, and why and how they came alive are so nicely exposed that this book can replace your favorite bed time one."},{"Title":"The Blue Door (Quilt Trilogy #3)","review":"When Amanda Videau is sent North to Lowell by her grandmother Abigal who is Nathenial Chelsmford's long, lost daughter she has many great adventures. I think this book really shows how talented Ann Rinaldi is and how she puts history in her books. The other books in the trilogy were good, but this was the best. It is a very good ending to the trilogy, but I think it would be neat if Ann Rinaldi wrote some more books to go to the trilogy."},{"Title":"The Blue Door (Quilt Trilogy #3)","review":"If the first two entries in this trilogy are any indication, one expects a brilliant third entry.

He lives in the south, a land of slavery, and his plantation is going bankrupt as no one wants to buy his west isle cotton. So, in an effort to generate income, he sends his \\"most sensible child\\" Amanda north to try to beg his grandfather to buy the cotton for his mill. With her she brings a bible, with an ancient family letter and a quilt pice that will identify her as Abagail's grand daughter.Along her journey north by steamboat she befriends two lovable sisters, one of whom is fleeing her abusive husband Nicolas. Nicolas is a dangerous man, and ion an effort to catch the girls he poses as a mechanic and in doing so causes an explosion, killing many. Prior to the accicent Amanda donned one of the sister's clothing to keep the girl hidden, and the bodies are recognized by clothing so Amanda is presumed dead. In the explosion Nicolas finds the quilt piece, and will use it to pretend to be the grandchild. Amanda, meanwhile, for protection and to try to convince her grandfather of her true identity, begins to work in a mill. Here she finds horrible conditions, worse than the slavery in the south. she had to choose whether to fight againsyt her family for mill-girl rights or try to sell them the cotton, that will allow them to continue to exploit the girls.Intriguin story with enough complexities to be intresting, but it's still easily understandable."},{"Title":"The Blue Door (Quilt Trilogy #3)","review":"Amanda Videau, the granddaughter of Abigail Chelmsford, who, in A Stitch in Time ran off to marry a Southerner, is sent up north to try to convince her great grandfather to buy Yamasse cotton.The Steamboat she is on explodes, killing most of the passengers.

If this is the first time you have read her please try something else, like A Break with Charity or Coffin Quilt both excellent books.

They were so good it something was shacking in the book you felt it too! This book has lots of characters! Some were good characters some were bad!

It's a quick read."},{"Title":"The Blue Door (Quilt Trilogy #3)","review":"This is not Ann Rinaldi's best work, though I enjoyed it for the story it has to tell. The author is much more enjoyable to read when she is writing about historical episodes. I have read seven of her books and rank this among the two I like least. For a good introduction of Ann Rinaldi's work, start with &quot;The Last Silk Dress,&quot; which I have read four times"},{"Title":"The Blue Door (Quilt Trilogy #3)","review":"Finally, this trilogy is at an end. What a sad, pitiful, disfunctional family. Even for a work of fiction this is stretching things a bit.

If you would like to see how the trilogy ends - get the book from the library, do not waste the money and purchase it."},{"Title":"The Blue Door (Quilt Trilogy #3)","review":"The Blue Door was a very good book, with great characters, but it was my least favorite of the trilogy. It seemed to me to be slower and I thought the characters were a little better developed in A Stitch in time and broken days. Still if you read the other ones this book is well worth your time! It does wrap up the trilogy very nicely."},{"Title":"The Blue Door (Quilt Trilogy #3)","review":"I hated this book. It had no plot, what passed for a plot was totally unbelievable.

Moreover, the CEOs had totally different characters and a completely different business vision. One was extrovert, overambitious, jealous, profoundly selfish, impulsive, volatile, dominated by lust for power, vindictive, an intriguer. The other was rather introvert, cold, too trusting, apersonal, a bad communicator, self-centered, rather an intellectual aristocrat.The introvert was ousted by the extrovert, who wanted to run his own show.The house of Lehman was divided in two different clans: the bankers who were rather fixed on medium and long term business with stable clients and the traders who were only fixed on the short term.While the introvert CEO could stand above both business divisions in the battle for the bonuses, the extrovert was himself a trader and was rather despised by the bankers. When the latter took the rein, key banking personal left the company. The traders wanted to cash in their shares as quickly as possible and the company was gobbled up by a third party.This story shows also that \`human relations matter as much as the bottom-line.'A very worth-while read."},{"Title":"Enhanced carbon monoxide screen test","review":"1. 1983, Glucksman's primary interest was in preserving Lehman's independence and his own position of power, which he might best achieve by selling 50 percent or less of the business. Glucksman pushed Peterson out and trading represented 2/3 profits for Lehman. Market volatility characterized 1983, with thirty billion shares changing hands. Lehman was transforming from bankers holding 60 percent of stock to increasing percentage held by the traders. 90 percent of the stocks were traded by pensions, mutual funds, ContiGroup, Bankers trust, American Express, and investment banks.2. Glucksman knew that Wall Street had changed. He knew that giant firms and money managers served as custodians of other peoples money and strove to maximize the return on their investment. Traders emerged to meet the demand. A trader buys and sells securities, bonds, options, stock, financial futures, commercial paper, certificates of deposit, treasury bills, and euro bonds for a fee or by gambling with the firms money. Make a market, buy, sell, and hedge, don't hesitate is the traders creed.3. What kind of investment banking did Lehman want to be? Investment banking had changed. As the nation industrializes the most important element of corporate life is financing. Few of the inventor-entrepreneur class understood how to raise capital; they had limited access to financial institutions, investment banks for whom they could raise critical capital. Maturation of American Industry, new management class, and broad capital markets reversed the factors. Marketing and high technology operations replaced finance as the elements of major concern for CEOs. Lehman's traditionally high-margin products had been reduced to commodities where price and distribution were more important in selecting a banker than historic and social relationships.4. Gustave Levy had made Goldman Sachs millions through the sell of commercial paper. Instead of borrowing money from a bank, corporations issued unsecured IOU loans, repayable in thirty days or more, for daily operations. Agents liked Lehman and Goldman Sachs collected a fee for placement of these IOUs with large investors. They also served an underwriting function , taking some of these accounts on their books to provide money for their clients. Underwriting means the agent inherit's the risk of default on their books, securing the loan, for their seller of the commercial paper and provide money to the buying client.5. From Oct 1983 through Feb 1984 income totaled $7.1 million compared with $87 million a year earlier. Michael Schmertzler reported, \\"Management does not anticipate that the environment in which it is operating will necessarily improve this fiscal year. Indeed, trading and distribution losses could lead to consolidated losses in net income in certain months\\". By 1973, Lehman's commercial paper had reached $496 million in sales. This was the beginning of woe. Glucksman, like other traders had began playing with the firms money, betting that interest rates would drop. Glucksman was investing Lehmans own capital in certificates of deposit and other commercial paper, rather than just selling this paper to investors. A derivative, a winner and a loser, if interest rates dropped than Lehman would be the winner realizing massive gains and the New York State Housing Finance Agency the loser. The derivate pattern would carry forward until 2008, until losses would force Lehman to bankrupt.6. Glucksman believed profits were best generated by expanding business, which meant confront every opportunity and having ample staff to do. In boom economies money is cheap, staffing ample, and profits easy.7. Peterson believed that the nations mounting deficits would drive interest rates up, cripple productivity growth, and the interest charges consumed over 10 percent of the federal budget. Peterson presented a plan to cut $175 billion in spending cuts and tax increase, for President Reagan to present to congress. The central message was that massive federal borrowing was consuming savings needed for investment in new plants and equipment, new infrastructure, and new jobs and training.8. Rising interest rates, coupled with a weak stock market and high overheads resulting from the 1982-83 boom, declining productivity, rising energy costs were depressing earning all over Wall Street. Brokerage houses were reporting losses in second quarter 1984: Merrill Lynch $32.8 million, Dean Whitter $25.8, and E.F. Hutton $7.8 million. Losses at Lehman forced the board to become anxious to sell the firm. The ultimate goal was find a buyer willing to pay $400 million for the company. Candidates included Shearson/American Express, E.F Hutton, and Paine Webber. Shearson's business was retail brokerage with individuals, and communications was mostly across telephone and teleprinter wires. Peter Cohen wanted Lehman. Lehman's strength was in banking, fixed-income trading, and dealer for US government securities. Shearson strength was cutting costs, 1984 saving $7.4 million.9. In 1984, American Express was financial service power house earning $10 billion a year, reaching 130 countries.10. March 1983, Lehman showed a lose of $5.5 million. The first six months operating and trading losses was $30 million. In 1984, Breckers fixed-income division had lost $27 million before being forced to sell to Merrill Lynch. The firm had invested heavily in securities gambling that interest rates would fall. The opposite was true as fed man Volker raised rates to fight inflation. Mark to market technique priced the current worth of securities in their portofolios. Lehman did not mark to market their short-dated money market securities, euro certificates of deposit, therefore, it was to Lehman's advantage to buy long-term securities with lower-cost short-term borrowings, thereby creating a current profit on the carry. The only risk was that the overnight interest rate would go higher than the interest rate on the longer-dated security.11. Shearson offers $325 million for the purchase of Lehman and Lehman accepts the offer."},{"Title":"Enhanced carbon monoxide screen test","review":"This story of greed and glory is one that has been acted out in all types of businesses - large or small, service or product, new or old.

I picked it up on a whim an it has truly been a Godsend. This book is full of REAL LIFE examples of the things we moms (including the authors) do to our families that can really hurt our relationship with them. I'm not talking about mental or physical abuse - though this book does help with that a little. I'm talking about when you've yelled at your kids for the 82th time to close the cupboard door or to pick up their toys or listen to the whining about how \\"IT'S NOT FAIR!\\" day after day after day. This book can really help a mom cope with these daily issues.It also covers how we as moms can learn to accept ourselves for who we are - not who we think we should be - i.e. Supermom. It's very God focused but not in a preachy way. Trust me, this is coming from someone who loves the movie \\"Dogma\\" and who has not gone to church for the majority of her life.

In many books this is a real bonus as you feel half transported, half in another world and that juxtaposition of feelings works to create a certain frisson. In many books, that is, but not necessarily this one because the fog of war, or more likely the fog from which these tales came from, is fairly impenetrable and you find yourself trying desperately to remember why a person in a tale is important. Not to mention the fact that many of these tales seem too touched by the hand of the latter day romance writers who have not done any real favours to anybody here.Having said that I would wholeheartedly recommend this to anybody with an interest in such Arthurian cycles or related classics as you will find yourself in possession of a range of new stories even though this is touted as a Welsh epic. I guess my main beef with this product is that I'd just read Parzival and the Nibelungenlied prior to this and their more cutting - literally! - story lines and far more reality based feel left me feeling a little cold to many of these short tales that seemed at times to have little flow on narrative or real artistic worth."},{"Title":"The Mabinogion","review":"This edition reads like it was translated word-for-word from the original middle welsh.

So I had high expectations for the Mabinogion.Unfortunately, the book failed to live up to them. Out of the eleven mostly unrelated stories included in this volume, only a few really held my interest. In a work like this you expect an episodic, somewhat repetitive story, but the Mabinogion takes this to the extreme. A few of the stories are practically parodies of Arthurian romance; for example, \\"How Culhwch Won Olwen.\\" In this story, the hero meets the heroine and is told that he must complete thirty-nine tasks to win her. The rest of the story consists of an account of the completion of these tasks, most of which don't rate more than about a sentence; plus a five-page list of all the knights of Arthur's court who helped him. Expanded to full length, this might be interesting, but as it stands it's about as exciting as reading Cliff's Notes. In addition, the Mabinogion's humor often falls flat, especially when compared with the Icelandic epics.The Penguin Classics edition seems to be well-translated and well-annotated, but the book itself didn't hold my interest.

Different, but quite good for readers who enjoy Celtic legends. THE MABINOGION will definitely entertain this select audience.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Mabinogion","review":"A strange little book of Welsh fairy tales. It's not to everyone's taste, but to those who like the strange and historic, it's fun and fascinating."},{"Title":"The Mabinogion","review":"The publishing history of this edition, and its relationship to other translations of what is commonly known as \\"The Mabinogion,\\" is a little complicated, and I think that is worth clearing up, although it may be a little tedious. However, my explanation of it should serve as \\"buyer's guide\\" if you are hesitating over exactly what to order.In 1948 the Golden Cockerel Press issued an \\"edition-de-luxe\\" of translations from Medieval Welsh prose tales, made by Gwyn Jones and Thomas Jones, under the title of \\"The Mabinogion.\\" This was the direct ancestor of the present Everyman volume. The translators, besides sharing a common Welsh name, were both distinguished academics: Thomas Jones was Professor of Welsh at Aberystwyth, and Gwyn Jones was Professor of English at Aberystwyth and Cardiff.This title of the book was, as the translators pointed out, an erroneous form, a mere scribal error turned into a comprehensive title for stories with quite diverse histories. It was established in the public mind in the nineteenth century by Lady Charlotte Guest, who issued the first complete English translation of the stories, with Welsh texts, published in seven volumes, 1838-1845. The English text and notes of the shorter 1848 edition of her version had been included in the \\"Everyman's Library\\" series since 1906. This fat (432 pages) little volume furthered its position with the literary public interested in Welsh matters, general Celtic literature, or Arthurian stories, despite enormous advances in Welsh studies in the intervening century before the Jones and Jones translation. (I have separately reviewed some of its recent editions, with more on the translator's remarkable life.)A more accurate translation by T.P. Ellis and J. Lloyd, \\"The Mabinogion: A New Translation,\\" had been published by Oxford University Press in 1929, and seems to have made little impact. (One wonders: did the Depression play a role?) It had some useful annotations, and I have often wondered why it has never been reprinted, while Guest has gone into a variety of fuller or shorter versions (including the stories-only Dover Thrift edition, and one, apparently with the notes, illustrated by Alan Lee) of her bowdlerized and otherwise truncated rendering. Ellis and Lloyd continued to use Guest's title, and omitted one story, \\"Taliesin,\\" a practice which Jones and Jones followed with no clear explanation. (I will offer one below.)Otherwise, the narrative contents of all three of these translations are the same. They contain stories in four categories. (Note that preferred spellings of proper names vary, and I have not tried to be fully consistent.)First, \\"The Four Branches of the Mabinogi,\\" from which the collective title was derived, consisting of \\"Pwyll, Prince of Dyved,\\" Branwen Daughter of Llyr,\\" \\"Manawydan Son of Llyr,\\" and \\"Math Son of Mathonwy.\\" These begin with a story about the conception and birth of Pwyll's son, Pryderi, whose death is one of the early events in the \\"Fourth Branch,\\" and concern a variety of heroes, and what are clearly rationalized gods. (Evangeline Walton turned each of the \\"Four Branches\\" into a novel; and other writers have done versions of one or another of them.)Second, there are two \\"native tales,\\" \\"The Dream of Maxen Wledig\\" and \\"The Story of Lludd and Llevelys,\\" about Roman (\\"historical\\") and pre-Roman (\\"mythical\\") Britain as imagined by the medieval Welsh. The 'Lludd\\" text, as we have it, actually belongs to the \\"Chronicle\\" tradition launched by Geoffrey of Monmouth's supposed translation from an \\"ancient British book.\\" (Which, if any part of it ever had any existence, was NOT the \\"Mabinogion.\\") \\"Maxen\\" seems to reflect an even more garbled version of a story known to Geoffrey, compounding several real people.Third are two Arthurian stories in native Welsh mode. \\"Culhwch and Olwen,\\" is an elaborate quest, dragging in, at least by name, most of the gods and heroes traceable in Welsh material, and some of their Irish cousins into the bargain, mostly as part of Arthur's court. \\"The Dream of Rhonabwy\\" is a visionary encounter with Arthur and his warriors (and anything else I could say would probably be controversial); a fascinating text, which almost boasts of its authentically dreamlike obscurity.Fourth are three \\"Romances,\\" \\"Owain\\" (otherwise known as \\"The Lady of the Fountain\\"), \\"Peredur son of Evrawc,\\" and \\"Gereint the Son of Erbin,\\" the first and last of which are clearly versions of Chretien de Troyes' Old French Arthurian Romances, \\"Yvain\\" and \\"Erec,\\" while the second is related in a more complex manner to his unfinished and problematic \\"Perceval le Gallois.\\" These seem to illustrate Celtic materials going out into wider European society, and then flowing back into Wales to enrich (and confuse) the native heroic and mythic tradition with ideas of chivalry.The story missing from these two later translations, as well as a third version from 1976, was published by Charlotte Guest as \\"The Tale of Taliesin,\\" although it is also found in some manuscripts as two separate tales. Although attested rather late, there are Irish parallels, and its tradition would seem to belong very much with the \\"native tales\\" like the \\"Four Branches of the Mabinogi\\" and \\"Culhwch.\\" There seems to have been a real Taliesin, an early medieval poet, to whom much later poems were also attributed, but this story-complex has more to do with the myths about the nature of poetry. (It is also behind Thomas Love Peacock's comic novel, \\"The Misfortunes of Elphin,\\" and quite a bit of modern fantasy literature.)Fortunately for those of us who do not read medieval Welsh, Everyman's Library retired the lovely, but unreliable (and textually dubious) Guest translation, replacing it with Jones and Jones in 1949 (J.M. Dent and Sons, Ltd., London, and E.P. Dutton & Co., Inc., New York). This was an inexpensive and readily-available edition, which included a set of textual notes. Confusingly, it kept the old series number (97), which can lead to problems when ordering used copies. It was frequently reprinted, sometimes with emendations including a reissue in 1974 with Supplementary Textual Notes. This preserved the old pagination, which was frequently cited in discussions of the stories, but made it necessary to check the Supplement to be sure of the translators' most recent conclusions. It appeared with more revisions, additions, and a welcome Index of Proper Names in 1989. There were paperback editions (No. 1097) with at least two different covers, one lovely, one, to my mind, merely garish.Finally, in 1993, with Dent now part of the Orion Publishing Group, and Charles E. Tuttle as the American publisher, it was reset for the Everyman Paperback Classics, with the changes to the translation smoothly incorporated, and the Textual and Supplementary Textual Notes in what seem to be their final forms. Gwyn Jones was still alive to work on these revisions, now with the collaboration of his wife, Mair Jones. The new pagination makes it harder to locate older references to passages; I have held on to my copies of older printings for this reason. Why go flipping through pages when I can look up the reference directly, and then find the corresponding section in a few seconds?There is also a hardcover edition with a Preface by John Updike, published under the Borzoi imprint in 2001 (not seen). However, as the 1993 / 2001 text is the translator's final, preferred, revision, it is important to know that there is a difference -- especially if you are ordering it used. The 1974 text still had, besides the 44-page introduction, 283 pages. The 1993 edition, and its reprintings, are in a slightly larger format, and have a 32-page introduction, and 240 pages of main text.Jones-and-Jones is in almost every way superior to the Guest translation, and is readily available; the lack of the \\"Taliesin\\" material, and of comparable, but modern, annotations, are its only failings. It has two modern competitors. One is the Penguin Classics \\"Mabinogion,\\" translated by Jeffrey Gantz. The English of this translation is more modern, and some prefer it. I find Gantz's decisions on spelling some of the Welsh names rather strange; and some students of Welsh think that some of them are hard to justify. Of more importance to most readers will be his decision to give many of the names, particularly in the long lists of champions, their wives, dogs, horses, and swords, in \\"Culhwch,\\" in the original Welsh. That sounds normal enough, but they are often intended to be understood as nicknames, whose meaning should be transparent, not meaningless, and some are even funny (\\"Big-bone, daughter of Strength\\"). Gantz consistently translates them in footnotes, which is highly distracting. In many cases, putting the Welsh text there for those who need it would have kept the main text easier reading, and looking less like the \\"begats\\" in \\"Genesis\\" and \\"Numbers.\\".The other alternative -- which I would suggest getting as a supplement to either, if not, indeed, as a first choice -- is Patrick K. Ford's \\"The Mabinogi and Other Medieval Welsh Tales.\\" It drops the French-influence Romances, the enigmatic \\"Rhonabwy,\\" and \\"The Dream of Maxen,\\" but gives a clear and vigorous rendering of the Welsh material, with an excellent introduction and notes. Ford not only did away with the persistent \\"Mabinogion\\" mistake in the title, he also included \\"Taliesin,\\" based on the text he had re-edited from manuscripts, and restored to its two-story version, as \\"The Tale of Gwion Bach\\" and \\"The Tale of Taliesin.\\"It seems that Ellis and Lloyd and Jones and Jones, knew that Charlotte Guest's text for the story (with poems) had passed through the hands of the notorious Iolo Morganwg. He was a pioneering scholar who didn't hesitate to *invent* the evidence to support his theories, and they had preferred not to plunge into that thicket. Nor had anyone else. Unfortunately, the Guest version had been worked over by Robert Graves for his brilliant, and absurd, \\"The White Goddess,\\" and a reliable version for non-Celticists was more than overdue. Ford's text edition was of value for another reason; there are close parallels between the stories of Gwion and the boyhood of the Irish hero Fionn (Finn McCool), investigation of which certainly needed a proper edition of the Welsh version to work from.As an added bonus, Ford included as an appendix a translation of the notoriously difficult \\"Cad Goddeu,\\" or \\"Battle of the Trees,\\" also found in Guest's notes. It too had been given a splendid, and absurd, interpretation in terms of the Irish Ogham script by Robert Graves, who demonstrated his profound lack of knowledge of Welsh, and equally deep understanding of Irish. (He actually \\"improved\\" and re-ordered the translation he was using, without reference to the original....) Ford doesn't claim to understand its \\"real meaning,\\" if any, only what it actually says, and it is very nice to have it. (By the way, \\"The Battle of the Trees\\" seems likely to have been in Tolkien's mind, along with Birnam Wood coming to Dunsinane, when writing of the Siege of Orthanc.)There is a growing secondary literature about the \\"Mabinogion\\" stories, ranging from the excellent but technical, to the trivial, to the seriously erroneous (Graves is not alone!). Gwyn Jones himself contributed an excellent, and readable, analysis of \\"Culhwch and Olwen,\\" in his book \\"Kings, Beasts, and Heroes\\" (1972), where it joins \\"Beowulf\\" and \\"Hrolf Kraki's Saga\\" (Jones having also translated the latter)."},{"Title":"The Mabinogion","review":"Jeffrey Gantz's translation of The Mabinogion is not only the most readable to the modern man, unlike Guest, he doesn't delete passages thought &quot;indelicate&quot; by Victorian society. This is the best representation of these Welsh classics, and includes Gantz's own study of the mythology of these texts, a book in it's own right, as a prologue and at the beginning of each tale. A must for every library."},{"Title":"The Mabinogion","review":"The Mabinogion is an excellent collection of Welsh Celtic myths/legends. Certain tales are difficult to follow because of a large cast of characters and long list of events/deeds. Nevertheless, the Mabinogion portrays Celtic (Welsh) mythology well. There is an excellent summary of each tale, a guide to pronunciation of names and a map of the region. Together with the tales, these additions make this book exciting and easily accessible."},{"Title":"The Mabinogion","review":"Gantz has created a modern, readable translation of these eleven Welsh classics. Although they come from the same oral tradition and were captured on paper around the same time (1200s to 1400s), they are rarely related to each other. Each story has its unique character, like page after page of people named in 'How Culwch won Owen'. 'The Dream of Rohanbwy' likewise seems to be a listing of colored arms and costumes so detailed that the writer say, \\"no one ... knows The Dream without a book because of the many colors.\\"Others of these tales are much more interesting for their relatioships to other parts of the mythos of the British isles. 'Peredur son of Evrawg' is variant of the Parsival story, with close parallels in many of its particulars. The Mabingion also retells some of the earliest known tales in the Arthurian canon. 'Gerient and Enid,' for example, is founded in the Arthur mythology. It's founded on the notions of knightly honor and chivalry, but with a primitive and harsh interpretation of the ethos.There are other glimpses of early Celtic times, as well. One that struck me, in two different passages, was a telling of some great feast, where the doors were closed to all comers once the feasting began. All comers, that is, except a \\"king of a lawful dominion or a craftsman who brings his craft.\\" Later in that story (Culwch), the bouncer isn't told to let the kings in, only the craftsmen. This is a vivid display of their high regard for skilled work, something that sounds strange to a modern ear. I think less of the modern ear for thinking so little of such skills.Not all translations of the Mabinogion are created equal. Reading another translation, I foundered on obsolete, Elizabethan language injected to make the stories seem archaic. This one uses contemporary language, as bards in a living oral tradition would have done, to create a smooth and readable collection.//wiredweird"},{"Title":"The Mabinogion","review":"The Mabinogion is a collection of ancient Welsh mythlogical tales.

Overall, a fascinating read. Well worth a purchase."},{"Title":"The Mabinogion","review":"Eleven Welsh tales written in the 13th century based on older oral versions which probably date back to pagan times. The quality and coherence of the tales varies. Some of them are well-told with good narrative flow and consisent, well-defined characters. Others are a confused jumble of seemingly random incidents which end abruptly with major conflicts still unresolved. Jeffrey Gatz's translation is plain and readable; nowhere near as murky or as dry as some translated \\"classics\\" I have struggled through. I noticed a slight change in tone from the gentle Celtic lilt in the first half of the book, to frequent use of Beowulf-like compounds (\\"ferocious-bold\\" \\"venomous-painful\\" \\"fierce-powerful\\" etc) in the Arthurian tales of the second half. Could it be that in the Arthurian romances, an intentionally archaic style was used by the writer? Dr. Gantz doesn't specifically mention this, though he does say that some of the vocabulary in the Mabinogion was obsolete even at the time it was written. An air of mystery and magic pervades all the stories.The tales of the Mabinogion were paraphrased by T.W. Rolleston in his _Celtic Myths and Legends_, 1917 (still available from Dover,) so I was already somewhat familiar with them when I read them. The full versions are much better, and being already familiar with the plot did not diminish my enjoyment at all. The Mabinogion has many parallels with Irish myth and legend. It also contains some of the earliest versions of tales from the King Arthur mythos (even a primitive, very understated version of the Grail legend!) \\"The Dream of Rhonabwy\\" (placed by Gantz in the middle of the book to serve as a transition from the mythological tales to the Arthurian tales) contains one of the best contemporary descriptions of Medeival squalor I have ever read. You can almost smell the filth and feel the discomfort of Rhonabwy and his companions as you read the opening passages of this tale.Gantz's introductory materials are brief and to the point. He provides a general introduction at the beginning which gives the historical background of the Mabinogion and puts it into its literary perspective alongside the French romances. There are a few paragraphs before each tale which provide background information pertinent to that particular story."},{"Title":"The Mabinogion","review":"Before you step into anything by Lawhead, Zimmer-Bradley, or yet another retelling of Arthurian legends, THIS is the book you should read first. This is also the edition that is used as a coursebook in Celtic Civilisation lectures at the University of Glasgow, so it is probably one of the better translations out there.Aside from the fact that the best place to learn about Celtic mythology and folklore is from the myths themselves, (Why bother looking around for someone to 'speak for the Celts' when they are perfectly capable of speaking for themselves -- indeed, have centuries of tradition in doing so?) the Four Branches of the Mabinogi are entertaining in and of themselves. Rhiannon isn't a glitter-infested fairy queen nanny of New Age construction -- she's a snarky, quick-witted lady who oftentimes finds herself coming to the rescue of her dull-witted husband, Pwyll. Arthur invokes the anger of his closest knight, Cai, (Kay) by making up a parody song on the spot -- and Cai storms off in a huff.Although removed from present culture by centuries, the tales within the Mabinogi touch on a chord of familiar human experiences through lively tales and engaging characters who are not at all so different from ourselves."},{"Title":"The Mabinogion","review":"And pick up the Mabinogion!

Its title is an erroneus one, a word invented by Lady Charlotte Guest who first translated all these tales into English but it has stuck to the collection.Only the story of Taliesin is for some reason omitted from Gynn Jones and Thomas Jones' translation.Chronologically, according to subject matter, the story of &quot;Lludd and Llefelys&quot; comes first, which explains in passing the dragons which were later to uncovered by Ambrosius in Nennius' _Historia Brittonum_ and by Merlin according to still later accounts.But in order of presentation the book presents first the Mabinogi proper, _Mabinogi_ possible meaning 'Hero Tale'. The four tales of the Mabinogi supposedly take place in Britain just before the attempted invasion by Julius Caesar and Cassibelaunus who was historically Caesar's main opponent appears here as Caswallawn son of Beli. But we know from other sources that many of the characters presented here as great lords and chieftains and kings of that era were earlier gods worshipped in Gaul or Ireland or both.Rhiannon (whom Pwyll gains as wife in the first branch) is the goddess known from Latin inscriptions in Gaul as Rigatona. Manawydan is the Irish god Manannan also known as the god of the Isle of Man. In the third branch the young and rather inactive prince Lleu is the Irish Lugh and Gaulish Lug, the most important god of the Celtic pantheon. What we are told of him here has very little relation to what is told of him in surviving Irish tales.Who can know what these beings meant to the anynomous teller of these tales and how much is based on genuine pagan tradition and how much on inventive story telling based on stock motifs?The second half of &quot;Math son of Mathonwy&quot; is easily recognizable as a variant of the second half of the ancient Egyptian &quot;Tale of Two Brothers&quot;, commonly called the oldest extant fairy stale.&quot;The Dream of Macsen Wledig&quot; is a legendary version of the career of the historical Magnus Maximus. But perhaps its connection of Magnus Maximus by marriage to a particular British noble family located at Carnarvon is historical.&quot;Culhwch and Olwen&quot; is arguably the most unrestrained and wildest heroic tale preserved in any language. The legendary Arthur and his men must undertake twelve great tasks which themselves require numerous subtasks. Chief of these tasks is the hunting of the great boar Twrch Trywth to obtain the comb and shears that lie between his ears.In style this tale is like wonder tales perserved in Gaelic about Finn Mac Cumahail and his warriors but it goes even beyond these, perhaps intended as a parody of that kind of tale, but a parody by one who loved what he was parodying.&quot;The Dream of Rhonabwy&quot; tells of a mysterious vision by a medieval dreamer of Arthur and other heroes of the British heroic age of the fifth and sixth and early seventh centuries haunting still the British soil. The meaning of the violent board game between Arthur and Owein is unknown.Last follow three knightly Arthurian romances influenced obviously by French material which tell tales already known through the French verse of Chr&eacute;tien de Troyes, though &quot;Peredur son of Efrawg&quot; provides additional episodes and a conclusion not found in the French. It seems that the Welsh nobles for whom such tales would have been written were turning away from the native traditions of Arthur and their native heroes in favor of the more sophisticated French reworkings.Little else survives. This slim volume sadly contains almost all that remains of idigenous medieval Welsh tales in prose. Enjoy it in sadness at its smallness."},{"Title":"The Mabinogion","review":"This book is a collection of some of the best-preserved, non-Irish Celtic stories, which makes it a valuable resource for anyone studying Celtic literature and culture.

At the Foothills Veterinary Clinic he meets an odd staff.Also at the clinic he learns about a recent nearby homicide, but thinks that is far less a murder count from where he used to live. After nearly dehydrating, only to be rescued by Pine County Clinic DVM Dr. Laura Nakai, Dale and Sully find a corpse near their home. The victim John Heflinger apparently drowned in an arid drought infested backyard. The Midwest transplant informs the cops, but tries to ignore the incident until he realizes that he, his canine, and the eccentric crew at the Foothills Veterinary Clinic are at risk from a determined killer.NOSE FOR TROUBLE is a lighthearted funny amateur sleuth tale starring a caring individual who seems to land in one doo-doo droppings after another in spite of his knowing to watch where he steps. The eccentric support cast, mostly those working at the clinic, Laura, and Sully, finds themselves in amusing predicaments that will have the audience laughing out loud. Still this is clearly Dale's tale as he tries to start anew, but trouble seems to be his magnet.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Five Star First Edition Mystery - Nose For Trouble","review":"This is a charming tale from a new voice in mystery. Fans of Durgin will be delighted to read Dale and Sully's first adventure.

Wow, another great book from Doranna. The story grabbed ahold of me from the beginning and it just got better from there. Seeing the story not only from Dale's POV, but also his Beagle Sully was creative and really brought the characters to life for me. I look forward to seeing more Dale and Sully stories in the future."},{"Title":"Five Star First Edition Mystery - Nose For Trouble","review":"I enjoyed this book, as I have enjoyed all of Durgin's books about animals, starting with Dun Lady's Jess. I keep them around and reread them occasionally. I also liked the sequel to Nose for Trouble, Scent of Danger. I hope Durgin will write more in this series and bring them out in paperback form. I am not into romances, and I think Durgin's thrillers are less successful than the animal books and fantasies."},{"Title":"Five Star First Edition Mystery - Nose For Trouble","review":"I guess I did like this book, and hey, cute dog... gotta love that. But I felt like the author was in a horrible storm, and half her manuscript blew away, kind of randomly. But she turned the other half in, and they published it at a VERY large price for such a small book. But I just kept feeling confused throughout the book. (and he did NOT come from the east coast. Farms in Ohio don't count as the east coast). The book ended, and I was still confused, with few loose ends cleared up. I feel irritated that I was cheated out of some really good stuff. Oh well. Other reviews seemed to love this book, but I'm suspicious of their motivation. All that said, I liked the guy and the girl, and loved the dog. Makes for a decent read, but no way was it 4 or 5 stars.PS. Add extra points if you like hearing the dog's point of view.

I would read a whole book at one sitting.2 of the books I read in one day. But book #8 and this book I had to force myself to finish; especially this book.I have a real problem with Christopher Braxton. He has alot ofemotional baggage. Even though I believe it was a good idea to wait until Corrie and Christopher knew each for 2 years before they got married and I do not believe working for your future father-in law is the answer. He should have been out there looking for a way to support his future wife and family. But the author never really dealt with Christopher's jealousy over the fact that Corrie could command an audience when Christopher did not have that talent. I have not read the next book and I do not plan to, but I can not help but believe the real reason he wants to move east is so he will not have to compete with the Hollister's well-respected reputation in Miracle Springs."},{"Title":"Joshua: An Introduction and Commentary (Tyndale Old Testament Commentaries)","review":"Helpful background information coupled with insightful theological reflections for contemporary readers.

It is a &quot;must read&quot; for any youth minister. Mercadante integrates a variety of personal stories into the reading as a way to illustrate his points. The stories, worksheets, and tools enable this book to not only be a &quot;how to&quot; book, but a reference manual as well. After reading it through to understand the big picture, I have often pulled it out as my first point of reference for such topics as &quot;getting started,&quot; &quot;evaluating a current ministry,&quot; and &quot;developing large and small group evangelistic settings.&quot; Since using Growing Teen Disciples, it is clear to see why Mercadante is viewed as one of the experts on developing successful youth ministries."},{"Title":"Growing Teen Disciples: Strategies for Really Effective Youth Ministry","review":"I've read Make it Real and Positively Dangerous. I also read Purpose Driven Youth Ministry(PDYM). The similarity with PDYM even extends to the font used. As such, may I suggest making this, the first book you read.Without detracting from the great work he has done I just want to note that on p 117, Frank seems to make no distinction between Protestant term 'evangelism' and the Catholic term 'evangelisation'. But there is a difference. Evangelisation, as the Catholic Church understands it, \\"is a complex process made up of varied elements: the renewal of humanity, witness, explicit proclamation, inner adherence, entry into the community, acceptance of signs, apostolic initiative\\" (On Evangelisation in the Modern World #24). Thus, evangelisation is the entire mission of the Church, under which evangelism or proclamation is just one of its aspects."},{"Title":"Growing Teen Disciples: Strategies for Really Effective Youth Ministry","review":"Frank Mercadante is superb.

I own 60+ Kennedy books and had always wanted to purchase this one. Maude Shaw was with the Kennedy family from 1957-1965. She was the only person to live in the same home as Jacqueline and John Kennedy for an extended period of time.

He concedes that the universe is expanding, but his premise is that new matter is being created as the old matter recedes. Therefore, the overall appearance of the universe remains constant over time.In this book, Hoyle presents a popular description of the structure of the universe, beginning with the Earth and moving outward through the solar system and to the universe in general. His presentation is well within the grasp of readers that do not have a sound knowledge of astrophysics, yet the age of the book means that much more is now known. The evidence gathered since this book was published is overwhelmingly in favor of the \\"big bang\\" theory of the origin of the universe; few people now even mildly support the steady-state theory.Therefore, this book has largely been rendered a historical relic; the passage of scientific time has rendered much of it archaic."},{"Title":"Calypso Magic","review":"I loved this book but then I like all of Catherine Coulters' books.

It was funny and entertaining. Although I admit, I liked Midsummer Magic better. I can't wait for Moonspun Magic to come out!! I recommend this for people who have read Midsummer Magic!!"},{"Title":"Calypso Magic","review":"I will not deny that the story is set up excellently with so much promise in its plot, unfortunately in the end it fails to deliver. Quite a few characters were introduced and slightly developed that did nothing to contribute to the story, like the mistress and the 'old monk'.Characters introduced from other books seem thrown in purely to promote their respective books. For example you learn nothing about why Captain Rafael 'isn't just any ship captain sailing the seven seas.' He just very helpfully shows up, contributes a few cleverly placed lines and then disappears.The culmination of the story is an unbelievable dues ex machina, involving a sudden manifestation of 'insanity.' Its like a bad soap opera. There's a poisoning incident where, even at the end of the book, you still don't know who did it nor why!Sadly, I've read children's books better written than this novel and entirely regret buying it. I give it 2 stars only because the beginning was so promising and I did enjoy it, until I reached the unsatisfactory end that left me frustrated."},{"Title":"Calypso Magic","review":"i have not read calypso magic,vegas rich or heartbreak ranch as yet. catherine coulter and fern michaels have never disappointed me yet"},{"Title":"Calypso Magic","review":"I wouldn't describe myself as a big fan of Ms. Coulter's but after enjoying the first book in this series, I was looking forward to this one.

The hero of the story spanks, then fondles the heroine. Then later nearly rapes the heroine, while she is saying no.

These being her \\"Aunt\\" Lucia and cousin Lyonel/Lyon.Lyon has been recently disappointed in love by a faithless woman and is now a proclaimed woman-hater. Diana goads him constantly, and he shocks her with outrageous innuendos, but he insists he really wants nothing to do with her.During the course of their adventures they encounter a mysterious sea captain, Diana's family (which brings with it an excellent mystery), and great sex.Catherine Coulter has a way of making more of her secondary characters and I get a kick out of Aunt Lucia and her secret. You'll have to read and find out. She'll have a special place in your heart.I enjoy romance novels that don't just take place in one geographical setting and this one takes you from England, to the sea, to the West Indies. It has good little tidbits of historical info, but it's really the riotous banter that goes on between Lyon and Diana that keeps me hooked. I can pick it up anytime and not be bored!"},{"Title":"Calypso Magic","review":"This is the second book in the Magic Trilogy.

Enjoy the baiting and the arguements between the two, as Lady Lucia pushes them together, although they are both against marriage. Follow the twists of Coulter's writing, as they are marooned on a ship, without an escort, left on an abandoned island, and are forced to marry....although, now, it is just Diana who is against marriage (a nice change!). Take in the sights of Savarol Island, and get involved in the murders and the mystery found there. This is a good story, but I especially enjoyed the mystery of whodunnit.

Based on the many great reviews for Calypso Magic, I expected a great read. Her writing style is very strong - her characters come alive, the places described seem very real, and the dialogue is smart and witty. The heroine was a strong character and most of the characters were well depicted. However, I felt this story descended very rapidly into drivel as the hero/heroine started off on their voyage. The hero beats the heroine early in the story (ok - he calls it a thrashing - it is more like a spanking, but turns into groping as well), later attempts to rape the heroine and would have been successful except for the timely attack of the ship they were on), then after they are married, he does rape her - so forcibly that she bleeds- after becomming enraged when he sees his wife's married sister-in-law meeting with a lover in the middle of the night. Huh?? Yet, the heroine decides finally that very next morning that she loves the hero. Well written, but I just can't get into a love story that finds rape acceptable."},{"Title":"Calypso Magic","review":"Very good story. Excellent chemistry.

Plan: Your Foundation for Optimal Nutrition","review":"I've tried just about every way of eating there is and I have to say that this way of eating makes the most sense, at least for me, and I'd bet many many other people would also benefit from it, if not all people.Mixed proteins make good sense and are easier to digest and absorb vs. eating a lot of one type of high stress protein.Complex Carb meals at lunch and suppertime seem to be a good idea for me so that I can maintain my weight. I personally found that 2 PV meals a day seems to make me lose more weight than I want to lose, but would be very helpful to anyone wanting to lose weight and improve their health.I refer this book to anyone that tells me they'd like to improve their health.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------Update 9/20/2010 :Several years ago I drifted away from this way of eating, and without realizing it I gradually went down to a lower level of health.Organic foods are not enough. They must be combined well or they create toxic by products that affect health in many ways.It's more time & effort to eat this way, but it's really worth it, and it's necessary. My back started to bother me again recently, even though I had not injured it again, and I took that as a sign that I really needed to make a change in diet and quit eating all of the fruit I was eating. After just a week of being on this way of eating, my back feels a lot more stable. The fact is, proteins have a lot to do with joint health and many other things. I'm not sure just what was going on with my body, but it's better now and I'm thankful of this diet to quickly turn it around. We definitely ARE what we eat. If I had kept on the way I was eating, I really believe I would have been needing a cane to walk in the near future. Don't wait to find out the hard way, eat this way now and always.I was just like the person he refers to in the book that kept eating sweet fruits and juices all day in an effort to try to increase energy. I found out it doesn't work. More protein is not better. I had more or less lost my taste for the two most important foods : vegetables and proteins, because of all the fruit I was eating.This book will never be outdated.

To some, this little book appears to be an elementary introduction to familiar physics -- even, to \\"Newtonian physics\\". Others recognize it for what I believe it is: a beautiful and elegant introduction to a new view of the physical world very different from Newton's. To express his theory of electromagnetic field and the holistic view of nature it demanded, he had found his way to the Lagrangian formulation, based not on the individual forces of Newton, but on the energy of whole systems. Individual elements are derived, if at all, only abstractly by way of generalized coordinates. This little volume restates the elements of this new view elegantly without its analytic mathematics. For more about this turning point in Maxwell's work see my study of its role in the Treatise.Figures of Thought. I spell out this view of Matter and Motion in an article reprinted on my website thomasksimpson.com -- look under the heading \\"articles\\".For a beautiful exposition of the Lagrangian view and its foundation in the Principle of Least Action, see Cornelius LanczosThe Variational Principles of Mechanics (Dover Books on Physics and Chemistry)."},{"Title":"Matter and motion (Manuals of elementary science)","review":"definitely not the best intro to newton mechanics but if you already know it and need the info in a new prespective this book will do you.NOT A SELF STUDY GUIDE.Is best when used as a review."},{"Title":"Matter and motion (Manuals of elementary science)","review":"This is how founding fathers thought and wrote about the Matter and Motion. It is a nostalgic reading. Maxwell himself wrote about Matter and Motion of course based on Newtonian Physics. You do not learn any new Physics unless you are doing study in the History of Science. Maxwell basically starts with definition of concepts in Newtonian Mechanics and explains Newton's laws of Motion. Force, Energy, Momentum all the good staff. Short book and interesting piece of history. Definitely worth reading of it for leisure or for study."},{"Title":"Matter and motion (Manuals of elementary science)","review":"Just as some assembly is required as with a good chair for the study, some reverence is required to understand this book.Mordern physics is founded less on math (as some institutional slimeballs would have us believe) and more on the accurate revelations and precision wording--plus just a dash of intellectual wiggle-room--of our most distinguished and revered. Careful thought about just what is being said here by Maxwell along with a thoughtful historical perspective provides an analysis of science that is on par with any analysis of calculus (e.g., as found in Walter Rudin's Principles of Mathematical Analysis).To give this book less than 5 stars is a sign of reprehensible bad taste."},{"Title":"Matter and motion (Manuals of elementary science)","review":"This is a glorious book, I highly recommend it. Of course, you really shouldn't need me to recommend Maxwell to you. I can assuage any doubts you might have about the presentation being too antiquated to be useful to actual students, however. This isn't just for the historically interested expert, the insights are there for first time learners too."},{"Title":"Matter and motion (Manuals of elementary science)","review":"I suggest that the other reviewers completely missed the significance of Maxwell's book \\"Matter and Motion\\" as it is the fountainhead of modern physics.

There was also a t.v. movie of the same name and it has been documented that Lyle and Eric Menendez were \\"inspired\\" by the movie to commit the horrific murders of their parents.This is the true story of Joe Hunt, a brilliant psychopath who, several years after graduating from the exclusive Harvard School in Los Angeles, formed a club he named the BBC. This club was made up of other young men from affluent families who wanted to make big money fast. The club was to be part investment and part social. The boys would live together, pool their resources and live by Joe's creed of \\"Paradox Philisophy\\", which was simply Joe's way of exercising control and manipulation over the other members.Joe's investments soon go awry and he ends up loosing the money that other people have trusted him to invest for them. When things get out of control, Joe plots murder and kidnapping and that is when the book really takes off. I could not put it down!This is an excellent true crime story which focuses on Joe Hunt's ruthless anti-social personality. It is an excellent portrait of an evil sociopath.True crime fans will love this book! I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Further Adventures of Halley's Comet (Norton Paperback)","review":"I enjoyed this book and the television movie. These young men, led by Joe Hunt, wanted to live the good life. They wanted to make huge sums of money, drive flashy, fast cars, go out with debutantes and girls of high society and live the good life. They thought they could accomplish this by becoming whiz kid stock market investors. This plan went did not succeed. Instead of making money for themselves and their clients, they lost it. All of it. As a result they resorted to murder. They killed the father of one of their kiddie group and another person who had tricked them by making them think they had successfully invested a large sum of money, only to find out it was a phony investment scheme on paper. The murder of this man was to cover the extortion of a million plus dollars from him and payback for tricking them."},{"Title":"The Further Adventures of Halley's Comet (Norton Paperback)","review":"Joe Hunt's story is fascinating, Sue Horton did an amazing job getting to the bottom of the story from all points of view, I have read this book and watched the old CBS TV movie numerous times over the years.I have my own theory about Ron Levin's alleged murder, and it isn't popular! I personally believe Ron Levin faked his own death and conned Joe into aiding him..the perfect getaway. Ron Levin was out on bail and was facing many years in prison, Ron wasn't a young man, so 15-20 years would be Catastrophic in his mind. In my opinion, Ron Levin saw Joe as the perfet target, young, ambitious, eager to build an empire at all costs, much like Ron Levin himself. Ron may have payed Joe to aid him. This theory is supported by the fan that multiple people have seen Ron Levin alive and well years after his alleged murder! Must be his ghost, huh! Plus his corpse was never found.As for Joe and his confession to some of the BBC members about murdering Ron Levin, I have a theory about that as well..Joe was eager to gain power and respect from the other members, and in his mind this was a way to do that, sort of the mafia mentality of bragging about a \\"hit\\", in this case the BBC saw Ron had scammed Joe with the Commodities scam, which knocked their confidence in Joe down as well as he groups morale, Joe had to find a way to get their confidence back as well as respect, but it backfired obviously. Joe was infatuated about people believing he was some sort of preternaturally special person, hence his story about a psychic telling his he was the beast of revelations, some special ambitious people do have those same dreams where being te antichrist means you would be the powerful...heck, I used to believe I was the beast also! Lol jkAnother issue, Joe met with Ron alone numerous times and Ron took Joe under his wing as a protege, they became friends over this period of time and it is not far fetched to believe at Joe helped Lein fake his own death, I believe it's very likely given he evidence.I have a feeling the real truth will come out soon and I would like to start investigating this scenario even more part time. If any other people support this contact me, maybe we can solve this mystery! :)Robert Hope"},{"Title":"The Further Adventures of Halley's Comet (Norton Paperback)","review":"i have read this book 2x. when i saw the movie i had to get the book, which came out after the movie. what spoiled rich kids will do for money! what joe hunt will do for power and control. it was quite a story... and it was told well! a page turner."},{"Title":"The Further Adventures of Halley's Comet (Norton Paperback)","review":"Is it just me?

I know it sounds like I'm knocking the previous reviews but hey guys, that's not the same book!"},{"Title":"Majesty's Rancho","review":"For me, if it's not Louis L'Amour, then it's Zane Grey. It's how I roll in my American West literature (sorry, Max Brand; sorry, Larry McMurtry). Anyway, one hint that a book is dusty and dated is when instead of a character saying \\"Damn!\\" it comes out as \\"----!\\" This book offers up several of these cloaked expletives. MAJESTY'S RANCHO was written pretty late in the day in Zane Grey's career and, for whatever reason, happens to be one of my top two favorites in this author's bibliography (the other is THE DUDE RANGER). I haven't read all of Grey's novels, but I've read enough of his more serious, more epic stuff. Held up next to those, MAJESTY'S RANCHO comes off as more fun and upbeat by miles (HERITAGE OF THE DESERT or RIDERS OF THE PURPLE SAGE, to name two, are solemn reads). This one feels like Zane Grey letting his hair down, putting his feet up. I also like that the story takes place in modern times, or what was modern times when this book was first written. It's a nice change of pace.It's 1932, Hollywood, and western cinema is very much in vogue. Lance Sidway, lean and tall cowboy from Oregon and hoping to scarce up funds for his sister's surgery, rode into Tinseltown and became an instant success. Or, rather, his magnificent horse \\"Umpqua\\" (which means \\"Swift\\") became an instant success. On his last day in Los Angeles, Sidway runs into the fiery college student Madge Stewart and helps her out of a jam (she was being harassed by a policeman Lothario). Sidway is instantly smitten, but things don't work out. He ends up leaving town.Sidway and Umpqua make their way into Arizona where Sidway is on the lookout for job prospects. He ends up in Majesty's Rancho, where the owner sizes him up and signs him on as a ranch hand. And if you've read LIGHT OF WESTERN STARS, well, then this is when you get reacquainted with the protagonists of that book, Gene Stewart and his wife Madeline. They own Majesty's Rancho. Guess who their daughter is? You're darn tootin'.Coincidence has a nose and it sticks it in. No sooner does Sidway get hired than Gene's daughter, Majesty or \\"Madge\\" shows up, expelled from university and now come home to stay. Madge is dazzled by Umpqua and demands that Sidway sell his beloved horse to her. Sidway refuses. Madge also accuses Sidway of purposely showing up at her home to chase her. Sidway, affronted, denies it. Zane Grey builds on this initial misunderstanding and, soon enough, these two are at each other's throats. Which means only one thing. Or as one of Majesty's college girl friends murmurs: \\"It's the most delicious love story there ever was in all the world.\\" Oh, Zane Grey, you softie.Zane Grey and Louis L'Amour are both wonderful narrators of the Old West. But where L'Amour's stories are more stripped down, leaner and meaner, with more blistering \\"oomph\\" in the action sequences, Grey tends to be more expansive. He allows more moments to play out, he fosters dialogue. In MAJESTY'S RANCHO, chunks of time elapse with the hero NOT fighting villains - and, yeah, there are gangsters and rustlers and kidnappers in these pages. The focus of the book seems to be most on Madge and Sidway's combustible romance, with all the other goings-on, including the villain sub-plots, serving as backdrop. And it's okay. Because Sidway is an agreeable cowboy (although he could've done with more of a sense of humor), and I've been halfway in love with the stunning, imperious Madge Stewart since I read this book years and years ago. Even if she's about as high maintenance as one could get.One of the subplots centers around the financial hole the Stewart family had fallen into while Madge was away in college. Gene Stewart's concern is that his daughter will prove not to be \\"true blue western\\" but instead a flighty, spoiled city girl. We find out which sort she is fairly quickly.Shenanigans play out at the ranch, especially when Madge's college pals come a-visitin' for the summer. Sidway and Madge keep on circling each other, trying their best to one-up each other. Madge is the adventurous type and so she keeps getting into scrapes, and it doesn't sit too well with her that Sidway is the one always bailing her out. And then, everything comes to a head when Madge is suddenly kidnapped. And then Zane Grey really gets going."},{"Title":"Majesty's Rancho","review":"In this the sequel to The Light of Western Stars written twenty years earlier, we are introduced to Madge Stewart, the daughter of Gene Stewart and Madeline Hammond, the hero and heroine of TLofWS. She is a fun-loving, \\"modern\\" girl that trouble always seems to find, and Lance Sidway, an ex-Hollywood hopeful because of his great horse, Umpqua; he himself shied away from being an actor, and he hated doubling for the \\"handsome Apollos\\" of the silver screen. This novel has gangsters and kidnappers, and cattle thieves who use trucks--just like those good old Gene Autry movies I love to watch. Is the book dated? Yes, somewhat, by the exaggerated slang ZG uses, and for which in later years he was harshly criticized, but overall this is a good book, a very readable one, an enjoyable time with the written word as only Zane Grey can produce."},{"Title":"Mourning Becomes Electra","review":"O'Neill's drama is built on Aeschylos' \\"Oresteia\\". The Greek drama is about murder and retribution in Agamemnon's family. As the leader of the victorious Greek army returns from the Trojan War, his unfaithful wife, Clytemnestra, makes her lover, Aegisthos, slay her husband. The children, Electra and Orestes, take it upon themselves to revenge this murder: Orestes kills his mother and the usurper. Finally, since Orestes is haunted by the ghosts of his guilty conscience, the moral and legal case has to be decided, which crime is worse, Clytemnestra's or Orestes' - and the gods decide in Orestes' favour.O'Neill did not only use the \\"Oresteia\\" as his blueprint, but also the psychoanalytical theory of Dr Freud, who borrowed some of his central terms from Greek mythology. O'Neill deviated from Aeschylos (see below), where he followed Freud closely:The drama plays in 1865/66. General Ezra Mannon (Agamemnon) has returned from the Civil War, his wife Christine (Clytemnestra) hates him because to her he is a hardened, unfeeling male chauvinist and her daughter Lavinia (Electra) blindly hates her mother, as she loves her father. Ezra is prepared to be a better man now but his wife can't forgive him. Knowing that he has a weak heart she brutally tells him that she has a lover, and when his expected heart attack begins, she gives him poison. As soon as Orin (Orestes) has eliminated his mother's lover and Christine has committed suicide, Lavinia transforms herself into her mother in her looks and behaviour because, of course, she envied her and wanted to take over her role. Orin is an especially pitiful case. Whereas in the Greek drama he is able to act firmly and find redemption, here he is a neurotic weakling and perishes, for, of course, since Lavinia changes perceptibly into her mother, he begins to lust for her (having had no success with his mother as long as she was alive), and as Lavinia doesn't comply with his wishes, Orin can't bear it any longer and kills himself. Lavinia feels that life or sexual fulfilment are not for her, and so she locks herself up in their house for the rest of her life: the dead prove to be stronger than the living.On the whole O'Neill 's trilogy is full of blood, horror, gloom and depression, but it is no longer a tragedy. The Greek drama played a public role in classical Athens - politically, religiously, morally - and since the gruesome events took place on the state level, were carried out by public representatives and supported or hindered by the gods, they carried weight and universal meaning. O'Neill restricts the gruesome events to the personal sphere, where they appear as macabre. Tragedy is turned into melodrama which doesn't shatter you any more nor does it concern you very much, as the \\"Oresteia\\" concerned the spectators in Athens and might still concern spectators today. By adhering to Freud's ideas O'Neill sacrifices poetic truth. Feelings are too often expressed too directly and explicitly, as if taken from the psychological handbook. More often than not one cannot help feeling that his drama could easily be turned into a comic strip or a parody, it is simply too unlikely. I guess this depressing parable about sexual frustration is not so symptomatic of the time (1931), when it was written, as it is of O'Neill's troubled mind."},{"Title":"The Best Medicine","review":"Senior Vice President, Denise \\"the Dragon Lady\\" Lyons is the Boss from Hell.

We even witness the DNA Activation technique differently...it's all much faster now.Vianna published a newer Basic book, as a revised copy, in 2007.

It has changed my life profoundly. It's so user friendly that even a child can learn.So to sum it up, if you want an outdated classic edition, then this might be of interest.

It's about a strong hero who has a good purpose behind him, and there's romance in it and a LOT of action. But the chapters are so LONG! There are only five chapters in the book, and they go on forever and ever. I can't believe L'Amour would do that. It made the book drag in a few places. I had to keep comparing this book to books by Kirby Jonas, who critics call the New Louis L'AMour. The difference between them is that I could never put Jonas's books down, but I was able to put down Louis L'Amour. I'm glad L'Amour wrote this book, and I can see why they call Kirby Jonas the new Louis L'Amour. But I wish L'Amour had written more in the style of Kirby Jonas. There sure would be a lot more great books to read instead of a lot that were rushed out a little too fast!"},{"Title":"The Burning Hills","review":"I've always liked this particular story by L'Amour because I like Maria Cristina so much. She's a strong woman, proud and independent. Jordan teases her a little, saying that he needs to boss her around a little, but no one is going to boss Maria Cristina unless she lets them! She's different from the usual women in L'Amour's books, too, because she is Mexican, living in the area right around the Mexico/USA border. I loved the side issue of how she and her family were managing to survive in a changing and challenging world. The story is classic L'Amour: Jordan is being pursued by riders from a nearby ranch. Some of them stole the horses he and his partner had caught and were breaking, and killed the partner as well. Jordan catches up with them, finds the ranch owner and some riders and accuses them of stealing his horses and the usual western free-for-all happens. As with all of his books, though, you'll like this one if you like the others. If you don't or you don't like western actions books, you probably won't like this one."},{"Title":"The Burning Hills","review":"I want to preface this review by saying that Louis L'Amour is my favorite western writer.Although a great story and in keeping with typical L'Amour characteristics, I was frequently lost as to who was speaking or from what perspective at any given moment. I found myself thinking several times that the writing was that of an amateur rather than that of a master like L'Amour. It was also crazy-short. I read it in one easy afternoon, and then had nothing to do in the evening. Really, my low rating is because of my disappointment in the length of the story, and also the awkwardness of the perspective. Also, I thought the plot was a little underdeveloped for a L'Amour. Basically, skip this one and read a Sackett."},{"Title":"The Burning Hills","review":"Western literature has an undeniable charm and represents a unique creation in the world. Let me get rid of the radical rejection of Indians as blood craving and war monging individuals with no individuality. Native Americans are rejected into and by such clich&eacute;s. The land grabbing thieves that the Europeans were are calling wolf when the original landowners start defending their property. But western literature goes a lot farther than that. It shows an essential side of humanity : the desire to go beyond limits, to force the future, to create a new world out of nothing, or out of not much, to curb nature to human needs and projects, and Indians are only part of that nature. It also shows how human feelings are reduced to some basics that can be the foundations of a more complex construction, but that are most of the time the essential part of that construction that never gets off the ground. Humanity living within its basic needs. Love is thus reduced to the need to be needed and the need to be protected along with the need to need and the need to protect. This is simple but essential. We can maybe regret that all the romanticism and the elaborate feelings that love implies are not included in the western recipe but the basic sentiments of need-beneeded and protect-beprotected are an essential human attitude that shows how man and woman can only survive and create the future in difficult situation because that is their destiny. It is this fundamental human destiny to conquer the world and transform it which is essential in western literature. Then what do we do when these values are projected into modern life ? That's a completely different question that requires a lot of thinking and much discussing. Western literature is a central melting pot from which the iron of human endeavor can be produced and refined.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU"},{"Title":"The Burning Hills","review":"THE BURNING HILLS was released in August, 1956, after both HONDO and GUNS OF THE TIMBERLANDS and offers excellent example of the early western writings of Louis L'Amour. Yet, for me, the book remains one of the better novels Mr. L'Amour wrote.The main protagonist, Trace Jordan, a horse trapper has been forced to kill a man. Suffering an incapacitating wound and hunted by a posse including an able tracker, Trace Jordan requires the essential help and care of the woman named Maria Cristina. She is a wonderful central female character, one as untamed as any in western literature, and one of the better ones Louis L'Amour ever brought to life.Another strong character in this book is Jacob Lantz, a \\"Dutch-Indian\\" tracker who could and did trail renegade Apaches successfully. A man who truly enjoyed his work very much, and his professionalism equaled his enjoyment. Jacob was the son of a Dutch trader, his mother a Ute squaw, and it was stated Lantz tracked with his \\"mind as well as his senses\\". Trace Jordan is both a wounded and trapped man and only the mercy of Maria Christina can help save him--for Jacob Lantz certainly means not to.A movie based on this book was later made too but as usual it fell far short of reaching the drama and tension present in Louis L'Amour's written novel. Should you enjoy Louis L'Amour books, especially early L'Amour books, consider this short book as it will offer a few hours of solid reading. And after this one you only have 110 or so books of his left to read!Though Louis L'Amour died in June, 1988, he left us many worthy books to read and re-read.

I've read 21 of his Western novels, dozens of his short stories, 5 non western novels and his first book....poems. One of my favorite authors. All of his works I've read so far are 5 or 4 stars. See my reviews.The Burning Hills was one of his earlier works and one of the better ones of his I've read. Lots of action and good scenery description.We see Trace Jordan and his friend having the Mustang horses they found and collected stolen and his friend killed. Trace kills one of the men responsible and a posse comes to kill him. We see them hunting him with an expert tracker. Trace comes across a beautiful Mexican woman that he eventually falls in love with but she is a wildcat and needs tender training and a loving hand.Eventually after she gives him food and cleans his wound and Trace has time to recuperate a little from being shot, he becomes the hunter of the men hunting him. Lots of gunfighting and survival scenes. I won't say too much and ruin the story for you. Another great Western by INMO one of America's great authors and THE best Western author Louis L'Amour. Rated 5 stars"},{"Title":"Leo Laporte's 2005 Technology Almanac","review":"We have TechTV no more, we no longer can watch The Screen Savers and see Leo, and I can not watch Call For Help anymore now that it is only shown in Canada. All of those things are sad but we still do have Leo's wisdom, teaching, and advice coming to us each day through the pages of his new almanac. Just like the past three almanacs...the information is clear, simple, and to the point. I enjoy getting my daily dose of help and technology with this book. Yes you can search the web for this info, but that is not the point. This is a daily one stop source for some everyday, useable information on computing.

The page contains a bit of history, a short essay on some technology subject and a small snippet about a gadget, download or factoid.For instance on July 8th, the history note is on the Roswell incident - you remember, where either an Air Force experimental balloon blew up or else a UFO crashed in Roswell New Mexico.On April 24th the essay is on closing stuck programs in XP.On January 25, the download of the week is the Picasa software for organizing photographs.There's enough information here that you almost absolutely certainly will find something that is useful. You may have to search for it however."},{"Title":"Leo Laporte's 2005 Technology Almanac","review":"After reading the 2003 edition, I never want to be without the latest issue of the Technology Almanac. Laporte & Miller use the calendar format to present historical tidbits, not all technological in focus, as well as information on trends in technology.Each month begins with a calendar and for each day there is a caption describing a significant event that occurred on that day. There is a focus on a specific aspect of technology for each week, for example, the emphasis for the first week of August is web design. Each technical segment for the days in that week describes some aspect of the focus. Two other items also appear on the page devoted to the day. The first is another significant event for the day with a companion web site containing additional information. The second is one of seven different \\"of the week items.\\" They are:*) PC gadget of the week.*) Download of the week.*) Mac gadget of the week.*) Web site of the week.*) Portable gadget of the week.*) Fact of the week.*) Software of the week.Since only one page is devoted to each day, the explanations are very short. Nevertheless, they are thorough enough to satisfy any initial interest you may have and easily point you in the appropriate direction. An additional list of historical facts for each day of the month is included after the last day of the month.This book is a joy to read, it presents most of the significant trends in technology in short, easily digestible bytes. It is also a primary resource in the true sense of the word. It gets you started with the appropriate and understandable initial information."},{"Title":"Leo Laporte's 2005 Technology Almanac","review":"Mr. Laporte's style is always well written, informative and has a touch of humor.

After purchasing the very good 2002, 2003 and 2004 Tech Almanacs, it was a given to add this one to my collection.It's written differently than the previous almanacs in that the old Tech TV crew is not involved as they were in the previous books. Each page is devoted to a day of the week covering a special download, software, gadget or web site along with lots of useful general information and trivia facts. Each week also has a special focus such as Computer Networks, Linux, Blogging, Web Design, Stopping Spam, etc. Mac's are covered also as well as Mac gadgets.I enjoyed it, I'm glad I bought it and I recommend it!"},{"Title":"Leo Laporte's 2005 Technology Almanac","review":"I read the book from cover to cover.

Most of them are reels for square dancing and jigs, with a few hornpipes and strathspeys thrown into the mix. Key signatures range from C (no sharps or flats) to E (four sharps) on one end to B-flat (two flats) on the other. The tunes are not complicated, but several of them have chord sequences that can surprise you. There are no troublesome two-note harmonies to worry about--just the straight melodies. I like to flip through the pages to practice sight reading. If I find one I really like, I'll add in the left hand and work on it.So this book is good in more than one way. You can learn tunes from it. You can practice sight reading. If you enjoy playing folk music, or if you have a friend who plays in a string band at square dances, you can probably find some familiar tunes in it. Learn those and practice with the band. I guarantee that your squeeze box sound will add something unusual to what would otherwise be just another square dance band."},{"Title":"Mel Bay 100 Tunes For Piano Accordion","review":"This book has 100 songs but I have never heard of one of them.

I play several different tradional musical instruments (Irish Flute, Tin Whistle, Piano, Concertina) however I am relatively new at the accordion and was able to play a lot of the tunes in this book with ease due to them being well written for easy fingerings on piano accordion.

I immediately was intrigued by Saroyan's method of writing and the fact that his novels are autobiographical. This is a story of Aram Garoghlanian, a boy living in Fresno with his large family of Armenian immigrants. Throughout the book, such ideas are touched upon as maturity, honesty, and acceptance. My Name is Aram is a portrait not only of Aram Garoghlanian and William Saroyan himself, but Americans in general. Americans struggle with basic values and ideas everyday, and accepting our eccentric family members is something we learn to do. Saroyan describes small details in hi writing that bring the story to life and open up a new world. Readers will soon realize when they open this novel that each of us holds Aram inside us, whether it means we struggle with the idea of stealing a horse or keeping the families reputation. I strongly recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"My name is Aram (A Laurel edition)","review":"The book is composed of different events that happened in the author's life. It is the life of an Armenian immigrant family in the beautiful San Juaquin Valley. Although, the story is about events that are happening in a particular Armenian family, in reality it is the life all immigrants in America. The stories some how effects all Americans. I am positive that some where in our lifetime we were criticized for a certain cultural trait. It is the story of the ultimate underdog who is determined to succeed. At the same time it is a very fun and easy book to read. I could not put the book down.Saroyan has to be the best writer to come out of the West. He should have been recognized more for his genius work."},{"Title":"My name is Aram (A Laurel edition)","review":"This is a nice small book of short stories which offers a pleasing weekend or evening read. Book is about a young boy by name Aram Garoghlanian and his family, Armenian immigrants living in Fresno, CA. It describes Aram's adventures during his early teenage years and events happening in his great and proud tribe of Garoghlanians.Book is base on episodes of the author's childhood, and the characters of Aram's tribe are based on real individuals, Saroyan's relatives. The book is sensitive and pleasant, and each of the 14 chapters, is written as a separate short-story."},{"Title":"My name is Aram (A Laurel edition)","review":"William Saroyan who is also the author of the famous song, made immortal by Rosemary Clooney, \\"Come On A My House\\" wrote these great tales. He and a nephew, Ross Bagdasarian (David Seville) wrote the song in their enthusiasm while on a road trip to visit an Aunt somewhere out west. Rosey Clooney added her seductive slant to the song in 1951 and we got the famous million seller.I read this book for the first time over forty years ago. I loved it and never forgot many of the stories.As I held the book in my hand to write this review, I began relating some of the tales in it to my wife. Then I sat down and read the book again to see how good my memory was. My memory was pretty good ... but not as good as the book.This book was one among many books of short stories that have served to inspire my own writing. Until re-reading this book, I did not realize how much of this book and this writer I had incorporated into myself.These are all true to life tales of childhood (granting poetic license) and growing up on the West Coast, in Fresno, California way back when. The stories are about mom, dad, grandpa, and uncle Khosrove and the author's unique immigrant heritage.I grew up decades later on the East Coast in an old industrial mill town - nothing like the rural settings in this book. But other than replacing a \\"borrowed\\" car with a stolen pony, the humor and the sentiments are all universal. Today as I review this book, the movie \\"My Big, Fat Greek Wedding\\" comes to mind. The immigrant nature, the humorous relatives, the contrasting values and the crazy antics and situations brought together by life in the new country are common to the book and the movie.Two of the stories that I never forgot are \\"The Summer of the Beautiful White Horse\\" and \\"Old Country Advice to the American Traveler.\\"\\"A Nice Old-Fashioned Romance\\" isn't bad either. The only thing bad about this book is maybe you haven't read it yet.The writing is cleaver, entertaining, humorous and spun through with simple wisdom. In this modern copy I have, I have noticed that the punctuation is rather radical. There are no quotation marks used. Rather strange but easily readable nonetheless. I didn't notice that 50 years ago when I read this book the first time. But there are many things quite evident today that I didn't notice 50 years ago.Not many people write books like this these days. Writing has become too sophisticated. There are no monsters from outer space, no demons, no devils, no spirits or ghosts. There are no serial killers, perverts or criminal insanity. Nobody eats any children in this book. No one flies on a broomstick in this book. There are no spells or even \\"little people.\\" I suppose the younger crowd would find it boring.I have always loved it ... and still do.Richard Edward Noble - The Hobo Philosopher - Author of:\\"Just Hangin' Out, Ma,\\" Humorous Anectdotes"},{"Title":"My name is Aram (A Laurel edition)","review":"\\"My Name Is Aram\\" is a collection of short stories set in Fresno, California in the early 20th century featuring a boy named Aram and his extended Armenian family. The stories are essentially in chronological order and include recurring characters, but the book isn't truly a novel, as all the stories are self-contained and could really be read in any order.Most of the stories in \\"My Name Is Aram\\" are superbly written gems of short fiction. The first, \\"The Summer of the Beautiful White Horse,\\" has frequently been anthologized and with good reason: it is an expertly crafted short story, with a childlike sense of wonder and some unforgettable characters (such as the easily irritated Uncle Khosrove, who reacts to EVERYTHING by shouting \\"It is no harm! Pay no attention to it!\\"). Another favorite is the offbeat \\"Locomotive 38, the Ojibway,\\" about a wealthy, eccentric Native American who wanders into Aram's town. These are two stories that everyone should read at least once. I also particularly enjoyed \\"The Circus\\" (Aram can't resist skipping school whenever the circus comes to town), \\"The Pomegranate Trees\\" (about an attempt by Aram's uncle to grow a field of pomegranate trees in harsh desert land), and \\"The Three Swimmers and the Grocer from Yale\\" (on the way home from a swim, Aram and two other boys encounter a very strange grocer). A couple of the other stories have a somewhat sad or serious tone, which helps balance the book as a whole.Many of these stories reminded me of the works of Jean (\\"A Christmas Story\\") Shepherd. Aram is often getting into minor trouble and clashing with the authority figures at school, but even when they're punishing him, most of the adults realize he's just being a kid. A common theme in this book is the conflict between people who are artistic (or \\"poets\\") by nature and those who consider such pursuits to be foolish. William Saroyan clearly sympathizes with these \\"poets,\\" who he admits may not always be practical, but who nonetheless make the world a much more colorful, interesting place.Originally published in 1940, \\"My Name Is Aram\\" is a timeless classic that everyone should read. If you've never read any of Saroyan's short stories, you're in for a treat!"},{"Title":"My name is Aram (A Laurel edition)","review":"This is Saroyan's collections of short stories from his youth in the early 1900's.

The warm and accurate, unsentimental humor in the way Saroyan portraits people and their life is unforgettable."},{"Title":"My name is Aram (A Laurel edition)","review":"This book has the most endearing charm of any book I have ever read. It got me hooked on Saroyan. Even though he wrote the book many many years ago, it still reminded me of the life I had growing up in the San Joaquin Valley. His portrayal of the innocence of childhood and his hilarious laugh outloud stories still linger in my mind, and every so often I pick up the book again to get lost in a land and time that I love to go back to"},{"Title":"My name is Aram (A Laurel edition)","review":"I reached for this book because I was thinking about stories that I had loved in my junior high years, and I remembered some of Saroyan's stories about a boy growing up in a rural area during World War II. I don't think the author's reputation has really grown much in recent years - up until the 1970s or 80s he was part of the cohort of great American 20th century writers, and I am not sure he is in that category any more - but he is a very interesting writer. His stories are a little odd, yet deeply American and very human. He writes a fair bit about what seem like fairly minor, ambiguous incidents in his characters' lives.This book of short stories is based on his memories of growing up near Fresno, Cal. between 1915 and 1925. His family was Armenian, and they were farming people. These are well-written and charming little yarns, which have the ability to appeal to both younger and older readers. \\"The Summer of the Beautiful White Horse\\" is the best, and I used it in a class I was teaching. It tells the story of two cousins, one around 10 and the other around 13. The older boy has stolen a white horse which they ride around at night so that no one can see them. Eventually they are caught, and give the horse back to its rightful owner. In another one I liked, a few boys go for a long hike and a swim in a river. On the way back they meet an eccentric shopkeeper with a Yale education. It describes a kind of adventure which is mostly gone from the American landscape today. In a funny piece, one boy keeps getting sent to the principal's office, where the principal half-heartedly flogs him, and the boy somehow gets in between a possible budding romance between the principal and a teacher. In a sweet yet slightly disturbing tale, an Indian who apparently has come into some money hires a boy to drive him around town and show him where the good fishing is.Not all of these were good for today's students - in fact only a couple would be. But I enjoyed reading them, and I look forward to someday dipping into some of Saroyan's more adult works."},{"Title":"My name is Aram (A Laurel edition)","review":"Arrived Quickly and in the Condition Promised.

For the most part, it's a great book. My problem with it is the occasional random scattering of absolute misinformation.On the positive side, most of the information is quality. If you want to learn about different foods, their functions, and how your body processes them, the explanations are very easy to understand and this is a great reference. It is straightforward and written in a way that makes it easy to learn from.There were a few things, however, that are blatantly inaccurate and poorly referenced. One \\"Spotlight\\" section went over artificial sweeteners and \\"debunked\\" the \\"myths\\" that they are harmful to our health. There were studies referenced, but many of these studies have been found scientifically insignificant or inaccurate and vast other studies have found artificial sweeteners to be anything but safe. It isn't a huge secret in the health world that artificial sweeteners are terrible for you but this book assures you that they're harmless.Another part briefly brings up genetic engineering and references the Flavr Savr tomato, describing how it was engineered and what it was being modified for. From the book you would get the impression that this product ended up being highly successful. They fail to mention, however, that the Flavr Savr tomato was largely a flop.The references to the Food Guide Pyramid are also kind of ridiculous.If you're wanting to learn what your body needs, how nutrients and minerals work, and that kind of stuff, I would highly recommend this book.

Not only did the locale grab my attention, but also the characters quickly became three-dimensional, introducing me to a lifestyle that has long since been laid to rest.Walking the path with protagonist Rose Padroni, I saw through her eyes, heard with her ears, and felt with her heart. Her longing for her widowed father's approval and her pain at not receiving it reached out and touched me, as did her grasping for a mother-figure in the form Marietta Monroe, only a few years her senior but world-wise well beyond her years. When Mari is murdered shortly after their friendship blossoms, Rose reaches beyond her own grief to assist Mari's brother in trying to find those responsible for snuffing out her friend's life.The realistic story becomes even more powerful when the reader learns it was inspired by an actual murder that occurred in Grand Junction in 1937. Many months of research preceded the writing, and Ms. Brockett deftly wove the threads of that tragedy into the fabric of Stained Glass Rose. This historical novel rivets the reader's attention to its pages from beginning to end-no matter where that reader may happen to live."},{"Title":"Stained Glass Rose","review":"\\"I see a perfectly crafted masterpiece of beauty and message. The amazing thing is, if the artist had left out even one bit of glass, the picture would be incomplete. No matter how small or colorless, each piece is necessary and valuable.\\"This excerpt is the secondary, but important character, Father Nick talking to Rose...the main character of Stained Glass Rose. The above sentence describes the book itself tightly written without a piece of \`necessary and valuable' information missing.Debbie Brockett's research is impeccable. In Stained Glass Rose, she takes a real-life murder case and weaves a story of friendship around its unsolved elements. Thus not only does Stained Glass Rose hold elements of mystery, but is a book about how one important person can make a difference in someone's life.The book, Stained Glass Rose is told through the eyes of an elderly woman. D.A. Brockett weaves her story so well she can slide her reader back and forth from flashback to present without a jolt. The book's richness is more enhanced by her choice of first person Point of View.All characters carry a strong individual flavor in this book; a piece of Americana where \`old country' meets new. It gives us a peek of how \\"The Melting Pot\\" grew in Grand Junction Colorado.This is a very well written and enjoyable book with a few surprises. I look forward to more of D.A. Brockett's work.Reviewer:Jody GoreCo-Owner/EditorWriting for Independents, e-zine"},{"Title":"Stained Glass Rose","review":"I learned of the existence of this book a couple of weeks ago by turning on my car radio and catching the last part of an interview with its author. She was saying that her research in preparation for writing a novel is practically as exciting as creating the story itself. In her research she meticulously gathers information about real people, the locale and the time in which an actual event occurred--an event that provides a historical backdrop for her story. Two of her novels, \\"Stained Glass Rose\\" and \\"Our Darling\\" sprang from cemetery tours in and near Grand Junction, Colorado, where she lives. The way \\"Stained Glass Rose\\" wends through the streets of Grand Junction was particularly fascinating, and would be even to someone not familiar with the environs.The principal character is Rose Padroni, a teenaged girl trying to win the love of her abusive, widowed father. Unexpectedly, she strikes up a romance with Satter Simpson, and a friendship with Satter's sister Marietta \\"Mari\\" Monroe, a street-wise, rough-around-the-edges woman just a few years older than she. Despite Mari's being only a few years Rose's senior, she provides sort of a mother figure for Rose with her take-charge, highly protective manner. Their friendship is truly heart-warming but, sadly, just as their friendship becomes rich and meaningful, Mari is murdered, leaving Rose grief-stricken and confused. Debbie Brockett tells the story of Rose's father's deteriorating health, the discovery of her deceased mother's journal, and Rose and Satter solving the mystery of Mari's death tenderly and skillfully, with spiritual lessons embroidered into the fabric of the tale but not dominating it. It is a story well told, and well worth the reading."},{"Title":"A Hero By Mistake","review":"Stories about the strong, fearless and conquering hero are staples of literature, are engaging and can be inspirational. However, in most cases, they are also false and misleading as most people are frightened when faced with danger. What makes them a hero is that they are able to overcome their fear and perform whatever action needs to be done.Dionisio is a Mexican Indian loaded with fear; the story opens with him running from his own shadow. The slightest sound or movement turns him into a quivering mass of protoplasm unable to perform even the simplest of tasks. Dionisio is well aware of his weaknesses and their detrimental effect, yet cannot conquer them. When he buys a bugle and is taught how to play it like a soldier, his fortune takes a random turn for the better. Dionisio approaches a town and plays his bugle to announce his presence. The playing of the cavalry charge frightens away five bandits and Dionisio is surprisingly a hero.Being hailed as a hero is not enough to make him one, but one night Dionisio hears strange noises outside and goes to investigate. He throws a piece of wood at the shadow and when he trips over something he discovers that he has knocked a very bad man unconscious. Dionisio ties him up and then later is hailed as a hero. Dionisio finally learns that he is a very brave man, for he did what he was afraid to do, the very definition of bravery.All children possess fears; a large part of growing up and becoming a functional adult is learning to manage those fears. That is the primary lesson of this book and it is a very valuable one."},{"Title":"Modern Boeing Jetliners","review":"I recently bought this book because i am a plane lover and hope to one day be a comercial airline pilot.

The author prefers to fictionalize the people in the telling of this story. They are simply brought to us as Verna and Jeff, and we are acquainted with them as a young couple in their years of adulthood. She studies in the nursing profession and he pursues his vocation as an aerodynamic engineer. Verna finds Jeff intelligent, and entertaining as well. He tells her wonderful things about science like the theoretical space ship that flies to Venus using aluminum sails like the windjammers of old, only this one uses the energy from the sun instead of wind on acres of aluminum.Verna is fascinated by Jeff \`s inventive brain. They marry, and they have two girls. What happens now is like a scrapbook, lovingly coaxing the mind to recollection. Graduation, golf, family outings. Things could not be more suited to anyone's wishes or dreams. About the time the girls are in college Verna and Jeff are poised for retirementThen Jeff begins to show symptoms which lead to Verna's taking him to the doctor. He has been behaving strangely, losing track of things, wandering off, None of this is like him.Verna learns what she had feared most. Jeff has Azheimer's disease. Verna as we find out is able to pick herself up, dust her self off and go back to work. In this, with her sincerity, she is able to teach by example. She is positively Rastafarian in her approach to the world. It doesn't matter how unfair nature is found to be, our response is guided by the power found within. Consider, if you will, what it means to take responsibility for a full-grown man as if he were an infant, only this one is walking around. Caring for an infant would be like a day off. She takes on the task with a will that can only be called love.If it can happen it is likely to be found on the pages of this book. It is not a litany of woe but a manual of greeting expectations. The guiding spirit of this book is not hope but courage.The book is pedestrian. Anyone could have written it, But they didn't. Ms Lawrence saw a job to be done as more important then worrying about her part in things. The book shows symptoms of humanity and genuine care. That is important in this time of self-glorification and indifference. She might say simply: \\"That's why you take a vow. You know, \`Till death do us part.'\\"Tom Gelinske"},{"Title":"Disaster at the Pole: The tragedy of the airship Italia and the 1928 Nobile Expedition to the North Pole","review":"Great adventure tale but there is a little too much Hero Worship on the part of the author.

It's available on video tape."},{"Title":"Disaster at the Pole: The tragedy of the airship Italia and the 1928 Nobile Expedition to the North Pole","review":"The Airship Italia disaster of 1928 has unfortunately been nearly forgotten today, but in its time captivated the world. I've read a number of books on the incident and this one ranks with the best (I even have an aviation text from that same year that was published after the accident, but before the rescue. The readers were left hanging!). While attempting to fly to the North Pole under the command of Italian Gen Umberto Nobile, land on the ice, and return, the airship Italia crashes on the pack ice hundreds of miles from civilization. The survivors are hurled to the ice and can only watch as 6 other survivors float off to their doom on the derelict airship. Legendary Norwegian artic explorer Roald Amundsen, flies off in a seaplane to attempt a rescue, and is never heard from again. The castaways confront sudden cracks in the ice, broken bones, polar bear attacks, and almost staggering incompetence from their base ship back in harbor, which didn't even bother to monitor the radio most of the time. 3 of the party set off in a desperate bid to reach land and lead back a rescue party. The Norwegian Dr. Malmgren is soon too exhausted to continue, and after stoically help dig his own ice grave, bids the other two, Zappi and Mariano, on after giving them his food. The duo trudges on, clearly seeing land on the horizon, while the drift of the pack ice cancels out all their efforts. 43 days after they started, the last 12 without food, the snow blinded Zappi and Mariano sit down to await their fate. But the Russian Icebreaker Krassen miraculously rescues them just hours from death. 48 days after the crash, and against all odds, all the survivors are finally rescued. First published in 1960, this book has the advantage that the author had personal one-on-one interviews with nearly every survivor. Ironically, after coming so close to death, each survivor lived to comfortable old age, while the majority of their rescuers met early deaths, either by accident, or in the case of the Russians, in Stalin's purges. Instead of receiving a hero's welcome, Nobile was slandered by Mussolini's fascist government, who perceived him as a threat. He only received the credit due shortly before his death. This story is just begging for big screen, big budget treatment (it was the subject to a not-well-known, but good, Sean Connery movie, The Red Tent, though). Hopefully, they wont take the U571 route and change the principle characters from Italian, Czech, or Norwegian to Americans!"},{"Title":"Disaster at the Pole: The tragedy of the airship Italia and the 1928 Nobile Expedition to the North Pole","review":"In 1925, the renowned Italian aeronautical engineer Nobile flew over the North Pole in a dirigible, at the time a considerable feat of scientific inquiry. All went well, and in 1928 Nobile attempted to repeat the feat, this time planning on stopping at the pole and landing observers on the ice. Unfortunately, by the second expedition Nobile was no longer in favor with the increasingly strident Fascist government, and faced many political and physical obstacles. However, he managed to get the expedition airborne, and reached the pole safely. On the return leg, the airship foundered in foul weather, stranding the survivors on the icecap. A bizarre tragedy ensued, with searchers from many nations looking for Nobile while Nobile's Italian support ship, sitting at the dock in Norway, conspicuously failed to participate. Well worth reading."},{"Title":"Disaster at the Pole: The tragedy of the airship Italia and the 1928 Nobile Expedition to the North Pole","review":"In the early years of the twentieth century, there were several explorers that journeyed to the North Pole. They went to vast desolate regions of terrible cold, to places of the earth that no man had gone to before. One of those explorers was Umberto Nobile of Italy. Nobile is not very well known today, but he was a man of great honor and courage. This book tells his personal story, and the story of his final polar expedition in 1928. Nobile chose a unique method for exploring the Pole: he used a lighter than air airship named the Italia. The Italia was similar in general design to the famous Hindenberg, but it was smaller and more flexible in flight. Nobile meticulously planned his exploration, but despite those preparations disaster struck and the Italia crashed onto the polar ice. The survivors then had to struggle with great endurance through desperate conditions. This is ultimately a book about courage, both from the crew of the Italia and those that tried to save them in one of the largest rescue efforts ever undertaken. Nobile had to also endure much unjust criticism and political pressure from the Fascist Government of Mussolini. His story shows how hard it can be to extend the frontiers of science; and the tremendous heart that is required to reach into the unknown."},{"Title":"Disaster at the Pole: The tragedy of the airship Italia and the 1928 Nobile Expedition to the North Pole","review":"I see that most of the readers given this book 5 stars. I given it 4 stars as I think only a few books deserve the highest rating. However, let me say this is one of the best book I ever read about Arctic/Antarctic exploration. I found the book in a recess of the library here at South Pole Station, where I'm wintering over, so that you can understand my interest in the matter, but I'll buy it because I want to own it.It is really a further shame that was an Englishman, and not an Italian - as I am - to wrote it. However, it is really a great way to restablish the historical truth about one of the most shameful, forgotten, episodes in the long history of my country, Italy. Thanks to the author, even though, admittedly, a bit on delay, for having written something so good about the great Umberto Nobile and his life.By the way, the original title of the edition I read was &quot;Ghost Ship of the Pole&quot;.

This book however, is recommended as the definitive account of the Italia disaster, and also a personal history of General Nobile. It gives some insight to him standing up against Mussolini and his Facists (Nobile was basically apolitical; he just wanted to design and fly airships and be left alone), which caught up with him after the rescue. The book really picks up after the crash and when the rescuers start to pour onto and over the ice floes. This was the biggest search since the Frankin disaster, fortunately for the survivors, there was now modern equipment such as airplanes and icebreaking ships available. Author Wilbur Cross interviewed Nobile in Italy and many of the other survivors. Recommended for anyone interested in Arctic survival, a lot of it is reminiscent of &quot;In the Land of the White Death&quot;, though for anyone wanting to know about the circumstances of Roald Amundsen's death should look elsewhere, as it's barely mentioned except to say that his plane was overdue, and some of the Norwegian people were hostile to Nobile after the rescue since the Italians did practically nothing to rescue their own people.Chapters are as follows:1. Prelude to Disaster--the Italia is losing altitude and nothing the crew does will make it rise again.2. The Impossible Dream--History of Nobile's airship designs.3. An Ambitious Undertaking--The story of Nobile and Roald Amundsen flying the Norge to the North Pole.4. The Next Big Step--Building of the Italia and preparations for more Arctic expeditions.5. Premonitions of Trouble--The flight from Milan to Spitzbergen across Europe.6. Destination Zero--Flight from Spitzbergen to the North Pole.7. The Downfall--The crash of the Italia.8. Picking up the Pieces--the survivors rally and gather equipment to survive.9. Frustration--SOS is sent and rescuers begin to head out--but where are the Italians?10. Split Decision--Mariano, Zappi, and Malmgren leave the camp to try to reach land and help.11. The Shortwave Dilemma--They are unsure if their shortwave messages are being picked up.12. Against the Odds--Italian Army Captain Sora leaves out on skis to search; Amundsen and others search by air.13. Manna From Heaven--The survivors are resupplied by airdrop.14.

Voices Muzzled--the Italians are censored by the Fascist government and Nobile's reputation and courage are questioned.22.An Abundance of Enemies--Nobile is attacked by the Fascists, including Mussolini, in court and elsewhere."},{"Title":"Disaster at the Pole: The tragedy of the airship Italia and the 1928 Nobile Expedition to the North Pole","review":"This story of Nobile and the Italia airship is now being actively considered by an award-winning film producer for a TV documentary on a major program. It is also being considered by two other American producers. And it will soon be a movie in Norway."},{"Title":"Disaster at the Pole: The tragedy of the airship Italia and the 1928 Nobile Expedition to the North Pole","review":"While exploring the polar regions in 1928, Nobile and a group of fellow adventurers crashed in the airship Italia. One can imagine the horrors of being stranded in the artic for a short time, but the expedition is not rescued for over a month, and face the cold, bears, and breaking ice in addition to their injuries.The reader will find the rescue story exciting enough, but in many ways this is Nobile's story. The commander, against his will, is rescued first, only to be blamed for this by Italian authorities, who proceed to wage a media campaign aimed at destroying his reputation. The reader may wonder how Nobile kept his sanity throughout it all. The cynical nature of the governments involved was but a small foretaste of what was to come in the next two decades."},{"Title":"Disaster at the Pole: The tragedy of the airship Italia and the 1928 Nobile Expedition to the North Pole","review":"I had only heard bits about the crash of the airship Italia back in 1928, and now I am fully informed upon reading this book.Cross wrote a well-researched, engaging book, conducting interviews with many of the survivors, including its leader, Umberto Nobile. It is detailed without being bogged down in minutiae or with too many personal editorializations.A brilliant engineer, Nobile flew to the pole in the Norge along with renowned explorer Roald Amundsen. Cross is quick to point out the extreme dislike the two had for each other, though when Italia crashed, Amundsen was among the first to set out for him (and it would cost him his life).Nobile became the tool of Mussolini's Fascist dictatorship and its intrigues--Cross pulls no punches in describing the jealousy and petty bickering that affected Nobile's efforts and nearly cost the expedition their lives when rescue efforts by the Italians were half-hearted.There are some really interesting and heroic characters here, those that risked their lives to search for Nobile and his men. The horrors they all went through are well-documented.Somehow, Nobile avoided false charges of cowardice and managed to keep his career going. At the end, he seemed to also retain his dignity.A great read, with a lot of real heroes that make ours of today seem mere shadows."},{"Title":"Disaster at the Pole: The tragedy of the airship Italia and the 1928 Nobile Expedition to the North Pole","review":"I had recently read the 1st edition of this true story, from the library.

In the case of Nobile, it was the 2nd trip of a Italian made airship to the North Pole with many scientific studies to be completed enroute and to even possibly land at the Pole and then to return home. The disastrous weather conditions in returning finally caused a crash landing on an ice flow and the frustrating attempts to keep alive and be rescued.

Garrison alsocritiques the ideas Keynesians and Monetarists. One of the keystrengths of the graphics in this book is that it focuses attention onunder appreciated elements of subjectivist-Austrian trade cycletheory. These graphs clarify the effects that interest rates have onhousehold decisions on saving and consumption. Also, the graphsfacilitate comparisons between different schools of thought. This bookhas little that is really new in the Subjectivist theory of the tradecycle and its associated critiques of competing theories in thisarea. By in large, this book organizes material from other books andarticles, many of which are by Garrison.The primary value of this book is in its organization and presentation ofthis alternative explanation of the trade cycle and unemployment. Thisbook is important because it facilitates the dissemination of a viableexplanation of important economic phenomena. The need for thisdissemination is both internal and external to the Subjectivistschool. Many members of the Subjectivist school promote this theorywithout fully understanding it. Those outside of the school tend toignore this theory completely. These two facts are closelyrelated. Clear representation of these ideas is an essential part ofthe effort on the part of Subjectivists to regain their former placeamong the mainstream of the economics profession. By doing this in hisbook, Garrison has made great progress in reducing the costs oflearning about Subjectivist Capital/Trade Cycle theory. A lower moneyprice for this book would extend this process further."},{"Title":"TIME & MONEY","review":"Austrian economics are often rejected by mainstream economists because they do not use mathematics and graphical analysis. Therefore, some great insights and ideas of authors such as von Mises, Hayek and Rothbard are neglected.Yet some austrian ideas can easily be paralleled with mainstream theories. For instance, the role of monetary inflation in monetarist macroeconomics, the role of expectations, and the difference between short term and long term Philips curve. All of these are coherent with the austrian theory. But austrian theory has a distinct approach when it discusses the role of inflation in terms of distortions of the structure of production. This leads to a new vision of recessions, as a necessary evil to cure the malinvestments of the boom.Dr Garrison has developed a pedagogical tool in the form of a graphics, integrating the loanable funds demand/supply chart, the potential production frontier and the hayekian structure of production triangle. Thanks to this familiar approach, his tool is used to present the austrian theory in terms immediately understandable by economists trained in mainstream macro. The book studies several real life cases, such as the business cycle, fiscal policy, budget deficits, etc."},{"Title":"TIME & MONEY","review":"Roger Garrison, a brilliant and entertaining lecturer in Austrian Economics, presents his approach to an issue that has been at the forefront of economics since Keynes' General Theory was published in the 1930s. Austrian economics, a theory of individual choices which drives the economies of the world, has in essence seemed to ignore the \\"big picture\\" of economics, the Macro field of aggreagtes, GDP and general price levels. Though many of these ideas were addressed by Mises and Nobel winner Hayek, Garrison brings Keynes and Hayek to the table of ideas for the first time in a coherent and quite frankly very understandable manner. Using Keynes' own material and Hayek's Theory of Production, Garrison bends and twists the two actual friends (just don't discuss economics!!) which can be seen best in a single 1,000-word picture first presented on page 50.

Only in the case where mpc+mpi=1 will the c-nc theory be operational.As pointed out by G,this is some point on the PPF boundary.This is where neoclassical and Austrian economic theory comes into play-explaining the underlying process over time that results in the picking of a (the) particular mix of consumption and investment goods,given resource scarcity,that businessmen will produce for sale in a free market."},{"Title":"TIME & MONEY","review":"For anyone interesting in Austrian macroeconomic theory, this is the book for you. (...)"},{"Title":"MacArthur's Undercover War: Spies, Saboteurs, Guerrillas, and Secret Missions","review":"\\"MacArthur's Undercover War\\" has all the makings of a great modern World War II book: seldom heard-of commando raids in the Pacific, daring esponiage, and a larger-than-life character in the famous and controversial Douglas MacArthur. Yet a few obvious errors and a lack of solid citations has left me to question a great deal of material in this book (as another reviewer warned.)First off, for readers eager to dive into the MacArthur controversy, this book will be a disappointment. Breuer has nothing but praise for MacArthur although he does acknowledge the commander's prima donna demeanor. Indeed, you will not see in this book a citation of the \\"Dugout Doug\\" poem that was undoubtedly uttered by so many GIs on Corregidor and Bataan in 1942.One error (or maybe a slip of the author's organization) in the book nearly caused my to shelve it without completing the work. While discussing the early battles between Japanese-American forces, the author places the battle of Midway after the struggle on Guadalcanal! In reality, the great turning point at Midway occured in the summer of 1942, while the Guadalcanal battle wrapped up a year later in 1943. I was quite stunned upon reading Breuer's account of Midway, and I looked over the pages again to make certain that I did not skip any dates that the author inserted in the text. There was none. In the chapter titled \\"The Great Manila Bay Silver Heist,\\" the last year mentioned before Breuer explains Midway is 1943. Then Breuer continues onward to mention how the battle of Midway opened on June 7 without mentioning the year, seemingly implying to any reader that he is still discussing 1943.In another error I noticed, Breuer describes the B-29 \\"Flying Fortress.\\" This again is misleading, since the B-17 was the official \\"Flying Fortress,\\" while the mammoth B-29 was the \\"Super Fortress.\\" Such errors would certainly force any knowledgeable reader to question an author's credibility.The good news is that \\"MacArthur's Undercover War\\" is an entertaining book; a great book for anyone looking for a \\"shoot 'em up\\" tale that may or may not be fiction. For educational purposes, however, readers should look elsewhere."},{"Title":"MacArthur's Undercover War: Spies, Saboteurs, Guerrillas, and Secret Missions","review":"This book has so many factual inaccuracies it is hard to know where to start. Maybe in the Introduction, where the author states that one of his heroes, John Bulkeley, was \\"American history's most highly decorated warrior.\\" Gee, how about Audie Murphy who was the most decorated soldier in World War II or Marine Major Smedley Butler who was the only man ever to win two Medals of Honor (Bulkeley only won one). Also, author Breuer uses the term \\"Congressional Medal of Honor\\" -- a medal that does not exist -- it is simply the \\"Medal of Honor.\\" An historian should know that.Author Breuer appears to be in awe of General MacArthur -- a man who apparently never made mistakes (such as not moving food supplies to Bataan in time for his army to be able to effectively resist the Japanese). Also high in the author's estimation is Charles Willoughby, a truly bizarre and Byzantine character born Karl Weidenback in Germany, and upon whom the author seems to rely for many of his \\"facts\\" and stories. Unfortunately Willoughby was not shrewd, incisive and skilled as the author characterizes him, but demanding, arrogant, inept, paranoid, inflexible and lacking in judgment. Willoughby's reports and narratives of events during the war have been proven to be unreliable, highly slanted to put MacArthur in the best possible light, and to place himself in an omniscient, heroic role. The truth is much different.As an example of the author's endemic errors, consider his treatment of Wendell Fertig, apparently based almost solely on Willoughby's writings which are those of a man who hated Fertig with a passion as a dangerous historical figure to the glorification of MacArthur and himself. The author describes Fertig as a \\"civilian engineer who was considered to be as brilliant as he was eccentric\\" (page 48), completely missing that Fertig was a Lt. Colonel in the Army Corps of Engineers who had been called to duty from the Reserves when the Japanese invaded the Philippines. Nor was he \\"eccentric\\" in any respect except to refuse to surrender in May, 1942, after having escaped from Corrigidor to Mindanao. Fertig built the MOST SUCCESSFUL GUERRILLA MOVEMENT IN AMERICAN HISTORY on Mindanao -- for over a year totally unsupported by the great men Willoughby and MacArthur, and by his presence and success threatened MacArthur's position as savior of the Philippine people.In taking over command of the guerrilla bands on Mindanao in September, 1942, Fertig was addressed as \\"General\\" by a mestizo leader Luis Morgan and Morgan's lieutenant Bill Tait, and the people on Mindanao rallied to Fertig in that capacity. Morgan said later, knowing that Fertig was just a Lt Colonel, \\"I made him a Brigadier General\\", and once made, that rank could not be taken back. Morgan himself took on the rank of Colonel shortly thereafter. In October, 1942, Fertig issued his first general orders \\"By order of the commanding general, Wendell W. Fertig, Brigadier General, USA, Commanding.\\"Willoughby/MacArthur did not communicate with Fertig until March, 1943, and then only to to chastize him, changing his branch from the Corps of Engineers to the Infantry and to say, \\"No officer of rank of general will be designated...\\" Obviously Willoughby/MacArthur did not understand the Asian concept of \\"face\\" and were only interested in bringing what Willoughby perceived as a rouge officer into line.The author's narrative of MacArthur's sending of silver oak leaves to Fertig later in 1943 is sheer fictional fantasy along with the supposed conversation between Chick Parsons and Fertig. Parsons actually told Fertig that Willoughby had blown up over the brigadier general rank, and he was there to see if Fertig was competent to command. Supposedly Willoughby had said that Fertig couldn't command men he didn't see. Of course, that was all garbage, since no general commands only men he can see. At any rate, Fertig ultimately commanded over 35,000 men on Mindanao, not counting civilian supply and supports, a number of small ships and some aircraft, in effect a full army corps that should have been commanded by a Lieutenant General plus performing the duties of a military governor. However, Fertig was so dangerous as a potential competitor to MacArthur for the Filipinos' affections, he was never promoted at any time or even upon retirement. He retired after the war at the same rank as in December, 1941 in the US Army Reserves -- Lt. Colonel. All this would have made a wonderful story, but the author either didn't know it or knew that it detracted from the luster of MacArthur/Willoughby.From this one example and others I could recount (such as Willoughby's consistent under-estimating of Japanese troop strengths) one can easily see that the author's narrative cannot be taken as history and is therefore of little value. Some of his stories based on personal conservations and memoirs are fascinating, but are not to be taken literally until backed up with adequate sources and thorough scholarship. Unfortunately such sources and thorough scholarship are missing in this book.Put this work on the shelf with fiction until the author performs the necessary research to validate his stories and tones down the uncritical hero worship so evident on page after page."},{"Title":"MacArthur's Undercover War: Spies, Saboteurs, Guerrillas, and Secret Missions","review":"This book provides a good familiarization with a part of history that is often over-looked. There are other books that provide a more in-depth study of a single element of the Pacific war like the coastwatchers,or the Phillipino guerrillas,or the American Nisei but this book covers the various groups working to defeat the Japanese in a single interesting volume."},{"Title":"MacArthur's Undercover War: Spies, Saboteurs, Guerrillas, and Secret Missions","review":"This book's title is a bit of a misnomer. None of the events here are really *MacArthur's* undercover war. Instead, the book is full of stories of undercover missions in the region that happened to be MacArthur's theater of operations. There's no evidence that MacArthur had any particular approach to undercover operations or, in all but one case, even knew about the activities discussed in this book.The book consists of a bunch of war stories, mostly gleaned by interviewing old veterans of the conflict. The stories are generally interesting, so if you like war stories, you'll be content. But the author makes no attempt to tie them together into an overall narrative, or to bring out any particular themes.The book reads like a bunch of interviews strung one after the other. I'm not surprised that people find factual errors, as the book does not seem to have been closely edited or fact-checked.Breuer also writes in a naively heroic, dated style that may strike some people as odd. White-skinned people are foregrounded, and they carry almost all of the action; dark-skinned people are \\"natives\\" who \\"help\\" the white-skinned heroes but are mostly not autonomous actors. (There are some non-white US citizens, such as second-generation Japanese-Americans, who are grouped with the heroes, however.) \\"Natives\\" of places like New Guinea or Borneo don't speak languages, they speak \\"dialects.\\" Breuer's use of language like this isn't meant to be offensive, as he's entirely naive - - but we don't talk like this any more, and younger readers will probably notice the style. All you students out there, don't write like this!The book is also naively anti-Japanese. Filipinos who side with the US are heroes, as are Indonesians who side with the Dutch and Australians; those who side with the Japanese are \\"traitors.\\" Traitors to what or whom? To Indonesia? There are reasons why some Indonesians and Filipinos might have thought that Japan would treat them better than their previous colonial masters. They would have been wrong, I think, but even so I think that most of us have learned enough empathy to understand these mistaken choices a bit better.A stronger editor would have helped Breuer avoid these issues of language and style in order to focus on the spy stories. More effort would have have produced a better book.That said, the spy stories are good, so if that's what you want, that's what you'll get.One last comment summarizes my reaction to the book The cover has the same picture of MacArthur twice, facing in opposite directions. What's the problem, couldn't the publisher find two different pictures of MacArthur? Let's work a little harder, people."},{"Title":"MacArthur's Undercover War: Spies, Saboteurs, Guerrillas, and Secret Missions","review":"This book was a fun little read...Okay, it passed the time.

Back in 1859, his seminal work, \\"Farm Drainage: The Principles, Processes, and Effects of Draining Land with Stones, Wood, Plows, and Open Ditches and Especially with Tiles -- Including Tables of Rain-Fall, Evaporation, Filtration, Excavation, Capacity of Pipes; Cost and Number to the Acre, of Tiles, Etc, Etc.\\" was published by A.O. Moore & Co. of New York, and sold for $1.00. Presumably the copyright on the original has expired and this is a reprint.Technologies and costs have changed in the past 150 years, so these parts are obsolete. But, the book still has historical and literary value. The term, \\"French drain\\", comes from it.

You stand on the cellar stairs, and below is a dark waste of waters, of illimitable extent. By the dim glimmer of the dip-candle, a scene is presented which furnishes a tolerable picture of \\"chaos and old night,\\" but defies all description.\\"Empty dry casks, with cider barrels, washtubs, and boxes, ride triumphantly on the surface, while half filled vinegar and molasses kegs, like water-logged ships, roll heavily below. Broken boards and planks, old hoops, and staves, and barrel heads innumerable, are buoyant with this change of the elements; while floating turnips and apples, with here and there a brilliant cabbage head, gleam in this subterranean firmament, like twinkling stars, dimmed by the effulgence of the moon at her full. Magnificent among the lesser vessels of the fleet, \\"like some tall admiral,\\" rides the enormous \\"mash tub,\\" while the astonished rats and mice are splashing about at its base in the dark waters, like sailors just washed, at midnight, from the deck by a heavy sea.\\"The lookers-on are filled with various emotions. The farmer sees his thousand bushels of potatoes submerged, and devoted to speedy decay; the good wife mourns for her diluted pickles, and apple sauce, and her drowned firkins of butter; while the boys are anxious to embark on a raft or in tubs, on an excursion of pleasure and discovery.\\"To avoid such scenes as the above, every cellar which is not upon a dry sandbank should be provided with a drain of some kind, which will at all times, secure.\\""},{"Title":"JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, Vol. 1","review":"When I first discovered JoJo 7 years ago, the only way I could get the whole (pictoral) story of the manga was buying the Mandarin version - since I could not locate the Japanese version anywhere.But now, Hirohiko Araki's 1987 classic has finally arrived, thanks to the wonderful folks at Viz.Since most U.S. JoJo fans are familiar only with the 3rd generation of the series (through either the Capcom videogame or the anime distributed by Super Techno Arts), Viz naturally began with it.Appropriately so, this story was where Araki first introduced what would become the signature of JoJo - The Stand. In a unique way of illustrating psychic battles of ego and will, each of the heroes and villains' powers are personified in the (often humanoid) form of a Stand - usually reflecting their own inner nature.Yet even with their incredible talents, the heroes still use their wits to apply their abilties in clever ways to defeat their opponents.Like Super Techno Arts's anime translation, Viz's translation remains faithful to that of Capcom's videogame. Araki is particularly fond of naming his characters after Western music icons. Thus, to avoid copyright infringement, names were slightly altered.Nevertheless, U.S. JoJo fans can rejoice now that this long underappreciated classic has, almost 20 years later, finally made it to our shores."},{"Title":"JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, Vol. 1","review":"I was never interested in this manga because the title gave me the impression that it was a hyper series meant for kids. A friend loaned me the first volume recently and I felt obligated to give it a try. I was very pleasantly surprised!Initially, I was a little skeptical. The idea of the Joestar family whose duty it is to stand against the evil vampire Dios seemed a big formulaic and contrived, not to mention lame. Also, I wasn't too into the Western setting. Noblemen riding around in carriages just doesn't appeal to my imagination.. In addition, I couldn't get used to the art, which is extremely unique; the men are ridiculously huge (really tall, with huge shoulders and chests), and the women are very full-bodied and curvy. I found the design unappealing and awkward. I wasn't too fond of the main character's outfit, either; it's all black, with chains that don't have any purpose and what appears to be an extra belt. Even now that I've been won over and love the story, I still don't like his cap.Despite my misgivings, I was enjoying the story by page 22. The action scenes are a lot of fun and the story is definitely compelling. I even started enjoying the art. The concept behind the characters' supernatural abilities is pretty original, and the abilities that each individual has are well thought out. By the end of the volume, I was very ready to read more, and the story has grown on me a lot since then.The characters, especially the main character and his grandfather, are larger than life. In a way, that's good, but it also means that they're hard to relate to. Also, there's some grossness and gore; in one scene, a woman possessed by a parasite suddenly jabs a pen deep into a student's eye. However, as long as you like hardcore action stories with supernatural elements including vampires and super powers and don't mind the gore, this is an excellent choice."},{"Title":"JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, Vol. 1","review":"There are just too many good things to list about this series, all I will say is this definitely a manga series worth reading, though the violence may be too much for younger readers."},{"Title":"A Spiritual Guide to Money: How to Use Money for Personal Growth & Genuine Spiritual Experience","review":"This book helped me deal with the issue of money in a spiritual context, without the sappy sentimentality or wishful thinking of most of the prosperity oriented stuff out there.

Although the first three sections rely on standard story development techniques, the novel fails as a coherent whole. Readers who enjoy a work in which separate threads are tied up by the end of the work may leave this book dissatisfied.Each of novel's sections is distinct in style and voice. In the first section, D'Aguiar attempts to use magical realism to paint visceral intriguing images. The style appears forced and unnatural, with errors in point of view, and heavy reliance on adjectives and a preponderance of jarring metaphors. However, D'Aguiar does occasionally offer poignant and original images, such as the interior view of children playing dolls as they hear the sounds of a massacre approaching their door.Each section also spotlights different characters and locations: a young boy and his oddball family in a small village, the president and advisors of a dysfunctional South American republic, a mother struggling abroad in London. The lack of transition between sections is unsettling and forces the reader to identify common threads.As the novel progresses, the style of writing becomes less forced, more honest. By the 3rd section which focuses on the protagonist's mother, D'Aguiar writes succinctly and without guile.The final section, in which the protagonist writes a set of letters from limbo questioning his present and his future, do work in isolation from the rest of the novel. These letters might make a striking set of prose poems. In context of the novel, however, and the reader's questions around plot and meaning, they offer only empty calories. Tasty but not nutritious.The book is short, and while I only begrudge the time spent reading the clumsy first section, I'd not recommend it. If you're looking for something more satisfying in a similar vein, try Marquez."},{"Title":"An Incident at Krechetovka Station & Matryona's House: \\"We Never Make Mistakes\\" Two Short Novels","review":"This is a collection of two short novels written by Nobel Prize-winning author Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn that appeared in the January 1963 issue of a Soviet literary magazine called &quot;Novy Mir.&quot;The first novel, &quot;An Incident at Krechetovka Station,&quot; centers around Lieutenant Zotov who works at one of the railway stations ensuring men and provisions make it to their proper destinations. One stormy night, full of wind and cold, an army straggler appears at the station, and it's up to Zotov to determine if he is who he says and what should be done with him.

In a word, the answer for Wilde is \\"nothing.\\" He argues that charitable attempts to help the poor both fail to help the poor but also \\"prolong\\" the disease that cause poverty. The disease, of course, is the system of capitalistic exploitation. It is wrongheaded, Wilde argues, to use the fruits of capitalism to redress the consequences of its rampages: \\"It is immoral to use private property in order to alleviate the horrible evils that result from the institution of private property. It is both immoral and unfair.\\" While Wilde is confident that the ravages of poverty will cease in a future socialistic society, he opposes all palliatives for the poor and oppressed in the meantime. That is one of the consequences of confining socialistic thought to merely theoretical and future-based considerations and failing to also make it activist, revolutionary and focused on the present.Wilde's socialism of \\"voluntary association\\" of the future is individualistic (individuals should be free to choose their own work), anti-authoritarian, and government-less (largely anarchical). In fact, Wilde sees authoritarian socialism as constituting a worse state of affairs than capitalistic exploitation: \\"If the Socialism is Authoritarian; if there are Governments armed with economic power as they are now with political power; if, in a word, we are to have Industrial Tyrannies, then the last state of man will be worse than the first.\\"Wilde extols the prospects of an anti-authoritarian socialistic society because of its potential to actualize individuality. But Wilde's individualism has a kind of hierarchy about it--one, it is impossible to fail to notice, that leaves persons like himself at the top: \\"These are the poets, the philosophers, the men of science, the men of culture--in a word, the real men, the men who have realised themselves, and in whom all Humanity gains a partial realisation.\\" Apparently, those given to other vocations are not quite as \\"real\\" and can only partially realize these Olympian heights.Soon Wilde's discussion of individualism acts as an unstable catalyst, causing him to veer into a wide variety of topics often inexplicably. But the topics that preoccupy him for most of the work are aesthetic and literary concerns, especially as they relate to the relationship between individualism and artistic expression. While this discussion has some merit and interest, it is difficult to imagine why these peevish considerations require the lengthy treatment they receive in a work entitled \\"The Soul of Man under Socialism.\\"My reservations about Wilde's work notwithstanding, I do think this is a relatively important work to read. While the work as a whole lacks a coherence that could have made it more effective, many individual passages are keenly insightful and highly quotable."},{"Title":"The soul of man under socialism (The Humboldt library of science)","review":"This is probably the best essay I have ever read.

Capital \\"I\\" on individualist.I couldn't find a date for this writing, but I believe his legal problems and the rumors preceding his legal problems were actually the motivation, and not economics or politics.As many artists and I consider myself one, believe their work and their life are one. Oscar showed his colors as far as common people go. I could not imagine him an equal to a chimney sweep or a waiter.Oscar was hurt and he was attempting to argue that life style, and art, especially his, should be free from the common people's rules. Poetry was not controlled because nobody read poetry.I find Oscar Wild a very human elitist and although I thought it sad, I enjoyed his work immensely and this work was no different.(PS: I really appreciate Kindle books.

For me, its process felt unsuccessful, but at least there are many places that can be quotable.Quotable -- to the point that I wanted to, in a half-hearted daydream, to imagine using this text as a theoretical basis to look at Wilde's own creative work to see if he meets his own aesthetic standards.

Since its publication in the 1980s, it has won many admirers, but few detailed examinations, and most of what's in print, such as the guides of Andre-Driussi and Borski, are amateurish and self-published. In ATTENDING DAEDALUS: Gene Wolfe, Artifice, and the Reader (Liverpool University Press, 2003), Peter Wright presents the first critique of academic quality on Wolfe's masterpiece.ATTENDING DAEDALUS begins with a general introduction to Wolfe's body of writing, and two of his early stories are explored in depth, \\"Trip, Trap\\" and \\"In the House of Gingerbread\\". What I found especially enlightening here is that Wright presents the long series of critical reactions to Wolfe's work, even admitting that CASTLEVIEW is a problematic novel, and showing that OPERATION ARES was worth surpressing.Wright's examination of the Urth cycle is based on two aspects of the work that have gained wide consensus through discussion on the Urth mailing list and other fora. The first is the deceitful religiosity of the book. While the Hierogrammates seem divine, the Claw a holy relic, and the deluge upon the coming of the New Sun sacrificial, humanity is really only being manipulated by the inhabitants of Yesod into furthering their own ends. God is, in the final analysis, nowhere in the picture. The second is the unreliability of Severian as narrator. Wolfe attended introductory courses in psychology in Texas and later in Ohio, and Wright conjectures that here Wolfe would have studied historic cases of perfect memory, providing a model for Severian's behaviour. Just as historic mnemonists, such as \\"S.\\" studied by Aleksandr Romanovich Luria, were incapable of reflecting on their experiences, instead merely re-remembering events without analysis, so Severian stands between the reader and the true events of the work.With these in mind, Wright's main thesis is that the Book of the New Sun is the epitome of a very complicated literary technique devised by Wolfe in which the reader is consistently challenged and baffled, and yet consistently given the necessary keys to unlocking the plot. Wolfe also consistently reminds the reader that what he is reading is fiction through a continual stream of metaliterary allusions and jibes. Wright's assertion that all of Wolfe's novels after the Book of the New Sun are meant to provide a series of elucidations for its mysteries is sure to be controversial, but is for me nonetheless quite convincing in many instances.If you are a dedicated fan of Wolfe, having sought out everything he's ever put written and read the Urth cycle more times than you can remember, I would highly recommend ATTENDING DAEDALUS. With the intricacies of plotting revealed here, I appreciate Wolfe's skill more and more, and see him as one of the most significant English-language writers of our time. Don't heed what naysayers claim, this book is entirely dedicated to Wolfe's oeuvre and is very relevant to those investigating the Urth cycle."},{"Title":"Attending Daedalus: Gene Wolfe, Artifice and the Reader (Liverpool University Press - Liverpool Science Fiction Texts & Studies)","review":"I don't agree with Wright's thesis, but people complaining that it is written in the academic tone, or comes with a bibliography?

And to have it together in a compact form with Cabal, it is awesome! This hard to find book from UK is pure joy to us fans. You would expect this book to be heavy and thick, but it is not heavy at all. I don't know how the publisher did it, but it weighs (or feels) lighter than a regular book. Would love to see more Clive Barker volumes from this publisher. The copy I got is well worn but I expect that from being from the great imagination of Mr. Barker (a well read book is definately a compliment to the author of the book).Since first reading his Books of Blood, In The Flesh, and Inhuman Condition, I was hooked on this author. Brilliant storyteller indeed. He blows away anything King could ever write.

Doing so, they argue, would &quot;restore full employment, banish poverty and sustain economic activity.&quot;In the prologue, Fred Harrison defines economic rent as &quot;the value of land and natural resources after deducting the rewards that must legitimately accrue to those who invest labor and capital in and on the land (buildings, fences, drainage, and so on).&quot; He then points out that the idea of shifting taxes entirely off labor and capital and onto land values goes back hundreds of years, but did not become widely known and understood until the publication of Henry George's masterwork, &quot;Progress and Poverty&quot; (1879). George argued that, because land is in fixed supply, landholders are able to grow rich without working simply by levying tolls on the fruits of other people's labor -- not in exchange for services rendered -- but in exchange for mere access to the earth on which all humans must live, yet which none produced.More specifically, since the growth and progress of society tend to drive up land values, and since an increase in land values tends to come at the expense of wages (the return to labor) and interest (the return to capital), the paradox of increasing poverty amid advancing wealth is the direct result of allowing publicly created land values to be privately pocketed by a landed few at the expense of the productive many. To eliminate this paradox, and to uphold the true right of property (property in oneself and the fruit of one's labor), George proposed making land rent the sole source of public revenue -- a policy that was later dubbed the &quot;Single Tax.&quot;In &quot;Land and Taxation,&quot; the authors explain that the Single Tax is just as relevant and just as needed today as it was 120 years ago, and do an excellent job refuting the various myths propagated by neo-classical economists concerning the nature and role of economic rent -- including the myth that the concept of economic rent applies, not just to land, but to any factor of production that is in scarce supply."},{"Title":"Is the Homosexual My Neighbor?: Another Christian view","review":"The book is very informative as to the history of thinking of the church and its modern day views towards homosexuality.

I would have liked to read more about \\"why\\" (but then see below). And the style is couched in antrhopologist speak (e.g. calling her friends and aquaintances in Japan \\"informants,\\" ho ho) but then scholars have to tow the jargon if they are to be accepted as scholars.I would recommend this book to anyone as a fun and informative back door to understanding Japanese society, and as food for further thought.If I might be allowed to highlight one point, that I wish Hendry had addressed further... She cricises Barthes' (and Maruyama Masao's?) \\"empty center\\" theory with reference to the imperial palace, saying (in a moment of enlightenment, about herself too on p109) \\"In fact, contrary to Barthe's expectation, I think that the place does irradiate power of a certain sort, and the problem may lie in our Western propensity to want always to be unwrapping, deconstructing, seeing the objects at the center of things.\\" Here I think that Hendry really hits the nail on the head, but in so doing she challenges the notion of Japan being a \\"Wrapping\\" culture. Japan is a \\"wrapping culture\\" so long as you are a Westerner that expects there to be something inside. To the Japanese wrapping is not wrapping, but the real deal. The problem is that we attempt to find something inside. Perhaps the same criticism could be leveled at this review."},{"Title":"Robert Capa: Photographs (Aperture Monograph)","review":"Ordinary people caught under extraordinary circumstances are what give these images the power that they have and elicit pure empathy from the viewer.

As a teen, he planned a career as a reporter. Journalsim, he thought, would enable him to combine his loves of politics and literature. In the spring of 1936, he adopted the name Robert Capa, the name of an alter ego, the imaginary character of a glamorous American photographer.He photographed five wars from '36 to '54. The first was the Spanish Civil War. He'd been sent to Madrid to photograph Juan de la Cierva who, in 1923, had invented a forerunner of the helicopter. He stayed on in Spain because he felt an affinity with the warmth, exuberance, and generosity of the Spanish people. He went to Barcelona, (a penpal in the Fifties came from that area, Sabadell, and was a mill worker who learned his English from American sailors and Frank Sinatra records.), Andalucia, and Cordoba.General Francisco Franco launched a civil war in July, 1936, which changed Spain forever. He had the courage of his convictions and his photos show a compassionate study of people under extreme stress. He was a photographer of people, which is the opposite of me, as I choose buildings, things, birs, animals, historic places and such for my amateur picture taking.Unlike his friend Ernest Hemingway, he never felt he had to prove his courage to himself or to anyone else. He was intent on making better pictures, at great risk to his safety. Unlike Hemingway, he was very much a gentleman of the old school, coming from Europe, and \\"gentlemen don't brag.\\" He believed that one shouldn't tempt fate by bragging.On the battlefields of Spain, he learned that soldiers use theri terrible weapons of mass destruction only because they have been brainwashed into the ability to 'conceptualize' their victims not as individuals but as a category -- the 'enemy.'He died in Indochina when he stepped on aa nati-personnel land mine. He was buried by his mother in a Quaker cemetery instead of Arlington National Cemetery, which was an offer she refused."},{"Title":"Life After Baby: From Professional Woman to Beginner Parent","review":"Life After Baby is an invaluable resource for new mothers and mothers of young children. I wish this book had been around when my son was born! (He is now 5.) Unlike other books about motherhood that stick with the facts, try to allay concerns or answer a myriad of questions, Life After Baby is about how it feels to be a mother--and all the attendant joys and fears. The author interviewed lots of women and brings their voices to the pages. Their experiences, their questions, their beliefs, their confusion, their love, all spill out from the chapters. I found the book thought-provoking and as I read it I felt less alone, less isolated. Motherhood is so exhausting and after reading this I felt energized. I highly recommend it for anyone who has pondered the meaning of motherhood! It would make a great gift for a new mom."},{"Title":"Life After Baby: From Professional Woman to Beginner Parent","review":"Finally a book that is informative/non-judgemental on a variety issues, concise (which is extremely useful if the little one is already here!)and very enjoyable to read.

Almost every microlight pilot in Great Britain will have a copy on his/her bookshelves. It is considered to be the microlight pilot's bible. I used it myself when learning to fly microlights, and still go back to it each year to remind the gray cells what I'm supposed to be remembering.The chapters cover the theory of flight, how a flexwing flies, engine information, Air Law (applicable to UK and International, and although the US has a few different laws e.g. airspace, most is relevant in the USA).It has an excellent section on Meteorology, Brian is an expert on the weather, and he has the ability to explain the basics in an easy to follow way.Another section, on Navigation, covers traditional navigational skills, which will help a pilot to plot a course, stay on track, and recover when 'temporarily unsure of position'. Although the GPS seems to be the main method of navigation for many pilots these days, using traditional methods adds another fun dimension to flying. When the signal dies on the GPS, the map and compass methods will keep you heading in the right direction.If you are looking to expand your knowledge, or if you intend to fly microlights outside the USA, then treat yourself to a copy of this easy to read classic."},{"Title":"Microlight Pilot's Handbook (Airlife Pilot's Handbooks)","review":"G'day,This is a very good book, and any aspiring ultralite/microlite pilots should read this.Armin Hubert."},{"Title":"Captive Mistress","review":"This is a low-grade, early '80's-style historical \\"romance\\", where the hero, Michael, for no discernable reason other than he's been let down by love before, behaves like a caveman toward the heroine, Christina aka \\"Christy\\".

The hero actually rapes the heroine in the book's one & only so-called \\"love\\" scene but because of the heroine's attraction to him, it's supposed to pass as a love scene although words like \\"pain\\" and \\"tearing\\" are used, and she gets no pleasure from the act although she does end up pregnant from it...Yeech.It's also actually a very boring read, no doubt because the motivations of all the characters are so simplistic (they all seem to think with what's between their legs, instead of with their brains).

Dali, born in Figueres, Spain on May 11, 1904, is probably my favorite Surrealist painter.What I enjoy the most are the color plates; however, a close second is the illuminating commentary by Mr. Wach of which he discusses the works' styles as well as the psychological content, both in succinct detail.The book is broken up into six parts:*Preface and Acknowledgments, *Salvador Dali: An Introduction (including many pencil, ink and charcoal drawings as well as his life and influences,) *Colorplates (with commentary opposite pages,) *Biographical Chronology (full of seemingly day by day happenings of his life and works,) *Selected Bibliography and *Index.For those considering purchasing this book, here are most of the color plates (*** stars are favorites of mine):**View of Cadaques with Shadow of Mount Pani, ***Port of Cadaques (Night)[&quot;Contemporary witnesses recounted seeing the young Dali painting two canvases at once--one with his left hand and one with his right...one of the first hints at his later interest in double images and in stereoscopic vision.&quot; from the commentary. I love this haunting painting.] **Self-Portrait (Figueres,) **Still Life: Pulpo y Scorpa, **Still Life: Sandia [&quot;...he was concerned with the more formal relationships of shapes that characterize the art of Cubism...&quot;], **The Basket of Bread, **Femme Couchee, **Apparatus and Hand [...one of the most accomplished works of this period...this painting announces a fresh Mediterrean luminosity that was to stay with Dali, together with a more uninhibited repertoire of images and associations...&quot;], **The Bather, **Beigneuses [sic], **Dit Gros, Platja, Luna i Ocell Podrit (Big Thumb, Beach, Moon, and Decaying Bird), **Ocell...Peix, [...&quot;the painting's dark sky betrays its orgins in the Surrealist's experimental technique of grattage--a method of pictorial generation that relied upon the uncovered images formed by scratching back layers of ink or thin bitumen spread over preexisting work...&quot;], **The First Day of Spring, **The Profanation of the Host, **The Average Bureaucrat, **Au Bord de la Mer, **Shades of Night Descending [&quot;...drawn from childhood memories of the Playa Confitera, a beach known and loved for its candy-shaped pebbles...&quot;), **Memory of the Child-Woman, ***Sugar Sphinx [&quot;...The large expanse of sky creates a quietly contemplative effect that is unique and hints at the solemnity of the theme...&quot;], ***Portrait of Gala [I wish I could include the entire commentary!], **Skull with Its Lyric Appendage Leaning of a Night Table Which Should Have the Exact Temperature of a Cardinal Bird's Nest [love this wacky title], **The Weaning of Furniture Nutrition, **Decalcomania, **Morphological Echo, ***Three Young Surrealist Women Holding in Their Arms the Skins of an Orchestra, **Tristan Fou, **Daddy Longlegs of the Evening--Hope!, **Old Age, Adolescence, Infancy (The Three Ages), **Geopoliticus Child Watching the Birth of the New Man, **Christ in Perspective, ***The Disintegration of the Persistence of Memory, ***Nature Morte Vivante (Still Life-Fast Moving), ***The Discovery of America by Christopher Columbus, *** The Ecumenical Council [&quot;...The faith is mediated by the floating image of Gala as St. Helena,...The corss that she holds reflects the one in the hand of Christ, above her, who points upward to its spiritual significance...&quot;] ***Galacidalacidesoxiribunucleicacid [sic] (Homage to Crick and Watson)[say that fast three times! Heh.] and the final colorplate is from the book's cover, ***The Hallucinogenic Toreador.I have enjoyed perusing over this fine book. Recommended for eye-opening insight into Dali. A few of my favorites paintings, &quot;The Persistence of Memory,&quot; and just two or three others are missing. But for what you get here, its definitely 5 stars. A very well planned, and organized, fun to read volume. Bravo Wach!Breton's definition of Surrealism (from _Manifesto of Surrealism_ in 1924:)&quot;Surrealism, noun, masculine. Psychic automatism in its pure state, by which one proposes to express--verbally, by means of the written word, or in any other manner,--the actual functioning of thought. Dictated by thought, in the absensce of any control by reason, exempt from any aesthetic or moral concern. Encyclopedia, Philosophy: Surrealism is based upon the belief in the superior reality of certain forms of previously neglected associations, in the omnipotence of dream, in the disinterested play of thought. It tends to ruin, once and for all, the other psychic mechanisms and to subtitle itself for them in solving all the principle problems of life.&quot;Soar!"},{"Title":"Salvador Dali","review":"As a Dali fan I could not have asked for a better book.

It is also a well-crafted tale complete with romance and suspense. It is a page-turner that will make you eager to find out what happens next.Nikki is a flower-shop owner whose life is going nowhere. Her business is suffering due to the big box competition that has moved nearby. Her gift of creativity has left her. She spends her nights out drinking with her best friend, having casual sex, and waking in the morning to regrets and a hangover. When Damien, a returned Catholic with a past of his own, walks into her shop and places a $1000 order for 500 days of a single baby rose, she really doesn't know what to make of him. As Nikki finds herself facing an unplanned pregnancy for the second time in her life, she is eager to push Damien away but something keeps him coming back. Meanwhile \\"Big Mike\\" faces caring for his comatose wife against what seem to be insurmountable odds.The characters Bello has created are real. Like all of us, they are a mixture of good and evil, pure and impure motives. They struggle with their spirituality and their faith as we all do when faced with difficult circumstances. Decision-making is often not black and white. While Damien does have a few moments of being preachy, one gets the sense that is part of who he is. He has found his way back to the straight and narrow after walking on the darker side and he is eager to have others do the same. Ultimately, however, even he is forced to confront his own ulterior motives.\\"One Baby Rose\\" is valuable both as a story and for the questions it raises. It would make for wonderful reading for a high school or college ethics course. It would also spur a lively debate in a book club setting.

Evans Studies in the Philosphy and Criticism of Literature, No. 25)","review":"Prominent speculative fiction journal Locus Magazine, in choosing this book as recommended reading this year, noted this is probably only the first of the books on this subject: prolific science fiction author par excellence, C. J. Cherryh. If this is so, I look forward to the next, and hope they are as well done as Edward Carmien's gathered collection of essays.To me, diversity is one of the strongest points of this book. Essayists run the gamut from Cherryh writing companion Jane Fancher, science fiction reviewer and author John Clute, and publisher Betsy Wollheim to more academic writers such as Susan Bernando and Carmien himself. There's a touching and personal introduction by science fiction artist (and Cherryh's brother) David Cherry, who also contributed the cover art. The essays straddle Cherryh's fantasy and science fiction, taking care to include some of her earliest novels to her very latest--and better still, I found Carmien to be quite gutsy in his choice to include a few essays that were not entirely positive. In fact, I found those pieces to be some of the more thought-provoking in the book, and even in the midst of their frank manner they highlight some of the best aspects of Cherryh's style.I was delighted to find two essays devoted to CYTEEN, my favorite Cherryh work. Susan Bernando did an outstanding job in her essay \\"Of Emorys and Warricks: Self-Creation in Cyteen\\" and despite some gushiness revolving around the field of psychology, Elizabeth Romey did more-than-adequate justice to her topic, \\"Dr. Ariane Emory, Sr.: Psychopath-or Savior?\\" I've gotten something out of CYTEEN each time I've read it (one of the few books I've read multiple times, and not for the last time), but these two essays brought new facets to light, for further pondering.Preceding an extensive Cherryh bibliography, Carmien's own piece ends the essay section of the book. He covers interesting tidbits such as Cherryh's early history with DAW, how she feels her science fiction does in the marketplace as opposed to her fantasy work, Cherryh's financial viability as a writer, and women characters in her fiction."},{"Title":"The Cherryh Odyssey (I.

It teaches interpretation without necessarily understanding all the physics involved. It is only a little book, yet covers a suprising amount. It helped me to understand ECGs better for my third year MBChB exams."},{"Title":"The ECG Made Easy, 5e","review":"The book is very clearly written. The new edition (6th Edition) is printed on nice glossy paper in two-colours (helpful for ECGs). The book is very clearly written, and can be read in one sitting (several hours, unfortunately). The methods for reading ECGs are pretty good, and stresses the understanding of the underlying electrical conduction of the heart. The ordering of topics is well-thought out, starting with ECG introduction (placement of leads, what we are seeing, etc.) to conduction problems, to heart rhythms, to abnormalities in the P, QRS and T waves.I think the book is as simple as it gets for ECGs. It doesn't mark the exact location of the arrhythmias, but if you are a medical/health professional (or student), it should be assumed that you must know something about the heart (and conduction) prior to learning how to read the ECG. It probably also assumes that you are reading the book somewhat in sequence/order, so you actually know what the author is talking about when he comments on each of the ECG print-outs. If you cannot follow the comments for each of the graph, it probably means that you have missed a good portion of the book.There is a short section in the latest edition including 10 ECGs to test your own understanding. It's a bit less than ideal, but there is a companion book they are trying to sell...There are two companion books for this book that look equally good (haven't read those).

Everyone has been told to go out and buy the nearly ubiquitous book by Dubin. In my opinion, this book is vastly superior to Dubin's text. It manages to cover all of the basics of a full 12 lead EKG while explaining each additional piece of data in a step-wise and logical fashion. At no point did I feel like I was being pushed to memorize, but by the time I had finished reading the text (which you can do in one sitting) I felt a true understanding of what I was seeing in the EKG tracings. This book was recommended to me by a faculty member at my university who trained in the British system so I'm assuming it may have a larger audience outside of the U.S.So in summary, I think this book out performs Dubin's EKG text.

The three main charactures of this book are sisters growing up in a very disfunctual family in the 60's. I caught myself laughing out loud so many times, at the authors use of humor during some very un-humorous moments in the book. The characters are real, and reminded me of the different emotions I felt growing up. I think it is a gift for an author to write of shrewd and tragic situations with a sense of humor at the same time. If you enjoy a book that &quot;you cant put down&quot;...this is a book for you. I am excited to read more from this author."},{"Title":"Falling Angels","review":"Poor Norma, Sandy and Louise. The three Field sisters growing up in 1960s suburban Toronto live in a gloomy, comfortless world. Their father is demanding, difficult, and has dalliances on the side, and their mother, who dropped her baby son over the Niagara Falls many years ago, seeks solace in alcohol. The girls are the ones who take care of her and the house, going for groceries, cooking and cleaning, and trying to stop her from heading for the roof. But one day, one early morning, she does, and they cannot stop her.Barbara Gowdy seems to like the weird, the eccentric, the crazies. Falling Angelsis a tale of a dysfunctional family, with weird and unexpected events that lurk around every corner. It is a sad life these girls lead, and they each have their own coping mechanisms to deal with their family's problems, resulting in a book that is dark, honest, brutal, a little bizarre and funny at the same time."},{"Title":"Falling Angels","review":"Falling Angels is a rare novel.

But what I found was a book written before 1992 which was around the time importation was banned and hand raising and breeding birds within the United States had became more common. This resulted in very little information about todays common amazons. Also, this book described all the the precautions one must take to ensure the saftey of your wild caught bird, precautions that are now just plain useless!

I am quoting the ones I can remember: amazons, like all parrots, do NOT need to be fed grit; not only cherry, but a lot of other types of fruit tree wood are poisonous to parrots, including apple and apricot; acorns and celery are both harmful to parrots, and should not be fed to them. All in all, this is a guide to quickly and painfully disposing of your pet, and ought to be avoided. I don't give it one star mainly because it has some pretty pictures."},{"Title":"Amazon Parrots (Barron's Pet Owner's Manual)","review":"I also found this book extremely outdated (the original version was written in 1987 and there has been an enormous amount of research and experience with captive parrots since then that has revolutionized the way parrots are perceived and kept), with much information that is contradictory, confusing or incomplete. This is indeed a \\"dangerous\\" book for someone who knows little or nothing about Amazons (or parrots in general) and is looking for advice and information. Examples: In considering \\"Amazons as pets\\" the \\"warnings\\" are incomplete and/or euphemistic (most Amazons will outlive their care-takers; they not only \\"soil things\\", they are outright destructive if not constantly supervised; owning an Amazon, or any parrot, is a major committment to a labor-intensive responsibility that is time-, energy-, money- and attention-consuming and should not be undertaken lightly); the \\"Advice for buying\\" is terrible!! and any parrot book written these days, especially for the American market, is not complete if it does not mention the thousands of parrots that are given up every year to shelters and rescues - many of these birds are desperately in need of a good home and can be adopted by serious people; under \\"Dangers for your Amazon\\", fumes from Teflon pans in the kitchen are not mentioned and these can be speedily fatal; the diet advice is simply awful!; advice to breed to preserve the species that are threatened with extinction is completely wrong - parrots bred in captivity do not contribute in any way to preserving the species, as is now recognized by conservationists.At least one of the addresses given under \\"Information\\" is completely out of date; a large number of the references have nothing to do with Amazon parrots, but are about budgies, African grays or Australian parrots - Amazons, as the name implies, come from South and Middle America.Yes, the pictures are lovely, but the incorrect and misleading information make this book one that should be removed from the shelves.Anyone looking for good up-to-date parrot information can best consult the Internet - there are a myriad of excellent sites, with forums for questions. Here you can also get recommendations for books that will really be helpful, informative and up-to-date.

(Contemporary Political Theory)","review":"Where does the concept \`global civil society' stem from, what does it really mean today? Where will the vision contained in the concept lead us? John Keane, the founder of the Centre for the Study of Democracy (UK) and leading thinker in the field, offers readers a thorough and well-argued set of answers and wide-ranging questions to consider.\`Global Civil Society' has developed into a catchphrase within the current globalization debate. This scholarly analysis of its historical origins debunks some widely held myths and contributes to a much clearer conceptualization. Keane contends that past attempts to build global civil societies failed, drawing on examples from Christianity, Islam, ancient and more recent Empires and socialism Soviet style. To underpin his own definition of civil society, he cites numerous schools of thought. Characterizations range from very broad to very narrow. All concur that civil society is a counterbalance to government. Some see it as all encompassing - including all sectors of society except government. Others prefer a very narrow, idealist vision that restricts civil society to non-government, non-profit groupings that have a more or less common social and political agenda. Modern Global Civil Society, he argues, has to be understood against the backdrop of the failures of the past. Whereas he accepts that Western European intellectual elites of the 19th century were among the catalysts for current global societal developments, he refutes the criticism of those who consider today's vision of Global Civil Society a Northern concept imposed on the rest of the world. The presence of strong and growing movements from Southern countries proves his point.Global, regional or national inter-connected networks of widely differing non-governmental organizational configurations typify the modern civil society movements. Consequently, Keane states, global citizens today are not at all anti-globalization. Instead they are marked by a \`cross-border mentality', having created a \`special social space' from where they can challenge the powers that be, whether governmental or corporate. Keane identifies one important common thread among the movements: the mutual respect for diversity, compromise and connectivity.He also reminds us of the complex interplay of civil society movements with their societal counterparts. Governments and the corporate sector, in particular today's \`turbocapitalists', have played a major role and the evolution of civil society. Recognizing that the dynamics between civil society, governments and corporate business is often contradictory, Keane urges all players not to be discouraged in working towards a new global system of governance. He insists that what is needed is bold new democratic thinking for a new world governance system - an \`unprecedented world polity' - which he defines as \`cosmocracy'. Cosmocracy is an evolving and dynamic system. Even though we do not have all the answers and aspects of it appear confusing and chaotic, reading Keane impels us to boldly go where no society has gone before...While elements of this \`global conglomeration of interacting and overlapping institutions and processes' are in existence today, such as the UN, these are not adequate, as traditional thinking will not suffice. The diverse threats and vulnerabilities to global civil society can be addressed, he contends, as long as the gravest danger to its survival is prevented: fatalism.Keane's investigation represents a major contribution to current thinking on global civil society and world governance systems. The meticulous referencing to his sources through extensive footnotes offers the reader more than a glimpse into the academic debates surrounding the issues raised by his study. Anybody with an interest in socio-political studies would be well advised to use this book as a starting point for research and a guide to further reading.

I have never read anything like &quot;The Valley of Shadows.&quot; It has some of the most evocative writing I have ever encountered, and, in this edition, ranks as one of the best short novels of 19th century America. (Prof. Bray has wisely excised the latter chapters of Francis Grierson's &quot;memoir,&quot; and what remains is a compelling and very memorable work.) Grierson's descriptions of pre-Civil-War-Sangamon County, Illinois, the omens of war and suffering preceding Lincoln's election in 1860, and the religious hysteria of the times are unforgettable. His prose style is, to put it mildly, lyrical, but it is not in the least mannered or fussy. I think this book, more than any other except &quot;Huckleberry Finn,&quot; shows what the American Midwest was like in mid-19th century. Like &quot;Huck Finn,&quot; &quot;The Valley of Shadows&quot; is told from a child's point of view, and the feeling of wonder and confusion that comes from this choice of narrator is central to the book's charm. Perhaps best of all, the novel's characters, all beautifully differentiated and running a huge range from the comic to the deeply spiritual, are as unforgettable as any characters I have encountered. New readers of &quot;The Valley of Shadows&quot; are in for a big treat."},{"Title":"The valley of shadows (The Masterworks of literature series)","review":"Herbert Agar, in his seminal work THE PRICE OF UNION, touts Grierson's little book.

Grierson's book and A BORDER CITY DURING THE CIVIL WAR by Galusha Anderson were priceless sources describing St. Louis as the city began to split apart in 1861. Both books were published more than four decades after the War, but the events are described vividly."},{"Title":"The valley of shadows (The Masterworks of literature series)","review":"Francis Grierson gives a vivid account of his days in central Illinois near the Sangamon river.

It's a favorite of his. However, a few nights ago, the display on my Kindle Keyboard died (it was still under warranty and a new Kindle arrived today (Amazon has a WONDERFUL warranty policy, by the way)) and I had to re-download all the titles that I like to keep with me when I travel around -- including this one.However, the listing for The Saggy Baggy Elephant in my Kindle Library had changed to \\"Do Not Use - The Saggy Baggy Elephant\\" and no matter what I did, I was unable to re-load it into my replacement Kindle.I spent about 20 minutes in an online chat with Amazon's Customer Support (great customer service, by the way), but they were unable to re-deliver the title to me. Apparently, the publisher has re-formated this book to ONLY be compatible with the Kindle Fire. So, notwithstanding the fact that I had paid for a legitimate copy of this book, I was no longer able to access it. (No, I'm not upgrading to a Kindle Fire just to see a copy of this book.)So, buyer beware -- apparently Golden Books only wants Kindle Fire readers to access this book.

The characters in this story help Sooki the elephant realize he is just fine the way he is. It's an easy read with a sweet ending. Nice illustrations as well."},{"Title":"The Saggy Baggy Elephant","review":"A pleasant story on the adventure of a lonely elephant trying to find out what kind of animal he is.What attracted my oldest son to this book are the similarities of the elephant to Dumbo with the big floppy ears and small sized body. The book has about twenty-three pages with Sooki meeting other animals in the jungle.The Sappy Baggy Elephant begins with him dancing around in the jungle. While dancing his feet would pound the jungle so that it shook all around. Next his kicking would knock over trees as he continued further into the jungle.One day he met a parrot that asked him why he was shaking the jungle to pieces and asked him just what kind of animal he was. In answer to this question the elephant replied he had no idea what he was since he was alone. He had given himself the name Sooki and thought it suited him well. The parrot told Sooki that his ears and his nose were too big for him. He also thought his skin was much too big for him and suggested his name be Saggy-Baggy.The Saggy Baggy Elephant is a nice story of the elephant fitting in after all and finding his own kind in the jungle. This is a quick read and small enough for a toddler to hold and help turn the pages. The pictures are detailed and colorful.Many children can identify with the elephant feeling discouraged due to his large ears, nose and wrinkly skin. Along the way he meets many other animals similar to the way a child meets new kids that might not be friendly at first. We like to read this a few times a week. My son likes to see the page with the crocodile and the elephant blowing water out his trunk having fun. This also reminds me of the elephant scene with Bill Murray in the movie, Larger Than Life."},{"Title":"The Saggy Baggy Elephant","review":"This was (first published in 1947) and it is still delighting young readers and the young at heart to this day.

The twists and turns are unpredicatable which is a great change from so many other novels."},{"Title":"A HIGH WIND IN JAMAICA","review":"I found this book sort of a cross between Treasure Island and Huckleberry Finn, the former because the plot concerns children in the hands of pirates; but the style is more humorous and sophisticated, reminding me a bit of Twain, though more cynical, almost like Lord of the Flies. The first quarter of the novel covers the lives of the Thornton children in Jamaica in the mid-nineteenth cetury; it's this part that reminds me of Twain's writing and is about as interesting. Then the children set sail for England and are kidnapped by pirates, and suspense builds through the rest of the novel, along with a good deal of humor, some cynical, and some mildly shocking. The children, unsupervised, appear to be turning more evil than their pirate hosts. Unusual and amusing events described are just surprising enough to ring true. The author proposes that children are a different animal than people, an idea that was explored further in Mimsy Were the Borogoves, by Henry Kuttner and C. L. Moore (filmed as The Last Mimzy).I recently saw the film version of A High Wind in Jamaica starring Anthony Quinn and James Coburn; in a literal sense it follows the novel reasonably well, but as is always the case in adaptations the viewer can't experience the depth of the narrative, and some of the characters are not even established, let alone developed. However, there is a line at the end of the film that helps drive the point home, when a cab driver ironically tells Mr. Thornton that he must be proud of his children."},{"Title":"A HIGH WIND IN JAMAICA","review":"Richard Hughes knows how children think. He also knows how to write. Put the two together, and you get a pretty good book, a minor classic. The ending isn't \\"shocking,\\" and there is no real pedophilia, not even the hint of it. (Another reviewer referred to the captain playing with one young girl's \\"bottom\\": this implies you-know-what, but it is highly misleading. The captain goes down into the hold where the children sleep to check on them. He notices one young girl's night-shirt has bunched up at her neck. He tries to pull it down, and the young girl rolls over, still asleep, and sticks out her rump. The captain goes on to check the other children, and then, on his way out, flicks the girl's butt as you or I would flick at a fly. Nothing prurient, just playful.)There is a hint of sex (not rape) with regards to the oldest child, Margaret, who is 13, and post-pubescent. Strictly speaking this is not pedophilia, and bear in mind that in many parts of the world, young girls are married at this age.However, sex plays a minute role in the story. It is more about the psychological insights and empathy the author has with children, and the verisimilitude (ain't that a two-dollar word?) he conveys. This book is one of the MLA 100, and deserves to be read."},{"Title":"A HIGH WIND IN JAMAICA","review":"This book, originally titled The Innocent Voyage, is written a bit like Peter Pan -- poetic descriptions alternating with wicked character sketches and unflinching worldliness about children's savage &quot;innocence.&quot; An unforgettable adventure and coming-of-age story, one of the few that should appeal to both boys and girls. Richard Hughes gets inside Emily Bas-Thornton, in particular, the way few female authors, even, have succeeded in rendering the inner life of a young girl. A masterpiece of the English language and sensibility."},{"Title":"A HIGH WIND IN JAMAICA","review":"It is truly a shame that this book may be soon out of print. I first read the book when I was 10 years old and found it disturbing because the little 10 year old main was nothing like &quot;normal&quot; literary heroines. The next time I read the book I was in my twenties and understood themes in the book that pertained to adult perceptions of children. The third time I read the book, I picked up themes relating to perception of people in general.Although this is an &quot;adult&quot; book, I think it would make a great present for a child to share with an adult."},{"Title":"A HIGH WIND IN JAMAICA","review":"My adult reading class, ranging from 48 to 81 years, has just finished reading this book. We are all united in thinking it's one of the best tales we have read. It is high adventure, desperate tragedy, and hilarious comedy rolled into one. All completely believeable due to the well drawn characters. Even when being appalled at the careless treatment of the children we had to laugh out loud at the crazy situations."},{"Title":"A HIGH WIND IN JAMAICA","review":"I picked this book up at a used book sale because I'd heard of the name and it cost fifty cents. No one I knew had heard of it, much less read it, but I didn't have too much to lose except a couple of hours and the money to buy the coffee to be consumed during reading.So, out of the blue: Pirates!! Hooray!A High Wind In Jamaica is of course more than just some dumb book about pirates. It was later described to me as a 'Lord of the Flies' on a boat, and I after reading it I can associate with that. Kids and violence and lies and pirates and whatnot, with a smattering of philosophical wandering on the nature of kids in general (mother and father cling to the idea of their kids; the kids forgot about them quickly).Overall, I'd say that the prose sings, zips along incredibly fast (read the book in a single sitting) and is engaging. The author covers deeper meaning with an engaging story and works the two together very well.I've recommended the book to a lot of people, and the few who've bothered to track it down concur: it's a great little book."},{"Title":"A HIGH WIND IN JAMAICA","review":"This was one of my father's favourite books, and the lucky person who gets to read this instantly sees why. Although it's many years since my one and only reading, the extraordinary 'story' qualities of this novel are a long way from being forgotten, or surpassed in other novels I've since read. However, the most striking element of the book, without any doubt, is the remarkable accuracy and simplicity with which Richard Hughes represents the world of children, the protagonists. Never have I read such a perfect description of the motives for children's actions, their perception of facts and deeds, and the accompanying dialogue. Complementing this is the reaction of adults, their own surprise, and quite simply one of the most spellbinding stories to plunge into. This book cannot be recommended enough."},{"Title":"A HIGH WIND IN JAMAICA","review":"Hughes' penetrating insight into the psychology of children isall the more startling for being written in the 1920's when theromantic conception of idyllic childhood innocence and fragility prevailed. The parallels with recent events are striking. The lionization of the captured children upon their return to England as well as their traumatic experiences during the ordeal at sea presages the Elian Gonzoles saga. Like Emily in &quot;High Wind...&quot;, Elian, no doubt has relegated his memory of his loss of his mother to a fairly insignificant section of his consciousness. Like the children of &quot;High Wind...&quot;, he has become adept at exploiting his celebrity. Like the hapless adults in &quot;High Wind...&quot;, the participants in the Elian affair are mistaken in their evaluation of the actual impact of the events on the child's worldview and misinterpret (and often as not misrepresent) his reactions. Hughes' depiction of how suggestion can be used to implant or distort young memories is also prescient and compelling. Recent highly publicised cases of false accusations of horrific child abuse based upon repressed memories extirpated by psychiatric therapists are eerily prefigured in Hughes' novel.Hughes' basic premise that we cannot presume to understand the alien thought process of children remain true to the present day. His novel is a masterfull and engaging exploration of this theme."},{"Title":"A HIGH WIND IN JAMAICA","review":"On its surface, Hughes' High Wind in Jamaica is the story of two families of young cchildren, sent home to England by their parents following a cataclysmic hurricane that levels their plantation in Jamaica. Subsequently the children are kidnapped by pirates; the book follows their story until their eventual return to England. The pirates turn out to be, for the most part, well-intended and even protective of the children, but by the end of the story the same cannot really be said of the children themselves, whose behavior at points seems threatening and malevolent by comparison to their captors.Others have made a comparison between this book and \\"Lord of the Flies,\\" both because of their stories of children torn apart from the moorings of civilization, and for their undercurrent emotion of malevolence, darkness, and evil. To my mind, Hughes' intent is broader than that, and I actually prefer \\"High Wind\\" to its rival. Hughes is also exploring a more general theme of alienation and the kind of moral emptiness that accompanies it: child vs. adult, plantation owners vs. slaves, the wild of Jamaica vs. the civilized form of the British Empire, each unknowing and thus cruel to the other.The ending is actually shocking, a perfect end to this highly unconventional but perfectly-pitched book. One of my \\"best ever\\" novels."},{"Title":"A HIGH WIND IN JAMAICA","review":"This is a wonderful book. Short, swift and very bloody, Hughes tells a story of children as seperate from adult human nature and explores the ways in which children can cope with danger and catastrophe in the light of the usual adult nervous fumbling. It is a psychological portrait, but is so much more as well. An exciting action-adventure; an epic on nature and the sea; a ruthless story of pirates in the age of their decline; a terrifying masterwork detailing the lies all people must tell themselves in order to survive.It is difficult to sum up exactly what is going on throughout the book, event leading to action leading to betrayal leading to another fun game. In the end the book might even be read as a comedy--that of a pessimist attacking both human nature and the world--and I must admit that throughout several of the more harrowing scenes I found myself laughing in self-defense.Great, great stuff, beautifully written and compelling. I wouldn't presume to guess how any one individual might take it and that, to me, the unexpectedness of the whole thing, is what constitutes some of the greatest masterpieces. Very highly recommended--"},{"Title":"A HIGH WIND IN JAMAICA","review":"I'll never be able to say the MLA's list of the greatest novels of the 20th Century was a total waste, because it made me aware of this book's existence.I'd never heard of \\"A High Wind in Jamaica,\\" and had a hell of a time trying to find it---I ended up in the basement of a branch of my public library (I guess I shouldn't be endorsing the use of libraries on Amazon's site, but I can't afford to buy every book I want to read---sorry, Amazon). Once I started it, I couldn't put it down.I'm always wishing I could find books like the ones it seems are only written for children. Kids get great books---full of adventure and fantasy and harrowing escapes, etc. It always sounds fun to go back and read books that enthralled me as a kid so I can recapture the same feelings that filled me then. But it never works. I can never get into kids' books in the same way, no matter how hard I try.\\"A High Wind in Jamaica\\" is like a children's book written for adults. It's got all the right elements: tropical locations, a harrowing storm, pirates, murder. But the psychological element Richard Hughes gives to the story adds a dark, brutal dimension that children's books are often missing altogether or only skate briefly by.This novel has a wonderful way of seeing events through the eyes of a child, and it functions as a sort of warning not to forget that children, though maybe possessing less life experience than adults, are capable of feeling the same emotions and, more importantly, have the potential to be just as brutal. In fact, Hughes suggests that children may actually be more brutal, since they have less of a knowledge base from which to understand and weigh consequences.I don't want to make this book sound over burdened with rhetoric and psychobabble, however. It's a fast-paced, tense novel, with a menacing tone constantly present just under the surface. Hughes creates beautiful images of Jamaica in the book's early chapters, and paints a vivid picture of life at sea later on.If I actually had any money, I would buy the rights to this book, because it would make a great movie."},{"Title":"A HIGH WIND IN JAMAICA","review":"Richard Hughes's &quot;A High Wind in Jamaica&quot; is a subtle dark comedy that explores the contrast between how adults and children perceive their surroundings and the psychology of child-adult relations. Written in a loose, informal style, it is a fast, fun, yet compelling read.The Bas-Thorntons are an English family living on an estate in Jamaica some time in the late 19th Century. They have five children ranging in age from about twelve to three. When their house is demolished in a hurricane, the parents decide to send the kids back to England to spare them from future potential danger and emotional trauma.The kids sail back to England on a small ship called the Clorinda, accompanied by two friends whose parents also are staying in Jamaica. Soon the Clorinda is overtaken by a schooner bearing pirates, who rob it of its cargo and kidnap the children. It is not the pirates' intention to detain the children for long, but the captain of the Clorinda, believing that the pirates have murdered the kids, escapes the encounter and notifies the Bas-Thornton parents of the unfortunate incident.The pirates, as the children soon discover, are not very menacing and not very competent in the moribund business of piracy. They stop at a coastal village in Cuba and try to auction off all the cargo from the Clorinda but meet with indifference from the villagers. Failing to slough the kids off on the village's Chief Magistrate, the pirates resume cruising around the Caribbean with a cargo of unwanted brats. As the kids eventually adopt the schooner as their new playground, the pirates' captain begins to take on a role akin to a hapless school bus driver, a fortuitous babysitter and awkward disciplinarian. Meanwhile, the kids fantasize about becoming pirates themselves and taking over the ship someday.Two important events in the story involve the deaths of two characters, one by accident and the other by murder. Neither is directly the pirates' fault, but they must stand trial for the crimes when they are betrayed by the children after their &quot;rescue.&quot;From reading this plot summary, you can tell that this book is bursting at the seams with irony. As other reviewers have pointed out, it could be compared to William Golding's &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot; (which it predates) and O. Henry's &quot;The Ransom of Red Chief&quot; (which it doesn't), but it avoids the serious sociopolitical implications of the former and the shallow slapstick of the latter, ultimately finding an original niche somewhere between the two."},{"Title":"A HIGH WIND IN JAMAICA","review":"Richard Hughes's 1929 odyssey, A High Wind In Jamaica -- which has been included in the Modern Library's List of \\"The 100 best English-language novels of the century\\"--forces the reader to revisit that moment when children lose their innocence to the world; that diaphanous transference from childhood to adulthood that can be so heartbreakingly revelatory. In this tale, it rides in on a torrent of bad weather seemingly induced by an earthquake.Emily Bas-Thornton has just turned ten in Jamaica and has had a wonderful birthday exploring the island, meeting a group of indigenous people and receiving their good faith gifts. But just a few days later, Margaret Fernandez, a neighbor, a bit older then Emily, announces that she can smell an earthquake. Thus the trouble is ushered in as the children cartwheel across the rumbling ground, and their pet, a feral cat, is pursued by predators through the Bas-Thornton house and into the jungle where its otherworldly yowls punctuate the night.Soon afterward the Bas-Thornton's decide to ship their five children back to England. From this point in the novel, things go terribly wrong as the young troupe is mistakenly kidnapped by a hapless band of Caribbean pirates. Hughes's quirky writing style enhances the dream-like quality of the narrative: seemingly important characters die without the bat of an eyelash, good seems bad, and right seems wrong from the vertiginous heights of the reader's crow's nest.From the primitive wilderness of the Caribbean Islands to the hyper-civilized atmosphere of an English Central Criminal Courtroom, the novel follows a logical if allegorical arc; but does Hughes mean to describe this arc as progressive or regressive?A High Wind in Jamaica is one of those books that lulls the reader into a long and languorous torpor. Then it shakes you, slaps you and says \\"snap out of it\\"."},{"Title":"A HIGH WIND IN JAMAICA","review":"This review will be short and read about as fast as this excellent book. I'm so glad I found it, late in life as it is - when I can appreciate language and character-study. The other reviews reveal the thread of the story, but none seem to mention Hughes' craft in juxtapoisng the characters with fate. Not their particular fates, fate in the large sense. Mr. Hughes presents situations more comfortable in reality, not fiction - but, of course, that is what good authors delight in. There are children and adults here, but they mix like oil and water. Natural disaster (applied to loss and human suffering), the physical properties of water, wind, and the motion of ships all clash with character options - what we call happenstance. These options prove just as fallable after everyone is safely ashore, where old and young struggle to co-operate in a conclusion to the adventures of chance, which fate controls there as it blindly condemed and saved on the sea. Justice and maturity might be the overriding theme of High Wind in Jamaica - a teriffic novel that shouldn't be compared to Lord of the Flies, which explores another path (absence of adults among boys facing adversity). How Hughes convincingly represents the reasoning of pirates, court officials and children of both sexes is why this novel is a gem."},{"Title":"A HIGH WIND IN JAMAICA","review":"I first read this marvelous book as a young teenager. At the time I was appalled, even a bit frightened, by the story of Emily.Having just reread the novel, I liked it as much as then, but found I had recollected it differently, or perhaps misunderstood the story. I was, this time, somehow not quite as appalled. Probably the fact of having seen too many bland fictional killings on TV since then has numbed me to the effect of violence.More importantly, this time I had a strong sense that, beneath the adventure story, this book is a work of philosophy. It is all about what we are as humans, and particularly what we adults once were as children. The author's opinion seems to be that children are savages concealing themselves beneath a mere spider's web of polite respectability. I am sure he is right about that, but I would add that, at base, adults are no different."},{"Title":"A HIGH WIND IN JAMAICA","review":"I almost didn't read this book when it was compared to Lord of the Flies, but I found it to be more like Animal Farm myself. Maybe I read too much into it, but I thought the opening sentence, \\"One of the fruits of Emancipation in the West Indian islands is the number of ruins...\\" set an interesting tone of the obstacles of emancipation whether in children, slaves, or through revolutions. There are scenes where the church's good intentions lead to death, scenes where assumed loyalties mean next to nothing, scenes of people (or causes) overly impressed with their own importance, scenes where pigs (governments?) are referred to such as, \\"You would never have thought that the immobile mask of a pig could wear a look of such astonishment...\\" and (also refering to a pig) \\"When Destiny knocks the first nail in the coffin of a tyrant, it is seldom long before she knocks the last\\", and scenes towards the end where history is conveniently rewritten. It interesting to me that this book was written in the 1920s -- maybe it was a stretch of my imagination, but I could see a lot of Russian revolution in the book. That is not the amazing part though, the amzing part is that so many take-overs, wars, conflicts, and liberations since seem to have followed (and continue to follow) similar patterns as those of the children in the book. Anyway, enjoy! It kept me interested while making me think!"},{"Title":"A HIGH WIND IN JAMAICA","review":"I must have re-read \\"A High Wind In Jamaica\\" at least a dozen times since first reading it in high school. It remains one of my favorite novels. It is a finely-drawn portrait of a certain era, but its depiction of the fears and fantasies inside the children's heads is timeless. Its humor, though definitely on the dark side, is first rate: there are passages that never fail to make me laugh out loud, despite the fact that I have read them many times before. The ending, however, is disquieting, and it is easy to see why this novel is often compared to \\"Lord of the Flies.\\""},{"Title":"A HIGH WIND IN JAMAICA","review":"There's a peculiarly boring film version of this, made in the 1960s, which is interesting only because it features the English novelist Martin Amis, then a fetching blond teenager, in a supporting role. Good books often make bad films, and this is a very good book indeed. Richard Hughes had never been to Jamaica when he wrote this remarkably vivid story about a colonial family in the nineteenth century. Jamaica, as Hughes describes it, is a wild and lush paradise for the Bas-Thornton children - but a paradise from which they are soon to be expelled. After a hurricane devastates the island, their parents decide that the five children (Martin's one of them, in the movie) must be sent back to England. But they have not got far before their ship is attacked by pirates, and the children are kidnapped. The ordeal which follows is a dramatic and unexpected one - for the children, led by the tomboyish Emily, are more than a match for the brutal Captain Jonsen and his crew. Not a children's book as such, but a novel about childhood, this powerful adventure story has been compared to William Golding's Lord of the Flies (1954). The vivid, laconic style is a considerable achievement - and the ending, especially the last sentence, is one of the wonders of literature."},{"Title":"A HIGH WIND IN JAMAICA","review":"Someone sent me this book out of the blue. I read it not knowing anything about it.Coincidentally, I was reading a book about William Blake and young London children at the same time; and one of those 'pirate' movies was making the rounds of cable TV. \\" High Wind\\" is instantly interesting, the descriptions are vivid and different from most, and the 'inner view of the perceptions of the children' is disturbing; probably like reality. The story moves along briskly, but sort of stalls out in the middle; on the pirate ship. Since there is no plot, but just sort of a meandering interconnected series of happenings (like real life), it's impossible to know where we are being led. Until the very end (which coincidentally, for me, coincided with the Casey Anthony trial on TV) I was not impressed. I was impressed and moved with the ending. Which reinforced the reality that we really never know the truth. ( in the 70's, Donovan sang \\"love is hot, truth is molten\\"). The book is much too short. It feels to me like a fragment, or part 1 of a longer tale never written. Considering when it was written, it's impressive. But I would not recommend it. I am pretty sure that people I know would not like it as much as I did. It's odd."},{"Title":"A HIGH WIND IN JAMAICA","review":"Not as exciting as Lord of the Flies, this tale of children held by pirates who will come to deeply regret having taken them on board is a worthwhile read, if somewhat old fashioned. Just keep your internet connection handy if - there are a good number of nautical terms you'll be wanting to look up!"},{"Title":"A HIGH WIND IN JAMAICA","review":"Sometimes you pick up a book you knew little about, pour through its pages, and think that somewhere, somehow, you had read this book before or one which was so similar. This is one such book.Ensconced with the unique perspective of children -- ages 3 to 12 -- required to fend for themselves, the plot of this novel seeks to prove to the reader that children can be perceived as midgets or miniature adults. They can take much better care of themselves than we would ever imagine. They are equally capable of great adventure.This book involves children who are intertwined with pirates. This 1929 novel and \\"Peter Pan\\" (1902) have something in common. But, this is not comical. This is a serious novel on a very parallel set of facts. The oldest -- a girl (Wendy?) -- down to the youngest must find a way to overcome the pirates or at least survive capture by pirates. They do.This book deals with children on the open sea with wild tigers. This 1929 novel and \\"The Life of Pi\\" (2001) have something in common. This book involves horrid acts committed before the eyes of the children. Something this 1929 novel and \\"The Painter Bird\\" (1965) have in common. And, the children make it through their adventure, in spite of being part of and being witness to man's inhumanity to man. Something this 1929 novel and \\"Pi\\", \\"Painted Bird\\" and \\"Peter Pan\\" also allow.And there are the trifles and quarrels between the youth. Something this 1929 novel and allegorical \\"Lord of the Flies\\" (1954) have in common.This book has either directly or indirectly influenced so many other great novels which delve into the complexities of youthful interaction with adults. And, to make the novel more complex, it defies all stereotypes. The pirates are humane, not Peter Pan goofballs or Treasure Island's irreproachable characters of improper breeding and education. The children are perceptive and observant, not lumps on logs whose wide-eyed impressions fail to reduce to logic who they are with and how to make the best of the extremely bad situation they are placed in.In the end, adults of the community can only perceive the pirates as bad, and the children as innocent. But, little Rachel has some evil in her that rivals Hollywood's \\"Little Chucky.\\" And, those who are around the impish tyrannical child, know not to defy her mandate nor tread near her, for something may happen to them which the pirates themselves would (did) abhor and decry as beyond the pirate's oath.Hughes' 1929 writing style is different than most anything I have read of this period. It is sharp, it is confined, and it is without excess. Hughes's topic as well as his style are what make this book so wonderfully different and enjoyable. After reading this, I think I will soon reread Golding, or others who I believe were influenced by this classic."},{"Title":"A HIGH WIND IN JAMAICA","review":"Surprising.

What I feel shame for, however, is that I had never even heard of the novel until it appeared on Modern Library's list. Now I rank it among my favorites.What impressed me most about the work is the number of levels upon which it works. A child could easily read this book as an adventure story, while an adult would read it and grasp the minute horrors that its children face. To say this is a masterstroke of its author would be putting it mildly. Very few authors can successfully pull it off, and Hughes deserves any and all recognition he receives for that accomplishment alone.

It has plenty of elements of dirty reality that keep it on firm ground, or at least a solid wooden deck.

I downloaded a taster onto my Kindle but didn't get a chance to look at it. Then I forgot I had the sample until recently when, on a long train journey, I finished the book I was reading. I skimmed through the Kindle list and found the forgotten sample. The opening chapters gripped me immediately.Richard Hughes brings to life a disturbingly vivid vision of Victorian Jamaica as he takes his reader into the middle of an odd family of children who live on a run down sugar plantation. By the time I'd finished the sample I was hooked and wanted to know what happened to Emily and her brother John. I clicked the \\"buy this book button\\" and downloaded the whole novel on a train speeding through Grantham towards London.The story is told mostly from ten year old Emily's viewpoint so the action unfolds as she understands it. Their unaccompanied voyage back to England is rudely interrupted when the ship they are travelling on is seized by pirates To Emily it is a fine adventure but an adult reader notices many unsettling insights into a brutal world. The twists and turns of the tale are unpredictable and the ending an unexpected shock. All in all a gripping read which I couldn't put down until I reached the final page. And then I was left wondering just what happened to Emily after the novel ended."},{"Title":"A HIGH WIND IN JAMAICA","review":"I have just begun reading New Yorker critic James Wood's wonderful handbook,HOW FICTION WORKS, and so am particularly attuned to questions of narrative voice: who is telling the story, with whose thoughts, and for what audience? A perfect focus for Richard Hughes' 1929 novel, a subversive masterpiece of apparently straightforward narrative used for disturbing ends.Hughes writes like an adult telling stories to children. He is not a parent, but black-sheep Uncle Richard with a deliciously cavalier attitude towards convention. The book begins with five English children leading a carefree life on a run-down plantation in mid-nineteenth-century Jamaica. Their parents having little time for them, they amuse themselves by such pursuits as catching small animals and swimming. Here is Emily, the eldest girl: \\"Once, when she was eight, Mrs. Thornton had thought she was too big to bathe naked any more. The only bathing-dress she could rig up was an old cotton night-gown. Emily jumped in as usual: first the balloons of air tipped her upside down, and then the wet cotton wrapped itself round her head and arms and nearly drowned her. After that, decency was let go hang again: it is hardly worth being drowned for -- at least, it does not at first sight appear to be.\\" Decency go hang -- how great for a child! You would not find such laissez-faire attitudes in genuine Victorian children's literature such as E. Nesbit'sTHE RAILWAY CHILDREN, and you certainly don't find it in C. S. Lewis' high-mindedCHRONICLES OF NARNIAa quarter century later. But what about that authorial aside, \\"at first sight\\"? A warning of more serious trespasses still to come?Or consider this passage. The children, on a visit to a neighboring plantation, are swimming in a lagoon. It is heavy, close, and suddenly very still: \\"The water of the bay was as smooth and immovable as basalt, yet clear as the finest gin: albeit the swell muttered a mile away on the reef. The water within the pool itself could not reasonably be smoother. No sea-breeze thought of stirring. No bird trespassed on the inert air.\\" By giving nature a well-bred sense of decorum with his \\"reasonably,\\" \\"thought,\\" and \\"trespassed,\\" Hughes is playing to the children -- but the comparisons to basalt and gin are disconcertingly adult. The switches of voice, together with the brilliant description of the earthquake which follows, keep the reader off-balance for a page or two; but when it is over, he returns to Emily, surprised that her hosts take the Big Event as a matter of course: \\"How funny Creoles were! They didn't seem to realize the difference it made to a person's whole after-life to have been in an Earthquake.\\"Soon it will not be merely a matter of stylistic hints, though these have laid the groundwork. The story proceeds like a wonderful adventure. The children survive a hurricane, but are shipped off to England for safety. Their ship is captured by pirates and they remain on the pirate boat for several weeks, getting dirty as mudlarks, climbing the rigging, and making friends with the ship's menagerie, which at one point even includes a lion and a tiger. But animals from the beginning have been more than childhood playmates -- more like predators and prey, and a primal image of an animality that the children themselves share. Not that Uncle Richard's child listeners would notice; he already has them in thrall. But imagine the shock in their bright eyes when he suddenly kills off one protagonist, involves another in homicide, and makes to drown a third. And any adults reading over his shoulder would certainly pick up on the burgeoning sexuality and loom of puberty just over the horizon. Not a story for children, after all.The children turn out to be more feral than the basically benevolent pirates, but it is not evil coming out, so much as the inherent amorality of childhood, the darker side of innocence. I thought, of course, of William Golding'sLORD OF THE FLIES(1954), but while Hughes' actual events are less horrific than Golding's, the implication of that horror is more pervasive. Golding wrote of the breakdown of boarding-school order into savage mob rule; Hughes' children are in their natural anarchic state to begin with and they keep a sort of innocence to the end. To some extent, Golding was writing a political novel in the shuddering transition from hot to cold war. Hughes would go on to write political fiction later, in his planned trilogy on the rise of the Second World War that began withTHE FOX IN THE ATTICin 1961, but here he is doing something deeper; his battlefield is mapped by Freud and Jung. Yet he was subliminally aware of the currents of his time. I cannot do better than quote the ending of Francine Prose's fine introduction to the NYRB edition: \\"Published in 1929, just as history was preparing events that would forever revise the terms in which one could talk about innocence and evil, A High Wind in Jamaica is one of those prescient works of art that seems somehow to have caught (on the breeze, as it were) a warning scent of danger and blood -- that is to say, of the future.\\""},{"Title":"A HIGH WIND IN JAMAICA","review":"I thought this might be more graphic, but much of the drama and suspense is more understood than explained. The ending was a suprise. A very entertaining story, makes me want to look for more works from this auhor."},{"Title":"A HIGH WIND IN JAMAICA","review":"I heard about this classic novel on one of those \\"Summer Reads\\" lists and since I enjoy sea novels, I thought I'd give it a try. The story holds up well after 80+ years and works well as such, complete with pirates and adventure on the high seas. and it is an interesting psychological study of both children and adults. It's a good book to take to the island of your choice, or just enjoy in your backyard."},{"Title":"A HIGH WIND IN JAMAICA","review":"Quite unlike any other book before and very few since. I think the movies have taken up the wicked children idea more than novel writers have. One child stabs a bound captive to death and blames it on the bumbling pirates who have kidnapped her and gets them hanged. Lots of other other grim incidents but also many hilariously funny ones, and wonderful description of sea and tropical life. He writes from multiple points of view as well as an omniscient narrator, so seamlessly that you never notice the transition."},{"Title":"A HIGH WIND IN JAMAICA","review":"I'd like to read it, but it is too difficult with all the crazy characters in my Kindle edition. This has happened to me enough times that I am starting to revert to buying cheap used books (which have the benefit of being sharable)."},{"Title":"A HIGH WIND IN JAMAICA","review":"I came to this book with high expectations. It is not only listed amongst the top 100 novels of the 20th c. by the Modern Library, but is also mentioned by Anthony Burgess on his own top 100 novels list. One Amazon reviewer whose literary tastes I admire also heaped praise on it.About all I can say positively for it is that it's an easy read and flows by rather swiftly. My main quibble is with Hughes' overly febrile imagination. It definitely gets the better of him after the children are pirated away off the Cuban coast. Hughes' depiction of Emily's sexual awakening borders on the disquieting. She's only ten years old, after all. The even yonger Rachel has her upturned bottom smilingly explored by the pirate captain while she is sleeping in a scene closer to De Sade than to Golding. Such scenes are passed off as innocent encounters, yet the underlying tension is not so easily dismissed. Freudians would no doubt have a field day with this novel.I enjoy dark satire and psychological exploration in novels. I suppose one can approach the novel from that perspective, but I can only say I've seen it done much more adroitly than Hughes manages here. He depicts the psychology, without any motivation behind it. That is a fatal flaw for a writer. The overly eccentric children's behavior is entirely enigmatic and uncontrolled, which reflects a rather Hobbsian or Calvinist world view. These are definitely not Rousseau's noble savages prancing about the yardarms. They are feral little time bombs, wreaking bloodshed and misery on the adults who intend them no harm. In that sense, they are indeed like Golding's barbaric little band of boys. They have no internal moral compass, no code of behavior, save what is expedient for them.Even that wouldn't be so bad, if the satire were fleshed out with a bit more more humor, a la Swift. Though some readers found humor in the novel, I just couldn't fathom where. At its core, it's one of the most cynical works I've ever read. It's the novelistic equivalent of reading Juvenal or Rochester, sans the great wit that underscored their satirical poems. Suffice it to say that I won't be including it on my personal list of 100 top novels of the 20th c.BEK"},{"Title":"A HIGH WIND IN JAMAICA","review":"This was a great book. The only thing to know is that Richard Hughes is not politically correct when referring to Jamaicans of African descent. It was written 1929. I actually think the story would not be affected by making this language a bit more politically correct at the next printing."},{"Title":"A HIGH WIND IN JAMAICA","review":"If I remember correctly, this book was first published in the 1960's. The writing may be difficult for some to read, though, because it reads like first-person novels written in the 1800's. But if you were enamoured by WUTHERING HEIGHTS, JANE EYRE, and HOUNDS OF THE BASKERVILLES, you will fall right into the story line about a group of upper class English children sailing from their homeland in Jamaica to boarding school in England. At first the book may seem a little slow, but the pace picks up when the children's merchantman ship is attacked by pirates, and they are taken hostage. This is a book I recommend teachers in the upper elementary grades and middle school read to their classes. You will be assured of many lively discussions. If you do a unit on pirates, there are many excellent nonfiction books to read for background information. Many books are still being published that continue the myths about pirates making hostages walk the plank, burying treasure, and being feared by everyone. (Pirates who lived during the Golden Age of Piracy occasionally threw people overboard and seldom buried treasure but rather spent their proceeds in port. Also, people seldom feared pirates, because they came into port ladened with cheap goods the citizens needed, and they spent their proceeds in the local shops!) A good novel portraying pirates accurately to read to your classes is The Diary of a Slave Girl, Ruby Jo. And of course, A High Wind in Jamaica!"},{"Title":"A HIGH WIND IN JAMAICA","review":"Book arrived on time for book group review and was in condition described. Strange story.

Maybe I just am not smart enough."},{"Title":"A HIGH WIND IN JAMAICA","review":"The characters, the plot, and everything else in this book are extremely boring. The only thing keeping this from a 1 star book is the character Emily. She alone has creative and unique thoughts floating around in her head. I'm glad I read it because she amused me so much. But as for the rest of the book, it was not worth writing, and the ending was infuriating."},{"Title":"A HIGH WIND IN JAMAICA","review":"Wow. I thought this book would be a masterpeice after all the reviews I've read about it. I must say, I was quite disappointed.The pace was slow. Saying the fact simply is probably the best way to say it. Chapters at a time would go by without anything happening. Whatever trace of a plot had been building would just die. A whole chapter was spent with one of the children pondering whether or not she was actualy god, and just didn't know it.The thoughts of the children are so far fetched, one would wonder if the author ever had a childhood. I first read the book at age fourteen, and my thoughts were that there was no child in the world, ever, who would behave like the children in the book.Why everyone thinks this book is so great is a mystery beyond me. The innocence of the children is one thing that is pointed out as the redeeming quality of the book. My thoughts are that the children seem so unlike children that the innocence is lost.When one child broke his neck and basicaly dropped out the story until the last paragraph, I wondered if the author had some reason for axing the character that no human has ever realized, or just forgot about him.Overall, do not buy this book. It is boring and far fetched for a book of its genre. There are other classic books that are actualy worth reading. Go read the Hobbit, Lord of the Flies, or The Sun Also Rises. Anything. Just not this one."},{"Title":"A HIGH WIND IN JAMAICA","review":"I have been collecting these books, and now they have changedthem.

Following all of the children - but especially the god-monster child, Emily - makes this book so strong and hard to put down. I was in between stories at time - I definitely picked up 'Wizard of Oz' - 'Peter Pan' - moments. Having read Walcott's 'OMEROS' a few years ago - this movement through Jamaica and the Caribbean waters - felt comfortable, wild and familiar. The odd bonding between Emily & Capt. Jonsen is definitely the strongest picture painted in the book - and in several places requires looking back a few pages to catch up to the present. The narrator's switchback style - giving and taking from the characters and stories at whim is also amazing done without interrupting the story. It's the stories close - where the real world pushes back in - and gives all that came before a close. \\"Once more a phase of their lives was receding into the past, crystallizing into myth.\\" - is the perfect sum of this happy/melancholy tale."},{"Title":"A HIGH WIND IN JAMAICA","review":"Can you imagine a book that reminds one of The Ransom of Red Chief; Treasure Island; The Clockwork Orange; and The Lord of the Flies, at the same time?

In the process, one is forced to examine all your assumptions about the nature of good and evil. A forgotten masterpiece."},{"Title":"A HIGH WIND IN JAMAICA","review":"A High Wind in Jamaica is unlike any book I've read before in that Richard Hughes successfully found a great plot for an adventure novel and wrote it from childrens' perspectives. It is this unique perspective that makes the book one of kind and one that I would recommend, while at the same time creating a few problems for the reader.Much of the story takes place in the underdeveloped heads of very young children who don't take notice of what may seem very obvious or interesting details to an adult. Therefore, the problem lies in trying to figure out what exactly is going on in the book. Although the children are involved in some very exciting adventures with pirates and natural disasters, they sometimes don't realize it, if at all, until long after it happened, and since you only see what the children see and understand (which may not be what is actually happening) this can prove frustrating. In A High Wind, you are left to wonder, as a 5 year old child wonders, what in the world is going on around him.I leave it to you, the prospective reader, to decide if you would like to experience adventure and violence through the eyes of a child (as confused and out of focus as those eyes often are)."},{"Title":"A HIGH WIND IN JAMAICA","review":"Everyone on earth ought to read this book, even if we have to translate it into Malagasy and Mordvinian. It is supremely excellent for several reasons.It portrays children, their thoughts, their world with its textures, imaginings and fears, in a way so accurate, honest and vivid that you notice at once that almost all other fictional treatments of children are nonsense by comparison.It shows us everything else from the same child's-eye viewpoint, bringing unequalled freshness and strangeness, but also displaying the adult world in exactly the way children see it: as baffling and inexplicably absurd.Lastly, it tells an \\"exciting tale\\" of storms and pirates and kidnappings in the Caribbean in a way no-one had ever thought of before: opening unfathomable depths simply by describing things as they are, not as they're supposed to be.A typical touch comes at the beginning, when a hurricane flattens the house of a slave-owning English couple on a sugar-plantation. They then send their children away, worried the poor little things have been traumatised for life. Yet the children were in fact far less disturbed than their parents, enjoying the unexpected change in routine and too young to understand that a hurricane is dangerous and you're supposed to be frightened.This is the rare book that is short, gripping and unassuming, yet teaches you more than many large literary novels. The only comparable writing about children I know of is in Jules Supervielle's novel \\"Le Voleur des Enfants\\", translated as \\"The Colonel's Children\\". Read it if you can find a copy.Sadly Hughes' wrote little else. A storm-at-sea book, \\"In Hazard\\" is slighter than \\"A High Wind\\" but has the same freshness and strangeness; a collection of children's stories, \\"The Spider's Palace\\" is a must; and two volumes of an unfinished trilogy, \\"The Fox in the Attic\\" and \\"The Wooden Shepherdess\\", are well worth reading but disappointing by comparison."},{"Title":"A HIGH WIND IN JAMAICA","review":"I loved this book. It was spell-binding and bizarre and completely unpredictable. However, it had obviously been many years since Francine Prose read it and clearly she didn't re-familiarize herself with the book before doing the introduction. She made a couple of flat-out mistakes, such as the number of children on board the pirate ship. Also -- without going into detail -- there was a scene in the book where the pirate captain checked on the kids and was not aware that one of them was awake and watching him. In Prose's introduction, she mentions this scene and erroneously states that the captain was fully aware that the girl was watching. Whether or not the kid saw him makes a crucial difference in how one interprets that scene and I was amazed that she had it so totally wrong. She also snootily claims that this book succeeds where Lord of the Flies failed, which I thought was an outlandish statement. It crossed my mind that she wrote this introduction either drunk or after some serious sleep deprivation.Anyhow, I'd recommend the book if you have a strong stomach (warning -- whenever an animal is introduced into the plot, prepare yourself for that animal's demise) and a high tolerance for the bizarre. But, as I said, Prose's introduction will do you no favors."},{"Title":"A HIGH WIND IN JAMAICA","review":"Rousseau once said that man is born with a clean slate, the picture of innocence, and that, as children, he \\"learns\\" evil at the hands of adults, of society, of experience and life. Voltaire, his intellectual counterpoint, saw it otherwise. His notion was that man is born soiled, that the evil seed, so to speak, is firmly in place in every child at the moment of birth. It is natural, wild, unpredictable, and capable of wreaking havoc without the least coaching from the world.Richard Hughes, author of A HIGH WIND IN JAMAICA, is clearly a proponent of Voltaire's outlook, and you will be too after reading his odd little study on two \\"crews,\\" one a band of children \\"kidnapped\\" accidentally en route from Jamaica to England, and the other a band of pirates who meet their match at the hands of these not-so-noble little savages.Captain Jonsen and his first mate Otto treat Emily, Rachel, Laura, John, Edward, and Harold with the greatest respect, but the children's imaginations and boredom itself bring about strange events on the pirates' ship they occupy. Yes, it's a bit like the Stockholm Syndrome perhaps, but there are undercurrents, too, of Henry James classic THE TURN OF THE SCREW. You would guess that children this small could be nothing but harmless, and, with Hughes casual tone, they might appear every bit so. But the casual tone cannot deny that fact that acts of violence occur and that streaks of very adult and psychological meanness and love interact in the minds of little ones.First published in 1929, A HIGH WIND IN JAMAICA does not show its age. From the opening storm in Jamaica to the final courtroom scenes in London, you will see children \\"through a glass darkly\\" and realize that stereotypical notions of childhood innocence are just that."},{"Title":"A HIGH WIND IN JAMAICA","review":"A High Wind in Jamaica is interesting in the depiction of the ways that children relate to abductors or others in authority, even if the abduction in this case was unintentional. The descriptions in the book can almost make you \\"feel\\" the tropics, but the most important aspect of the book is the insight into the psychology of childhood (thinking that an inconsequential earthquake is the highlight of one's life while discounting a hurricane that totally disrupts life, confusion of moral right and wrong with socially dictated ideas of propriety, mourning the loss of a cat or a pig while overlooking the loss of a brother and other issues of emotional attachments). The ironic ending certainly gives something for us to ponder about issues of justice, too. The one aspect of the book that I think could have been made clearer is the character Margaret. She seems ambiguous--why did she change so much and what were her motivations?"},{"Title":"A HIGH WIND IN JAMAICA","review":"This is one of the most haunting books written in the twentieth century, and certainly one of the most unsentimental visions of childhood ever put down on paper. The children's choices emerge from the book with utter ruthless logic, and we feel we cannot blame them yet (impossibly) nor can we wholly forgive them for what they do. The prose is gorgeously fevered, and the descriptions of the earthquake and the hurricane seem like something from a dream at once beautiful and horrible. Not to be missed."},{"Title":"A HIGH WIND IN JAMAICA","review":"This darkly humorous, gently ironic story is first and foremost a spellbinder. Told in an informal understated fashion; it is a tale of great events and awe-inspiring violence both by man and nature.The Bas-Thorntons, an English family with five children, eke out a living in mid-nineteenth century Jamaica. (Father is handsome, but not a money maker.) The children have an enchanted existence in this lush, tropical, faintly oppressive island. They are busy from sunup to sundown with their own ideas of play, investigation and pretend. Their lives are changed when a devastating hurricane demolishes their home, killing one of the Negro servants, and their half-wild cat, Tabbie. The children are quite calm during the ferocious storm and interestingly are far more desolate about the loss of their cat than the human being who died before their eyes.The parents decide the children must go back to safe Mother England to better structure their lives. Most ships were still under sail at this time, and the children are quite excited at the prospect of magical England. Mrs. Thornton worries that the children will pine endlessly at being separated from her, but in actuality, they are quite indifferent. They have no sooner set sail than they are set upon by some of the most inefficient pirates that ever graced that notorious profession. After a few weeks on shipboard with the pirates, the children are thriving, and the pirates are not. Two deaths, one an accident and the other murder occur though the pirates are relatively innocent of both. After the rescue, the pirates are tried, found guilty, and hanged.The children endure great hardships and shocking sights, and the reader is taxed again and again with the merciless survivability of small children. They resolutely see what they want to see, and believe the adults if it is convenient, but most of the time just plain do not care. Usually, they have other fish to fry. The author is careful with his characterizations treating the well-meaning mother and the individual pirates with same merciless clarity as he does the children. This is truly a classic, and I believe every parent who reads it will have an uneasy feeling of humility at the close of the book. Read and enjoy. Read it to your children and be ready for them to laugh in all the wrong places."},{"Title":"A HIGH WIND IN JAMAICA","review":"What a shame that this novel was not appreciated when it was written and apparnatly still is unknown.

It's two successors being William Golding's \\"Lord of the Flies,\\" and J.D. Salinger's \\"The Catcher in the Rye.\\" Richard Hughes' uncanny ability to lay bare the mind of a child offers continuous, piercing insights unclouded by judgement or sentimentality. His prose evokes the strange, often bewildering perception of the innocent, with an objective, childlike point of view. Be forwarned though this novel is not for those who would dislike spending a day in the mind of young children. Those, however, interested in child psychology or just facinated by the nature of the young will enjoy this rare gem of a book."},{"Title":"A HIGH WIND IN JAMAICA","review":"I don't recall ever reading a work of fiction that did a better job revealing the inner workings of the mind of a child. Richard Hughes crafted the story to allow us to see just how disengaged children are from the real world, how emotionally distant they can be from what matters, and how self-centered their world actually is. In this aspect, this truly is a great novel.On the other hand, I found the book to be poorly written. The occasional use of first person was bothersome, often it didn't feel appropriate. I realize that the book was written in 1929 by a British writer for a British audience, but too frequently I was confronted with terms and metaphors I had never heard.Finally, I just couldn't get interested in the story. Maybe that was part of Hughes' plan - to write a novel that left the reader feeling disengaged from the story just as the children were. Whatver the case, I didn't find the story compelling in any way.This book should be, and probably will be, skipped by most readers."},{"Title":"A HIGH WIND IN JAMAICA","review":"Amazing, amazing, amazing.

One little girl, who grows up before our eyes, encapsules all that is human: innocence, love and joy. But also lust, craving and violence. And all this is set within the captivating scenery of turn of the century Jamaica, and later on a pirate ship.The special setting and extreme circumstances allows the auther to explore the incredibly diverse sides of human behavior (in this case a child human) in extreme circumstances.

Strangley, everyone either loves it or hates it when the truth is that it's not good enough to love nor bad enough to hate. The authors know exactly what they are talking about, there's no doubt. But I think therein lies the problem because the explanation of the code examples is almost non-existent. So, if you are looking to learn the principles of connecting Flash to a data-base, then this isn't for you. The examples in this book are of excellent quality but, unless they are EXACTLY what you're looking for, customising them may prove tricky without an explanation of what each piece of code does. Other problems include frequent typos in the book and the constant switching from asp.net to asp and from SQL to Access. In fairness to the authors, their code example on parsing an XML document took my thinking in a direction that I would never before have considered but, in order to understand it, I had to go out and buy \\"The Flash 8 Bible\\"! So, my final word is, this book is not suitable as a single resource to learn the subject, but the examples are well rounded and the approach sound. To avoid disappointment, order it alongside a book that will help you to understand the principles laid out in the code examples (The Flash 8 Bible is a good start because its chapter on parsing an XML document is a simplified - and fully explained - version of the one in this book)."},{"Title":"Building Database Driven Flash Applications","review":"I found this book very useful.

But they have outdone themselves with Patricia McKillip's \\"Moon-Flash\\" duology. It's bittersweet, beautifully written, and serves as an unusual coming-of-age story.In the first book \\"Moon-Flash,\\" Kyreol is a young woman living in the jungle valley of Riverworld, which the inhabitants believe is the entire universe. But while unhappily living with her betrothed's family, Kyreol encounters the strange Hunter, and realizes that he is from somewhere else. And wherever he came from, Kyreol knows that her long-lost mother went there.So she and her childhood friend Terje escape down the River. When they finally make their way to the Hunter and his people, Kyreol and Terje are taken to a lunar Dome far above their home. Together, they will find that the universe is more complex than they ever knew -- and that nothing in Riverworld, even the sacred Moon-Flash, is what they think it is.\\"The Moon and the Face\\" picks up four years later. Terje and Kyreol have been trained by the Agency, and are now ready for their first assignments. Terje will be accompanying Regny back to Riverworld, to observe its inhabitants, and Kyreol will be going to a nearby planet to observe the lightless Burrowers.Except neither mission turns out right: Kyreol's spaceship crashes on a desert planet, stranding her in an abandoned city with an unknown alien. To make matters worse, she is plagued by dreams of death. And Terje returns to his old village, only to find that the Healer (Kyreol's father) is dying.Patricia McKillip began writing the \\"Moon-Flash\\" story while she was in the middle of another science fiction book. And like her other sci-fi stories, \\"Moon-Flash\\" is light-years away from typical space operas.McKillip's dreamy, detailed writing is still in full force here, whether she's writing about a lunar base, a rainforest, a graveyard, or a colorless city on an alien moon. Even her aliens are unusual -- some are made of water or air, while others are furry three-eyed creatures who communicate entirely in wordless song.She also explores the idea of primitive people being exposed to futuristic technology, and the way it would change them -- they would gain knowledge, but lose innocence. The most bittersweet subplot is that of Kyreol's parents, whose love was sacrificed so that her mother could preserve Riverworld. And while Kyreol and Terje seem to learn everything a bit too quickly, McKillip makes their slow education absolutely thrilling.The first book's main focus is on Kyreol, exploring her doubts, her curiosity, and her longing to know everything. But the second is more about Terje, who struggles with his love for Riverworld and his love for his new life. They grow from naive children to independent leaders and explorers, and in McKillip's hands, it seems entirely plausible.The \\"Moon-Flash\\" duology is a beautiful, spellbinding piece of science fiction, and it's a good thing that this story has finally come back into print. Absolutely entrancing."},{"Title":"Moon-Flash","review":"If you are selecting this book for a child, it is entirely appropriate to be read aloud and discussed with mature pre-teens. It is a great topic for early teens to read alone if they have a strong vocabulary. IF you read on and the book is for you, be warned plot points are spoken of.Moon Flash by Patricia McKillip is an engaging story of a 13 year old girl in a primitive tribal jungle setting. When she discovers a man dressed in camoflage gear speaking into a communicator, she realizes her world is not what it seems. Seeing the man and having had her mother disappear 10 years before motivates her departure. She is also avoiding a betrothal. She and her best friend, a boy her age, take a canoe over the giant falls leaving their village and the life they've known behind. They encounter numerous scenarios on their journey down the river, some dangerous and toward the end of the book, come to a city in the modern world. The whys and whereabouts of her mother's disappearance are sought and the reason their tribe has lived untouched by the modern world is discovered. This book is beautifully written as are all of McKillip's stories. I highly recommend it. While there are some scary parts as the young travelers escape a head hunter tribe there are no sexual scenes that would make it inappropriate for pre-teens. Life is spoken of very forthrightly however. It is a lovely book that would likely appeal to girls and some boys, if they are big fans of reading and have a broad range of interests. I would not call this a fantasy in that most of it is true to real life. Perhaps only the ending is fantasical in that the city that the young explorers find is more advanced technologically than we are today in modes of travel. The sequel to this book is a full blown space travel fantasy."},{"Title":"Moon-Flash","review":"I do like Patricia McKillup's writing. This is quite interesting and surprising. At least, I didn't see what was coming."},{"Title":"Moon-Flash","review":"The writing style makes the otherwise easily formulaic story flow like a lovely tapestery as per the norm of the author"},{"Title":"Moon-Flash","review":"Life for Kyreol has always been simple and easy on the River, which begins at the Face and ends in the rainbows of Fourteen Falls. Her people lead a simple harmonious life of fishing and swimming. Kyreol, with her inquisitive nature and her missing mother, is thought very eccentric by her tribe.During the annual Moon-Flash ceremony which marks Kyreol's betrothal, she sees a stranger in the crowd. Insatiable curiosity and feelings of being trapped by her future husband's family lead Kyreol to steal away in a boat with her childhood friend Terje to find out what, if anything, lies beyond Fourteen Falls.McKillip's writing is as excellent as ever, and while this is a fine coming of age tale, I found it more than a bit predictable and felt unsatisfied when I turned the last page. Perhaps reading the sequel would help."},{"Title":"Moon-Flash","review":"When I first saw this book in the bookstore, I debated about getting it for about a month. The moment I bought, I regretted it. This book was so fanastic, you shouldn't hesitate! The back cover makes the book sound stupid, and the front cover art is slightly freaky, but the book itself was actually really, really good. Masterful writing combined with poetic development of characters and setting makes the novel flow. The transtitions and changes that the main characters have to go through, the challenges they face, and the triumphs and discoveries that they encounter will have you devouring the book in a day or less. Honeslty, don't hesitate when thinking about buying this book. It will become a treasured piece of your collection."},{"Title":"Moon-Flash","review":"It's a wonderful and compelling journey story.

It's got more than 200 pages, but you'll love it so much, you'd wish there were more!I haven't finished the book, but I think it'll be a a cliff-hanger so, you'll have to get the other books.I used to watch the show, 'till they took it off of NBC. (Which was really sad, as I don't have the Discovery Kids Channel. :( ) I would also reccomend the DVD'S. Even though I haven't actually gotten them, I watched the show and loved it. So, unless you've got the channel, that's the only way you can see it. And you've got to see it!The book is like you watching the show. They didn't change too much. So if you missed episodes, or just want to see what the show was like, this book will help. (I can actually remember them saying some of the exact things on the show that's in the book.) So you might even enjoy the book more if you've seen the show.Even though the book is the show, in book form, it is SOOOOOOOOOOOO much better than the Disney books!So as you can see, I think this is an awesome book and if you get it you'll think so, too. :)"},{"Title":"Static #1 (Flight 29 Down)","review":"I really love the Flight 29 Down show, but I read a chapter of this book on Discovery Kids.com, and you know what? The show is complete wimpy Snoresville compared to the book!!! For one thing, they put in more stuff than the show: all kinds of background information about the characters,and completely dramatic action they could NEVER have pulled off on TV. Also, you can't always lug a TV everywhere, but that's no problem with a little paperback. Third, They never abridged the story: anything they changed was just stuff ADDED IN.

Jones and a Little Monkey Business (Junie B. Jones, No. 2)","review":"Junie B. Jones is expecting a big present after her parents tell her that they have a big surprise for her. This 5 year old imagines everything under the sun that they could be getting her. She is horribly shocked to hear that the surprise is not a present, but a baby!! Junie B. doesnt' have a positive attitude about this new baby what so ever. Her parents get upset with her also taking away only dessert though. Junie B. gets little discipline from her parents. She calls the nursery, the dumb baby's room. She envisions this monkey coming to live there due to the jungle themed wallpaper and bedding. The day finally comes when mother has the baby boy. Junie B. has a wonderful time playing with her grandparents. Grandmother says that the baby is so cute but the description doesn't make him sound very cute to Junie B. She has a difficult time at school also, dealing with the new baby, as any child her age would. In the end, Junie B. begins to accept her baby brother and says that he's the cutest little monkey she's ever seen!Junie B. Jones books are somewhat controversial. The language she uses like, backtalking and calling her classmates and even adults names, is disrespectful and rude. She is hardly disciplined by anyone in these stories, other than an adult saying her name in that certain tone. But I have learned through my Kindergarten and first grade students, that they very much relate to this character. Junie B. does act like a typical year old. I use the backtalking and the other not nice things she does as an oppurtunity to discuss manners, respect, etc. with my students. Some discussions we have had about character education would not have come up without reading these stories. The children understand when Junie B. is in the wrong and what she should do instead.As for beginning readers, Junie B. gets my students hooked! I have plenty first graders who begin chapter book reading with Junie B. Their interest is sparked. They relate to the character. They understand the humor. They receive enjoyment from reading these stories. Granted, some children may pick up a bad attitude if there is no guidance or discussion or explaining about some of the things Junie B. does, but when read in school, that is covered and my parents that have bought these books for their children, have been able to talk to their child about right and wrong behavior. Many of the students go home, I hear, and make their family listen as they read aloud to them like we read to them at school, with full expression! Because you can hardly read Junie B. aloud without raising your voice for all of the exclamation points. It is a great learning experience and an enjoyment."},{"Title":"Junie B.

Jones and a Little Monkey Business (Junie B. Jones, No. 2)","review":"This is a post-TV book. Junie has no fond feelings for the new baby -- a real kid might be ambivalent, but not uncaring like this awful depiction of a kid.There is a horrible scene that made me sick to my stomach, where a \\"cry-baby\\" (in Junie's words) boy proudly shows off his crickets in Show-and-Tell. They turn out to be dead, but he thinks they're sleeping. He shakes them and says \\"wake up\\" and they fall into pieces. He cries. Now this isn't depicted as a sad event -- the tone of the book is that it's a real knee slapper that this sensitive boy cries because his loved pets are crumbling into pieces before his eyes.Really, really awful stuff. For people so jaded by TV, where everyone's nasty, angry, and insensitive. Don't buy it for your untainted child -- let them have a few years where they can have true human feelings."},{"Title":"Junie B. Jones and a Little Monkey Business (Junie B.

One is not able to read Junie B. without screaming due to all of the exclamation points!!There is some controversy with the content. Junie B. does have a negative attitude. She backtalks and calls classmates and other adults names. She is rarely disciplined, but in class we use these times as an opportunity to discuss her behavior and if it is right or wrong. This has opened the door for discussions on manners and respect, that may not have come up otherwise. Children do need some guidance with these chapter books, of this age that I am speaking of (5-7), for the reading of the words and also the behavior of this character.

Jones, No. 2)","review":"There seems to be a debate whether these books are appropriate for young children. This is my first Junie B. book (I had been reluctant to try them due to the debate). While I see both sides, I come down squarely in favor of them, if they are read with a parent or teacher. First, they are very 'real' -- Junie B. talks and thinks like a real six-year-old. Second, they are very, very funny -- for children and adults. Third, they provide teaching moments for the adult to discuss Junie's conduct and feelings -- and by extension the child's feelings. (I used this story as a vehicle to discuss my four-year-old's frustration with her two-year-old brother's conduct.) But there are some downsides. First, the grammar is too 'real' -- it is how real six-year-olds talk. Since I am reading to my four-year-old, I edit the text as I read to clean up some of the grammar. Even if I did not, my daughter's grammar is not going to be harmed by Junie B. Second, Junie B. is not a model six-year-old -- and who is? Nevertheless, an adult should discuss with the child times when Junie B. acts inappropriately. My daughter and I also read Magic TreehouseMagic Tree House Series Books: Night of the Ninjas / Dolphins At Daybreak / Polar Bears Past Bedtime / Tonight on the Titanic / Magic Tree House Research Guide: Rain Forests (Unboxed Set of MARY POPE OSBORNE Magic TreeHouse Books, # 5, 9, 12, 17 + 1 Research Guide) and Geronimo StiltonThe Curse of the Cheese Pyramid (Geronimo Stilton, No. 2)books.

When Junie B's parents tell her they have a suprise for her, she is disappointed to learn that it will be a new baby, and not a present. Things worsen when mom won't accept Junie B's suggestions for names (\\"Teeny\\" being one of them, since the baby will be so small).But the trouble really begins when Junie B's grandma comes home from seeing the new arrival and refers to him as the \\"cutest little monkey\\" she's ever seen. Junie B takes this literally, and goes to school insisting that her new brother is really a monkey. Hilarity ensues- I couldn't stop laughing as my then first-grade daughter read it to me.In addition to the abundant humor, the book also shows that it is a confusing world out there, and that grownups' behavior is frequently inexplicable. Young readers can identify with Junie B's efforts to navigate through the disappointments and challenges of family and school even as they are entertained by her.This is a great choice for kids who are just making the switch to chapter books.

Because Karen and Richard were great talents, who were totally devoted to making their music perfect. I also enjoyed reading and learning new things about the Carpenters that the Ray Coleman biography didn't cover.Example. This book gives Karen's solo album a positive review over some of the unfair criticism made by others. I am so happy that this is written down for everyone to see it. Karen would have loved this very much. Another example. When I first started buying the CDs in the mid 80s, I noticed that some of the songs sounded different. This book confirms it, thanks in part to the author's vast knowledge of the Carpenters recordings.I think fans and the newer fans would enjoy this book very much.

The integration of the history of psychology with the story line of two fictional pioneers in the field was extremely well done. I have a degree in psychology, yet found myself learning many new things about the bases of current psychological theory, and I completely enjoyed the trouncing of the Oedipal complex and other parameters of the \\"Viennese\\" school even though Freud was never mentioned by name. Faulks draws his characters with style and verve - he has a good handle on both conscious and subconscious motivations, so the people of his novel do come to life and earn a place in your heart."},{"Title":"Human Traces","review":"This huge novel spans the careers of two pioneering psychiatrists, one French, one English, who meet as boys and eventually co-found a sanatorium in the mountains of Austria, until driven apart by professional disagreements and the outbreak of the first War. For the first 250 pages of this 600-page book, the story holds the interest with warm characters, fascinating settings, and the stirrings of romance. However, the long lectures and scientific papers that Faulks uses to demonstrate the growing differences between the two (one is a Freudian, the other a Darwinian) come to clog the book around the half-way point, and although the two men continue to develop in interesting ways as people, he loses the sense of linear narrative. But Faulks pulls it all together in the last hundred pages; always a magnificent war novelist (seeBIRDSONG, his masterpiece), his WW1 scenes appear almost as a lyrical interlude, with striking cathartic effect, and his final chapters have their own quiet beauty."},{"Title":"Human Traces","review":"What does it mean to be human? Are we at the mercy of our inner, unconscious drives, a product of incomplete evolution - caught halfway between the new brain and the old brain, a work in progress?Are people who hear voices crazy? Or, do they retain an ancient ability to talk to the gods, throwback to a previous version of us?Faulk explores these questions in the context of early nineteenth century culture and science. Darwinism, archaeological discoveries in Africa, and war all play into this rich examination of what it means to be human.Two men, each from disparate childhood circumstances, come together as clinicians in the newly forming field of psychiatry in Europe. Their ongoing discussion provides the raison d'etre of the plot.Two women - one, a constant presence, all along the way showing us what may be the most human characteristic of all.Sebastian Faulk gives us no sketch but rather a masterwork with shadings, details, complex colors, and a grand canvas for it all.Susan Williams"},{"Title":"Human Traces","review":"I loved this book and hoped it would never end- it could easily have continued past 570 pages for me! - but then, a lot of the material on the brain, the history of psychiatry and neurology was not new to me, and therefore not a struggle or tedious for me to read. In fact, I enjoyed recapping so much that was familiar to me and also learning something new (new to me). I developed an interest in these fields early in life, although I did not pursue this interest professionally, and I found that Faulks did a great job of covering so many aspects of mental illness - illustrating in fictional form what it might have meant to be mentally ill or working with the mentally ill then, and still today in some parts of the world. Some of the lectures, the case study of Katharina von A, for example, were a bit longish, but in a certain way, these elements, for me, made the book even more compelling because of their educational value, being quite authentic for the period, and presenting the various competing psychiatric points of view in a straightforward almost didactic style - yet all the time tempered by the personal interest we take in the lives of the members of the little Midwinter-Rebiere family.Surrounding the 'educational' dimension of the book is all the beauty we've come to expect of contemporary 're-creations' of 19th century literature. (There must be a better way to say that!) The book is like a living, moving painting in its vivid descriptions of nature, place, and character. In fact, I found the characters believable, sympathetic and, also in terms of their inner lives, rich. I loved the way the author took us through time with the main characters Sonia, Thomas and Jacques. Found them thoroughly believable and was interested at every turn in their unfolding lives.I would love to see this as a film, if they could recreate the texture, color and moodiness of the novel (as was done, for example, with Charlotte Grey) but I don't wonder if the psychiatric dimension might be too disturbing for a popular audience. Maybe not, modern films are quite disturbing, after all. Anyway, films always manage to truncate, abridge and change novels, so perhaps it's best to keep it as a fabulous book that takes a nice long while to read.Honorable Mention: I also enjoyed the side-trips to California, Africa and - having never read Faulks before - the scenes from world war 1 were just stunning in their vividness, beauty, and horror. I felt the sketching of the character of the young soldier was revelatory of a passion that finds a fulfillment in the situation of war - not in the killing - but in other aspects that I think we see in the best literature and art on the subject of war. Apparently, Faulks is well-known for war-writing.But in this book, that is only one chapter. The rest is devoted to something else, the quest for healing, for wholeness, for 'being human' - a quest which has been a part of my own life (I did choose a medical profession, in the end), and I enjoy books that explore that quest intelligently.This book is superb on so many levels, I really can't praise it enough."},{"Title":"Human Traces","review":"Faulks has convinced me through this seamlessly and powerfully written novel that he may indeed be the greatest living novelist writing today and still at the top of his form. It is, in one sense, in the great tradition of the Nineteenth Century novel - Indeed, it is set in the late 19th early 20th centuries - without any postmodern pyrotechnics to dazzle the reader. It is simple a masterfully and well-nigh perfectly crafted novel. But this would merely make it a well-wrought period piece. Emphatically, it is not! The story follows the history of two psychiatrists, Jacques and Thomas - one French, one English - who become friends and set out to do nothing less than cure all madness and create a \\"Unified Theory of The Mind.\\" This particular book - despite claims about Faulks made to the contrary - is only for intellectual heavyweights for a number of reasons. Foremost, the problems they attempt to tackle are still as relevant today as they were a century ago, and the book does not talk down to the reader; all the medical terminology and deep theoretical speculations are completely unbowdlerised and comprise a great portion of the book. And to what end? The troubling proposition the books tenders is spelled out early on by Thomas' mentor, Dr Faverill:\\"My instinct, though I am pitifully far from being able to prove it true, is that what makes us mad is almost the same thing which makes us human,\\"Just a sampling of some of the discourse herein between Thomas and the explorer Hannes concerning The Bible when they are in Africa in search of evidence of human origins will give the reader some idea of what lies before him or her:\\"I read of exile, abandonment and the terrible grief of people who have lost something real - not of a people being put to a childish test, but of those who have lost their guide and parent, friend and only governing instructor and are left to wander in the silent darkness in eternity. Imagine. And that is why all religion is about absence. Because once, the gods were there. And that is why all poetry and music strike us with this awful longing for what once was ours - because it begins in regions of the brain where once the gods made themselves heard.\\"The book proffers many such passages raising scientific, medical and philosophical questions over which to ponder the fragility of our minds, our selves and how close we all may be to madness with many detailed explanations regarding Darwinian natural selection, chromosomes and mutations to back these speculations up. As I averred, it's not for the intellectually faint of heart.Towards the end of the novel, Jacques' son Daniel - fighting with the British in Italy in WWI - receives a book of Shelley's poems from Thomas with Shelley's \\"Lines Written Among The Euganean Hills\\" underlined because Daniel is, quite literally, fighting among these hills. The final lines of the poem make a much more moving and beautiful summation than I could pen of what this book is about: Man's eternal quest to cure the insane, heal the mind and find peace in this world:\\"We may live so happy there,That the Spirits of the Air,Envying us, may even enticeTo our healing ParadiseThe polluting multitude;But their rage would be subduedBy that clime divine and calm,And the winds whose wings rain balmOn the uplifted soul, and leavesUnder which the bright sea heaves;While each breathless intervalIn their whisperings musicalThe inspired soul suppliesWith its own deep melodies,And the love which heals all strifeCircling, like the breath of life,All things in that sweet abodeWith its own mild brotherhood:They, not it, would change; and soonEvery sprite beneath the moonWould repent its envy vain,And the earth grow young again.\\"Shelley's lines are interred with Daniel shortly after Armistice Day."},{"Title":"Human Traces","review":"So says Thomas Midwinter, the central character of this enthralling, sprawling novel by Sebastian Faulks. It follows the lives of two men, born in the 1860s, one from England and the other from France. For different reasons they each are interested in the way the human mind functions. They meet by chance around 1880, and charged with the idealism and ambition of youth and a late-nineteenth-century optimism about the power of science, they form a pact to discover the cause - and, surely then, the cure as well - of all forms of madness. Thomas Midwinter continues his education in England, culminating with a stint at a huge and monstrous insane asylum where the lunatics are warehoused. Jacques Rebi&egrave;re gets his education at the famous Salptri&egrave;re in Paris. As \\"mad-doctors\\", they open a clinic in Paris, and then a sanatorium in Carinthia (Austria), which they operate until the outbreak of WWI. Along the way they get married, father children, have professional differences, and are visited by personal tragedy. The story ends around 1922.HUMAN TRACES is a big, somewhat old-fashioned novel, of a type there are far too few these days. There is nothing \\"post-modern\\" about it. Two things stand out (as was also the case with the one other novel by Faulks that I have read, \\"A Week in December\\"). First is the grand, sweeping story, with plenty of human interest and dramatic episodes, including love affairs, tragic deaths, even an expedition to the jungles of East Africa and scenes of battle in WWI. Second, that story is also a platform for provocative ideas. If you turn off the thinking, inquisitive part of your mind and simply follow the novel for the story, wonderful though that story is, you will be missing many of the novel's pleasures.Here, most of the provocative ideas involve the human mind, insanity, psychoanalysis, religion, human evolution, and the meaning of life in a world without God. (Incidentally, Freudian psychology and the Viennese school get a rough going-over from Faulks.)One of the intriguing theories presented in the novel has to do with \\"hearing voices\\", the malady that plagues many schizophrenics. Faulks hypothesizes that once \\"hearing voices\\" was both common and a good thing. Witness Noah, Abraham, and Moses of the Old Testament. Similarly, in the \\"Iliad\\" the heroes received their instructions from the various individual and distinct voices of their many deities. As humans developed, concomitant with the development of writing, their brains evolved, their self-consciousness expanded and became increasingly refined, and most no longer heard voices. (Poetry and music \\"strike us with this awful longing for what once was ours\\", because they begin \\"in regions of the brain where once the gods made themselves heard.\\") Those who do \\"hear voices\\" - schizophrenics or psychotics - are either throwbacks or those who have suffered some sort of genetic mutation or misfortune. Darwinian theory of natural selection holds that people with that sort of handicap would slowly die out (saddled as they are with a reproductive disadvantage), unless the genetic flaw they suffer from is an evolutionarily ineradicable variant of the superior brain that gives most humans such an advantage in the world. Thus, \\"the same \`genes' that drive us mad have made us human * * *. You cannot have humanity without psychosis.\\" And thus, the mad - or many of them - bear a burden imposed by biology and genetics in order that the rest of us humans can be the sentient creatures we are.But Faulks doesn't stop there. The overwhelming irony is that the super-refined consciousness of humans has now \\"robbed us of any privileged place in creation. There is no god and there is no consolation for us, only death.\\" That leaves humans today with a dilemma: \\"To conceive of ourselves as fragmentary matter cohering for a millisecond between two eternities of darkness is very difficult, because our lives do not feel like that. Either, therefore, that is not the reality, or there is something wrong with the way that we register reality.\\" To resolve that dilemma, HUMAN TRACES suggests, is the great task of the future, much as Thomas Midwinter and Jacques Rebi&egrave;re saw their challenge to be learning the way in which the human mind functions.Throughout, the reader is comfortably ensconced in the hands of a very capable author. Though long (786 pages), the novel reads easily. It proceeds at a brisk pace, moving from episode to episode, sometimes skipping ahead by several years. The narrative perspective constantly shifts among the central characters. Faulks employs a variety of narrative techniques, including letters and several talks or lectures. There are a few missteps, including three instances of highly improbable coincidence (at least two too many such instances), but for me HUMAN TRACES was very satisfying. Were there only more novels like it."},{"Title":"Human Traces","review":"An unlikely meeting of two boys from very different backgrounds, but sharing the same scientific curiosity, is the basis of the unusual story. In \\"Human Traces\\" Sebastian Faulks follows the lives and work of Jacques Rebi&egrave;re and Thomas Midwinter in the second half of the 19th century, revolving around one question: what is the cause and reason for mental illness.Jacques and Thomas meet as young boys during the vacation in France - and they become friends for life.Jacques, a son of forester-turned-businessman from Bretagne, had to leave school early to work for his father, but his natural scientific curiosity and perseverance earned him the protection and sponsorship from the local priest. The priest encouraged Jacques to finish school and enroll in the university in Paris, where he worked, lived in the cheap room, and studied medicine, fascinated by Professor Charcot and his research wit the hysteric at the Salpetri&egrave;re hospital. Jacques's interest in psychiatry had a very personal side - his brother, Olivier, was ill and lived in confinement most of his adult life.Thomas's path was more conventional: born in the middle-class family, he was always interested in literature, but the depths of the mind and soul he found in the novels could only be explained after he knew the mysteries of the human body and brain - hence, choice of medicine.Thomas's sister Sonia, married early to Richard Prendergast, is a prominent character in the novel, and one of more remarkable feminine characters in the novels I have recently read. At the same time malleable, agreeable and strong and supportive, she is a constant presence in the lives of the two doctors.The hard work and dedication to science and their patients allows Thomas and Jacques to build the sanatorium \\"for the nerves\\" in the Alps - and follow their dream of explaining the mental illness. The central question: how is the recurrence of mental illness possible during the centuries of existence of human species, if the ill usually do not have children, the illness does not give any evolutionary advantage (the friends are the fans of Darwin) so it should be naturally eliminated - yet it persists. They come to the conclusion that it is the price we pay for our big brains and intelligence; a sort of \\"side effect\\".This view of mental illness is not new, but I was impressed by the amount of research that went into this novel, the author's effort to be as close to the science of that time, as he possibly could, with meticulous renderings of the lectures given by each of the friends. I liked the mingling of the science and their professional interests with their private lives - very realistic. And, in agreement with the theory that one thing inevitably leads to another, this book was the beginning in the chain of interesting works revolving around the topic of mental illness I subsequently encountered: the article in Science on one of the novel mutations correlated with schizophrenia, and the book \`What I loved\\" by Siri Hustvedt. I am sure there will be more, and this is the proof of the trace that \\"Human Traces\\" left forever in my mind. I am surprised not more people reviewed this novel, and also that it has not received more five-star reviews - in my opinion, it certainly deserves recommendation."},{"Title":"Human Traces","review":"Our main protagonists, Rebi&egrave;re and Midwinter, meet in 1880, when they are both twenty-years old and destined for greatness in the burgeoning filed of alienism, or \\"mad-doctoring.\\" Slow-moving and deliberate, the struggle of understanding madness is helped by lectures from Charcot, a famous neurologist. Rebi&egrave;re has a brother, Olivier, who seems to have all the symptoms of schizophrenia, although this disease, when the two doctors start their journey, hasn't been diagnosed yet.Midwinter and Rebi&egrave;re are forever tied together, not just because of their joint venture in mad-doctoring, the establishment of a stunning sanitarium in Carinthia, but also because Sonia, Midwinter's sister marries Rebi&egrave;re. Fate twists and distorts, and Katherina A., an initial patient of Rebi&egrave;re, who is a young woman suffering from mysterious debilitating pains in the abdomen and arms and hand joints, is initially thought to be suffering from hysteria.Midwinter reads his partner's case study and determines that her illness is not hysterical in origin, but physical, and rushes her off to Vienna for ovarian surgery that cures her. Subsequently, Katherina A. becomes Midwinter's wife, Kitty. Sonia births a son, Daniel, while Kitty delivers twin girls, Martha and Charlotte. Life plods on in the deliberate slowness of the era, all the while readying us for Sonia's fleeting thought at the end of the novel, \\"...human beings could live out their whole long life without ever knowing what sort of creatures they really were. Perhaps it did not matter; perhaps what was important was to find serenity in not knowing.\\" Interesting and dynamic subject matter with all the requisite drama of a book this size, over 600 pages.Armchair Interviews says: This is an excellent historical read based on the birth of psychiatry."},{"Title":"Human Traces","review":"I do not understand why the Brits dissed this book so heartily. It was one of the best I've read this year. Granted, one must have some interest in mental processes and illness, which I do; however, I should think we are all interested in what it means to become human. The characters were just fine, the writing was clear and focused...please give it a try."},{"Title":"Human Traces","review":"It is saddening to rate a work by the author of the sublime 'Birdsong' as less than excellent, but 'Human Traces' disappoints. The novel spans the period of greatest development in the understanding of the human brain in the late 19th and early 20th century, using the two central characters to summarize these developments. As a history of pyschology, it is educational and digestible. But as a novel, it is tedious: the storyline meanders, with no detail too trivial to be omitted in the name of period color; the excursion to America by one of the protagonists could be entirely cut from the book, there is a Mills & Boon quality to some of the scenes, and the characters remain just out of focus.The youthful ambition of Thomas and Jacques, the two 'mad-doctors', to comprehend human consciousness and hence cure mental illness is, of course, unrealized by the end of the story after the Great War. They live and love, father children, build their careers, and get a chance to expound their theories (which are interesting), but the ambitions of the novel are ultimately as unfulfilled as those of the main characters."},{"Title":"Human Traces","review":"The action of this book takes place amid the both fascinating and horrifying setting of late 19th and early 2oth century psychiatry. When this remains the backdrop of the book and the characters are allowed to dominate the story, it's all good reading. However, I think that the the author's expectations of his lay-readers is too high when he chooses the format of long lectures and case studies to get across the information he wants to transmit about the different views psychiatrists of that era held when fathoming out the workings of the mind. At times,(quite a few of them), I felt as if I were being force-fed information. At other times I couldn't wait to find out what happened to the conflicted and close-knit group of people that Faulks brought to life so well."},{"Title":"Human Traces","review":"This is not an easy page turner, but an amazingly well researched novel on a grand scale. Faulks weaves physchology, Darwinism, religion, sociology, anthropology and story together seamlessly. I would have liked a little more editing in some of the \\"speeches\\" and letters of the characters, but the novel poses deep questions about the nature of reality and the question of what it is to be human.A complex and very provocative book that's in the Faulks tradition of excellence."},{"Title":"Human Traces","review":"This book had a lot going on at different levels - family stories, history of psychiatry, World War I - and more. It definitely would have benefited by tighter editing (e.g., removing some of the storylines that went nowhere, shortening the medical lectures and making them less pedantic). And some of the scientific suppositions are so prescient that they are not believable. But I was touched by the human side of the story. CAUTION, SPOILERS AHEAD. Having lost a child (though not in the manner of this book), the parents' sense of loss here brought me to tears. And the irony of a man who spent his life studying the human mind losing his, and being aware of his trajectory, was both heartbreaking and ironic."},{"Title":"Human Traces","review":"Having read many of Faulks' novels, I was looking forward to reading Human Traces. It started well, but ultimately was a disappointment.Overall, there is something about the characters that is not quite 'real'. Whilst I was interested to know what happened, my interest was never quite full. There seemed to me to be random characters added for no reason other than to fill a few pages. The course of the story moved like a badly edited film, with long and short 'hops' in time that seemed to come at inopportune times in the narrative.Overall, for anyone interested in Faulks' work, I'd recommend Bird Song, Charlotte Gray, or the excellent Engleby before Human Traces."},{"Title":"Human Traces","review":"Vendor was prompt and professional.Item was clean and good value.Stultifying, slow moving, could not finish this tome.Not the Faulks that I know and love."},{"Title":"Human Traces","review":"Mr. Faulks writes with great intelligence and insight about two young menwho pursue their common goal of helping the mentally ill.

I wanted to read them because killers always seemed to answer that they didn't know why they felt compelled to kill or they gave answers which really did not satisfy my curiosity. Ann Rule's books contained the information which satisfied my curiosity. Previously I was for the death penalty, but now I am against it. I'm not religious, but I think Jesus was right when he said, \\"Forgive them for they know not what they do\\". In fact I dare say that we all live our lives the way we feel compelled to and we don't really know why we do what we do (including I myself).

I chose it because I thought it would be. As always the book came to me in a very timely manner."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me (Signet)","review":"After reading numerous serial killer books, including some about Ted Bundy, I decided to try Ann Rule. I heard a lot of complimentary things about her books, and after reading \\"The Only Living Witness,\\" I thought it would be interesting to read a book by a person who had a relationship with Ted before he began killing. While she did provide some interesting stories and background information I had not previously read, I did not like the book as much as I thought I would.I continually felt astounded at the amount of times Rule was able to insert an irrelevant rambling about her personal life. Telling the reader that someone tried to steal her car had absolutely nothing to do with the story. If Ted Bundy had tried to steal her car, I get how it would fit, but otherwise, it was a meaningless departure. That is just one of about fifty examples.These offshoots might be acceptable if Rule weren't completely delusional about her role in Ted Bundy's life. She clearly sees herself as an integral cog in the Ted Bundy machine, yet anyone who reads the book can see she is yet another woman who is constantly being manipulated by Bundy. She allows herself to be his marionette, jumping through any hoops necessary to fetch him his latest request or to complete his personal business for him outside the jail. Perhaps she does this because she has a contract to write about Ted, or maybe it's simply that old Bundy charm that worked so well on all his victims. At one point in the book, Rule actually compares being in Hollywood writing a movie script to Bundy's experiences in jail. \\"I could now more easily relate to what Ted is feeling in jail. I miss Seattle, too,\\" etc. It was laughable!Ann Rule admits early in the book that she would have tried to date Ted while they worked together had she been younger. It is blatantly clear through her actions and statements about Bundy that she is under his spell. He made a fool of her, using her to get things he wanted, and I think that to this day she really believes they shared some sort of cosmic bond. It's kind of pathetic.The three stars are for all the information on Bundy. If I wanted an Ann Rule autobiography, this would have been great."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me (Signet)","review":"This book was engaging up to a point and then I started skipping pages and then I finally put it down and watched a documentary.There was way too much Ann Rule in this book and I really didn't care about that part.

She not only provided a book that opened the world to the idea that the serial killer is not the bogeyman, but sometimes, literally, your work partner, or your friend. She made me want to search further. How many others were wearing similar masks? We have all heard of the goriest stories, the most heinous criminals, but it wasn't until I began delving personally into tinier stories across the country that I realized I needed to understand better the pathology of serial crime. As the writer of Serial Killer Letters, I hope I can hold a candle to Rule's gift to a society: a wake-up call that the bogeyman comes dressed in designer clothes and pearly whites. Sadly, he is also mentally diminished, wrongfully convicted, and so forth. So while I was learning about one kind of mask when I took the study upon myself, I realized, this is lurking everywhere, many faces...the end result of my own study? Sadly, it is much more difficult to tidy up a little definition than I thought.

A definite page-turner, as well as an eye opener."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me (Signet)","review":"&quot;Stranger Beside Me&quot; is not only one of the best true crime books I've ever read, but was also the only one to truly scare me to death--as I was a junior at FSU when I read it. The streets, the Chi O house, the Tallahassee landmarks were not only such that I could see the action in my mind, but could literally walk a couple of blocks to the scene. But what frightened me most was the personal nature of the story. It was impossible for Ms. Rule to write this story as an impartial observer, and how Bundy's story intertwines with her own serves as a chilling reminder that you never know the true nature of those you believe are close to you. Unbelievable!"},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me (Signet)","review":"It was many years ago that I first read Stranger Beside Me and the very first Ann Rule book that I had read. It really intrigued me and ever since then I have always wondered what makes people like this tick? I continue to read her books and have found them very hard to put down!!! I love her style of writing! ~~Sabrina Veley"},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me (Signet)","review":"I had heard of this book, of course; had wanted to read it for years, so when this 20th anniversary edition came out, I decided to give it a go. I had a pre-conceived notion: OK, this is going to be a really interesting biography of Ted Bundy, with the added attraction of having been written by a former dear friend. Fast, easy crime reading, I thought.I was wrong. This story is so chilling, so frightening, it grips you in the gut. Ann Rule has simply stated the facts. No sensationalism, no gratuitous gore, no psychobabble. Just the facts. As they happend. And even though the reader might think of Ted Bundy as &quot;old news,&quot; and even though he was executed in 1989, this book makes one check to see that the doors and windows are locked.There are actually two stories here: one describes the gradual disintegration of a seemingly normal, affable, brilliant man into a sexual psychopath so evil, so methodical in his vicious killings, that one wonders if he was at all human. The other story is that of Ann Rule herself, a decent, hard-working, middle-aged mother of four who meets and befriends a nice young man working beside her in a crisis clinic. A man she regards as a younger brother; a man she views as a close and trusted friend. The slow but inexorable realization on Rule's part that this man is in fact an unspeakably violent serial killer is as painful to read as it was for her to experience.Each victim is described in terms of such respect and such anguish that even a family member, I think, can feel that his or her daughter has been given a chance to shine, a chance to be more than a victim, more than a nameless number (8th girl killed, and so forth). The poignancy of these girls' very human preoccupations and lives serves to outline the contrasting horror in even more detail. That is why Rule does not have to defile the victims with intricate detail. The contrast between their young lives and their terrible deaths is enough in itself.Rule's new Afterward, written in 2000, is fascinating. She has not &quot;recovered and moved on&quot;; there is no real &quot;closure.&quot; She has come to accept that the incomprehensible contrast between Ted the Dear Friend and Ted the Monster will never leave her, and will never be fully explained, no matter how many facts she sifts, no matter how much progress has been made in understanding the sexual psychopath. It is her fate to have known Bundy in all his skins; it is our privilege to read her account of it."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me (Signet)","review":"This is an excellent true crime book. It has an unusual twist in that the author and the subject of the book, serial killer Ted Bundy, had a platonic relationship that arose from the time they were co-workers for a Seattle, Washington crisis center. Quite frankly, the author initially had no idea that Ted Bundy was anything other than what he appeared to be: a handsome, intelligent, charismatic, and articulate young man, who was, at the time, involved in local politics and later became a law student.When he became the suspect in the disappearance and murders of a number of very young, pretty women, the author was in total disbelief. As the evidence mounted against her friend, the author, who is a former police officer, could not shut her eyes to the reality that Ted Bundy was actually a very disturbed individual who was guilty of all of which he was accused and probably guilty of other such crimes for which he was not accused for evidentiary reasons. Consequently, the author would suffer some angst for many years, as she struggled to reconcile the Ted Bundy that she thought she knew with the fiend who was compelled to commit so many vicious abductions, assaults, and murders. It is believed that at least thirty-five young women, and probably a good number more, died at the hands of Ted Bundy.The author details the abductions, assaults, and murders of his victims from coast to coast, which crimes were ultimately to make Ted Bundy a nationwide household name, and an entity to be feared. The investigative efforts of law enforcement officers in the states of Washington, Utah, Colorado, and Florida are revealed, as are Ted Bundy's arrests and his trials. She also details his two escapes from custody in Colorado, the last of which would find him heading to the sunshine state of Florida.Florida was an interesting choice of state for Ted Bundy, as it is a death penalty state in which convicted felons, who have been given the death penalty, are actually executed. Notwithstanding Florida's stance on capital crime, Ted Bundy went on to commit a slew of shocking assaults and murders in Florida for which he was ultimately arrested, tried, and convicted. Considering the fact that Ted Bundy could have chosen to relocate to a state other than Florida after his last escape from custody in Colorado, it almost appears as if he had a death wish by going to Florida and continuing to give in to his sick compulsion. Unfortunately for him, Florida was quite happy to make his wish come true, and on January 24, 1989, Ted Bundy was executed, and his reign of terror was finally over.Those who like the true crime genre will enjoy this well-written and well-researched book. It is highly detailed and contains a great deal of information, some of it quite personal due to the author's relationship with Ted Bundy. She paints a very intriguing, intimate portrait of him, one that is three dimensional and complex. He was definitely a man whose benign and compelling external visage was at odds with his many internal demons, as he was a prolific serial killer. Externally, Ted Bundy was the sort of man towards whom women gravitated, and there was no dearth of Ted Bundy groupies once he made headlines.In the updates at the end of the book, the author theorizes as to why Ted Bundy, a young man of so much promise, would end up the way that he did, and she provides some interesting and personal familial information from which the reader may draw his or her own conclusion. All in all, aficionados of the true crime genre will find much of interest in this book."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me (Signet)","review":"Without a doubt, the coincidence that found Ann Rule already acquainted with the prime suspect in a series of brutal murders is one that would be hard to believe if this were fiction. But it's not -- Rule, contracted to write the story of the elusive &quot;Ted,&quot; discovers that her former colleague, Ted Bundy, curiously resembles the profile of the killer. Rule's later career as one of the most spectacularly successful true crime writers was significantly enhanced by the publication of this book. She writes with a surprising candor of the intimacy between herself and the Republican Party aspirant and law student who was eventually put to death after committing an unknown number of killings in an unknown number of states. Bundy's episodic rampages through the states of Utah, Washington and Florida are well known, and he is, in many ways, the most &quot;famous&quot; of modern serial killers. On the constitution of the serial killer as a modern identity, there's probably nothing better than Mark Selzer's book Serial Killers, a fascinating study of this modern pathology which traces the identity assumed by Bundy and other back to Jack the Ripper. The Ripper, as the first elusive, anonymous, random killer to gain notoriety in popular culture, offered an &quot;identikit&quot; profile for the serial killer which Bundy, as &quot;Ted,&quot; fits perfectly.Rule's book reads like a curious amalgam of true crime and romance fiction, and, in many ways, this is a love story of sorts. Rule's fascination with Bundy reminds us of the charismatic powers of the sociopathic personality, and its plaint, adaptable face in this competitive culture we find ourselves in. Some might find her portrait of Bundy disturbing: she remains, through most of the book, reluctant to acknowledge the severity and hideousness of his crimes. But she acknowledges them, finally, in her graphic retelling of courtroom testimony, and in her humble incomprehension of the pain that Bundy brought to the lives of many. If you're looking for a book about this iconic figure, it's hard to go past The Stranger Beside Me. One way or another, it's become a classic true crime narrative. Rule taps into the rule of contingency that dogs serial killings: everything takes place merely because of opportunity, coincidence, random fate. And everything seems to have a moral, though Rule is properly reticent about what the moral here might be. My only hesitation concerns the way in which Rule introduces the victims: in some ways, it's more like a roster call than the poignant series of vignettes she intends. There are facts here that have been better discussed elsewhere, perhaps, but because of the strange coincidence that drew Rule and Bundy together, it's a powerful book."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me (Signet)","review":"\\"THE STRANGER BESIDE ME\\" is undoubtedly one of Ann's best books. It is a cautionary tale of how someone who appears to have everything going for him, as Bundy did, can have another, hidden and dark side altogether. Bundy appeared to be the all-American \\"golden boy\\" but in reality, he was a sexual sadist, sexual predator and necrophiliac dominated by dark and unmentionable compulsions which he felt compelled to act upon.Rule's book is chilling because it shows that anyone can be \\"taken in\\" by these psychopathic (now called anti-social) personalities. In reality, Ted Bundy was nothing but a black hole. The appearance he made to all he came in contact with, including Ann Rule, was meant to fool people. His outward appearance was carefully thought out to reassure others and impress them that he was really \\"going places\\" in life and had everything going for him.Rule's book is eerie because she shows that much of what Bundy did, while maintaining this \\"perfect\\" image to the outside world, was carefully thought out, especially the disappearance of Lynda Ann Healy, who has still never been found. The only earthly remnant of Lynda was part of her skull, which detectives found on Taylor Mountain. Bundy was a devious, cunning, and wicked man. Ann is lucky because she could easily have become one of his victims. She worked with him alone at nights and the realization of this must still haunt her today. She worked beside him and truly thought she knew him, but she didn't. Thus, the title \\"the stranger beside me\\" truly is an apt one. I think this should serve as a cautionary tale to many women who think they have met \\"Mr. Right.\\" Perhaps women should heed the old adage \\"the jury is still out\\" when meeting someone new, especially after reading this book!"},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me (Signet)","review":"I have read this book several times since it was first released. It is very hard for me to read or watch anything about Ted Bundy since my cousin was his last victim. I would recommend this book to anyone that has ever heard of Ted Bundy. It is scary to think that this kind of thing can happen anywhere, anytime. Ann Rule shows you how you think you know someone but really not know them at all. Even though Bundy finally met his match, it's sad to think we will never know how many victims there really were and what kind of pain and horror they might have suffered. Too bad Bundy's life ended so quickly!"},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me (Signet)","review":"This book is one of the most definitive books on serial killer Ted Bundy, and for good reason: author Ann Rule actually knew and worked with him at a Seattle-based suicide &amp; crisis hotline. Bundy seemed an unlikely murderer; friends knew him as a smart law student, a man with an interest in state politics, and a man with a longtime girlfriend. Like most people, Rule wasn't sure what to believe when Bundy was first arrested on kidnapping charges in Utah in 1975. She stayed neutral and wrote this book, and the result was a fascinating account that manages to walk the fine line between good taste and opportunism.The Stranger Beside Me covers a lot of ground in its attempts to paint a clear picture of Ted Bundy. Countless acquaintances of Bundy are quoted or mentioned, and Ann Rule's past experience as a police officer gave her inside access to the investigations that most people could only dream about. She also manages to describe her strange relationship with Bundy without making herself sound overly important, thereby keeping her credibility above reproach. Bundy is revealed to be a hollow, warped, sadistic predator, not at all the cassanova that the press sometimes made him out to be. This book is fascinating on many levels, and Rule's careful research also shows.For all these reasons, I couldn't give this book any less than five stars. The only real complaint that I have is that the book often has a wandering feel. The book isn't just about Bundy; it's also about Ann Rule and how she followed the case and later the trial, even sometimes speaking with Bundy or writing him letters in jail. As a result, the focus of this book often seems to waver. But it is hard to blame Rule for any of this because Bundy himself was a wanderer, committing his crimes in several western states (that we know of) before finally ending his criminal career in Florida. His crimes were numerous and terrible and his personality was very abnormal, resulting in a very complex and tragic story. Rule glosses over some of the worst details, but it's just as well; there is no way for anyone to fail to appreciate how awful Bundy was. True crime doesn't get much scarier than this."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me (Signet)","review":"As a true crime fan, I have read many books by countless authors. Ann Rule is the only author who has completely explained the proper definition of a serial killer.This book is a fascinating look into the human mind and a man, Ted Bundy. I would like to thank Ann for finally describing and telling this story.This is a must read for any psychology student and true crime lover."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me (Signet)","review":"And i would say this book is also one of the greatest insights into the life of a Serial Killer, in this case one of the most known and prolific Serial Killers of the modern era, ever. Ann Rule has created a masterpiece that delves heavily into the mind of Ted Bundy, and she also keeps you hanging with every passing chapter of this 498-page book. It's hard to put this book down when reading it.Ted Bundy has to be one of the most famous, and in my opinion, most fascinating Serial Killers ever. I have read about countless Serial Killers, i own many books on Serial Murder, but this one by Ann Rule, \\"The Stranger Beside Me\\", is undoubtedly the most gripping, realistic and most involving one i have ever read. What makes it so unique, mainly, is the fact that the Author, Ann Rule, was a good friend of Ted Bundy's. They had met and become good friends at a Crisis Clinic (Of all places for Ted Bundy to have worked..) where they both worked for a time. From their first meeting in 1971, when Ted Bundy was 24 and she herself was nearing 40, all the way to the early-mid 80's, Ann Rule kept in touch with Ted Bundy.This book is so deeply involved, so heavily investigated and well-thought out. Another unique thing about it is how Ann Rule tends to write and describe certain things. Her way of writing, at least in this book as i don't happen to own any of her other books unfortunately, just keeps you on edge. The facts, dates and information about each murder is extremely in-depth, as is the letters and calls Ann Rule and Ted Bundy made to eachother, and what Ted Bundy has said on tape to Police Detectives and Investigators that worked on the case.The updated chapters, from the mid to late 80's, are also a great highlight and a good reason to pick up this book. The whole book is such an interesting read, and so hard to put down when reading, that it's a mistake to pass up on this. If you are at all interested in Serial Murder, or if you are interested in Ted Bundy and his story, certainly without a doubt do not miss out on this. Pick this up straight-away, you just will not be disappointed. Ann Rule has written a classic book that will go down in history, or at least in this genre of writing's history, as one of the greatest. 5/5 is really an understatement.Also check out books such as; \\"The Only Living Witness\\" and \\"Conversations With a Killer - The Death Row Interviews\\" by Stephen G. Michaud and Hugh Aynesworth, and also \\"The History of Murder\\" by Colin Wilson, a massive 639-page book that has extremely in-depth coverage of Murder all through the ages. From the years 1000 through to the Columbine Massacre of April 1999, it chronicles everything from Vlad the Impaler, Marquis de Sade, through to a very detailed and very long chapter on Serial Murder and leads into \\"Serial Killers of The Nineties\\" which is a detailed guide to some unknown and less famous Serial Killers."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me (Signet)","review":"Despite being a huge crime reader, I don't usually read true crime. This book was recommended by so many crime fiction readers that I thought I'd check it out. I was interested in how one of the most noteworthy real life serial killers compared against his fictional counterparts.Many aspects of Ted Bundy's life of crime really are the stuff of novels, and no doubt have inspired many. Women of a specific and similar physical appearance disappearing all over the country are like something from a James Patterson book. Like Hannibal Lecter, Ted Bundy had formal psychiatric training and was experienced at administering the same psychological tests that were given to him in prison. He is cunning enough to escape prison, and adept at procuring fake identities and eluding the police. No maladjusted misfit, he was personable, charming, attractive to women - while capable of chilling rages where, in a single night, he could savage 4 different women, racing, bloodstained, from one college dorm to another.Much of the book is about Bundy's trials and time in prison - details absent from most fiction, which usually conveniently end after the perpetrator's discovery. While Bundy himself could hold his own as a fictional character, what really differs is the lack of any cohesive protaganist. While many individual police worked long and hard on his cases over the years, there was no idea for a long while that many of his attacks were connected, a situation that surely could not have escaped, for instance, a Lucas Davenport. Once the police finally manage to convict him - on only three of a known 35 and suspected 150 murders - the suspense moves to Bundy's fight against his execution date, which is postponed many times. Bundy repeatedly gains time by promising to confess - although already convicted, confessions to the any of the dozens of outstanding suspicious disappearances are a powerful bargaining tool for him due to the closure that it brings to these victim's relatives. The thought of so many real families in such uncertain agony - some of them, still - is very upsetting.Whether Ms Rule's unique persective on the Ted Bundy case actually adds anything to the story is hard to say - despite their long friendship, she seems as baffled as everyone else as to how or why the kind and sensitive guy she knew could be a brutal and sadistic killer. Everyone who reads this by now knows the facts of the case, and it's hard to share any of her initial support of Bundy. This book's effectiveness is its thoroughness in showing the untidy fringes and loose ends that accompany real life crime - it's a scary, thought-provoking, and worthwhile read."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me (Signet)","review":"I realize that the author was not objective in writing this book because of her acquaintance with Bundy, but I found the book much, much less than objective. I suppose I should have gotten a book by someone else because I was looking for a novel that gave all of the facts and was very straight-forward. This came off a little \\"fluffy\\", which I admit is not the best choice of words for a novel about a serial killer. At one point, Rule wrote something along the lines of how it was such a shame that all of Ted Bundy's victims were so young, beautiful, and intelligent. (Because it would be so much more excusable if they were dumb, ugly, and old!) Also, the descriptions of various people, from Detectives to victims, was too flowery for my taste, containing lots of adjectives and cliches. The editing was also a problem, almost a nuisance. An example is that one of the possible victims' names is Ann Marie, which she writes multiple times as either \\"Anne Marie\\" or \\"Ann Marie\\", and sometimes refers to her as \\"Ann\\", just before calling her \\"Ann Marie\\" again. She states on one page that it took the jury just under 7 hours to deliberate, on the next page it's less than 6 hours, and finally it's back to 7. And my final complaint, a big pet peeve of mine, is that she stated some events as being \\"anticlimATIC\\" (instead of anticlamACTIC)- maybe she was referring to being against the weather?Other than those complaints, I was satisfied with the portrayal of Bundy and with the amount of information given. There is much detail, including names, dates, jury selection, judges, etc. Overall a decent book if you don't mind the above issues."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me (Signet)","review":"This book, \\"The Stranger Beside Me\\" by Ann Rule, is truly terrifying. My husband works the night shift, and that's when I get most of my reading done. Even though Ted Bundy is dead, I wished my husband worked days more than once while reading this book so he would be home with me! Despite the fact that I was scared out of my mind, I still couldn't put this book down.Ted Bundy confessed to murdering over 30 women in the most brutal fashion in the 1970's. Most of the women were college age, early twenties, stylish, with long dark hair parted in the middle. His youngest victim was [...]. Only a couple of his victims survived. He would stalk them as they were out walking, then pounce at an opportune time, such as when they were walking under a dark bridge or alley. Sometimes, he killed more than one girl a night, such as the Chi Omega sorority murders, when he left two for dead and severely injured two more before going to another house and bludgeoning another girl who also lived. That happened after he escaped from prison a second time and ran to Florida, where he was free for several months.Ann Rule has a great writing style. It's detailed but moves along at a good pace, and flows very nicely. She gets the point across matter-of-factly of how horrific Bundy's crimes were without getting too grisly, which is something I appreciated.I can't believe she actually knew Bundy while he was murdering these women, was friends with him. Of course, she didn't know he was a killer, but I can't imagine being in that situation. How did she feel about it? How did she accept it? How could someone so charming and so normal by day turn into such a madman at night? What was wrong with him? Nothing spectacular happened in his life that would give us an explanation. It's a mystery. He is one of the reasons I believe some people are just born with those bad inclinations, and people like Ted Bundy choose to act on them.This book is highly recommended for anyone interested in true crime or horror stories, because this book is certainly horrifying."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me (Signet)","review":"I originally read the book mainly for the purpose of a term paper I was doing for school. I'm majoring in Criminal Justice and find the minds of serial killers to be so interesting. So, when I chose to do my paper on Ted Bundy, I figured I would be reading a book simply to get a term paper written. However, I ended up loving the book and couldn't put it down. I found myself looking forward to having free time just so that I could use that free time to read more of the book and get further into it. Needless to say the book was great from beginning to end. I definitely recommend it to anyone who enjoys True Crime books, especially when they are written by someone who personally knew the person who the book is about."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me (Signet)","review":"This is one of the best true crime books that I have read. Ann Rule does a great job at presenting all the aspects of Ted Bundy's life. So many true crime books merely tell you the crimes and how the criminal was caught, but Rule gives you many deatils of Bundy's life and the lives of his victims. Many questions I usually have after reading a true crime book were answered here. Rule does a wonderful job giving the readers information about the victims. The victims aren't just numbers in a trail of horror. They are actual people who you grieve for as you read the book."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me (Signet)","review":"The sheer number of Ted Bundy's known and suspected victims may well satisfy most people that his execution should be the end of his story, but it should not and \\"The Stranger Beside Me\\" does not answer what is begged: why? Did something in society create what truly was a monster or was Bundy truly a human form of pure evil? Ann Rule is not to be criticized for not answering in her book, a masterpiece in detailing the horrors that Bundy inflicted on his known victims and posing the frightening likelihood that others still buried endured his torture. Rule was, after all, blinded like everyone else by Bundy's purported grace and all those other attributes assigned to \\"decent\\" people. For anyone seeking the definitive answer, if they care, are likely to be disappointed that \\"The Stranger Beside Me\\" doesn't provide it. Illigitemacy? A love relationship gone bad? Can these two simple factors alone or together and which so many other people have undoubtedly experienced so fracture a human psyche that it abandons every shred of humanity? It's doubtful, leading us to conclude that some other horrific force was at work. Still, Ms. Rule's book is a great read for no other reason than to feel the numbing trauma of Bundy's catastrophic acts, even if they aren't satisfactorily explained."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me (Signet)","review":"Ann Rule did a good job of re-telling the true story of Theodore Robert Bundy. However, she often focused too much on herself and her personal accomplishments rather than on the story of Ted Bundy. Some of the sections where she talked about herself interrupted the flow of the novel. The fact that she actually knew Ted Bundy gave the book a more personal touch. Her in- depth knowledge about Ted Bundy gives the reader the feeling of knowing who he really was. Ann Rule wrote the story of Ted Bundy unbiasly. She leaned neither to his innocence or to him being guilty. This gave the story a more true quality. The overall story of Ted Bundy, told in The Stranger Beside Me, was intriguing and interesting to read. I am looking forward to reading another one of her novels. Ann Rule is really the &quot;Queen of True Crimes!&quot;."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me (Signet)","review":"As another feminist, I found Reviewer Gwen's comments to be knee-jerk and utterly off-base (also, seeing woman-haters everywhere is pretty much why people roll their eyes when they hear the word &quot;feminist&quot;). Because if anyone does just the slightest bit of research--pulls old newspaper photos and clippings, views video of courtroom testimony, reads other books on the subject, etc.--you'll see that Ted really *did* attract a ridiculous number of women to his side. They flocked to him in droves. As Rule points out, this is a fascination &quot;some women&quot; have with serial killers. Rule's observation of a common phenomenon (check just about any psych text or, better yet, talk to a shrink to verify its frequency) hardly classifies her as a cruel, cowardly woman-hater. &quot;We&quot; don't need to keep that in mind, &quot;we&quot; should just read this book for a fascinating and intimate glimpse into what drives a sociopath."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me (Signet)","review":"Most people seem to speak well of this book. It's not that I didn't like it so much as it didn't satisfy me. There are descriptions of grizzly murders, and Ann Rule has the advantage of personally knowing Ted Bundy, so she's got a better view than most. Nevertheless, I feel like I'm reading a newspaper account. We don't get under the skin of Bundy; we don't know what makes him tick; we know very little of his life. When I finished, I didn't feel I really understood anything."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me (Signet)","review":"This was the third &quot;Bundy Book&quot; to come out with &quot;Stranger&quot; in the title. The first two were the paperback &quot;Ted Bundy: All American Stranger&quot;, which was rushed into print on the heels of the Chi Omega verdict and Richard Larsen's &quot;Bundy: The Deliberate Stranger&quot;, which came out shortly after the Leach verdict. Larsen's book served as the basis for the TV miniseries starring Mark Harmon and then fell out of print. &quot;Stranger Beside Me&quot; had better legs and remains in print to this day. This book's success comes from Ann Rule being a better writer who wrote from a better perspective. Although Richard Larsen also knew Bundy personally, he was not as close to Bundy as Rule apparently was. Factually, the book appears about as accurate as any other of the plethora of Bundy books, but all these books suffer from a common failing: wittingly or unwittingly, they tend to glamorize a sadistic, brutal recreational killer who really was no stranger than any of the other &quot;serial killers&quot; who captured the headlines of the last half of the 20th Century. This alone separated Bundy from the pack: he was an articulate pretty boy. If you feel you really must read about such a monster, this book is about as good as any of the other Bundy books and probably better than most of them."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me (Signet)","review":"I decided to read this book because it was a recommendation for readers (after Alice Sebold's Lucky). I am not a true-crime fan. And I worked as residential treatment staff for mentally ill for several years. Sociopaths are rare... but they're out there. I am convinced they are born as is, that some part of their brains just doesn't have the capacity to feel anything. The smart ones study &#34;normal&#34; people's facial expressions. I think if Ted Bundy was a young man in this day and age, someone would have reported his behaviors, and red flags would've gone up. Ann Rule, in this day and age, would have had courses chock full of studies identifying psychotic behavior, as well as bipolar and antisocial behaviors. Ted Bundy killed at a time when forensic science was still in its infancy... imagine how great it would have been to be scientifically sure to have evidence against him. For anyone interested, Jomathan Kellerman wrote a non-fiction book called Savage Spawn, about young sociopaths. And The Psychopath Test is making the rounds also. Ted Bundy used his normal white guy looks back in the 70s... these days he would find his prey was not so easy to obtain. And I really hope Ann Rule has gotten some therapy for what is either survivor's guilt or Stockholm Syndrome. Hopefully by now she realizes that she was being used by someone who probably laughed at every check or book of stamps she sent. She would not have gotten any kind of confessions out of him... he was feeding the authorities what they wanted so he could continue to be the star of his own movie... and to live. Really good book thoughtfully written. I just threw up in my mouth a little each time Rule tried to describe Bundy's &#34;good points&#34;. He had none. It's good he's dead."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me (Signet)","review":"Here you go. A great tale of someone who worked beside Bundy. This is kind of a trashy genre, but I personally can't help myself. And this does have its insights. I read this in college, so I don't know as I'd call it a literary masterwork, but very readable. The story of how Bundy worked in a crisis center was really chilling. One of the mind-blowing things about Bundy was that his girlfriend was working with the FBI as she suspected he was the culprit, yet she stayed with him for two years afterward. This book is full of weird turns like that; how someone right next to you is a full-blown psychopath. The stuff of nightmares."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me (Signet)","review":"This was one of the best books I have read in a long time. How tragic for all those young girls to fall prey to such a vicious monster. On the other hand, what a tragic waste of life for Ted Bundy who one day could have very easliy have been a high ranking member of society. Ann Rule did such a great job in capturing every aspect of this monster better then anyone else ever can, on a personal level. Great read for anyone interested not only in True Crime, but Ted Bundy himslef."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me (Signet)","review":"Very interesting because of Ann Rule knowing Ted Bundy and what she went through. True Crime author involved with the person she is writing about makes this a one of a kind. Not knowing her friend is her subject until he's a suspect! I like the fact that she shared her personal struggle with writting this book. One of my favorites by Ann Rule."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me (Signet)","review":"The Stranger Beside Me is the best true crime book I have ever read. However, it is also the most disturbing, so much so that more than once, I vowed not to finish it. Of course, I did finish it, and the story will probably stick with me for a while.The book is, for the most part, a chronological account of Ted Bundy's life. It's fascinating that the author was actually friends with Bundy before she knew he was a killer. The book is filled with devastating accounts of the crimes that he was accused and later convicted of. Rule also explores possibilities of how and when he became obsessed with murder. Interesting reading, but keep the lights on and the doors locked."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me (Signet)","review":"I have been fascinated and terrified by the Ted Bundy murders since I was a little girl. He was a bit of an iconic anti-hero in my hometown of Seattle. When I was a teenager, I picked up this book for the first time, and over the years I've read it over and over again. My first copy became so dog-eared I passed it onto a friend, who bought me the updated version. Ann Rule is one of my favorite authors. I was always an avid reader of both fiction and non-fiction, but I have been so accustomed to her writing style, I scarcely want to read anything else anymore. I'd recommend this book to anyone, whether they enjoy true crime or not, whether or not they're familiar with the Bundy case."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me (Signet)","review":"Ann Rule, a true-crime author, is hired to chronicle the hunt for a brutal serial killer. Slowly she comes to realize that the homicidal maniac police are searching for is her beloved friend and co-worker. No one can make real life characters as compelling as Ann Rule, and The Stranger Beside Me is a masterpiece. And what makes later editions worth the trouble of seeking out is the additional material Rule adds, often in answer to readers' questions."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me (Signet)","review":"If you have yet to read this book, I envy you. It was the first true-crime book I ever read, and remains one of the best to this day. Read this book at night, alone in the dark, and you will be terrified. But the book is very multi-dimensional. The victims are not treated as mere props, you will truly feel for them. Rule, a mature woman and former police officer, was taken in by Bundy's charming persona. Her gradual (and very reluctant) realization that he was a serial killer make an engrossing story. The lesson is that \\"charm\\" is not necessarily a god-given personal attribute, but could be the tool of a manipulative human predator. If this aspect of \\"The Stranger Beside Me\\" is of interest to you, try reading \\"The Gift of Fear\\" by Gavin DeBecker. It contains a lot of fascinating information on identifying the tactics of manipulation."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me (Signet)","review":"Ann Rule was a Seattle policewoman who turned to journalism, specializing in True Crime around the northwest coast. Of her many books, this is the only one where she had personal knowledge of the perfect son, law student, social worker, and \\"trusted friend\\". Rule started writing this book before she found out that the suspect in these serial killings was her friend and co-worker, Ted Bundy. [Was he the inspiration for \\"Hannibal Lecter\\"?] Rule says there was nothing in Ted's record that could predict his future (p.xi). Yet there were incidents in his behavior: suspicion of auto theft and burglary (p.12), rifling lockers and stealing from drunks (p.14). His first girlfriend believed Ted used people and took advantage of them (p.15); she was also out of his class. Ted had other disappointments (pp.16-17). But he returned to college and became an honor student in psychology. Ted told stories to gain sympathy from a Professor (p.20). [A sign of a manipulator.] But otherwise Ted seemd to have a bright future (p.21).Ann Rule worked as a volunteer for the Seattle Crisis Clinic in 1971. Ted was one of the work-study students there. They both helped to save lives (p.25). Ted was helpful in his advice to Rule (p.27). Ted's slenderness disguised his physical strength (p.29); racquetball and bicycling. Rule admired him. Ted was a conservative Republican who believed in law and order; Rule never saw any anger (p.32). Ted had a \\"compartmentalized\\" life, moved in many circles where no one really knew much about him. Ted's relationship with Stephanie changed, due to Ted's bitterness. Did Ted court her so he could reject her as she had earlier rejected him (p.47)? She survived this and married someone else. After this, the first victim disappeared.Rule's life continued, a single mother with four children, writing reports on cases for the police, then writing stories for publication (p.49). Rule was a Deputy Sheriff in many of the counties, and spent time with various units (p.50). After young girls disappeared, Rule believed the killer would be a violent man, someone let out of prison too soon (p.77). Ted had a letter or recommendation from the Governor of Washington (pp.106-107). His coworkers at the Dept of Emergency Services noted his resemblance to the \\"Ted\\" at Lake Sammamish (pp.108-109). So did others (p.110). The murders in the Seattle area ceased but new murders occurred in Utah, Ted's new home (Chapter 13). But Ted failed to abduct and kill a young woman; Ted impersonated a police detective to fool this victim! After this young woman started to disappear in Colorado; some of their bodies were found (pl143). Early one morning a Utah HP sergeant noticed a VW Beetle driving by; he followed and stopped this car, and arrested the driver for evading an officer, and possessing burglar tools. Now things began to fall inot pale, and Rule received a phone call from Ted (Chapter 16). Those who worked with Ted couldn't believe the charges (p.157). Rule wrote to Ted in jail, and received Ted's letters. [Rule doesn't say that her association with Ted provided a powerful competitive advantage for her book.] The divorced single mother who lived off and on with Ted admittted he would leave in the middle of the night for hours, often when the girls disappeared (p.166). The police checked Ted's credit card records and telephone bills. Ted had been in the area where girls disappeared (p.175). Prison psychiatrists found Ted to be \\"normal\\" (p0.217); but he was sober then. After his second escape Ted travelled to Tallahassee FL and attacked girls at the Chi Omega sorority. (Rule had pledged to this organization - was Ted sending her a message?) A police officer noted a car coming out of a parking lot early in the morning, followed and stopped it. The suspect resisted arrest, but Patrolman David Lee caught one of the Ten-Most-Wanted. Ted's murder spree was over (Chapter 34). The rest of this book end this story, with Rule's personal experience at the trial.Ted's trial in Miami was televised live; was this a first? The bite marks on Lisa Levy's buttocks first linked a victim to Ted (p.397-398). Rule said Ted was found guilty becaase he fought against his defense lawyers (p.403)."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me (Signet)","review":"Fate made her friends with a young, handsome, charismatic young man named Ted Bundy.

It will definitely frighten you. It will also provide an intimate look at the life and death of Theodore Robert Bundy. This book is unique due to the fact that Ann Rule knew Ted Bundy. She wanted to believe for a long time that he didn't commit these crimes, but she eventually had to let herself face the truth. The Bundy case is one that will always fascinate me, and Rule's book is a staple for an exploration of the case."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me (Signet)","review":"The Stranger Beside me is a very interesting read about Ted Bundy and the heinous crimes he committed.The only gripe I have with the book, is that the author Ann Rule, writes about herself too much - it just seems un-necessary and contrived.Its still an interesting book to read though...a little slow in some parts, but still definetly worth looking into."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me (Signet)","review":"I really liked the way that Rule mixed the very professional description of the crimes with the very personal description of her friend, Ted. It was thoroughly creepy and seriously made me wonder about everyone I know. However, what I really appreciated was her focus on the victims rather then the killer. She makes a point to describe each victim as a person, what they did, what they liked, how they acted, etc, so you get the sense the people Bundy murdered were PEOPLE, and not just names on a list. I feel like she gave them an identity other then that they were victims of a horrible crime. I give her credit for that especially because of the fact she was friends with Bundy, and tried so hard to give him the benefit of the doubt for so long.My only complaint with the book is I felt it was drawn out. I didn't bother to look at how long it was (since I read it on my kindle, I had no real reference unless I checked the page number, which I didn't) and expected it to be around 300-400 pages. So that could be why I felt like it dragged a bit. But I also felt some of the trial and the epilogues could have been cut down (I would say the same about the crime description, but I felt she was trying to give each victim equal attention, and I think that was fair).Otherwise, the book disturbed and at many points seriously frightened me, while at the same time making me feel empathy for all the lives Bundy ruined. Rule is definitely an excellent crime writer, and this book will haunt me for a while."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me (Signet)","review":"the author is able to provide a unbiased view of the subject. anyone wanting to know more about the subject, this is the book to read."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me (Signet)","review":"This is a good, comprehensive true crime book about Ted Bundy.

This is the first book I've read by her but she is officially on my to read list."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me (Signet)","review":"Ann Rule captured the personalities of Ted Bundy. Great details of how they captured him. Better than the movie. Highly recommended if you are into true crime stories"},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me (Signet)","review":"This remains one of my favorite true-crime novels. Ann Rule really delivers here.Rule gives us not only the background story on Bundy's crimes, but also his childhood story, his victim's stories, and some incite as to what drove Bundy....at least as far as we know. She provides a complete picture of the man and his crimes, and I can't recommend this book highly enough to those interested in Bundy or killers in general.Her story is, of course, made more interesting by the fact that she knew Bundy. However, there are also draw backs to her \\"inside knowledge,\\" the most obvious of which is potential conflicts of interests and problems determining when she is sincere. Sometimes her story seems to go a little \\"too far\\" as when she is telling stories about nightmares she has about Ted. They may be true, and I hope they are, but they definitely made me wonder. If they are true, it brings into question her impartiality. Rule was really in a catch 22 with this book - there would always be questions, given her previous relationship with Bundy. Overall, I think she handled the situation professionally and impartially.The book does drag a little bit in the middle, particularly where she is sharing a lot of Bundy's letters to her - I would have expected that to be the most interesting part, but it gets a little dull at some points. Beyond that my only real criticism is the way she handles the delays in his execution; she treats them as if they are somehow phenomenal, even implying that Bundy might somehow be influencing the system. While this was less true then than it is today, delays in execution are extremely common. In fact, by today's terms, Bundy was executed rather quickly. While this was, as I said, less true when she was writing, I do think she gave into the temptation to stretch the truth a little bit for drama's sake. Either that, or she didn't have a full grasp of the reality of the death penalty, which I find unlikely as she usually seems fairly knowledgeable of the legal system in most respects.Overall I highly recommend. It will change your outlook on crime and criminals, and it will probably answer a lot of your questions about Bundy himself. I wouldn't recommend reading when you are home alone, though!"},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me (Signet)","review":"When I was a kid, I wrote an opinion piece in school - can't remember what that piece was about - but the teacher responded with much red ink, saying something like, \\"Choose a side, and argue it!\\" I think that that teacher was a she, and I think that she was right. And I think that a lot of school kids make the mistake of arguing both ways at the same time - hedging their bets - because they don't know how to argue. They don't want to offend as well. Big mistake.After reading 625 pages or so of \\"The Stranger Beside Me,\\" I believe that that is the biggest problem with Ann Rule's book. Throughout, she gives opinions like, \\"Oh, if only this or that, maybe I could have saved Ted Bundy\\" (how could she have had any impact on a sociopath such as Bundy?). And then at other times - near the end I believe - she opines, \\"Even if I could have saved Ted from the electric chair I don't think that I would have.\\" OK Ms. Rule; which one is it? (I believe that she perhaps wanted to show that she was torn between her love for Ted and her loathing for him at the same time. But in print, this type of flip-flopping doesn't quite work.)Another problem I had: Ms. Rule was surely not objective here, which yes is to some degree understandable as she was so close to it all. However, how is it that the Seattle detectives, once they realized that Ted Bundy was a suspect, allowed the same access to information for her? If I were the police, I would have said, \\"Look Ann. I'm sorry, but you're too close to Ted and so therefore we must lock you out. We cannot risk our investigation by giving you too much information, no matter how much we trust you.\\"One other problem: Ms. Rule, I believe, tried to make the Florida judicial system look so much more primitive than the \\"wise\\" system in Washington. It was almost like she thought, \\"They just wanted to kill Ted so they are animals in Florida, while we in Seattle are so enlightened.\\" This implied logic fell on deaf ears to me. Ted was a killer, a cruel killer at that, and surely deserved to die a thousand deaths. And yes, when he was executed I cheered as well, all the way back when I lived in Seattle. (I live in California now, another soft state perhaps on criminals.)I certainly liked the first half of the book better than the second half. Additional chapters were added after-the-fact, and to tell you the truth, I don't think those chapters added any clarity. In reality, they might have clouded the overall story. The first half was filled with edge-of-your-seat drama and terror; the second half kind of devolved into mostly courtroom strategy, some of which was only mildly interesting. But even still, I did give this book a four (4) star as I found it an interesting read that accompanied the better book by Dr. Robert Keppel."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me (Signet)","review":"The greatest purpose of Ann Rule's 1980 book \\"The Stranger Beside Me\\" is it terrifies you. After reading her extensive study of Ted Bundy, you feel compelled to lock the windows and doors. I defy anyone to ever get into a stranger's car again after these pages. It's not just Rule was deeply involved in the case, with a rare insider view making this one of the greatest true-crime works ever written, but the specter of Bundy himself being so extraordinarily deceptive. There is no criminal in history who fits the mold of this man obsessed with destroying women, his compulsion so acute he devised disturbingly intricate strategies to kidnap and murder.The early 1970s were not necessarily an innocent time, and yet Bundy swept the land to conduct his massacre. He was unusually attractive for a monster, with wit and intelligence at home in collegiate settings. He belonged in circles completely bereft of high-risk victims. He fooled so many, most notably fiancees and Rule herself, who worked with Bundy in 1971 at Seattle's Suicide Hotline center. In what is one of the great coincidences in history, Rule had been hired to write a book on the burgeoning \\"Ted\\" murders before Bundy was ever a suspect. Much to her shock following his arrest in Utah, she realized her friend could be responsible. Not until his Florida murder trial did she finally accept Bundy was a serial killer (a term created by his rampage).In Rule's own words, the idea Bundy was a brutal murderer was \\"incomprehensible.\\" Indeed, there has never been a convincing explanation as to why Bundy evolved into an obsessive predator. He was an illegitimate child growing up without a father, and he thought his grandparents were his parents and his mother his sister. There's really no evidence Bundy had an especially difficult childhood. But it appears his killing began as a teenager in Tacoma, Washington when an eight-year-old girl who lived on his newspaper route disappeared. He would never admit to the abduction, which remains unsolved.Rule details what could have been additional early Bundy crimes in the 1960s when he was a student at the University of Washington. As the book progresses, one begins to realize everywhere Bundy went unsolved cases against women took place. What appears to be the catalyst for his ultimate rampage was a collegiate relationship with Stephanie Brooks, an attractive, wealthy student from California who became Bundy's dream girl. She dumped him and Ted was devastated. Interestingly, he focused on a new psychology major, becoming an honors student and a dependable employee of the Seattle Republican Party. On the professional fast track, he recaptured Brooks' heart and when she accepted his marriage proposal, he cruelly dumped her in return. Two days later, the first female student disappeared.It's unthinkable Bundy would throw away a successful life and career. I'm of the belief he had already raped and killed multiple times. Certainly he had long contemplated his predator perversions, as the disappearances of 7-8 women were conducted with skill born of criminal experience. Arguably his most famous crime took place July 14, 1974 at Lake Sammamish State Park when he abducted two separate women. Such a brazen atrocity stunned authorities, though eyewitnesses encountered a man named \\"Ted\\" trying to entice women to his VW.By this time, murder apparently consumed him and Rule details circumstantial evidence of his failing grades as a law student in Utah. He would be arrested eerily driving near Salt Lake City equipped with handcuffs, crowbars, ropes and ski masks. Luck had run out and investigators were suddenly suspicious of this man named \\"Ted.\\" The walls were tumbling, and yet the story amazingly continued.Rule's attempts at analyzing Bundy, in addition to explaining her own feelings on the surreal developments, are fascinating. She reveals multiple letters they exchanged providing insight, though I'm not sure she ever pegged Ted correctly. \\"The Stranger Beside Me\\" has remained in print for years with updates in 1986, 1989 and 2000, inspired by renewed knowledge of criminal behavior and Bundy's execution. I appreciated Rule's insinuation of the murderous detail rather than exploiting Ted's demented behavior. Seattle detective Robert Keppel, one of the few to listen to Bundy's last-minute confessions before electrocution, would pen his own accountThe Riverman: Ted Bundy and I Hunt for the Green River Killer, including grisly facts and a portrait of the pathetically compulsive creature he became after years on Death Row. Though not as lyrical as Rule's work, it's a necessary contrast to the myth of Mark Harmon andThe Deliberate Stranger.The success of \\"The Stranger Beside Me\\" would inspire its own filmAnn Rule Presents: The Stranger Beside Me - The Ted Bundy Storyand Rule would evolve into the greatest true-crime writer in history (with more than 30 books includingSmall Sacrifices: A True Story of Passion and Murder (Signet)). But the epic Bundy tragedy is where it began for her career. Part investigation and self examination, this page-turner is a decades-long journey attempting to make sense of a man's destruction. Rule asks, \\"How can evil exist where you least expect it?\\" There is no answer, and we can only lock our doors."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me (Signet)","review":"Yet again Ann rule mesmerizes us with her detailed plots and dazzling writing. This is her best piece of writing in my mind and for anyone who likes true crime this is a must read book. I could not put it down the whole time I read it. Just don't read it at night. it will scare the bageebees out of you!"},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me (Signet)","review":"This book is simply terrifying -- no, not for the portrayal of a serial killer...but for its precious author! Kind of disturbing that a woman would send money to a man accused of heinous crimes even if they were \\"friends\\" and former co-workers. She also handed good old Ted her true crime articles for his reading pleasure! In Ann's starry eyes, Ted was such a great man and nothing ever seemed amiss, even though she knew he took money from women and never paid it back and cheated on his longtime girlfriend. Of course, that was just the tip of a very large iceberg. And she claims to be a former cop! As other reviewers here have noted, Ted is humanized while the victims are not well drawn and are portrayed as naive at best. At one point (early on), Ann gave Ted's name to investigators as a possible suspect and then said vaguely she found out her tip didn't come to anything. Aargh! Why didn't she follow up and press the issue herself, being an ex-cop and true crime writer? Chillingly, that was BEFORE many of Ted's murders had taken place. And she gives herself too much credit later, saying, oh, if only the cops had allowed me to see Ted in jail in Florida, he would have confessed right then and there. The joke's on you, lady, because Ted was just using you for cigarette money and as a sounding board for the usual murderer complaints--I am innocent, the food in here is terrible, the prosecutors don't know what they're talking about. Was her motivation getting a book out of it--or was she really that stupid? Either way, she comes off as an enabler to one of the worst serial killers in history."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me (Signet)","review":"This book is, if anything, a testament to the eerie manipulative effect that sexual-sadist-psycho-killer Ted Bundy has on women. Ann Rule is an ambitious, thoughtful, reasonably skilled writer; and yet she fell for him just like the others.I understand that she would have been conflicted when she found out that one of her good friends was a perverse murderer. But it's not as simple as that feeling of being torn... even though throughout her book, Rule seems content to leave everything floating in that ambiguous area. Friends come and go -- some things are enough to break off friendships over. Also, to be fair, she didn't know Ted all that well -- they had worked together and bonded a bit over the Crisis Center hotline that they both volunteered at, but it seems clear that Rule was very taken with Bundy's personality and strove to keep in contact. She was dazzled by him, and wanted to stay a part of his life because she thought it could be a very promising one. Which indeed it might have been... as many people have said before, with Bundy's intelligence and skills of manipulation, he could have been a very successful CEO.Ann Rule insists, on multiple occasions throughout the book, that she was NOT attracted to Bundy; that she was decidedly NOT in love with him... a claim that certainly warrants her insistent reinforcement. From her near-glowing tones describing Bundy, her sensitivity and expressed care about his needs, her seemingly boundless faith that -- despite all evidence -- it doesn't seem possible that he could be capable of such things; the attitude that comes across to the reader is definitely love. If not romantic love, than certainly familial. Rule says herself that she might have been vulnerable to developing an uncommon attachment to Bundy... she had lost her brother to suicide, and always thought of her relationship with Bundy as similar to the one she had with him. Maybe she felt like he just needed saving... needed someone to understand. A tempting conclusion, and even an understandable compassionate desire. But while she is writing this (very graphically detailed) account, she never really addresses the reality of what Bundy did. In the same way, she never seriously addresses the possibility that she was emotionally manipulated by Bundy. When you read between the lines of her account, it seems all too clear.And she GRIEVES for him -- she still remains in his grip. She even goes as far to say that her relationship with him was the deepest and most meaningful connection she had ever had with a man.Bundy was a con man to the very end. He was cruel, empty, manipulative to everyone he encountered, a desperate egomaniac, would rather die than be made a fool of, all the while NEVER SHOWING HIS TRUE IDENTITY TO ANYONE. He never owned up to his crimes in the least. He wanted to be accepted as a lawyer, a student, a successful young white male, and never for what he really was -- a serial killer, a sexual sadist, and a sick, sad man. This is what makes his case so incredibly heinous to me, and why Rule's almost tearful rendering of Bundy's downfall and eventual conviction leaves me feeling distinctly unnerved. It's just inconsiderate. If I were related to one of Bundy's victims and read this book, I imagine I would have a much more visceral reaction."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me (Signet)","review":"Public fascination with Ted Bundy has certainly been quite beneficial to author Ann Rule, who parlayed her association with Bundy into a lucrative cottage industry for herself and used it as a springboard to launch a commercially successful series of crime novels. While I wouldn't go so far as to say The Stranger Beside Me is worthless, I wouldn't exactly say it was close to being a definitive source on Ted Bundy, either (regardless of the amount of copies it has sold). Considering the title of the book, I suppose it isn't a great surprise that Rule's own life should figure into the storyline. What IS most irksome is the significant degree which the book concerns itself with (and the high amount of page space devoted to) the minute aspects of Rule's life that have an at best peripheral bearing on Bundy's life. This irksome feature is coupled with the needlessly dense style of Rule's often cliched prose, which can be quite a slog to penetrate at times. In addition, there are more than a few instances where raw data and factual figures become jumbled when restated throughout the book. It is also slightly odd that Rule frequently indulges in periodic self-gratification over her skills of detection and research into criminology while simultaneously admitting she had no real idea Bundy was doing what he did until virtually the rest of the nation found out about it in 1978. Outside of Rule's own interaction with Bundy over a fairly short span of time in the early 1970s and a dozen or so phone calls and letters exchanged between 1975 and the late 1980s, the rest of the book (which is most of it) is fairly pedestrian...almost sophmoric, really...in terms of the conclusions drawn about who Bundy was and why he did the things he did."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me (Signet)","review":"If this is the 'definitive' book on either true crime or serial killer Ted Bundy, then I find that to be pretty sad. Simply put, Ann Rule is not a good writer. Her prose borders on being cheesy and melodramatic. I appreciate the additional background information given on the victims, but Rule's prose is syrupy and almost comes across as mocking. Ex: \\"...when he got wind of her letter, he learned Janice had indeed expired\\" or \\"There was always tomorrow. Only there wasn't. There were no more tomorrows for Julie Cunningham...\\" Surely there must be more tactful ways to describe someone's death.One problem with the \\"The Stranger Beside Me\\" is it cannot decide if it wants to be memoir or biography. One senses Rule's relationship with Ted is played up a bit, and in that case, the book would have served better as a biography. There is too much information revealed about Ann Rule's life that is irrelevant to Ted Bundy. Yet the biggest problem with \\"The Stranger Beside Me\\" is how Rule presents theories as facts, when in reality it is nothing more than personal speculation. Besides the Devine murder, other information in this book has been proven completely inaccurate. One is Rule's theory that Margaret Bowman was Ted's designated victim on the night of the Chi Omega attacks simply because she was a brunette. Bundy actually planned on attacking Cheryl Thomas on Dunwoody street first, but since she wasn't home he went to the Chi Omega house. As for Margaret being his first victim, evidence reveals that Lisa Levy was attacked first. More alarmingly, she has Ted admitting to murders he never confessed to. Did he really commit these murders anyway? We don't know, but it's wrong to print that he confessed when further research states the opposite. Melanie Cooley's murder is now classified as a cold case, and according to \\"The Only Living Witness\\", Ted claimed to have killed only three women in Colorado. Rule also mixes up two Utah victims: Nancy Baird and Sue Curtis. He confessed to Sue Curtis's murder not Nancy Baird's. There are other minor errors that are insignificant, but because there are so many of them, Rule's credibility is further brought into question. Georgeann Hawkins is described as having brown hair, and then in the 2008 update she is suddenly a blonde. Liz Kloepfer's fake surname is 'Kendall' but Rule fudges up her last name as 'Kenyon' in the 2008 update. Chi Omega victim Kathy Kleiner is called 'Kathy Meiner' at one point.The moral of the story is one can't believe everything they read in one single book. In the case of people who become famous or infamous, there are always personal theories that get swept in as fact. The truth is out there, but sometimes you have to dig for it."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me (Signet)","review":"OK, I thought I had lost my innocence years ago but I was wrong. I'm pretty sure that this book took whatever was left.I wasn't expecting to be surprised like this. That this person existed....that would be enough. That the author was an intimate friend, destined to become a true-crime writer and involved before Bundy was a suspect is just mind-blowing.I'm not exactly sure what this book did to me. It was largely at an unconscious level. And it was intense. I still find myself frequently drifting back to thoughts and feelings about the book.I recommend reading this when you think you have already figured everything out about who to trust...or if you are finding the world at all boring.or if you just want to read *THE* masterpiece of true crime.

There's only one problem with these books (and I have to admit, I'm a fan of the genre): you begin to think your husband, boyfriend, brother, cousin, next door neighbor, and the nice little old lady at the hospital who dispenses pleasantries just might be a cold-blooded killer. I'm always a little stand-offish toward my strange-acting neighbor when reading these things. I try to think if there have been any killings or rapes in our neighborhood lately, and when his car doesn't show up for a week or two, I brood a bit on what he's been up to. However, soon after putting the book down, I realize that my imagination has been racing out of control thanks to Ann Rule, and how silly it was to suspect him of Ted Bundy-like behavior.I hope she comes out with a new one soon. In fact, in case true crime fans haven't noticed, there hasn't been too much fresh product in this area lately.

You don't know truely the experience, unless you've come across one, with the mask off) I, myself has come across one of these personality types, (Malignant Narcassist or passive/aggressive disorder). Not that all are &quot;killers&quot;, but the reaction is the same. And I think Ann did more than &quot;throw up&quot;! Probably left with a disturbing and never ending question of &quot;Why&quot;?After reading Ann's book, depicting every mood, every turn of personality from the handsome, witty lawyer to a crazed, angry killer, it brings me back to the recollection of the &quot;friend&quot; in my life who also took off his mask and realizing he was &quot;Nothing&quot; he appeared to be. Only later after research and theropy, finding out I was only a reminder of his &quot;mother&quot;. He wanted her love and punish her as well. Geez, how could I have known!I feel Ann Rule's book gives a thorough insight into how her friendship with Ted Bundy changes over time after realizing, things don't seem right; his lies, descriptions seem eerly similar. More of an insight of her intuition. I think the idea of the way Ted is able to hide his &quot;true self&quot; is just as compeling as the actual acts themselves. She gave, how many $10 to him? and personal thoughts! One doesn't like being made a fool!It's a must read and great description of the disorder!"},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me (Signet)","review":"I wanted to read this book because I was wondering if it was one of those \\"oh, he was such a nice man, shame about that sorority house though\\" kind of books. Ann Rule, talks about Ted Bundy in a way that is almost capable of making the man who stalked my nightmares as a child and pre-teenager almost seem like someone that could be understood. I found out a lot of details about his murder spree that I didn't know, for example, I found it quite interesting that almost all of his victims were women with the same features of the girlfriend who dumped him. Which is very creepy, while I don't think that Ann Rule was trying to make excuses for him, I do think that she was somewhat under his spell. The fact that she had staunchly defended him until the trial for the Chi Omega murders which was the first time she came face to face with what he really was capable of. I found this book to have its slow points but all in all it was a great read. For example, I didn't know that Bundy had a jailhouse wife that he had a child with.On a personal note, as I said, Bundy was the stuff of my young nightmares; the Chi Omega murders happened before I was born but \\"The Deliberate Stranger\\" brought that horror into my living room. I remember that from that day to this, I am always double check my locks, because I remember, watching Mark Harmon (playing Ted Bundy) walking down that hallway and trying the doors, one of them was locked and I can't help remembering that though that was what saved that girl. It was the stuff of my nightmares and somehow this book, was like when the sun comes up and you realize it was all a dream."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me (Signet)","review":"This is one of those instances where truth is definately stranger than fiction, imagine you write true crime stories and then as a effort to produce a novel rather than stories, you choose a current event whereby someone was brutally attacking young women leaving them for dead, then you get the suspicion that a man you were alone with at the dead of night (in a crisis centre) whom you shared your problems with could be this...'monster', and then you are proven right - it is him. To the best of my knowledge - even Hollywood didnt come up with this storyline.Reading an account of Ted Bundy's story (just after he was executed) was what actually what got me into reading true crime and watching similar type films. Here Ann tells of having worked beside the man and her impression of him is the absolute opposite that the media portrayed (Media - he was brutal, angry man, Ann- he was a shy, respectful person that listened - At times you think hell is she talking about the same man they executed for these indiscribable crimes against young women?) She tells of how they met, listened and helped each other with problems, there is even a possibility that had circumstances been different she might have been instrumental in at least getting him to stop, possibly even avoid going down the road he went - that's f you can believe that a bad person wont be bad if he/she gets the help/support they need at the right time - who knows?For me this was a very difficult read. I think partly because I made the mistake of first reading the update she recently put in and the women that were attacked - those that survived are up in their 50+'s now - were on average the same age as I am. At times the book is also a bit heavy like when where A.R. considers mentality, and factors that might have affected Bundy to do what he did (and at times she takes pains to explain as well - thats why the 4 stars).Overall - a great read."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me (Signet)","review":"I was disappointed in this book, especially after having read Ms. Rule's Dead by Sunset, which was far superior.I agree with ALL of the other 2-star reviewers.The book is too long and there is too much documentation about Rule's feelings toward Bundy. As one of the reviewers wrote: &lt;&lt;She comes off as an enabler to one of the worst serial killers in history.>> I agree! I also thought, \\"If I read one more of his stupid letters, I'm going to scream!\\" I love true crime stories and I looked forward to finding out what behavioral therapists had to say about him, more about the women he murdered, more about how the authorities finally tracked him down and realized that he'd committed murders and other crimes in other states. (The made-for-TV movie with Mark Harmon made the \\"aha moment\\" much more dramatic.)I grew tired of reading about how the author felt about him, and how he acted and felt. Toward the end of the book, Rule was still concerned about him, about wanting to send him money, about wanting to reach out to him. I wanted to bonk her on the head and shout, \\"Reality!\\"For such a famous case, the book was quite lackluster, and did not hold my attention. I was also irritated with poorly constructed sentences, unnecessary commas, and the uses of \\"which\\" instead of \\"that,\\" and \\"anxious\\" instead of \\"eager.\\"If you'd like to read this book, I recommend getting it in your local library. Don't spend your hard-earned money on this book!"},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me (Signet)","review":"Informative. Not very ppeasant to read but it keeps you glued to the story. I will read more of Ann Rule's books."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me (Signet)","review":"Was just waiting for the kindle version. Great book. Well written story covered in depth. Ann Rule really rocks it."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me (Signet)","review":"Ann Rule not only tells the story of Ted Bundy as she knows it, but in the process evaluates herself and her reaction as she comes to the reality that her friend is the &#34;Ted&#34; killer."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me (Signet)","review":"This book was well written and researched. Ann Rule talked about Ted Bundy from the point of view of not only a concerned friend but a well informed crime writer. Good book, easy to read. Alot of information. This was actually the first true crime book that Ann Rule ever wrote. Pretty strange that it would be about her own friend that happen to be a serial killer. Which just shows that Ted was an intelligent man who was only inspired by other intelligent and well informed individuals."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me (Signet)","review":"Regarding the purchase in and of itself, book arrived quickly in the stated condition. That's a happy thing.The book was oddly, a delightful read. I found that I didn't want to put it down. I was a teenager when Ted Bundy was in the public eye. I knew he was a serial killer but pretty much nothing else. What an awful position for a person to be in, but Ann Rule's telling of her relationship, and the straightforward approach she took with both sides is a true testament of her character. The chances of having an opportunity such as that as a crime writer; the experience of *knowing* someone like that personally- I can barely imagine what it was really like even though she did her best to tell all. He was fascinating, and her ability to face and revisit the truth is more than remarkable- I'm running out of words to describe it.If you want a good solid read, to be transported to a reality that you likely cannot identify with to any extent, to try to understand the potential falseness of truth and to be left awe stricken, read The Stranger Beside Me. It is absolutely worth every turn of the page."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me (Signet)","review":"This is a crazy story about one of America's most dangerous serial killers. Ted Bundy was one messed up soul and Ann does an amazing job of telling the story from her eyes (and relationship with BundY), as well as reporting what really happened according to police and the public. A great read."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me (Signet)","review":"What is unusual about this book is that it was written by someone who was a fried of Bundy before he was suspected of committing any crimes and that the author is also an excellent writer. This gives us a unique combination of a compelling story written by someone who knows a great deal about Bundy personally.I disagree with the recent reviewers who think Ann Rule is too pro-Bundy. First of all she says she would not have stopped the execution at the end. Her views obviously evolved over the years. Secondly he was her friend. Just like his family, people can be of two minds and she said it was nearly impossible to overlay the person she knew with the monster he was. She calls him a monster and obviously does not excuse his behavior. She wrote a 600 page book describing the horror.Like the overwhelming number of reviewers her I think this is an excellent and compelling book. Very highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me (Signet)","review":"Great Book. I have read it before but this recent release has more information added, such as women that have come forward reliving their stories to Ann about escaping Ted."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me (Signet)","review":"Considering the unspeakable horrors that Ted Bundy committed during his lifetime, Ann Rule's book is surprisingly devoid of gory details, which I appreciated. Although I enjoy reading true crime, I find myself turned off by lurid descriptions of beatings, rapes, and murders. Rule briefly mentions what Bundy did to the victims, but she does not dwell on this evil, focusing more on how Bundy approached his victims before abducting them. She tells the story from her own unique perspective as a close acquaintance of Ted's during the time he was committing many of his murders.\\"The Stranger Beside Me\\" moves at a quick pace, and I found myself unable to put it down, telling myself over and over that I would read just ONE more chapter before going to bed. The book itself is chilling, but well-researched, and the 2008 edition has a new forward by Rule, and also contains her addendums to all the previous additions. I would strongly recommend this book to anyone who is interested in true crime."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me (Signet)","review":"Ann Rule before she became a well-known true crime writer worked an evening a week on the suicide hotline with a young aspiring politician or lawyer named Ted Bundy. Nobody knows for sure when Ted started his killing spree so I can't say before or after he knew Ann Rule. Ted was charming, charismatic, and brilliant human being. Then there was the side of him that was dangerous, disturbed, and quite monstrous lurking inside him like a werewolf that changes during the full moon. Rule didn't think that the Ted she knew could be the same Ted that the Seattle Police were looking for. Anyway, this book chronicalizes her relationship with him but she doesn't shy away from the truth and remembers the victims as she does in all her books. They are the ones that need it most. Ted Bundy was a shocking serial killer because he appeared so normal, so charming, so good to be true, and that's when you know it often is. Rule does a good job in understanding Ted's girlfriend at the time, Liz, who was probably victimized by Ted's lies and his secret mask that conveyed this monster. She was his girlfriend at the time and with her daughter. Like Ann, Liz trusted Ted and loved him but like Ann, she came to believe in the awful truth that Ted was a vicious serial killer and we don't know how many victims are still out there because he was a slick serial killer who perfected luring his victims who were always female by using crutches, slings, and saying he was a police officer, and once the predator has his hands on his prey, there is no stopping him. Rule doesn't write about the reasons or the motives for Bundy's crimes. Why did he want the bodies? He would visit them after the fact and scatter their parts in dense Pacific Northwest Forest."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me (Signet)","review":"This book is definitely Ann Rule at her best. What other true crime writer would have the opportunity (albiet unknowingly) to work beside a serial killer? I thought I knew the story of Ted Bundy before I read this book, but Ann has so many details and accounts of Ted that only someone close to him would know.I was fortunate I was able to hear Ann speak at a dinner about her relationship with Ted. It's scary to think that someone she considered a friend could wear a mask so well that no one knew or even suspected Ted of the horrible things he did. The only one who didn't like him was her dog and they could never figure out why at the time.I consider this book to be the only book on Ted Bundy worth reading. It grips you and you can't put it down until you're finished. And you wish it was only fiction."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me (Signet)","review":"The best thing about this book is Ann Rule's unique perspective in being the only true crime writer who actually knew the killer as a friend before he committed his crimes! It's a fascinating read that is also heartbreaking for so many reasons. Rule perfectly describes the man she thought of as a younger brother, her affection and love for him, and the horror and true emotional pain she suffered as she slowly realized that he was a serial killer.Rule does a commendable and touching job of showing us that human relationships are extremely complex, and that emotions cannot be shut on and off like a faucet. Intellectually, she accepts that Ted is guilty and admits that she would not have stopped his execution had she the power, but she also confesses that she cannot forget the true friendship and affection she felt for the charming, intelligent, and seemingly open 24-year-old she met at Seattle's Crisis Clinic in 1971.Unlike many other books on Bundy (and there are plenty of them), this one allows a genuine first-person account of what he meant to people who knew him as something more than just a monster. It also proves unequivocally that Bundy's list of victims included more than just the poor girls he killed."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me (Signet)","review":"Overall, it is my opinion that this book is very well written. And, although Ms. Rule had published articles before, this book was a tremendous first effort.While I was reading the book, I kept thinking about what it would be like for me if a long-time friend of mine had been charged with multiple murders. How would I react? It definitely would not be easy to write a book about it. That considered, I feel that Ann did an outstanding job writing a balanced book and telling about the victims as individuals.I first heard of Ted Bundy when I saw the movie about him when I was in high school. I have always thought of him as the epitome of evil. This book helped shed some light on him as a person rather than just another murderer.I know quite well one of the first psychologists who evaluated him when he was arrested in Utah. He has believed that Bundy had a split-personality.I also once had a co-worker who still has the handcuffs that he used when he transported Bundy to USP. He had nothing good to say about the man.As for the book itself, there was one inconsistency that I noticed. In one subsequent chapter, she wrote that it was Julia Burr who'd had her arm in a cast. In the next, she wrote that it was Mary Burr who did.The book is quite well written. However, it seems as though she either really loves commas or overused them in an all-out effort to avoid using the conjoining word, \\"and.\\" That became a tad annoying after the first couple of chapters.Another annoying factor was that she continouously referred The Church Of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints as the \\"Mormon Church.\\" Also, she referred to Utah as \\"The Mormon State\\" rather than by its official nickname, \\"The Beehive State.\\" I'm not even from Utah and I know that.Other than those few things, I feel that the book was very good. I did find it interesting about the \\"Ted Groupies\\" being in love with Mark Harmon. The first time I saw the actor in anything was when he portrayed Ted Bundy. I had a very hard time seeing his characters on any show since then as a \\"good guy.\\" I always related him to Ted Bundy. The poor guy."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me (Signet)","review":"This book is amazing. Rule strings you along throughout, and not until the end does she even name Bundy as the actual killer. This book made me wake up in the night in a cold sweat and I still couldn't put it down. One knock. Although I realise its part of the story, I wasn't fond of the constant switchings into Ann's life. She might have been able to make the book without it; she might not have. Either way, this book will keep you reading until the last page...three times over."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me (Signet)","review":"Ann Rule brings superb style to this most personal of her true crime narratives. Ex-cop Rule never suspected that her charming and intelligent co-worker at the Seattle crisis phone center in the early 1970's was a warped rapist-killer. But then Ted Bundy had most people fooled, including the state's Governor (Dan Evans) for whom he briefly worked. Still, as the decaying bodies piled up, suspicions grew. This narrative covers the many crimes by this monster (in four states), the convincing mask he displayed, the efforts of law enforcement, and his escapes from custody that led to further tragedy. We also get a lengthy look at his trial in Florida - where this former law student assisted in his own defense - and his weaseling attempts to trade confessions for time as the hangman approached. Rule describes her own role in this brutal narrative, and (as always) lets us know something about the tragic victims; a deed one hopes gives some measure of comfort to grieving loved ones.THE STRANGER BESIDE ME is a personal and absorbing narrative about a gruesome serial killer and the author's unwitting friendship with him. This book ranks with the best of Rule's many superb efforts."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me (Signet)","review":"This is the book that got me started reading true crime, and it is rightly called \\"the classic story of serial murder.\\"Ted Bundy is now a household name and the embodiment of serial killers; however, when Ann Rule met him in 1971, he was a law student and fellow worker at a crisis center. Ann is assigned to write a story about several missing girls from Washington state...and the reader gets a front row view of not only the investigations, but Ann's growing horror and revulsion as she realized that the person responsible for these terrible murders is her good friend, Ted.Ted escapes, and Ann is guarded by FBI agents in case he tries to come to her for help in escaping. Ted calls Ann collect from Florida after being arrested and suspected of the Chi Omega murders, and hints that he would confess all to her. These and many other chilling stories provide a unique, highly personal view into Bundy's destructive life and drawn-out death.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me (Signet)","review":"As with the other reviewers, I have nothing but accolades for Stranger Beside Me. Unlike other 'true crime' books written by attorneys (prosecuting or defense) who like to show off how smart they are, Ann Rule gives a balanced, sympathetic account of the very strange life of Ted Bundy. But more, much more than this is the relationship between the author and the subject. They were actually good friends before Ted's murder spree. Stranger Beside Me is as much of an account of how Ann Rule copes with this situation - that is, coming to terms with the fact that a friend and work colleague is actually a killer. Fascinating, almost beyond belief.Clearly Ann Rule profited from her relationship with Ted Bundy. She went on to become a very successful writer. However rather than exploiting the situation Ann's good fortune really is just a bizarre twist of fate. No doubt she wonders if she would be where she is today if Ted Bundy never existed, or if their personal link never existed. I think Stranger Beside Me proves that Ann Rule would have been a successful writer regardless.Bottom line: a &quot;best of breed&quot; piece of true crime fiction."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me (Signet)","review":"I have almost finsihed The stranger beside me by Ann Rule and I would just like to share a little. This is the first True Crime book I have read and I would like to say it is also the scariest book I have ever read. I am having restless nights reading this book, but I just can't let it go! Ann Rule puts a lot of herself in to this book and although it is all factual and doesn't read like fiction at all, it stills chills you to the bone. Ted Bundy was a truly disturbed man and the way he managed to stay undetected for so long is one of the scariest things about him. The other scary thing is how the young women he attacked or kidnapped and murdered were so totally unaware of him and went willingly or they were asleep and had no choice when they were attacked. Brutal is a good way to describe the book, not only for its contents, but Brutual is also the effect it has had on me."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me (Signet)","review":"Ann Rule sees both sides of the coin--she tells the story about a friend who she worked with and socialized with. She also tells the story about a man who terrorized dozens of women, and received his just punishment. This friend/man was one in the same--Ted Bundy. You can feel Ann's trepidation as she discovers someone she likes and admires, is involved in some of the most heinous crimes in history. I recommend this book to everyone."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me (Signet)","review":"I don't have to tell you how fascinating the case of Serial Killer Ted Bundy is, if you are searching for a book about Bundy it's probably because you are aware of how special this case is. This is, in my opinion, the best book written about the case and one of the best book about Serial Killers/True Crimes. If, like me, you buy a lot of books about True Crimes then buy this book, this is a must-own and a great addition to a collection."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me (Signet)","review":"In Stranger Beside Me, Ann Rule tells of working at a suicide hotline and meeting an attractive young man there.The man she met was kind, courteous, and even helpful with her personal problems.Oddly enough, that man turned out to be Ted Bundy.At once a cautionary tale of just how little we can know about those around us and a gripping true crime story, Ann Rule effortlessly negotiates all the emotions and connections that emerge from her very unlucky pairing with one of America's worst serial killers.Appropriately enough, Rule starts at the beginning with her first meeting with Bundy. As the years progress she provides the often mundane blow by blow of their friendship which apparently started just prior to when Bundy went into high gear killing Seattle area college girls.In terms of how it read the closest any other book came to telling essentially this same story was Stephen King's novella Apt Pupil (later made into a movie of the same name). In Apt Pupil King's protagonist was a Dennis the Menace type boy who'd fixated his boyhood attentions on a Nazi war criminal in hiding.Though the King novella drew its story by defying our expectations of how the boy/Nazi criminal's relationship would/would not develop, the Rule book eschews those issues because obviously Rule wasn't aware of just who Ted Bundy really was.Sadly, Rule wasn't alone as scores of women succumbed to Bundy's charms and then his homocidal intentions.By acknowledging her delay in understanding what she needed to know about her \\"friend\\" Ted Bundy, Rule managed to raise the question of just when others themselves would have been suspicious.By reporting the devotion other women felt for Bundy even when the evidence was clear about him says much about the myopic qualities of human love."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me (Signet)","review":"This is the first Ted Bundy book i've read, but i am impressed with the amount of information and detail i have learnt about him.

Don't feel guilty about turning down a strangers request for help for it may be a ruse. Thank you Ann Rule for this masterpiece into the mind of a serial killer."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me (Signet)","review":"If you only read one True Crime book in your life, ''The Stranger Beside Me'' should be your choice. Author Ann Rule presents a chilling and disturbing portrait of one of American's most notorious serial killers, who just happened to be a good friend of hers. Rule's perspective on Ted Bundy's life, combined with her own writing skills, makes this book one of the best in its class.The author gives some background on Ted Bundy then traces her own meeting with him and their quick friendship. Bundy and Rule met while working late-nights at a crisis prevention center in Seattle. It was pure chance that a budding crime writer would be sitting right next to a budding mass murderer at the crisis clinic!Like many of Ted Bundy's college professors and other women, Rule found Ted to be highly intelligent, warm, caring, and handsome. Eventually they drifted apart as Ann began working on as a crime writer to document a string of recent murders in Washington state. The killings were horrific - young, attractive women were being abducted, raped, brutalized, and strangled to death. As Rule followed the cases as a professional, it slowly dawned on her that a young, male friend of hers fit the description of the killer!Rule follows Bundy's steps to Utah and Colorado, where more women are abducted and killed after he spent time in the area. Rule provides some background information on the victims that gives them life - instead of just being statistics. Most of them simply vanished while walking across a college campus or down a city street at night. Witnesses were few, but some remembered seeing a young man with a cast on his arm or leg, asking for help carrying something to his car.As the book progresses Rule covers Bundy's time in jail, legal battles, and his escape from custody and flight to Florida, where his manic killing spree re-emerges in a brief, 4-week flurry of attacks and killings. His final victim, one of about three dozen, was found dead in an abandoned hog shed, having been raped, beaten, and strangled. She was 12 years old.Reading a book this disturbing reminds me of how evil humans can be. Rule tackles the subject with seriousness and empathy, while at the same time not devaluing the victims with lurid descriptions of the crime scenes. I highly recommend The Stranger Beside Me, even though the killings were many years ago and Bundy has long since been executed for his crimes."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me (Signet)","review":"I was looking forward to reading Ann Rule's - THE STRANGER BESIDE ME.Ann was in the unique position of having been friends with Bundy since 1971,working together at the graveyard shift of a Crisis Center. Ann wants to give us her slant of a man arrested for unspeakable acts of violence, yet seemed more to chronicle each detail of Ted's life which had me skipping ahead at times. This book I felt was way to long. A shorter more indepth study would have kept my attention.Ann postioned herself as a surrogate mother of sorts, beliving that if she was granted permission to speak with Ted, he might have stopped killing women. It reminds me of wanting to be best friends with the school bully. Ann does not want to share him.Ann writes well, yet I expected more insight to Ted Bundy, a master of disguise, a rogue, a murderer. She had at her fingertips the inside track so to speak, yet I came away dispointed. Ted was a sociopath, Ann could have provided a portrait of a monster, I got tired of reading how she \\"Just Could Not Believe Ted Was Capable of The Crimes For which he was Accused\\""},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me (Signet)","review":"I read most of Ann Rule's work before this, her classic novel. One of my strongest impressions of her previous work has been the dignity and respect with which she writes about the victims. You can read the sympathy in her tone, though this sympathy never causes her to \\"sound\\" unbiased when describing the facts of the case. She also seems to describe the criminals in her book fairly dispassionately, though choosing adjectives and character traits that still allow her to express her overwhelmingly negative feelings about them.In The Stranger Beside Me, this familiar pattern falls apart. Understandably, her publishers wanted her to play up her friendship with Ted Bundy - and this she does. He is to Ann what I would consider a casual acquaintance, though she repeatedly calls him her \\"close friend\\". After working together at a Crisis Center telephone hotline and chatting between calls, they went their separate ways, remaining out of contact for years at a time. Once Bundy was arrested, a fugitive, re-arrested and finally tried and convicted, only during that progression did he seem to really re-enter Ann Rule's life, mostly (as far as I could read into the text of this book...) initiated by Ann herself.Her unique perspective into Ted Bundy's life and behavior could have made for a really fascinating book and character study, but somehow the latter goal was never reached. To her credit, Ann Rule never claimed to have any insight into Bundy's true character or personality. In fact, whether she intended this or not, her writing highlighted how very little she knew, suspected, sensed or intuited about him beyond the superficial. He was charming and handsome, she was a bit bewildered but also flattered by his friendship and correspondence. Now this may be because she was told to play up their friendship and as a consequence she repeated only what she knew: his whereabouts, his relationship with a certain woman, his cigarette brand preference - but as I read, I kept thinking: this wasn't a close friend of hers. She really didn't know him all that well.One more thing in that vein that I know has been covered in these reviews: I'm one of the readers who felt disappointed in the author's continued emotional support of Bundy even after it was clear he'd murdered many women, brutally and without conscience. After she was reasonably sure he was guilty she continued to send him money, to care about his emotional health, to write about him with compassion, to repeatedly describe his good looks, his smile, his eyes, his youthfulness, his intelligence.... I found this so distasteful at times I put the book down to think more about it. Even given that she was describing her own sense of disbelief that someone she knew could commit such crimes, she never seemed to pull back from a very caring, supportive tone when writing about him. She even only barely pulled back from the brink of seeming to make excuses for him and his \\"compulsion\\" to kill. I was uncomfortable with this, even as I acknowledged that what I was reading was a demonstration of how families of criminals can sit behind a mass murderer and still offer their love and support. Ann Rule demonstrates a mild case of this herself, and since I've gotten a feel for Ann through her previous work, I do have to acknowledge that this is how those irrational (seeming) feelings emerge.That said, the book was very readable though not as quick a read as some of her other stories. Yes, she still had compassion for the victims in her writing and she did a creditable job in describing the progression of events (though the flash-forwards and flash-backs were less cohesive than in her other work - I had to remind myself that though I'm reading this last, this is actually one of her earliest works). I tend to refer to the picture insets several times while reading one of her books - does the victim or the criminal look as I imagined, can you see any overt sign of malice in their eyes - and this book had several pictures I simply couldn't stop referring back to while asking: how could this have happened? how could he disguise such monstrous tendencies? would I have known this person had that potential if they approached me on the street?I found the final updated chapter revealing and thought provoking. Again I was disturbed by her admission that she continued to send Ted Bundy money in the hope that he would be comforted by it, comfortable, so that he could smoke... I again felt that this was so inappropriate I simply couldn't get my head around it. But that's me. You could still feel the ambivalence and confusion in her writing, and perhaps now, in 2009, ten years later, she's reached some kind of peace."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me (Signet)","review":"Ann Rule is my among my favorite writers, I read everything she has out there, her book on Bundy was chilling and one of the best on the subject"},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me (Signet)","review":"The most well known fact about this book is that its author - Ann Rule - knew Ted Bundy as a friend before he became the infamous killer he is remembered for. Naturally, this gives the whole book a special approach, and one that affects the author's very own point of view; negatively or positively, that's up to you to say, but I think she does a good job of it.What you get in this book is a good telling of the facts. It's a pretty long book, and it covers many interesting periods in Bundy's life.I would recommend it as a first book on Bundy. However, I have the impression that there was more to tell; specifically about the gruesome details of the cases. For instance, Ted did come back to the corpses of his victims and applied makeup to them; and according to his own confessions, he repeatedly came back to the bodies to perform necrophiliac sex and what not. I found very little on this in the book. Also, this is the first book on a serial killer where I have a really hard time to figure out the killer's personality. By which I mean. Bundy is obscure. He's definitely the most intelligent serial killer I read about, and believe me, the bulk of them are far from intelligent, despite glamorous Hollywoodian beliefs. Bundy had the brains, but his narcissistic issues still made him sound like a fool a times, as it never fails to do.A very interesting serial killer. I recommend this book for the unique point of view of its author and the thoroughly laid out timeline of the facts. Somehow, I feel there's more to be told, a lot more."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me (Signet)","review":"From policewoman to author, someone who knew and actually sat next to and worked with Ted Bundy. She sure knew him well. This book is really long and has a lot of good details about the many years of crimes and the long times it took them to \\"capture\\" him-without him actually escaping. He was very devious! This is definitly NOT for anyone under 18-20, it has some very graphic accounts of what he did to the women, if you are squeemish, not the book for you."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me (Signet)","review":"Ann Rule really knows how to tell a story so the reader can feel every emotion! I had trouble putting this book down; then again, I had trouble falling asleep at night after reading it. The story is so detailed. I learned so much more to the Ted Bundy story than I remember seeing in the movie. Rule does a fabulous job of letting the reader get acquainted with the victims...you feel like you know them. And the fact that she knew Ted makes it even more scary. This was my first Ann Rule book, and I have purchased a few more of hers. I would highly recommend this book if you want to know everything about the most notorious serial killer of our time."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me (Signet)","review":"This is an excellent true crime book. It has an unusual twist in that the author and the subject of the book, serial killer Ted Bundy, had a platonic relationship that arose from the time they were co-workers for a Seattle, Washington crisis center. Quite frankly, the author initially had no idea that Ted Bundy was anything other than what he appeared to be: a handsome, intelligent, charismatic, and articulate young man, who was, at the time, involved in local politics and later became a law student.When he became the suspect in the disappearance and murders of a number of very young, pretty women, the author was in total disbelief. As the evidence mounted against her friend, the author, who is a former police officer, could not shut her eyes to the reality that Ted Bundy was actually a very disturbed individual who was guilty of all of which he was accused and probably guilty of other such crimes for which he was not accused for evidentiary reasons. Consequently, the author would suffer some angst for many years, as she struggled to reconcile the Ted Bundy that she thought she knew with the fiend who was compelled to commit so many vicious abductions, assaults, and murders. It is believed that at least thirty-five young women, and probably a good number more, died at the hands of Ted Bundy.The author details the abductions, assaults, and murders of his victims from coast to coast, which crimes were ultimately to make Ted Bundy a nationwide household name, and an entity to be feared. The investigative efforts of law enforcement officers in the states of Washington, Utah, Colorado, and Florida are revealed, as are Ted Bundy's arrests and his trials. She also details his two escapes from custody in Colorado, the last of which would find him heading to the sunshine state of Florida.Florida was an interesting choice of state for Ted Bundy, as it is a death penalty state in which convicted felons, who have been given the death penalty, are actually executed. Notwithstanding Florida's stance on capital crime, Ted Bundy went on to commit a slew of shocking assaults and murders in Florida for which he was ultimately arrested, tried, and convicted. Considering the fact that Ted Bundy could have chosen to relocate to a state other than Florida after his last escape from custody in Colorado, it almost appears as if he had a death wish by going to Florida and continuing to give in to his sick compulsion. Unfortunately for him, Florida was quite happy to make his wish come true, and on January 24, 1989, Ted Bundy was executed, and his reign of terror was finally over.Those who like the true crime genre will enjoy this well-written and well-researched book. It is highly detailed and contains a great deal of information, some of it quite personal due to the author's relationship with Ted Bundy. She paints a very intriguing, intimate portrait of him, one that is three dimensional and complex. He was definitely a man whose benign and compelling external visage was at odds with his many internal demons, as he was a prolific serial killer. Externally, Ted Bundy was the sort of man towards whom women gravitated, and there was no dearth of Ted Bundy groupies once he made headlines.The interested readers should consider buying the twentieth anniversary edition of this book, rather than any of the older editions. The anniversary edition contains updates of the Ted Bundy story in which the author theorizes as to why Ted Bundy, a young man of so much promise, would end up the way that he did, and she provides some interesting and personal familial information from which the reader may draw his or her own conclusion. All in all, aficionados of the true crime genre will find much of interest in this book."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me (Signet)","review":"My Mom bought me this books years ago when I was still enjoying my summers at the beach with high-school and college friends - none of my friends could understand my anxieties -UNTIL THEY READ THIS BOOK - he could have been anyone of the guys we met - on the beach, the boardwalk, the bars or parties, we were still carefree in a sense, but we had this knowledge in the back of our heads - we never travelled home alone again...if we even attempted too (while in relaxed state of mind) we were quickly reminded of the name Ted Bundy - it was enough to make us wait for someone to walk home with you...

However, Ann Rule has done an exceptional job of covering her experiences with Ted Bundy as a co-worker and as one who corresponded with Mr. Bundy through numerous letters after he left the state of Washington. Sadly, Mr. Bundy often appealed to the goodness in others in getting them to help him when he appeared handicapped with a cast on an arm or a leg prior to killing them. Ted Bundy is the classic example of how it has become impossible to trust even the most sincere person who has a desire to help another individual. Ted Bundy has shown there is no stereotypical individual as to what a serial killer should look like. The book is 456 pages long, but it certainly makes for gripping reading. I would not, however, want to read another book on Ted Bundy. This one was enough."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me (Signet)","review":"This was the 2nd Ann Rule book I read, and after reading it 3 times already over the past few years...it still sends shivers down my spine.

However, she often deviated from the story to talk about her personal life. The sections in where she wrote about herself interupted the flow of the novel. I beleive she tried to credit herself too much throughout the book. in some parts of the novel there was too much of a description. Some things could have been written better with fewer words. The overall story of Ted Bundy was awesome. The story itself was intriging and interesting to read.

The bottom line is who cares if she worked with him and was friends with the guy? That doesn't make her any more qualified to write about him then anyone else. Miss Rule adds to much conjecture and her own personal opinion.Miss Rule also plays hard and loose with some of the facts. For instance she states that James Dobson (who interviewed Bundy just hours before his execution) is an evangelist and preacher. That's simply not true, Dr. Dobson graduated with a PHD from USC in psychology and is a fully licensed psychologist in California. He worked as the head of the pediatrics division of USC for 14 years. She calls him an evangelist because he has a radio show called Focus on the Family and is a Christian man. To me this sounds of sour grapes that Miss Rule didn't get the interview with Bundy. She also states that Bundy and Dr. Dobson had been \\"corresponding for years.\\" That is also not true. Ted Bundy had contacted James Dobson two years prior and wanted to schedule an interview.Finally Miss Rule states at least umpteen times that she had never seen anything strange in Bundy's personality or behavior when she was friends with him. This is so predictable, in that how many times do we have to hear that some creep who has killed people was \\"normal\\" and a very \\"nice guy?\\" The fact that Miss Rule didn't detect any abberation in Bundy's behavior is insignificant. Ann Rule says that she was completely shocked when Bundy began to confess, as if she still held to the belief that he was an innocent man being rail roaded until then, give me a break. I guess the only way that Miss Rule would have considered him weird or odd is if he was exposing himself while doing back flips.I was hoping to find more about Bundy's childhood and information into the investigation and trial. Ann Rule continues to give her opinion when it is not needed nor wanted. I don't care one iota that she knew him and I certainly don't think it is mysterious that she knew him. The guy had tons of friends and it is inevitable that someone would have written about their personal knowledge of one of the worst serial killers of the 20th century.If you are looking for insight into the investigation and why Bundy did this, don't waste your time with this book. It is too long, and Ann Rule spends way too much time talking about what she thinks and the times that she spoke with Bundy in her personal life. It's about as interesting and if I wrote about my conversations with my co-workers throughout the past year. It's boring.I would recommend \\"The only living witness\\" over this. Ann Rule used to write articles for detective magazines. Her writings are evident of that. Sorry to say but this reminded me of a trash novel."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me (Signet)","review":"I do not know what it is about Ann Rule's writing style , but i just can not seem to get caught up in her books.

You feel her struggle with her own feelings as she comes to realize that this &quot;friend&quot; is really a mad man who has killed all these girls, then thinking back to the nights they worked together alone! It will bring chills to you, because Ted was just a regular guy, like maybe that guy you work next to!!!!!

No doubt that Mr. Bundy will remain in the history as the &quot;alltime&quot; person you NEVER want to sit next to. He never showed remorse even on his last day here on earth. &quot;Who,me&quot;?

For many reasons,this case was one of my motivations for pursuing a career in law enforcement.This book by Ann Rule revealed many things that I never knew before about Bundy.He was arrogant and acted like he was the victim instead of the poor young women and girls whose lives he violently ended.Bundy not only manipulated his victims but also women he had friendships and relationships with,including Ann.Bundy faded from memory somewhat after he was justly executed in January 1989,(which I celebrated)but recently his horrible antics resurfaced when someone mentioned his name.This book, as disturbing and disgusting it is to read about Bundy's rampage,it is also very hard to put this book down.I was once again reminded what a demon possessed loon this guy was.He turned many lives upside down without any human feelings of any kind. In my opinion,he is in the same class as Osama Bin Laden,a brutal terrorist who met his demise to the cheers of many who long awaited justice."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me (Signet)","review":"tells the story of ted budy with the use of facts but also manages to humanize him."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me (Signet)","review":"As always, with Ann Rule, This book is written in a very organized way, which is what I really like about this author. I don't think any other true crime writer flows as easily as she does, while managing to get in all of the facts and informaiton. So I was completely enthralled in the book. But...I couldn't give it 5 stars because there was something picking at my brain, bothering me as I read this book, but I could not put my finger on it. I don't share the opinion that she exploited this whole nightmare, just for her own gain. I think it was just that I could not connect the actual depth of their relationship to her willingness to be unsure of his guilt, in light of all of the facts. When I say \\"all of the facts,\\" I do understand that she was not privy to all of the information that the authorities had. But even being privy to what would ONLY have been released to the public, logic tells me that she had to know he was guilty. At the very least, she had to know this by the time he had escaped from jail the 2nd time. Ann Rule had been a former cop. She was a TRUE CRIME WRITER. I find that those two facts largely outweigh the depth of her relationship with Bundy. When a parent, sibling, child, etc., cannot seperate themselves from the blaringly obvious, it is understandable, if not frustrating. But I didn't gleen that deep of a relationship between Bundy and Rule, even though there are several times during the book that she is quick to point out her self-struggle with her involvement (i.e., the counseling she sought) which I believe she portrayed genuinely. I just can't shake the feeling that somehow, we were misled to think she was in this denial so that it could justify her loyalty to him, and the longevity of her ability to share humor with him through his letters instead of being repulsed by the idea of it. These are just my feelings and my impressions, which I'm SURE will be scrutinized by her loyal fans. So I will end with a reminder that I did give this book 4 stars, or as I prefer to look at it--almost 5. This book deserves them."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me (Signet)","review":"I am 28 and so was only a young girl when Bundy was executed. I had heard of him, but was not familiar with the extent of his crimes. Working in the forensic field, I am fascinated with the stories of true crime and serial killers. I am an avid reader but sometimes it is hard for me to find non-fiction books that really hold my attention. Not the case with this book. I received this book for my birthday and started it as soon as I finished the book I was reading at the time. I couldn't put it down!The original book ended before Bundy was executed but there are several follow-ups at the end that really carry the story through to today. Because Rule knew Bundy, she is able to provide much insight and goes above and beyond just the facts.I highly recommend this book if you are at all interested in knowing more about one of the most notorious serial killers of all time."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me (Signet)","review":"Ann Rule was Ted Bundy's friend..indeed she might have seen him for a time as little brother, replacing the one who tragically killed himself. I've read many a book on crime, but never has the author known the subject so well. It lends a fascinating and spooky feel to the narrative. The book is a bit long and can be a bit slow at points, but that is bound to happen when the last 100 pages or so are updates (from '86, '89, and '00). Nevertheless, the Bundy shown is the whole man. I think that is incredibly important. Some will argue that Bundy is strictly a monster and should not be humanized. I disagree. What makes Bundy (and those like him) so terrifying is their very humanity. And their ability to so easily destroy the humanity of others."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me (Signet)","review":"I know many are going to disagree with me, but this book about Ted Bundy wasn't all that great. There's a good deal of Bundy's biography here, but the relationship touted in the book regarding Ann Rule's friendship with Bundy seems, to me, to be stretching it for what she can. So she worked with the guy for a bit and then stayed in contact with him over the years... so what. That's like any of us writing a book about someone you worked with at a job you had in college. Rule seemed to be straining to show that she knew Bundy and were dear friends. I just didn't pick that up in this book. She seemed to be grasping to show she knew him. Otherwise, the book is a very good biography of a twisted man and his demented actions.Another thing that bothered me about this book is the softness of it. Let me explain; in I-5 Killer, Want-Ad Killer, and Lust Killer, the author lays out the crime scene and actions as you go along in those books, giving details of what happened in the various assaults and crimes. The author avoided doing that this time, simply noting that so-and-so disappeared on this date or was found in this condition. Rather than giving the scenario and actions of the crimes, Rule glazes over them until the Chi Omega house assault, almost as if she were trying to convince herself that Bundy didn't do these crimes.Overall, its a good book to biograph Bundy, but the author dwells on what seems to be a self-convincing thought process that her and Bundy were best buddies or childhood friends and spent dozens of years together rather than one time coworkers that stayed in touch. The whole court scenes are drawn out and appear to be space fillers but none-the-less it was certainly readable."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me (Signet)","review":"Ann Rule's 1980 true crime memoir is the gold standard for the last three decades of crime non-fiction. Rule holds a unique position as a renowned crime journalist and first-person participant in the life of prolific serial murderer Ted Bundy. The pair were co-workers and confidantes at a Seattle crisis hotline in 1971, just years before Bundy's killing and mutilation of young women ramped up in multi-state sprees. Rule was older than her friend, in the process of a divorce in 1971, and served as a motherly figure to the handsome man who charmed so many others around the nation (even after his conviction). Throughout his jailings on suspicion of burglary, kidnapping, attempted murder, and murder, Bundy reached out to his old friend via phone calls and letters. She was upfront with him about her book contract negotiates and her desire to transition from a magazine journalist to book author with a story about Bundy.The story is as much an exploration of Bundy's childhood, troubled life, complex relations with women, and crime as it is a meditation on friendship. Detectives in the first cases against Bundy asked to see his letters to Ann, and she sought psychiatric help to sort out her feelings on the matter. She was friends with the police, who trusted her not to prematurely reveal crime details and to whom she pointed out interstate connections between various crimes (both Bundy- and non Bundy-related), but she also felt a loyalty to her friend. She wondered if she was exploiting Bundy to advance her own career and secure a financial future for her children. After careful contemplation, Rule determined that regardless of Bundy's guilt, she would keep writing to him, she would provide a friendly ear, and therefore she was not using him. In fact, she realized she might be one of his few true friends, and the only female not under his manipulative spell (Bundy maintained several simultaneous long-term girlfriends while he was imprisoned).No one knows how many murders Bundy committed (he made a dozen deathbed confessions but refused to comment on any child murders). In her book, Rule, who long wrestled with Bundy's claims of innocence in the face of overwhelming circumstantial evidence, enumerates exactly which crimes she thinks Bundy is guilty of. She also describes her theory that Bundy's murders stemmed from the rejection he felt from a socialite college sweetheart (his victims all bore a striking resemblance to his one-time fianc&eacute;e). Rule is in a unique position to describe Bundy both objectively and subjectively, and her book is an absolute must-read. The twentieth anniversary edition contains both 1989 and 2000 updated on the evidence against Bundy and the culture of true crime and justice in America."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me (Signet)","review":"After studying what makes a serial killer the way he is/was... I had a lot of books on Ted Bundy, but they were only by Chroniclers, men who were journalists, who only wanted to chronicle Ted's crimes as he sat on death row, they never knew him personally... and had made their judgments of his crimes in that manner... they didn't know the OTHER SIDE of Ted Bundy. Just the person he became sitting on Death Row.This is the first Ann Rule book I bought ever. She gives insight that other journalists that have \\"talked to bundy on death row\\" have not. She not only gives insight as a True Crime Writer and friend of every police precinct in Washington, but she also gives insight as a close friend and co-worker (in a Crisis Center) of Ted Bundy.We not only see how Ted was before and after he was caught in 3 states, but also what she thought of him during those times. She never sensationalize Ted the Monster, nor catered to \\"Poor Boy Ted\\", she just stated what she witnessed of him, and news articles on him.I must admit though, of all the serial killers I have books on from Women Who Kill to Jack Olsen's books... this one... after I was finished reading the last page, I couldn't go to sleep, I was wondering what would I do if someone came through my window, and didn't sleep well at all. The frightening thing about this book... is... What would you do in Ann's situation if you suspected, and knew there were investigations of serial sex murders on YOUR Best Friend... a very chilling account of \\"Ted Bundy As I Knew Him\\"-type of book. I highly recommend this."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me (Signet)","review":"Well, first of all, I don't really understand how the reader below said this portrayal was &quot;too sympathetic&quot;--why? Because it tried to portray Ted Bundy as a whole, complete individual? That's what makes this book work--showing that a person who can be as genuine and kind as any friend of ours can also secretly be one of the nation's worst serial killers. At any rate, in terms of the actual book, it's an engrossing story of Ted Bundy's life, with the added bonus of it being by someone who actually knew him. The personal touch didn't really contribute to a greater understanding of Ted, however; I don't think Ann Rule understands him any more than the average reader. What's most striking about this story is that both times he was caught (in Colorado and then in Florida), it was because he foolishly ran away whenever a cop happened along his path. It wasn't brilliant detective work that finally stopped him, it was chance. Pretty creepy!"},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me (Signet)","review":"Even though \\"Stranger Beside Me\\" is a book about one of America's most notorious serial killers, it seemed overly long and inert--perhaps because it was written in the first person, and that person was Ann Rule. I put it down several times and had trouble picking it up again.The author had the perfect background for this story: she and Ted Bundy worked together as volunteers at the Seattle Crisis clinic in 1971; she was already a crime writer, and an ex-cop to boot; she was assigned to work on the case of the mysterious North-west killings long before Bundy was suspected of committing them. She also belonged to the same sorority (Chi Omega) where Bundy went on his next-to-the-last killing spree in Florida--the case that finally put him on death row.\\"Stranger Beside Me\\" has almost everything you might want to know about Theodore Bundy: his childhood; the shame he felt because he was illegitimate; his two escapes from prison; the murders he committed and those that he probably committed; the police who were involved in his case; the women who loved him; his court appearances; his confession; his death.However, the book also has a lot you might not want to know about the author: her bad dreams; her \\"extrasensory awareness of evil or danger\\" in various places connected with Bundy's murders; her feelings about his feelings; her on-again off-again loyalty to Bundy. There's a great deal of print taken up about how he was really tearing her up inside with all of his alleged wrong-doings, but I couldn't help wondering if the money she sent to him in prison played a role in his escape to Florida. I also couldn't help wondering if she stuck with him as long as she did (this is probably totally unfair) because of this book contract.Ann Rule does have a unique insight into the soul (if he had one) of a killer. This is definitely a one-of-a-kind true crime story. It's just that I feel it could have been tightened up and cut from 548 pages (the updated twentieth anniversary edition) down to around 350, or so by eliminating the author's personal psycho-dramas."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me (Signet)","review":"This book reads like a preposterously coincidental fictionalized account of someone's acquaintence with serial killer Ted Bundy.

As she was well older than he, and hardly fodder for his brutish obsession with tall, young, beautiful, long haired women, and the two developed an almost sibling-like rapport that spanned several years, his arrests in two states, and the entire North American continent.Throughout, Rule's memoir remains personal, which allows Ted's story to unfold without the grotesque and gruesome details that would drape a more traditional biography. We get to know this especially intelligent and creative young man, and to see him as he appeared to the world as one witty, amusing, and urbane. We see their friendship develop over time, watching it turn into a mutually enjoyable and important -- if at times long-distance -- friendship of mutual respect and regard.The same qualities allowed him to fool his victims, ensnaring them with nary a wimper or whine in their own defense. We hear the evolution of this crime wave of murder and abuse as Rule herself must have heard it: episodically, without full color details or explanations... yet with Ted-related coincidences too extreme for her to ignore, though too brutish to believe.Especially for the squeamish, I consider this book a fantastic chronicle. I am easily scared and very suggestible, but this book didn't give me nightmares, for Rule practically takes us by the hand and shares not Ted's story, but her perspective of Ted's story. Thus, we not only understand the dichotomy of Ted Bundy, but we share Rule's dawning horror as she realizes her friend, her correspondent, her attractive and amusing pal is, in fact, the insidious embodiment of evil who brutally and insidiously pillaged the lives of several dozen innocent young women.When Rule finally put together the idea of Ted with the reality of his crimes, she threw up. I wanted to do the same.This book is eye opening and enthralling. As our world becomes increasingly unstable and unpredictable, I find this book an important opportunity for the vicarious experience. Other Rule books are intriguing and compelling, but none of the others I have read lend the same scandalizing horror as this one. I recommend it highly."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me (Signet)","review":"By far, the best book written about this mad man. Why? Because the author got to know the man behind the beast and tell his story as if we had known him. Ann Rule's account of the gripping murders brings to light how very close each one of us is to the horror and frightening reality of this world. This book never left me through the five or six times I have read it through...and it still sends chills up and down my spine. A must read for any true crime fan."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me (Signet)","review":"The Stranger Beside Me, is told with infinite attention to detail and answers some of the questions that linger in our heads about the mysterious Ted Bundy, making this the most personal book about him. An unsettling, intensely personal inside look at one of the nation's most infamous serial killers, it gives an intriguing observation that will keep you spellbound as you hear much of Anne Rule's relationship with him. She recounts how she was an unsuspecting coworker (Seattle Crisis Center hotline operators) and a close friend whose suspicions multiply during his killing spree. He often sat beside her and shared thoughts, discussions and laughs with her. She is supportive and unsure of his guilt at first, but by the end she realizes he really is the wicked person committing these crimes. It's not surprising that Ms. Rule had no idea since he was one very clever individual. The adjectives to describe this book are too numerous to mention and once you read it, you will know why.Ted Bundy was many things: charming, witty, amiable, charismatic and polite. Most of all, however, he was a sociopath who killed with such rage and deliberation, this story will make you think twice about strangers who approach you in parking lots. I know he wasn't wired right, but I keep asking myself why? What REALLY made him tick? The account of Ted Bundy's killing spree at the sorority house gave me chills for awhile after reading it. He was, however, not the genius that some people make out to be: he couldn't finish law school and he chose to take his killing spree to Florida, of all places. The book also doesn't concentrate on his victims as statistics but gives them the respect and dignity they deserve in a culture that seems more fascinated with the killer than the victim."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me (Signet)","review":"Ann Rule's \\"The Stranger Beside Me\\" is probably the most frightening of all the accounts of Ted Bundy's murderous career. Why? Because Rule was a former policewoman, she considered Ted Bundy a co-worker and friend and never saw the sociopathic personality lurking behind his charming facade. As a society, I think we want to believe that we can easily spot those Bundys, Dahmers, Gacys . . . and Rule's book emphasizes the fact that we cannot. Those monsters blend in sometimes seamlessly with the rest of us.Rule's book does a huge service to Bundy's victims by recognizing them as more than just \\"Bundy victims\\". Reading about their dreams, their goals and their daily lives makes the horror of their deaths sting even more.Rule's sadness over the story comes through in nearly every page - - sadness at the loss of lives and sadness over what Bundy's life could have been and what he could have offered had he not been so consumed by murder. Having known Bundy before he became infamous as a serial killer, Rule gives insight into Bundy's personality and character, from his childhood, through his adolescence into his political and legal aspirations, all the while fostering a murderous rage toward women.An insightful book, one that makes you check and doublecheck your windows and doors and pray that you never cross the path of someone like Bundy.Definitely one of Rule's best books. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me (Signet)","review":"Ann Rule's book is an exhaustive examination of Ted Bundy. Originally published in 1980, it was published again with an update in 1989 after Bundy's execution, again in 2000, and the current version is dated April 2008. Rule has updated the book as new information has come in. With the recent release of Bundy's DNA (July 2011) it is possible some of the unsolved murders Bundy is suspected of committing may be solved. If so, then Ms. Rule will undoubtedly have to come out with another, updated version of this book pending further developments. This is a case, where, like the perpetrator himself, secrets have only been given up grudgingly but thanks to modern forensic science it appears we will have a fuller picture of the man and his misdeeds. At over 600 pages, not an easy or quick read, but an incisive portrait of a manipulative and psychopathic individual who appeared driven by impulses he did not understand or could not control and who had no remorse or contrition for his crimes."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me (Signet)","review":"I've worked in prisons most of my adult life. I have looked many killers in the eyes...some who committed crimes as disturbing as Bundy's. You can see it in most of them. The most disturbing thing about Bundy is the fact that most people couldn't see it. Even his friend, Ann Rule, didn't see it.\\"The Stranger Beside Me\\" by Ann Rule is a brilliantly constructed book. It's amazing how she transitions from not knowing anything about the murders to not believing the murders to accepting that her friend, Ted, was a serial killer. It's shocking and interesting to read. This book includes a lot of details that I never heard anywhere until I read Rule's book.I rank this book as possibly the greatest true crime book ever written. It might be second to \\"Helter Skelter\\". I enjoy all of Rule's work, but this one is different. Her personal connection to the subject makes it even more disturbing. It's brilliant. Her very rounded background and relationship with Bundy give a perspective that we'll probably never see again in another book. I recommend it to anyone who likes reading crime books. It reads like a novel, only it's more difficult to stomach. It's real."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me (Signet)","review":"I got interested in the Ted Bundy saga after watching a movie about his life. I've read one other book about him: The Only Living Witness: The True Story of Serial Sex Killer Ted Bundy.This one by Ann Rule differs insomuch as Ann actually had a real life working relationship with Ted at the crisis clinic in Seattle prior to his national infamy. This puts Ann in a unique position to comment on the Ted that Ted let her see. Amiable, smart, good looking, sharp etc she uses all the metaphors one would never tie to a serial killer of such magnitude or, a serial killer in general.Ann walks us through the time line of Ted Bundy from his early days with a seemingly brilliant career ahead of him to his final days where all hope for his life had run out. I enjoyed this book slightly more than the one I mentioned above as Ann offers some background to Ted only someone who knew him could. This allows the reader to peek into the mind of someone who, reluctantly, you have to assume is mad.She admits to being taken by his charm and charisma as were so many others with tragic consequences. She shares letters written between her and Ted when Ted was incarcerated before and after his convictions.She also talks us through her internal battle to come to the realization that yes, the Ted she knew was capable of the horrific crimes he was accused of. Ann was an up and coming crime writer who had connections, along with the respect, of various police agencies and this relationship made her privy to key people involved in the Bundy saga. She gives us the benefit of her conversations with the key people and offers us her personal opinion based on the facts presented and her own internal thoughts based on the man she thought she knew.I especially enjoyed the part of the book which came after Bundy's conviction for murder. Ann outlines all the appeals and what they were based on. These appeals kept Ted alive for some 9 - 10 yrs AFTER being found guilty of murder and sentenced to death in Florida's \\"sparky\\" electric chair. Also, Ted's overwhelming arrogance and disregard for anyone but himself are bought into view as he tried to engineer his own defense which included firing one after the other public defenders and his partaking in court room theatrics usually reserved for Hollywood.I deducted one star due to the fact I felt the book was finished about 100 pages before it actually did. Ann offers too much post opinion and rehashes her thoughts which basically added little to what had already been written. Still, I thoroughly enjoyed the book and would recommend it as a valuable narration on a dark, dark human being who could easily be termed \\"evil\\" personified."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me (Signet)","review":"For a brief period in the early 1970's struggling writer and single mom Ann Rule worked as a volunteer at a suicide hotline. On at least some evenings she worked the phone bank, she was in the company of a college student named Ted Bundy, Bundy was pleasant company and good at his job. They became casual friends. And they both moved on, Rule to her career as a free-lancing true-crime writer (under the pseudonum \\"Andy Stack\\"), Bundy to various jobs in and out of Washington State government and also law school.One of the stories that Rule became involved in was the serial killer stalking the college campuses of Washington and some adjoining states; the victims were all vivacious young women in their early 20's with long, center-parted hair. It was on the day of this killer's most brazen attacks, kidnapping two women from a state park packed with thousands of people, that he finally acquired a name. \\"Ted.\\" (The name he gave to several young women he attempted to persuade to help him with a non-existent boat, his arm in a sling).Like more than a few people in the Seattle area, Rule noted Bundy's resemblance to the witness sketches, not to mention the name, and wasn't quite able to shove it to the back of her mind. Like these other people, she eventually went to the police and felt deeply embarrassed later.And then, Bundy was arrested in Utah for kidnapping and assault, and soon there were charges in Colorado for murder, and soon Rule, despite her friendship with Bundy, and his insistence that this was all a mistake, began to wonder if he was the Seattle \\"Ted.\\"He was. And he claimed victims in Utah, Colorado, Iowa (confessed only in the days before his execution), and Florida--including a pre-pubescent girl, Kimberly Leach. Rule does a smart, restrained job of chronicling the various investigations (she doesn't dwell on lurid details), and draws fast, vivid portraits of the women Bundy killed and does a powerful job of chronicling the ripples of misery and destruction that spread out from him as he drifted about the country.Several people have complained that there is too much of Rule in the book, but her presence is necessary; one of the major themes of the book is how little we may actually know about people we think we know well, and the deep turmoil of emotions that this stirs up. Rule writes intelligently and movingly about the emotional tug-of-war that Bundy stirred up in her, a conflict that will probably never be finally resolved."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me (Signet)","review":"I have been reading Ann Rule books for several years but never got around to reading The Stranger Beside Me. I owned the book, but kept putting it aside to read other books. After reading her Green River book, I decided to finally read the book about Ted Bundy.Now, to preface my rating, I must tell you that in 1974 I moved to Florida with my family just after my high school graduation. I worked for few years going to community college before enrolling at Univ of Fla in 1978. This was the year that Ted Bundy came to Florida, to FSU, just up the road. I had never heard of him until the murders and the trial, but by then I was a student at U of F. It was horrifying and yet for us college students, a bit surreal. We took it seriously but then we really didn't. We still propped open our dorm doors at night so people could get in without keys. We still walked alone around campus at night. We were stupid and even the horror of Ted Bundy did not shake us up. So this is probably why I bought this book and didn't really want to read it... it was real and I was so close to it. I could have been one of his victims, all of us in college during those times could have been his victim, and it is hard to swallow.The book I am rating as 5 stars even though I don't believe it is her best book. It was her first real book and since she herself was a main character, I can imagine how difficult it must have been to write. I give her big kudos for going through with it, knowing the kind of criticism she was going to receive. The books has its flaws but I think it was a story that needed to be told and the fact she was right there as a part of it makes it a great book. If you are a True Crime buff, like me, you need to read this book. The story is important, but also the lesson that we can be so close to evil and not know it is important. Ann Rule was an experienced investigator and cop and yet she didn't see the evil inside of him. That fact makes it easier to understand why family members of so many \\"killers\\" can't believe the truth, even when confronted with the facts. Sometimes we can't see evil, we are too close."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me (Signet)","review":"As I sat reading Ann Rule's riveting book, it occured to me that this piece of crime writing is actually a classic in American literature. Some may not agree. How many people can start to write about grisly murders and find out that a true friend that used to work by her side was the actual killer? This book takes one into the deepest,darkest, sickest recesses of Bundy's mind and lays him out for what he is, a creature that was unstoppable and who really could not stop himself from these horribly gruesome crimes. One even comes, at times, to care for Ted Bundy, and then just in time, realizes that you are caring for a monster, so sick that words can't describe him. I very much like true crime books, but this one is king of all that have been written and Ann Rule is the queen of her genre. Just beware before you read it. You will never be the same."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me (Signet)","review":"Ann Rule has masterfully written about Ted Bundy, her friend who also lays claim to being one of the worst serial killers in history.She elaborates on her background in law enforcement as a former police officer with family in law enforcement. Another aspect that sets her apart from most true crime authors is her training in crime scene investigations and her participation in crime expert seminars.In a strange twist of irony the author had signed a contract to write a book about the murders with no hint that the killer was someone that she knew.\\"The Stranger Beside Me\\" shows the contrasts in Ted Bundy- a very intelligent, politically connected seemingly charming man with a bright future and caring personality. Beneath all of that was a master conman and brutal murder fixated on a still unknown number of victims that fit a specific physical appearance. He was manipulative, thrived on media attention, and ultimately seemed to fear the end result that he meted out to his victims: death. He sure tried everything he could to avoid or postpone the death sentence he earned.What makes this book a true crime classic is the personal connection and insight that Ann Rule had with Ted Bundy. She tells the story not just as a writer, but an author that knew members of both sides of the investigation; the killer and many of the law enforcement members that worked the cases. An excellent book!"},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me (Signet)","review":"I would guess that this book is the best known and most read/popular book on Ted Bundy.Ann Rule was certainly in a unique position to write it. And she did a fantastic job doing it.Nobody can say that Ms. Rule isn't a talented writer or that this book isn't fascinating, gripping reading.I'm fascinated by Ted . I think I always will be. No other serial killer has ever held my interest and attention like he has.And I know that that thousands of others feel the same way.I normally read fast but it took me over a week to finish this because I could only take so much of the subject matter at once.I just finished it a few hours ago and I feel deeply shaky and emotional right now.I feel horror,disbelief,and extreme sadness for everyone involved here, but especially for both Ted and his victims.The whole thing is a complete, utter tragedy from start to end.How sad that so many young women were taken in the very prime of life,and how sad that Ted , a man with so much potential , was driven by an uncontrollable, compulsive mental sickness to kill them.Its also wrenching that so many of the girls were never found and were never able to have a final resting place other than wherever they were dumped at.I like almost everyone who has ever heard about these killings wish that it had never happened and that both Ted and the victims were still out there alive, living happy anonymous lives.As much as I like the book, there are a few things I'd like to mention:On the night before Ted's execution,Ann bitterly thinks to herself that she doesn't owe Ted anything. I have to disagree.I'd say that Ann owes Ted a great deal when it comes down to it.As much as I know that Ann was grieved and sickened by these murders and the fact that they were done by someone she considered a friend and as much as I know that she'd give everything up to have had none of it ever happen, the fact is that this book made her career.Ann was always a talented crime writer, but the fact that she knew Ted Bundy and has such a fascinating ,insider track in which to write a book about him with, made her career.It plucked her out of obscurity to become a hugely popular and successful true crime writer.Without Ted Bundy, I doubt that she would have achieved this level of success.I disgree with Ann's support of the death penalty, but I give her credit for not celebrating the execution and condeming the revelers outside the prison who did.Finally, its very hard to get a grip on how Ann actually feels about Ted now.The events in this book stretched for almost 30 years total(longer now,but 2000 was the last update},so of course her feelings changed over time.Even in later years though, her feelings seem to waffle.Sometimes she seems to almost hate him and says that she had kept hoping for a long time that the interest in Ted would die down, so she'd never have to think about him again.At other times, even though she denounces him as a psychopath who had no conscience and could have never been cured, sometimes she seems to retain some tenderness for him.Maybe she herself is still conflicted deep down about her feelings.In closing, Mrs.Rule does an excellent job in bringing to life many of the young women who were Ted's victims.I found many things out about them and their lives that I didn't know.Its always nice to see a portrait painted of someone instead of them just being a name and number on a victims list."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me (Signet)","review":"In all the years since the murders by Bundy and his subsequent execution, I never read this book until now. The mind is a very mysterious organ. How is a murderer like Bundy created? Is it in his genes?At this time in Phoenix, AZ we have been experiencing the deeds of two sets of serial killers. Fortunately one pair of murderers have been apprehended. Of course we don't know the whole story behind them but it seems their life experiences are rather average. So what creates the murderer?I enjoyed (maybe wrong word) reading \\"The Stranger Beside Me\\" but it's still beyond my comprehension how someone can so compartmentalize their life.The last addendum was also interesting in that Ms. Rule is still receiving stories from \\"almost\\" victim of Bundy. We'll never know how many there truly were."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me (Signet)","review":"As a fiction, the story would seem a bit far-fetched, so possibly the most amazing thing about it all, is that every word of this is truth. The author's angle on the case, having been a close friend of the seemingly benevolent Bundy, tremendously enhances the book. Bundy's unspeakable acts are chilling enough in themselves, but his dual-nature, expertly portrayed by Mrs. Rule, is equally as eerie. Mrs. is extremely objective in her portrait of Bundy and manages to capture both sides of his personality, the facade and the real man (and the places where the line between these two sides seems to blur). Mrs. Rule's masterpiece unquestionably ranks, along with such extraordinary works as the incomparable and never to be topped In Cold Blood and the recent masterpiece Devil in the White City, within the top 10 true crime books ever written."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me (Signet)","review":"i read this a long time ago and loved it then. its kind of crazy that this author was friends with the person killing all those young girls and not Ann Rule not knowing it until much later when she does turn in his name to the police yet feeling guilty doing it because she just cannot believe he might be the serial killer. Ted Bundy fooled a lot of people for a long time. good book and i strongly suggest you read it."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me (Signet)","review":"This is a well written account of Rule's relationship with Ted, as well as intertwining the details of the police investigations that were going on involving Ted and his crimes.

Anything from her pen is always well-written and a great read."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me (Signet)","review":"The author couldn't have put it better when she wrote that it wouldn't even be believable in TV or movie fiction that the person contracted to write about the disappearance of all the women would turn out to be good friends with the killer responsible. Because of this unique insight that Ms. Rule had it adds a deeper dimension to her work. She is very articulate and well written to begin with, but the personal touch her story brings really draws you in. You feel like you are getting to know Ted right along with her and almost want to believe he wasn't the killer just like she initially believed and wanted to believe. I have never read a true crime novel before and only read this because of a book club that I belong to.

(I've got a list of 20.)I started with this one because it is a personal story of what it is like to befriend a serial killer and extreme psychopath. In general, psychopaths are attractive to members of the opposite sex, but members of the same gender can tell that there's something off about them. Ann Rule's reaction to Ted Bundy is typical and thus a warning for all of us. Rule felt that Ted Bundy was one of the nicest, sweetest men she'd ever known. When they were through with their late-night volunteer shift at the crisis center, he walked her to her car because there are bad people out there. (Eek!) Bundy modeled the perfect gentlemen. Rule bought his act. I'm not condemning her, far from it. That's what most of us would do. That's one of the most important lessons in this book. Sometimes, the most perfect gentleman is also the most perfect monster.Rule's 20 year update of this book is fascinating. Her reactions, still, to the sweet, gentle Ted that she knew are unreconciled with the monster than dwelled within him. Psychopaths, whether they become serial killers or not, damage the people around them for a long time. (All serial killers are psychopaths, but very few psychopaths are serial killers.)While Rule's descriptions of Bundy's crimes are dispassionate and clinical, not sensational, I admit that I skimmed over them. I have too many nightmares as it is. Those chapters will give you more.Again, the most fascinating chapters in this book are of Rule's reactions to Bundy and her lasting friendship with him even after she was intellectually convinced that he must have committed those horrific crimes. Her analysis of herself and her own motives is every bit as fascinating as anything she writes directly about Bundy.Who's the nicest person you know, the very last one who you would suspect of being a psychopath who kills at night?TK KenyonAuthor ofRabid: A NovelandCallous: A Novel"},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me (Signet)","review":"This is a non-sensational, detailed and well-documented account of Ted Bundy's killing career. What makes it all the more gripping is the fact that not only did the author know Bundy but was his close friend. But, there was a side to him that she never knew. It was obviously a traumatic experience for her from which she still hasn't recovered.What makes Bundy alternately fascinating and chilling is the fact that he had absolutely nothing to gain from his murders. They were committed, apparently, for the sheer pleasure Bundy got from killing. The killings were the ultimate compulsion. Rule documents this quite well. What she fails to do is provide an understanding of Bundy, of what \\"made him tick.\\" This is not to fault her; I don't think anyone could. She provides considerable detail about some childhood traumas that Bundy suffered, such as believing for a long time that his mother was his sister, but ultimately these details don't explain anything. Many people have suffered from far worse traumas, childhood and otherwise, than Bundy, but hey didn't go on to become serial killers. So this is something we probably will never know.Ann Rule has since gone on to a brilliant writing career, but this is the book that got it all started. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me (Signet)","review":"This was the first book I read by Ann Rule; I was hooked, not only on the book but the author's style. I finished it in 2 days, I couldn't put it down and couldn't wait to finish it. This is a must have for any true Ann Rule reader or collector.Cudos and my hat is off to her."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me (Signet)","review":"I was scared out of my mind but I couldn't put it down. Here was the story of a madman, a monster, a truly sick individual whose greatest accomplishment in life was to viciously hunt down, murder and defile beautiful women. He mercilessly took their young lives from us- who knows what they could have been. Most of them were college coeds, some were already working with disabled children, and we lost them to the sick perversions of this notorious serial murderer.As much as we'd like to concentrate on the victims of the crimes, though, and as much as we'd like to mourn as a society for these innocents, we are drawn in by Ann Rule into the fascinating world of the killer himself. He becomes the star of the story and the women he killed are incidental. Sure, Rule gives us tiny bits of information about the victims, but some are almost just barely mentioned, mere footnotes in the biography of a depraved man.Ann Rule admits this as one of the sad results of what Bundy did. He stole their specialness, she says, by making them all blend together as mere \\"Bundy victims\\".I have only begun to read True Crime and my first books were by FBI profiler John Douglas. In his books, Douglas details the inner workings of sociopaths like Bundy, assuring us they are not \\"crazy\\" in the sense of having \\"no choice\\" about their forays into evil. They do it because that is what they love to do. An artist loves to paint and men like Bundy live to kill. (Bundy, however, is dead now- thanks to 2,000 volts from \\"Old Sparky\\", Florida's electric chair. He was sentenced to die in 1978 but managed to live, thanks to countless appeals, until 1989.)I read John Douglas's book \\"Journey Into Darkness\\" last year and I had no desire to pick up a book about Ted Bundy like I was some kind of Bundy groupie (of which there were several, disgustingly enough). But the angle of this book is that Ann Rule knew the man before he was ever a prime suspect in the grisly murders of several young women. Having no idea who she was working next to late at night, Ann was actually moved to believe Bundy would be \\"perfect\\" for one of her own daughters to date, were they older. Instead of being the perfect gentleman Rule thought he was, Bundy was a man with no conscience. He felt no remorse for what he did and indeed, he denied it until the end. For what were probably selfish reasons (he was a master manipulator), he confessed right before his death on January 24, 1989. (Eerily, I bought the book on January 24, 2004, exactly fifteen years after society was assured Bundy would never kill again.) But don't think Ann was a nave, eaisly conned woman. She was actually a cop in the 1950s and she was no dummy. What we have here is a man who is able to become whoever he needs to be in order to lure women to his trap- in this case a VW bug where he handcuffed them after bashing their head with a crow bar.What Rule fails to mention in her book, written in 1980 then updated twenty years later in 2000, is that Bundy kept his victims alive as long as possible to torture them. He was a sexual sadist and a coward whose last victim was only twelve years old and plucked from her middle school yard. I learned this from John Douglas. He has no sympathy for men like Bundy and perhaps Rule doesn't have sympathy for every last killer but Bundy was, after all, her friend and she perhaps felt it necessary to humanize him for the readers so we would understand."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me (Signet)","review":"This isn't a book to read if you're just looking for a lot of gory details about what Bundy did to his victims. There is very little discussion about his necrophilic activities, his obsession with dead bodies, etc. This is, however, the book to read if you want an accurate, well-rounded portrayal of Bundy as a person and as a killer.Like another reviewer already stated, this book was fascinating on several levels. Just as interesting as the Bundy case is watching how Ann Rule herself changed over time. She went from steadfastly believing in her dear friend (as most people would if they were truly friends), to seesawing back and forth, to throwing up when she realized he was guilty after the Miami trial. Her account in this edition of what she felt like when he was executed (the original book was released prior to Bundy's execution) was thought provoking to say the least. She admittedly wouldn't have stopped his execution even if she could, but her grief over losing a man she cared about was also very evident and is just one instance of how multi-dimensional this book is.Also as another reviewer pointed out, I appreciated getting to know the victims as more than statistics. For all the books that come out, not just about Bundy but about killers in general, the victims the authors claim to care so much about are brushed over and given about as much thought in death as their killers gave them in life. This is not the case with The Stranger Beside Me. This is a well-rounded, multi-dimensional book that you won't be able to put down."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me (Signet)","review":"Ann Rule was just beginning her writing career when she met Ted Bundy, with whom she volunteered nights at a crisis hotline. Ted was ambitious, gentle, and sweet. Little did she know that he was the same &quot;Ted&quot; that she was helping to track cross-country, the &quot;Ted&quot; who killed young girls.Ann Rule is the consummate true-crime author, and this is her most personal, and shocking, book."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me (Signet)","review":"My husband is currently reading this book and I can't wait for him to finish so I can read it again. I read this book a couple of years ago and I just couldn't put it down. It's a very shocking story and it's brilliantly told by the author. She builds up the suspense and like her you get to the truth in the end. Some people may not like this but sometimes I felt kind of sorry for Ted Bundy, he was such a brilliant, good looking an intelligent man, and it's really a pity that he threw away his potential by committing all those crimes. Why he did it? Was he insane? I personally think that he was some kind of schizophrenic who had some parts of him he couldn't deal with. But the truth no one will ever know why he did it...."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me (Signet)","review":"This was the second book of Ann Rule's that I read, the first being one with three different stories, &quot;A Rose for Her Grave&quot;. After reading one, I was hooked to her works, and very much hooked to this book. I'm only 21, and therefore didn't realize how much damage Ted Bundy did in the states, and just how many states he murdered in. I loved reading everything that went on and where. It was amazing to me that this woman, Ann Rule, knew Ted Bundy before anything was going on. It's always good and different to get the perspective from such a great writer, who also happens to be friends with the subject of the book. I must admit, towards the end when the updates were written, I got a little bored with the book. The story was now complete, and then it kept going on. I did read the updates, because I never remembered Ted Bundy, just the stories. So having a 2000 update was a bit helpful.I would say, a must read, even if you know all about Ted Bundy, but especially if you don't, like me."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me (Signet)","review":"A very revealing and in-depth look into the life history and criminal habits of Ted Bundy. Ann Rule's take on the situation is made even more interesting by her personal acquaintance with Bundy. In addition, she is able to beautifully convey her watching the events of Bundy's brutal crimes and subsequent trials unfold before her eyes with a fascinating juxtaposition of disbelief, horror and compassion for a man she once considered to be a friend. Definitely a great book for anyone interested in true crime."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me (Signet)","review":"Ms. Rule's storytelling skills weave a chilling blanket around the reader enveloping them into the bizzare twisted life of Theodore Robert Bundy.If you think you know all about the infamous &quot;Ted Murders&quot; and about Ted Bundy himself, you probably don't. Ann Rule worked side by side with a seemingly &quot;normal&quot; Ted Bundy only to realize later on the monster he really was.Pick up this book, and any of Ann Rule's/Andy Stack's other books. You will NOT be sorry!"},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me (Signet)","review":"Before reading this book, I hadn't really thought of Ted Bundy as anything more than a monster, a diabolical murderer of innocent girls. But Ann Rule made me see him as a real person, just like you and me -- one whom I might have liked (though, admittedly, my hair is short and parted on the side)."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me (Signet)","review":"In 1971, struggling writer Ann Rule worked the late shift at Seattle's Crisis Clinic, making the acquaintance of a young man named Ted Bundy. Little did she know that her friend Ted was behind all the disappearances of all the missing girls that she was writing about. Soon it became obvious that her beloved friend was a serial killer. The story covers Ted's years at large as well as the author's personal reservations and feelings regarding her friend. An insider's story of a truly horrific murderer and his many victims."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me (Signet)","review":"I had read other books by Ann Rule (she's great), and other books about Bundy (I'm a true crime reader). I saw this book mentioned on the back of the book cover, for one of her other books. When I saw that she had actually known Ted, at the time he was loose in Washington, I had to read it. I couldn't put it down, because it is not only very well written, but how often can you get this perpective on a monster?? There are facts, and insights here you'll get nowhere else. I think I finished this book in about eight hours, straight through!"},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me (Signet)","review":"I was terrified when I read this book, but I couldn't put it down. I lived in Seattle at the time, and was totally creeped out when I drove by some of Bundy's old haunts. When I finished this book I called my Mom and told her to tell my sisters to never trust a man unless he had ten references. This book scared me so much that I swore that I would only read positive life affirming books from then on. Of course I never did stop reading true crime or thrillers, but none of them have seemed as horrible as The Stranger Beside Me. It's a great book, read it if you dare."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me (Signet)","review":"&quot;The Stranger Beside Me&quot; is a story that I believe does not merit a lengthy review.

Ann Rule keeps readers on the edge of their seats even when they know the eventual outcome for Bundy, a given for someone like myself from Washington State. Ann was an acquaintance of Bundys and this makes her treatment of this sadistic fiend even more authentic, more personal, than the characters in some of her other books. The difference between this book, and in fact all of Ann Rule's books, and a mystery novel is the gaps. One is always left wondering, what happened here? Wouldn't knowing this make the story more coherent, weave it a bit more tightly? Sure, but real live mysteries are far different from fiction. More fascinating. Ann can't contrive a character and plot, she can only follow the evidence, as much as is available. This she does in a masterful manner, conducting hundreds perhaps thousands of interviews and wading through voluminous court records, newspaper accounts, and whatever else is available. How she does this year after year, producing riveting volume after riveting volume is the greatest mystery of all. If you have never read Ann Rule this book on Ted Bundy is the place to start."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me (Signet)","review":"Fascinating and extremely quick read of the story of serial killer Ted Bundy, written from the point of view of a \\"crime writer\\" who coincidentally was at one time friends with the killer. This author disturbs me nearly as much as Ted Bundy though! She is at best the most naive crime writer ever born, or at worst a knowing witness of a serial killer's career from beginning to end, possibly simply to further a dying writing career. For someone so sure of her clever criminal mind, the author fails again and again to put 2 and 2 together, at least according to the yarn she tells you in the book. Here's some examples:-when the Washington murders first start taking place, the only thing known about the suspect is a brief physical description, that he goes by \\"Ted\\" and that he may drive a Volkswagen. The author's old co-worker (Ted Bundy), matches the physical description, lived blocks from the missing girls, and after a quick check by the author, drives a Volkswagen. Author's conclusion: coincidence, not worth following up on.-Author's old co-worker Ted leaves Washington to go to law school in Utah; murders stop in Washington. Similar murders that the author reads about begin in Utah. Author's conclusion: coincidence, not worth following up on.-Later on, Ted is finally at least a serious suspect. He is arrested and convicted on kidnapping charges (but not murder) in Utah; author's conclusion: that can't be Ted, they got the wrong guy. Author starts sending Ted money on a regular basis!!!-Ted escapes from jail and disappears. Author's mom mails clippings of grizzly mass-murders in Florida shortly thereafter, at a time when authorities had not yet linked them to the escaped prisoner Ted. She attaches a note saying \\"It sounds like the 'Ted' murders. I wonder...\\". Author's conclusion: coincidence, not worth following up on.Maybe I'm way off here, but any dope should have put it all together by then. Of course maybe that just explains why the author WRITES about crime instead of SOLVES crime.Also beware of the last 50 pages or so. Extremely slow going, and also full of the author's sympathies for one of the most brutal killers to ever walk the earth. Pretty sad really."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me (Signet)","review":"I have read all the full-length books by Ann Rule and some of the short story collections. \\"The Stranger Beside Me\\" was one of her first and, yet, the last one I have read. I couldn't believe the effect it had on me. I cried for Ted Bundy, I cried for Ann. Incredible story. The fact that Ann worked beside Ted and was his friend, makes it even more amazing.Anything written by Ann Rule is hard to put down. She describes the characters so well.Fabulous author!"},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me (Signet)","review":"I did not enjoy this book - I felt that Ms. Rule WAS in love with Ted Bundy and the fact that he wanted everyone but her, scorned her in the end. She &quot;had&quot; a poor writing style there are extreme inconsistancies in her grammar - and she rambled for pages and pages about uninteresting topics and people related to law enforcement. I did not find her book insightful at all and do not recommend it."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me (Signet)","review":"too much about ted bundy, not enough about the victims. countless books have been written about this bundy parasite and nothing written about the victims except their death. ann seems to be honering bundy for some stupid reason. she almost tries to make excuses for him"},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me (Signet)","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed &quot;The Stranger Beside Me.&quot; However, before I began reading, I was expecting something totally different. I was expecting a story of about someone and their crimes, etc. - what a normal true crime story usually goes through. What I wasn't expecting was the inner torment of the author on whether or not she should believe her friend.I can understand that Ann Rule was friends with Ted Bundy and that caused torment for as she hunted for the &quot;Ted&quot; murderer and wrote her book, but this book about SOMEONE ELSE was written in the first person - and not from Ted's point of view. It's all about her thoughts and feelings as things are happening in the Ted case and what she's going through.The book was insightful because she actually knew Ted as a person - sociopath that he was. She felt that she could trust him and share with him. I do understand that would put anyone in an uncomfortable position when you find out someone is a serial killer and, yes, it should be mentioned in said book about this serial killer you are writing about. However, it should not be the basis of the entire book.Read it for the information on Ted, but try to ignore the fact that the book is more about Rule than him."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me (Signet)","review":"With her meglomaniacal need to insert herself for profit into personal tragedy, A. Rule had the audacity to re-release this thing with a new preface. It should be retitled \\"A Folly of Two\\" or \\"Shared Chilled Chablis\\" anyone? Or is that \\"Killed Hablis\\"...Ms. Rule produces letters they exhanged, this from Ted to Ann (emphasis mine):I send you this kiss,DELIVER THIS BODY to hold,I sleep with you tonight,with words of love untold,I would love you if I might,with WORDS THAT UNFOLD,these arms to PRESS YOU TIGHT.The banality of their exchanges produces the horror of this narrative - certainly NOT the quality of Ms. Rule's writing. If she'd gushed the adjectives brilliant, handsome, and tall anymore times somebody should've atleast thrown a thesaurus at her. At the same time, Rule's descriptions of the victims is lacking in depth that borders on coldness and jealosy.And what's up that Bundy kills girls in a Chi Omega sorority house which just happens to be Ms. Rule's pledge? She comments on their \\"intertwined fates\\" like it's all some romantically twisted coincidence. GAG.Anyway, chapter 22, pg. 231 paperback, suggests a powerful incentive to a sociopath. $$$!. In that chapter Ms. Rule details the book \\"deal\\" she'd made with Bundy sometime after they worked together at the \\"help\\" line (where vulnerable females commonly called in) that specified more $ to him for each additional chapter he wrote. Translate chapter into victim - a common format for true crime books - and you get a chilling picture. Ms. Rule was working for pulp true detective magazines (not working for the FBI as her early PR said) at that time and trying to get more money because her husband was dying.OK, this isn't just a trash Ann Rule review. The writing is mediocre and trite, as with all her books. The horror of Ted Bundy's swath through the seventies and her proximity to the case(s) is what makes the book interesting in a vicarious way, but even more interesting is looking for clues of their bizarre relationship. I'd love to get a hold of the classified sections of Washington newspapers from that period of his incarceration, and even before. Both of their oft repeated phrase \\"chilled chablis\\" takes on new meaning if one changes the first letters. Homo hablis is a branch of early man, habilis meaning something like \\"tool user\\" - like a club. There are plenty of double entendres and other word \\"games\\" to keep the amateur sleuthe busy trying to unravel Ms. Rule's psyche."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me (Signet)","review":"Ann Rule got lucky with this one in that she just happened to be associated with Ted Bundy when they worked together at a crisis clinic. If not for Bundy, Ann Rule would have gone nowhere as a writer. She has no sense of imagination or pace, and her books are always BORING! If you want to read a really great true crime author, read anything by Jack Olsen, may he rest in peace."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me (Signet)","review":"This was my second Ann Rule book and it will not be my last!

The whole idea of tracking a serial killer and the killer ending up being your best friend is just an unbelievable plot.

I started out thinking it should be better, since she actually knew Ted Bundy, but I actually didn't like that aspect much. I think this is because I felt like the entire book had a underlying feeling of sympathy for Bundy that I found very distracting.

This makes the story all the more compelling and freaky. The man personifies true evil, and Rule does a remarkable job telling the story.At the end, the best explanation is that the SOB may have had a head injury that caused the wiring in his head to go bad.

I read it, Ann Rule is good, the story is definetely \\"story worthy\\", it's just very very disturbing and it affected me for a long time after I finished it. I related to these young women. I have long dark hair. The thought that I could have been one of Ted's victims if I had had the horribly unfortunate bad luck to live at that time and come across a maniac terrified me! I was so upset after reading about this monster's callous disrespect for human life that I couldn't sleep normally for about a month.On the other hand, I couldn't really grasp how Ms. Rule could write about her relationship with the killer in an almost normal way. Ted Bundy was dead when I read the book but I was still scared of him. That Ms. Rule could continue to correspond with the man, to actually touch paper that had been touched by a man who commited such atrocities is not something I was able to accept. Maybe she has some coping mechanism that I can't grasp. But I couldn't help but feel a little bit of dislike for the author. She just didn't seem that scared that a homicidal maniac who was proficient at jail-breaks was corresponding with her. I probably would have had a breakdown.Again, no complaints about the writing or the accuracy, but spare yourselves the anguish. The news is full of it already."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me (Signet)","review":"For the first several chapters, I struggled through this book. The writing really put me off; even to the point where I almost put it down. It seemed like it was a good book by an untalented writer, if that makes sense. I stuck with it, however, and was soon very glad I did.The book is surprisingly unbiased; Ann balances emotion and fact very, very well. I've read many true crime books, and most of them are either overly-sensational or insulting to the reader's intelligence. This book is neither.This book is the complete story of Ted Bundy that no other author could have written. Knowing Ted gave her the insight to write the book with compassion and empathy. It is the most touching true crime book I've ever read. In fact, it really doesn't belong in the tired genre of &quot;true crime&quot;. It's right up there with Capote's &quot;In Cold Blood&quot;, as far as I'm concerned. Highly, highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me (Signet)","review":"I am Ann Rules' most devoted fan. She can do no wrong. Her word is gospel. I have everything she's ever written.

Love you!"},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me (Signet)","review":"Why Ann Rule spends the majority of her book giving the Beast from Hell the benefit of the doubt, I'm still trying to figure out. I'm sure she's not another hopelessly devoted Bundy Groupie. Maybe she's just being politically correct. Perhaps he's like one of her own sons. Whatever her reason, she gives new meaning to the concept \\"loyal friend\\".Satanic minds like Ted Bundy's are masters of deception and they know their enemies and \\"friends\\" better than these naive people know themselves. Their reason for living is to draw nourishment from other people - mostly women - dead or alive. And use it to satisfy their own evil appetites. And they're good at it. Rarely are they without a steady supply of clueless women to spoon feed them with affection and forgiveness.But when sharp-eyed, perceptive pros (like seasoned law enforcement officials) catch these Bundy types off guard, their cool-guy masks fall off and they lose it. That's when they scramble to summon a gullible woman, eager to run their errands and send cash donations.Ann's Bundy story is supported with provable facts and she tells it well. In the end, she can no longer deny that he's a criminal of the lowest order, but I wonder - does that old nagging doubt about his guilt still creep in when she's looking somewhere else?Well, at least the book had a happy ending."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me (Signet)","review":"A Stranger Beside MeI read Ann Rule's version of Ted Bundy and his life of sadistic murder. She is a good authur but with this peticular book, she threw so much of her life into it as much as she did his. The story kept going back and forth from present to past and back again. I realize that she knew him but the story was to be of him, not her. I found an error in which she discribes his daughter being four and a half when they first thought he would be executed, but in truth she was three months short of being four. Previously the author has mentioned that she was born in late October of 1982, The execution that she is mentioned in is inJuly of 1986. It's not that it's dreadfullly important but it bothered me that if she got those dates mixed up, were there more. Other than these points I would have to say that the book held my interest and like another viewer, it has caused me to lose sleep and be startled easier since finishing the book. I am reading more of her books that I have ordered to see how they compare."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me (Signet)","review":"As having an interest in true crime novels, I thought that this woull provide an insite not often seen of serial killers - the viewpoint of someone who knew the killer.This book seemed to drag on and on of how the author could not believe that the Ted she knew would do the thing he had been accused of. Even his escapes from jail were given reasons for being normal.While it was a well written book, there was just too much sympathy for the accused, making it a rather biased book.It was worth reading, but don't look to this book to give any insight into why the accused acted in the manner he did."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me (Signet)","review":"The author's relationship with Bundy makes the book riveting; it's also its great shortcoming, as we are introduced to Bundy the charming scoundrel, rather than Bundy the monster. Ann Rule states that she would have gone for Bundy herself if she had been younger, or chosen him for her daughter if she had been older. Rule waxes eloquent about Bundy's attributes; he is brilliant, charming, handsome, dazzling, a prince among men, a star in the Republican firmament. Could such a beautiful man be all that bad, really? She was enthralled by him, and it certainly shows. It's a sad fact that we are seduced by outward appearances and charisma, rather than discerning the true character inside. Bundy was foul to the marrow, but he had a smile to die for. And many women did just that."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me (Signet)","review":"Ted Bundy I was in a relationship with someone who had the same kind of dual Personality.Thank God I got away in time."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me (Signet)","review":"So I am a bit of an alarmist, but honestly, Ann Rule's account of her friendship with Ted Bundy is riveting.

This one stands the test of time!"},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me (Signet)","review":"How many times have you heard people watching the news when a killer similar to Bundy and Dahmer make comments like, \\"How could anyone be friends with THAT?\\" For years I wondered this myself until picking up Ann Rule's book, The Stranger Beside Me.Imperative to the story, which some people are complaining about, is Rule's own reactions to a man she never dreamed capable of committing the heinous crimes he proved to be more than guilty of in the end. She gave an account in the beginning of knowing an unsure, intelligent, bright young man whom she'd spent hours with working a suicide prevention hotline (yes, I find that baffling as well), having gotten to know and respect him well. He was not, as some people pointed out, insane, but a man who was intelligent beyond most people's grasp, and that is probably what made him more frightening than anything else. For all those people who don't understand, I empathized for years until reading this account. Given her portrait of the young college student she'd first met, I could see how a relative or friend doesn't want to believe the worst about somebody they have been so close to, yet most people don't get it because they have never, and probably never will, know a notorious sociopath who is clever enough to compartmentalize his life to the degree that Bundy did. In fact, I still find it amazing that Rule was capable of corresponding with him long after realizing that he was guilty. The individual human mind is capable of conjuring up coping mechanisms in ways science and society may never figure out, and Rule probably had to keep corresponding with him in order not to break. It is obvious from her writing the years of strain she has gone through. How did she know that, later being contracted to write about the elusive killer named Ted, that it would turn out to be her dear friend? You have to walk a mile in her shoes before judging her, and it's not an enviable position.I'm pleased that she gave the victims a tangible quality in their lives, so as to preserve the lives of their spirits in some way. After all, as she had stated, nobody really remembers their names except those close to them, and Ted is still a \\"star.\\"The story still bothers and scares me tremendously, makes me wonder if my neighbors have something to hide. After all, the Bundy monster is gone, but how many are out there free that have taken his place? I bet some of you have contemplated the same. One thing that is more terrifyingly certain is this: Bundy was NOT insane, he was evil, and that is more frightening than a madman. When he escaped to Florida, did he think the death penalty there would keep him from killing again, or was it a death wish? We may never know. Apparently, the lack of catering to his gargantuan male ego was what fueled him to kill again when he realized nobody recognized him in the Sunshine State. This was when I really began to hate him, and it would have been sooner if not for Rule's human portrayal. After his Florida rampage, they couldn't kill that selfish, conceited, egomaniacal sociopath fast enough. To me, if it's possible, the crimes seemed even worse than if they'd never caught him at all. Then again, would they have escalated anyway?Ann Rule's book both shows the chilling factors of a man who could seem so human, have everything going for him, yet be so emotionless as to let his violent fantasies turn him into a glimpse of hell. The only reason he confessed to so many crimes was to save his own life. The only reason he didn't confess to more was to save his own life. His tears were all for him, and in the end, none of his manipulation and tactics saved him. For this, and for the sake of his would-be victims, I am most grateful."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me (Signet)","review":"Even though \\"Stranger Beside Me\\" is a book about one of America's most notorious serial killers, it seemed overly long and inert--perhaps because it was written in the first person, and that person was Ann Rule. I put it down several times and had trouble picking it up again.The author had the perfect background for this story: she and Ted Bundy worked together as volunteers at the Seattle Crisis clinic in 1971; she was already a crime writer, and an ex-cop to boot; she was assigned to work on the case of the mysterious North-west killings long before Bundy was suspected of committing them. She also belonged to the same sorority (Chi Omega) where Bundy went on his next-to-the-last killing spree in Florida--the case that finally put him on death row.\\"Stranger Beside Me\\" has almost everything you might want to know about Theodore Bundy: his childhood; the shame he felt because he was illegitimate; his two escapes from prison; the murders he committed and those that he probably committed; the police who were involved in his case; the women who loved him; his court appearances; his confession; his death.However, the book also has a lot you might not want to know about the author: her bad dreams; her \\"extrasensory awareness of evil or danger\\" in various places connected with Bundy's murders; her feelings about his feelings; her on-again off-again loyalty to Bundy. There's a great deal of print taken up about how he was really tearing her up inside with all of his alleged wrong-doings, but I couldn't help wondering if the money she sent to him in prison played a role in his escape to Florida. I also couldn't help wondering if she stuck with him as long as she did (this is probably totally unfair) because of this book contract.Ann Rule does have a unique insight into the soul (if he had one) of a killer. This is definitely a one-of-a-kind true crime story. It's just that I feel it could have been tightened up and cut from 548 pages (the updated twentieth anniversary edition) down to around 350, or so by eliminating the author's personal psycho-dramas."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me (Signet)","review":"As a crime writer, Ann Rule was \\"in the right place at the right time\\" as far as Ted Bundy is concerned... That she can provide the facts along with personal, first-hand anecdotes regarding Bundy makes this book all the more mesmerizing... It is so eerie and macabre, that it is almost too bizarre to be a true story!!!For anyone interested in true crime, this is one that definitely should not be missed..."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me (Signet)","review":"I found this book highly stimulating, I was unable to put it down.Ann Rule's inside perspective brought a new light to the Ted Bundy story. The facts, the drama, the familiarity, all brought together makes this book extremely well written, easy to follow, and gripping to read! Great job Ann !!My boyfriend (who hates to read anything other than car magazines) gave it a read (to see what all my hype up of the book was about) and he finished it in about 5 days ! Now he's ready to read about the Green River killer. If a book can turn a non-reader into a reader, thats 5 stars in my book! And I am ready to read it again (I read it about 2 years ago)."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me (Signet)","review":"This book will keep you wondering until the end whether or not they got the right guy...I, like Ann Rule, did not want to believe that this man could commit these heinous crimes. That is why I believe that readers MUST read the 2000 version (Bundy was executed in 1989) as it includes some VERY important updates at the end of the book.A very well-written book. The reader can feel Ms. Rule's pain as she struggles with coming to terms that this seemingly incredible man is really a wolf in sheep's clothing."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me (Signet)","review":"The Stranger Beside Me, is told with infinite attention to detail and answers some of the questions that linger in our heads about the mysterious Ted Bundy, making this the most personal book about him. An unsettling, intensely personal inside look at one of the nation's most infamous serial killers, it gives an intriguing observation that will keep you spellbound as you hear much of Anne Rule's relationship with him. She recounts how she was an unsuspecting coworker (Seattle Crisis Center hotline operators) and a close friend whose suspicions multiply during his killing spree. He often sat beside her and shared thoughts, discussions and laughs with her. She is supportive and unsure of his guilt at first, but by the end she realizes he really is the wicked person committing these crimes. It's not surprising that Ms. Rule had no idea since he was one very clever individual. The adjectives to describe this book are too numerous to mention and once you read it, you will know why.Ted Bundy was many things: charming, witty, amiable, charismatic and polite. Most of all, however, he was a sociopath who killed with such rage and deliberation, this story will make you think twice about strangers who approach you in parking lots. I know he wasn't wired right, but I keep asking myself why? What REALLY made him tick? The account of Ted Bundy's killing spree at the sorority house gave me chills for awhile after reading it. He was, however, not the genius that some people make out to be: he couldn't finish law school and he chose to take his killing spree to Florida, of all places. The book also doesn't concentrate on his victims as statistics but gives them the respect and dignity they deserve in a culture that seems more fascinated with the killer than the victim."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me (Signet)","review":"Ann Rule's \\"The Stranger Beside Me\\" is probably the most frightening of all the accounts of Ted Bundy's murderous career. Why? Because Rule was a former policewoman, she considered Ted Bundy a co-worker and friend and never saw the sociopathic personality lurking behind his charming facade. As a society, I think we want to believe that we can easily spot those Bundys, Dahmers, Gacys . . . and Rule's book emphasizes the fact that we cannot. Those monsters blend in sometimes seamlessly with the rest of us.Rule's book does a huge service to Bundy's victims by recognizing them as more than just \\"Bundy victims\\". Reading about their dreams, their goals and their daily lives makes the horror of their deaths sting even more.Rule's sadness over the story comes through in nearly every page - - sadness at the loss of lives and sadness over what Bundy's life could have been and what he could have offered had he not been so consumed by murder. Having known Bundy before he became infamous as a serial killer, Rule gives insight into Bundy's personality and character, from his childhood, through his adolescence into his political and legal aspirations, all the while fostering a murderous rage toward women.An insightful book, one that makes you check and doublecheck your windows and doors and pray that you never cross the path of someone like Bundy.Definitely one of Rule's best books. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me (Signet)","review":"For years, I was hesitant to give this book a try based on the amount of books Ann Rule has written. She seemed too commercial and exploitive of a true crime writer for my palate. I was pleasantly surprise at how much I enjoyed \\"The Stranger Beside Me\\". The best part was that I only paid a quarter for the book at a used book fair.Ann Rule worked with Bundy as a volunteer on Crisis lines for a Seattle mental health clinic. Bundy seemed to be a normal caring person as he befriended Rule, which was before his crimes started. However, something inside of him snapped. Stephanie, the woman that broke his heart, seemed to send him into a spiral of violence that would not end. The cycle was only interrupted by his incarceration, before he escaped and continued to kill. Nearly every woman he killed beared some resemblance to Stephanie.Rule shows tremedous skill in her storytelling, making the book tough to put down. Her chronology of Bundy's life, includes his confusion toward the identity of his mother as he was born illegitimate. The details of the crimes leaves little to be desired, as Rule does an excellent job describing the scenes without being at the crime scenes.As the main editorial review provided by Amazon.com suggests, the updated versions do not add much to the book. So if you have an opportunity to save some money, buy an older copy. Based on my experience, I am looking forward to reading many of Ann Rule's other book. I would suggest true crime fans do the same."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me (Signet)","review":"The best true crime books (like IN COLD BLOOD) are less about the act itself and more about the lives and times of the victims. And the victims should never be forgotten, nor defined soley as those who lost their lives. This book expands the circle of victims to make the reader ache for everyone Bundy touched -- the dead girls themselves, the mothers and friends who must somehow accept the unacceptable, the dedicated but frustrated law enforcement officers who feel helpless to stop the carnage, even the officers of the court who must defend the indefensible ... Ann breathes life into them all.Then there's the havoc Bundy brought to his supporters. Ann, Meg, Stephanie, Sharon, his mother ... they all loved him, cried for him and fought for him until the evidence of his guilt became too overwhelming and repellent. And then these women had to live with the \\"what if's.\\" (What if I'd realized earlier that the \\"Ted killer\\" was my Ted? Could I have saved lives? Was there something I did that made him slaughter lovely, promising young women -- girls like me or my daughters?) He may not have strangled, maimed or wiped these women off the face of the earth, but he left them battered and bruised emotionally. It's one of the measures of what a monster he was that he didn't seem to notice, understand or care what his evil compulsion did to those who loved him. Ms. Rule makes their (and her own) plight so understandable, so human, that you feel you are walking in their shoes. By the end of the book, you count these women among Bundy's victims, too.Ms. Rule is not the writer Capote is -- there's no poetry here, and her prose never reaches the level of art you'll find on any page of IN COLD BLOOD. But her personal involvement and gift for observation make this book a classic of the genre, as well."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me (Signet)","review":"This is truly a remarkable work. Ann Rule has written both an in depth account of the Ted Bundy saga from an insiders point of view as well as her own remarkable story. Ann Rule and Ted Bundy worked together at a crisis center. The book is non-fiction that reads like a great novel. Rule follows Bundy with a history of his early childhood that gives insight to why he might have turned out like he did. The book also gives an account of how Bundy also viewed the world and how he tried to beat the death sentence. The reader is left an enigma of a highly intellignet and charming man who is also a psychopath. Rule also does a remarkable job of revealing to the reader how she originally believed Bundy to the conclusions that she was forced to realize that he was a murderer. I was left with the feeling that this book was painfull for her to write. Rule also tells a bit about her life and how she ended writing true crime. This book will leave you unsettled and you will not be able to put it down."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me (Signet)","review":"This is definately one of my favorite Ann Rule books so far. This book has a more personal touch than her other books because she actually knew him. I can't stress how great this book is, I'm on the last chapter right now and I had to force myself to put it down and do homework. Not only do you get to learn about Ted Bundy's murders but you also get to see him as a person. His background before he became known as a mass murderer is included. Ann Rule doesn't over indulge the reader in the gory details of the murders, but the effect of how horrid they were are still obvious. Like all of Ann's books the story doesn't end with the arrest of Ted Bundy, the court proceedings and events that ocured while Ted awaited execution on death row are also very interesting. Ann also shares letters she received from Ted Bundy over the years. Written from a friend to a friend. This is a great book that anyone with the slightest interest of fascination with serial killers should read"},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me (Signet)","review":"I was a fifteen-year-old girl in the South Seattle area during the \\"Terror of Ted\\".I ran with a crowd of other fourteen and fifteen year old girls who would freely hitchike around the Seattle area back then, usually in search of the next adventure ahead. Our travels took us way North, into Lynnwood, far east, into Issaquah and North Bend, and usually, into the U-District in Seattle.I remember being really afraid ... afraid to stick the old thumb out, even while in a gaggle of girls doing the same thing. I remember being really afraid whenever a VW slowed - we'd all squeal and wave the driver on. All this fear had been, of course, hammered into me by the news, by the schools, and by well-meaning family. But when you're young, you feel you truly are invincible, and that nothing can hurt you! And so, the group of us who hitched, were determined to not get into any car driven by a man named \\"Ted\\". We felt \\"safe\\" if we'd ask the driver his name. Foolish is what we really were.And of course, we all wore our hair long, straight and parted down the middle. It was the mid seventies. Every girl did!When the furor over \\"Ted\\", who'd by this time, moved on to Utah (and ultimately Florida) began to subside, the hitchiking lot of us finally wised up, and began to have our boyfriends drive us, or got our own drivers' licenses.This book re-lived for me the terror of those days, as a young girl, a frequent visitor to the U-District and Lake Sammamish Park off I-90 back then myself. I was never approached, nor were any of the girls I hung with, by the wavy-haired, good looking stranger with the eager smile.But with every brief introduction to yet another driver, another group of guys going nowhere in particular, I'll never forget the underlying fear that surrounded me. Those summers of Ted. Because we just never knew where or when he would appear next.Ann Rule captures this wonderfully in her 20th anniversary update."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me (Signet)","review":"I read this book cover to cover in three nights -- late nights, scary nights. Ann Rule keeps readers on the edge of their seats even when they know the eventual outcome for Bundy, a given for someone like myself from Washington State. Ann was an acquaintance of Bundys and this makes her treatment of this sadistic fiend even more authentic, more personal, than the characters in some of her other books. The difference between this book, and in fact all of Ann Rule's books, and a mystery novel is the gaps. One is always left wondering, what happened here? Wouldn't knowing this make the story more coherent, weave it a bit more tightly? Sure, but real live mysteries are far different from fiction. More fascinating. Ann can't contrive a character and plot, she can only follow the evidence, as much as is available. This she does in a masterful manner, conducting hundreds perhaps thousands of interviews and wading through voluminous court records, newspaper accounts, and whatever else is available. How she does this year after year, producing riveting volume after riveting volume is the greatest mystery of all. If you have never read Ann Rule this book on Ted Bundy is the place to start."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me (Signet)","review":"If you're a true crime aficionado then ths book is likely a must-read for you. As most people know by now, Ann Rule knew Bundy as a pleasant work colleague (at a suicide hotline, of all places) and friend before he was revealed to be a serial killer, and part of the book is devoted to her first-person interactions with him. The book helped propel Rule to fame as a true-crime writer. It's a well-detailed book and is free of a lot of the seeming hyperbole that characterizes some of Rule's other works - rather than constantly touting how \\"evil\\" Bundy is, Rule actually seems to downplay some of the awful aspects of his crimes. Because Rule shows that Bundy could act very pleasant and \\"normal\\" through her first-hand recountings, the book is especially chilling and sheds light on the behavior of psychopaths and how the killer got away with his crimes for so long, in a way that her other books do not. This is definitely one of Rule's more interesting and readable books, maybe in part because the Bundy story is more interesting, twisted and full of surprises than the average criminal's history."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me (Signet)","review":"This book is an excellent read as it shows Ted Bundy through a person who thought she knew him but in fact didn't..The pain she felt when she as a friend had to choose between being loyal to him and at the same time having to realise that he was a cold blooded monster..It's after reading this book that I realise Ted could have done so much better with his life..He destroyed others and in the end himself..He was in so much pain but instead of seeking help,he decided to inflict more pain on others..What a waste of life!!Ann did an excellent job in writing this book & I hope one day she'll realise that there was nothing she could have done to help her friend Ted as in the end he chose his own fate.."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me (Signet)","review":"My second Ann Rule book and I'm definitely a fan, I give this a strong recommendation to any that are interested in true crime and a small glimpse into an evil mind. The factors that lead to this book being what it is are beyond belief, if you can imagine for a moment being given a book contract on a current unsolved crime, missing women, and then finding out later that the culprit is a personal friend. What are the odds?Because of the personal interaction between Bundy and Rule, this book is something that no other writer could have written, personal accounts of time spent with the killer before he was caught, in fact, before he was even a suspect. Amazing.In any case, the book is a compelling read, and as I wrote in my other review, reading Rule is a bit like reading a good fictional novel, the story flows well, like a good piece of fiction, yet it is so interesting because it all really happened.I found some of the authors personal views and takes on the case intriguing, although I thought it was a bit ironic when she stated that she could see no benefit in executing Bundy, except for the fact that he wouldn't be able to kill again...Duh.While perhaps he was defanged, there are reasons to believe that if wasn't put to death by the state of Florida, he may very well have killed again. Perhaps not, however, taking away his opportunity was probably a good move. I do agree with the thought that perhaps leaving a killer alive, instead of administering the death penalty, could possibly help science, however if we leave this door open every killer is going to want to avoid capital punishment by claiming he'll work with shrinks. A can of worms to say the least.The story was definitely creepy, I wouldn't recommend it to young college aged coeds living in a sorority if they spook easily, it'll cause a few restless nights I'm sure, however for any interested in the subject of serial murder by a sexual deviant, this story of one of they worst killers in American history is a must read.A final note about the updated version, this update adds a bit (not a lot) but a bit of new interesting details, and is worth the read. Perhaps it would have been better to go back and rework some of the book with information that was added later, however it still works. Certainly Bundy was sick, but we find out in the update that he was even sicker than presented because a little more detail about his activities is added and alluded too. I'm not sure if adding this detail in an update, and with only bits of information, was the best course to take, however I'm going to assume Rule didn't want to dwell on some of what Bundy did, so she just hinted at it and gave only minor details.With the growing popularity of fictional crime shows on television and the like, I'm sure at some point we'll see a major motion picture of some aspect of this book, meaning a take on the Bundy murders with the twist of his friendship to Rule. Facinating."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me (Signet)","review":"This was my first Ann Rule book I have read. What an amazing writer! I really felt pulled just as she did. I can see how she would be impressed with the \\"Ted\\" she first met; but then again after the sorrowful incidents the audacity, shock, and horror Ann must have experienced, well, I can't even imagine what she went through as someone who actually knew him.This was a riveting, page turner that kept me hooked, and the thing that really kept me going was kind of a scary intensity that kept me reading till the very end even though I knew how it ended.I know people may think me odd (that isn't unusual), but I actually felt sorry for him...the life as he was growing up, the lies he had to live with that he was given from the day of his birth, the sorrow of love loss, and the evil that grabbed its hooks in him that kept him in its grip till the end of his life.Ms. Rule's style of writing and her words really made me feel what she felt. As I finished the book this evening, my heart actually hurt as her's did as she thought so much of the original \\"Ted\\" she first met. How tragic, yet amazing, the human psyche can be constructed even as a small child."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me (Signet)","review":"Bundy was an intelligent, good-looking, yet COLD-HEARTED, VICIOUS M U R D E R E R. I think that Bundy was a very evil and sick man - I don't believe at all that the fact that he was a &quot;bastard&quot; made him go out and kill young, beautiful women. Not that the author implied that, but I got the feeling that some people would use that as a &quot;motive&quot;. And to the girls who wrote love letters to him while he was in jail, &quot;You're stupid.&quot; Whoever believes in Bundy's innocence after reading this book (or knowing the facts and having seen the evidence) has got to be living in a different world. Too sad, though, that the disappearance of that little girl who lived on his street when he was a young boy has never been solved. Frankly, Bundy deserved to be executed - it's just too bad that so much money was spent on his defense and appeals before he was actually put to death."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me (Signet)","review":"This is the book which launched Ann Rule's career as the doyenne of true crime writing, and it is easy to see why. What started out as just another &quot;story&quot; for Ms Rule became a journey of horror, as she came to recognise the seductive, horrifically destructive side of a man she thought she knew well - Ted Bundy. Rule draws us into this tragic saga with incisive, careful writing and probing analysis into the crimes, mind and motivations of a sociopath. What makes this such a compelling book is not only the author's fabulous writing, but her heartfelt compassion for the many victims, both living and dead, and although he is undeserving of it, compassion for Bundy himself. In my opinion, the most haunting question that has arisen from this book is: &quot;How can we stop individuals from becoming the kind of sly, silent killer that Ted Bundy became?&quot;"},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me (Signet)","review":"This is a very unique book in that the author actually knew Ted Bundy and had worked beside him. She is a former police officer turned nonfiction crime writer, and her books are very well researched and detailed without sensationalizing the crimes. They include enough biographical information on the victims that you truly identify with them, and the book is hard to put down. I read this book years ago and it permanently changed my awareness of my surroundings. Before I read this book, I would have offered to help Ted without a second thought and could have easily become a victim at the wrong time and place.With that said, I almost gave this book 4 stars instead of 5, which would have been a mistake. After recently rereading this book after many years, two things about it bothered me:1. The author's friendship with Ted just keeps showing through. Understandable, but it became a little frustrating about two-thirds through the book. Of course, this perspective is one of the things that makes this book so fascinating, so maybe that one is totally unfair to her. She doesn't sugar coat his actions, but her feelings are evident throughout the book.2. His last known victim, 12 year old Kimberly Leach, doesn't receive nearly enough attention IMHO. Bundy received another death sentence for her kidnapping/rape/murder, but this case gets minimal coverage in the book. The thought crept in that maybe it received less attention because, if possible, it shows Bundy in an even more unfavorable light than the others. His other known victims were at least a few years older. In any case, I felt Kimberly's case deserved much more attention than it received. As her case actually went to trial, there would have been ample material available for research, in addition to the author's police connections. Perhaps she was too weary of it all, but this case seems almost to have been mentioned only as an afterthought.Nontheless, this book should be a must-read. It is absolutely fascinating and has undoubtedly saved lives. Serial killers are clever, often attractive people who are good at mimicking normalcy, and unless you (and your children) have at least some awareness of their methods, you might be easy prey.I have no doubt that this book was an emotionally difficult one for the author to write because of her friendship with the killer. My hat's off to her for doing a fantastic job. This edition has an additional update which is also very informative. The book really is 5 stars all the way. Read it and share it with someone you love."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me (Signet)","review":"This is partly my fault because I was wanting a book more about Ted Bundy but instead got a book about the author and her feelings about him which I could care less about. Also, she seems to regard her relationship with Ted Bundy much more highly than it actually looks like it was. She think somehow that if she had the chance to talk to Bundy before the trial that he would have confessed to her. Please. Who is she kidding? And sending him money and worrying about him all after she found out that he was THE PRIME SUSPECT in these murders/rape is really weird. She thinks that she's different from those other women who were in love with Ted Bundy but she's just one of them herself."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me (Signet)","review":"I did not read the original book but in a sense it worked well, because I found the latest edition to be highly interesting. In particular as a psychologist, the descriptions of Bundy's childhood were informative and applicable to my work with children having severe conduct disorders and the often accompanying narcissism. I can recommend this book to all persons, but especially to those professionals hoping to better understand the underlying pathology and causes for this personality."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me (Signet)","review":"There are hundreds, if not thousands, of books on various serial killers that terrorized America throughout the years, but none affected the country quite like Ted Bundy.He was the handsome, intelligent boy next door, working for the Crisis Clinic as work study during his undergraduate studies. She was a promising true crime writer volunteering some of her time as a way to possibly atone for the guilt she felt over her brother's suicide.During their late night shifts manning the phone bank, Ann Rule struck up an odd sort of friendship with the would-be serial killer - long before the world knew who Theodore Robert Bundy was. And, as he was thrust further and further into the headlines and the forefront of the nation's collective conscience, she struggled to reconcile her recollections of Bundy with the monster portrayed in the courts and news media.No case - and no killer - has haunted a person on the periphery of a media blitz as Ted Bundy has - and still does - haunt her to this day.This book allows the reader a very personal look inside the cases that held a nation in terror for almost two decades. Her friendship with Bundy gave her special access to looks at the inner workings of one of the U.S.'s most infamous killers.A must read for fans and the curious alike."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me (Signet)","review":"This is the definitive book on Ted Bundy. I've read multiple books on the case good and bad. Ann Rule having known Bundy there is of course a personal note there in. Not biased though in my opinion. Ann Rule as always does a wonderfuly through job of giving us backround of Teds' early life and happenings that can be pieced together, right through to the very end. It's the best account I've found in that it truly gives an insiders look at the man and at least the act he presented to her and those in the vicinity. I like that she gives us a complete account of the trial, thought processes, and all around happenings top to bottom. It truly is the definitive book on Ted Bundy and the horrible crimes he commited. Ann Rule is one of the foremost true crime writers of our time. She delivers on all fronts as usual. A must for true crime buffs."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me (Signet)","review":"A well-written, from the heart book with a perspective only the author could have. The addendums, written years after the first publication, provide good additional information and insight."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me (Signet)","review":"Ann Rule is the best true crime writer. She does not glorify or detail the crimes in a gory way. She always delivers the story with grace and compassion. This book is wonderfully written and the fact that she knew Ted is an extra bonus.

I highly recommend anything from Ann Rule."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me (Signet)","review":"good book, well written. i thought bugliosi's book helter skelter was written better, but i still enjoyed this--definitely creepy! i want to read more true crime by ann rule since reading this!"},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me (Signet)","review":"Ann and Ted were Crisis Hotline buddies. Ann was contracted to write a book about his case on the side without knowing he was the one responsible for the recent string of murders. The angle is amazing and has the effect of humanizing Ted, though there seems to be an impulse in view of future revelations, to cast him as being even more of a monster for the fact that he behaved like one a mere fraction of the time.Monstrous: The Autobiography of a Serial Killer but for the Grace of God"},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me (Signet)","review":"When you know the ending it is hard to write or read a book without being biased with the knowledge. This book weaves what was known and what was not at any given time so well that in your mind you keep trying to reconcile the two and for those moments you do not want to connect them to the end that is now so well known. The way she introduces Ted in the beginning and the way events unravel, you keep trying to juxtapose the known Ted Bundy and the mysterious and ruthless killer who left a trail of death in his wake, and like her, you simply cannot.What is also praiseworthy is that the author neither interrupts the flow with personal judgment nor does she glamorize the gore. It was mature and intelligent real-crime storytelling at its best.There are aspects of the relationship between the author and the main character that wants you to judge not Ted, but herself - did she lead Ted on so she could get a story out of it, all the time backing her actions with moral reasoning? In my opinion that is beyond the scope of this review and the five stars that I think the book deserves."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me (Signet)","review":"Being friends with and trusting a man who is actually a serial killer is very creepy. It is also sad to know that Ted Bundy took the lives of so many young woman who were just starting live on their own. I really enjoyed this book. I recommend it to anyone interested in true crime."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me (Signet)","review":"This is an excellent true crime book. It has an unusual twist in that the author and the subject of the book, serial killer Ted Bundy, had a platonic relationship that arose from the time they were co-workers for a Seattle, Washington crisis center. Quite frankly, the author initially had no idea that Ted Bundy was anything other than what he appeared to be: a handsome, intelligent, charismatic, and articulate young man, who was, at the time, involved in local politics and later became a law student.When he became the suspect in the disappearance and murders of a number of very young, pretty women, the author was in total disbelief. As the evidence mounted against her friend, the author, who is a former police officer, could not shut her eyes to the reality that Ted Bundy was actually a very disturbed individual who was guilty of all of which he was accused and probably guilty of other such crimes for which he was not accused for evidentiary reasons. Consequently, the author would suffer some angst for many years, as she struggled to reconcile the Ted Bundy that she thought she knew with the fiend who was compelled to commit so many vicious abductions, assaults, and murders. It is believed that at least thirty-five young women, and probably a good number more, died at the hands of Ted Bundy.The author details the abductions, assaults, and murders of his victims from coast to coast, which crimes were ultimately to make Ted Bundy a nationwide household name, and an entity to be feared. The investigative efforts of law enforcement officers in the states of Washington, Utah, Colorado, and Florida are revealed, as are Ted Bundy's arrests and his trials. She also details his two escapes from custody in Colorado, the last of which would find him heading to the sunshine state of Florida.Those who like the true crime genre will enjoy this well-written and well-researched book. It is highly detailed and contains a great deal of information, some of it quite personal due to the author's relationship with Ted Bundy. She paints a very intriguing, intimate portrait of him, one that is three dimensional and complex. He was definitely a man whose benign and compelling external visage was at odds with his many internal demons, as he was a prolific serial killer. Externally, Ted Bundy was the sort of man towards whom women gravitated, and there was no dearth of Ted Bundy groupies once he made headlines.All in all, aficionados of the true crime genre will find much of interest in this book."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me (Signet)","review":"I've read a few of Ann's books and really appreciated this one. She outlined the story of Ted Bundy well. She also related experiences she had with him on a personal level. Very interesting and educational about the story of the monster who was Ted Bundy."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me (Signet)","review":"Best Ann Rule book I've read so far. It was very interesting how one person can be two totally different people within the same body. The book made me so paranoid that I now bring pepperspray with me everywhere."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me (Signet)","review":"My favorite of all of Ann Rule's books to date...I've read every single book she's ever written. Ted Bundy was a handsome, charming serial killer. To think Ann actually knew him, and was fooled by his smooth ways. It is scary indeed to think this man fooled so many. Great read!"},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me (Signet)","review":"I don't want to give the story away, well anymore than you already know. The story took place in Washington, where I live. I found this book very interesting and it kept me in suspense. I never knew the real story...I was too young when this was happening and I found it very interesting to learn about Ted Bundy's life and the unfortunate victims."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me (Signet)","review":"High applause to Ann Rule! While struggling with her work andvolunteer hours at a Women's Crisis Hotline, she met a charmingyoung fellow--Ted Bundy the sociopathic murderer. Yet, Ann knewhim as an everyday Joe who sat beside her at the hotline center.She even rode with him in a car. She enjoyed conversations with this bright young man. And then she was knocked on her tail to find out about his secret horror. She met with him in prison andgathered the extra clues and details to make this outstanding, unparalleled novel. Highly recommended!!!"},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me (Signet)","review":"After reading this book, a presumably more personal account from a self-proclaimed friend of Ted Bundy, I think the author was manipulated and duped by this notorious killer. It's obvious that one of the traits of sociopath is the compulsion to write letters. For this is the only way to manipulate when they are locked up. We all heard countless stories about women being lured by inmates with letters and phone calls so they would be willingly sending money and care packages. Ted Bundy, just like the I-5 killer Randy Woodfield years later, was a compulsive letter-writer and phone caller. He used the letters and phone calls to manipulate many women at the same time so he could get what he wanted, be it money (Ms Rule probably spent over $600 on him, a big sum at that time), emotional support, or material goods. Based on this and countless times Ms Rule's \\"torn feelings\\", I can safely assume that she's one of the duped. During her correspondence with Ted Bundy, she was a woman about to divorce, had 4 young kids to support, meaning she's emotional weak and dependent at the time. Any woman with healthy emotional state of mind would not tolerate to be manipulated like this.Looking at the Washington State victims' photo, they could be sisters! I feel so sorry for the families who lost their beautiful daughters. If they were to live, they would be almost 50 by now. They could be someone's mothers, wives, and co-workers......... I cringe every time I think about the could-have-beens and would-have-beens for those beautiful girls.Another thing that struck me during the reading was how easy it is to break into a place. Ted Bundy must have farmed his target area to see which building's occupied by young women, which one was easy to get into, which screen was loose, and which lock was malfunctioned. The fact that a lot of his victims were hit in their dorm/home while sleeping was chilling. I have to double, triple check all my windows, doors, and locks to make sure they are secure. I think all women who live alone or with other women should do the same night after night before they can safely close their eyes to sleep.While I was looking at the few pictures of Ted Bundy, it struck me how much he looked like Greg Kinnear. Mr. Kinnear has the same handsome but changeable face. Mr. Kinnear also has the ability to play a normal guy with internal turmoil/evil type (watch The Gift). If there's ever a movie made about Ted Bundy, I think he's the perfect choice."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me (Signet)","review":"Imagine one of your co-workers who you are close to. Imagine spending hours with this person and discussing your lives with them. Then imagine some years later you discover that your friend is a serial killer. This happened to Ann Rule, the famous true-crime writer, in 1971 when she worked at Seattle's crisis clinic. One evening her boss told her that she had a new co-employee -- Ted Bundy. To Ann, he was an intelligent, kind and handsome 24-year-old. Little did she know, in 1974, Ted would become a viscous murderer, who killed at least 30 young women in four years.Ann Rule did an exceptional job on this book. She really focuses well on Ted's life, from his birth to being sentenced to death row. Also, she writes about each victim, staying away from the gruesome details of their death, but giving the reader a sense of their lives. If you're looking for a thorough and informative book about Ted Bundy, I strongly recommend \\"The Stranger Beside Me.\\" It's the best book I've read about him."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me (Signet)","review":"I'm always amazed that Ann Rule seems to be more often identified as the author of Small Sacrifices (also a good book) when I've always thought that The Stranger Beside Me was by far her best effort.Imagine that you have been closely following an investigation of a string of murders for several months: talking to the detectives involved, perhaps planning to write a book or magazine article. Then, you realize that someone you know, someone that you like and trust, is probably the murderer. That's the story of this book -- not the gruesome murders or the sick mind of Ted Bundy, but realizing that your friend is a serial killer.This book is a must-read for anyone interested in the true crime genre."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me (Signet)","review":"When I first picked up this book I did not think that I would become so wrapped up in it as I did. The whole time I was reading it I found it impossible to put down and have read it three times since.The most interesting part was not reading about Ted Bundy's crimes but reading about the waste of a potentially brilliant life. Not only the live's of Bundy's victims but of Bundy's"},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me (Signet)","review":"the story told in this book is inevitably linked with that of Rule herself. this book is probably so horrifying because, for the most part, we have no idea what happened to those girls who Bundy murdered; Rule manages to avoid the exploitative blood'n'guts, tell-all discriptions used by weaker writers. chilling, mainly because Bundy, as well as being a very smart individual, never revealed the whole number of his victims."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me (Signet)","review":"It took me awhile to read it, it's been appended a few times since its first publication in the early 80s, but it was a fascinating read. Something prevents me from giving it 5 stars though, and it's been awhile since I've read it so I can't be sure what it is. I just remember enjoying it in 4-star fashion."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me (Signet)","review":"I found this book too scary to read right before I went to bed, had to read it during the day. Ann Rule makes it more than just a true story about a serial killer, but having known Ted Bundy personally really is something!!! I was the same age, back in the 70's as the women he murdered. I was single with dark hair parted down the middle and I lived alone."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me (Signet)","review":"Again Ann Rule keeps you glued to the book from beginning to end. Just the facts and the insight of knowing a serial killer but not knowing he's a serial killer also makes for a different angle. Once again,could not put this book down."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me (Signet)","review":"This is a very detailed description of the Ted Bundy murders and his life. Interesting, but very long. I am glad to know he is no longer a threat."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me (Signet)","review":"As a fan of Ann Rule, I naturally wanted to check out this book that I'd heard so much about. Bundy was Ms. Rule's friend, et cetera, et cetera, then her big wake-up call. I think that her actions were correct, and if I had been her, I wouldn't have done anything different. I have known my share of people who turned out to be very different people than the people I thought I knew, and I can understand Ms. Rule's feelings. When I finished the last page, I was shaking all over, but I felt like crying at the same time. I have seen the \\"campy\\" version of that movie about Bundy, and Rule is correct to any girls who had written that they were \\"in love\\" with Ted Bundy. \\"No,\\", Ms. Rule writes, \\"You were in love with the actor who played Ted Bundy.\\" I apologize if my quotation isn't completely accurate, but I have tried my best to reiterate those words. Yes, Bundy was charismatic, intelligent, and could have had a bright future. But it just didn't turn out that way. I wish there were answers to my questions, but there are none. I can empathize with Ms. Rule's feelings for a life so misspent. \\"Peace to everyone\\"."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me (Signet)","review":"The book is about Theodore Robert Bundy, America's biggest serial-killer. The story is very complete because before he killed someone he was Ann Rule's friend so she can tells us how he was, and it's very interesting! -Bundy had killed one hundred people! He was very mad, but with his friend he was very nice, it's hard to understand!It's never boring, so I highly recommended it!"},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me (Signet)","review":"The Stranger Beside Me was an excellent find! I would recommend it to anyone who wants an in-depth look into the real life of Ted Bundy. Ann Rule does a great job of giving the reader all of the facts and leaving the emotions up to you."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me (Signet)","review":"Ted Bundy obviously felt ashamed of his illegitimacy due to the nature of his birth. When he went to college, upon encountering others from a more affluent social-economical class, he felt even more self-conscious. It's so evident from his confession during his early twenties about his background and his anxiety at the matchability with Stephanie, his self-proclaimed love of his life. This reminds me of Tom Ripley, Patricia Highsmith's character in her Ripley books. Both from humble beginnings with an above-average intelligence, the glimpse of wealth and class made them hunger for more. We all feel the same more or less in our teens and early adulthood, the emotional struggle to try to &quot;fit in&quot;, to feel &quot;belonged&quot;, and the self-doubt and feeling of inadequacy. Thank goodness majority of us would eventually find our place in the society and our own skin. But a very few individuals went way wrong and traveled down to a path of no return. The saddest point is that Ted Bundy was brilliant in the field of Psychology. But then again, a lot of analysts admit that they don't necessarily read their own mind consciously and have the same tendency to avoid their own problems."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me (Signet)","review":"Despite being a huge crime reader, I don't usually read true crime. This book was recommended by so many crime fiction readers that I thought I'd check it out. I was interested in how one of the most noteworthy real life serial killers compared against his fictional counterparts.Many aspects of Ted Bundy's life of crime really are the stuff of novels, and no doubt have inspired many. Women of a specific and similar physical appearance disappearing all over the country are like something from a James Patterson book. Like Hannibal Lecter, Ted Bundy had formal psychiatric training and was experienced at administering the same psychological tests that were given to him in prison. He is cunning enough to escape prison, and adept at procuring fake identities and eluding the police. No maladjusted misfit, he was personable, charming, attractive to women - while capable of chilling rages where, in a single night, he could savage 4 different women, racing, bloodstained, from one college dorm to another.Much of the book is about Bundy's trials and time in prison - details absent from most fiction, which usually conveniently end after the perpetrator's discovery. While Bundy himself could hold his own as a fictional character, what really differs is the lack of any cohesive protaganist. While many individual police worked long and hard on his cases over the years, there was no idea for a long while that many of his attacks were connected, a situation that surely could not have escaped, for instance, a Lucas Davenport. Once the police finally manage to convict him - on only three of a known 35 and suspected 150 murders - the suspense moves to Bundy's repeated fight against his execution date, which is postponed many times in a morass of often less than inspiring legal wrangling.Whether Ms Rule's unique persective on the Ted Bundy case actually adds anything to the story is hard to say - despite their long friendship, she seems as baffled as everyone else as to how or why the kind and sensitive guy she knew could be a brutal and sadistic killer. Everyone who reads this by now knows the facts of the case, and it's hard to share any of her initial support of Bundy. This book's effectiveness is its thoroughness in showing the untidy fringes and loose ends that accompany real life crime - it's a scary, thought-provoking, and worthwhile read."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me (Signet)","review":"Interesting book, with an EXTREMELY unique perspective. That the author was the killer's friend before she knew he was at all connected to the murders, is the books main strenght...but also a weakness, in that it's hard to sympathize with her feelings that Ted should not be executed. The guy was a monster. But that is interesting, too, that her feelings of affection for him should remain. A very interesting, very readable book."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me (Signet)","review":"No one can write true crime better than Rule. Any book she writes is a must have. The fact that she new Bundy is shocking. She writes with care, warmth and extreme knowledge of not only the killers but the victims and their families too. This book told the most accurate info on Bundy where some other books on him only concentrate on the gore aspect."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me (Signet)","review":"This book is truly amazing, as it is not a dry report of an author set out to cover the subject of Ted Bundy, but a realer-than-real story of an author, who has set out to write a book, only to discover that the serial killer she writes about is that kind young man she knows from her work at the telephone helpline. Ann Rule really KNEW Ted Bundy, and that's what makes this book so fascinating. The pictures in it only add to that. I have had my share of crime and true crime, but I did ponder some nights about &quot;that shadow in the corner&quot;.....this book combined with the movie Sixth Sense REALLY kept me up three nights, only daring to fall asleep with the lights on!Good book, good story, here and there it tends to become slightly tedious, but all in all she does a great job in covering the story of one of the most feared men of his time. Try it!"},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me (Signet)","review":"Ann Rule did it all. She knew Ted Bundy before she knew he was a serial killer and after she'd finally accepted he was one. She was also an experienced crime reporter who understood the legal system and sat through the legal proceedings as they dragged on and on. Meanwhile, Bundy kills throughout, with the worst being after he escapes from his first prison. Rule even links him with yet an earlier murder in his hometown when he was only 15, showing he started killing even earlier than she'd previously supposed. I read the 35th printing of this book, which is no small testimony to how right she's painted the portrait. If you're going to read about a serial killer, there's nothing like the real thing. I read this on a plane ride to Florida and, although I normally detest flying, I barely noticed I was in a plane, I was so engrossed in this book."},{"Title":"The Stranger Beside Me (Signet)","review":"There have been many Ted Bundy books, and I have read them all, but none are as well written as Anne Rule's. She knew the man, and beleived in him far too long. (like most of his friends). Excellent True Crime reading."},{"Title":"Alien Agenda: The Untold Story of the Extraterrestrials Among Us","review":"Jim Marrs is one of the best research journalists of all time.

You will not regret it."},{"Title":"Alien Agenda: The Untold Story of the Extraterrestrials Among Us","review":"While the author does include many interesting and well-documented UFO experiences, his research was far too sloppy. A case in point is a reference to a well-known fraud and author of occult books who poses as a Tibetan lama. Apparently, Mr. Marrs was too busy to uncover this fact while writing his tome. Lapses of this kind weaken his claim to legitimacy in the UFO field."},{"Title":"Numerical Recipes Example Book Pascal","review":"This is a disk with programs from the book Numerical Recipes. There are no comments in the code, help file is just an index of routines without any explanations. Routines are translations of Fortran code into C but authors did not make any effort to conform to standard C conventions. All the arrays start at 1 instead of 0 which makes the code useless the way it is written - user must modify it. No const attribute is ever used. And this is plain C so if you write a C++ code and hope for seeing exceptions or references, forget it. You are better off buying a book and writing routines you need based on the published code. It is really a shame that such a thing is sold (and tremendously overpriced). jstrompf@soil.nl in his review obviously meant the book and not the CD-ROM, his positive review is misplaced."},{"Title":"Numerical Recipes Example Book Pascal","review":"Get the book w/disk. If you're programming numerical routines in C, there's no better place to go. I've used the first edition of the book w/software for more than 10 years and I'll keep using this stuff till the end. Translating from C to C++ has been a very easy task these 10 years. The important thing is that these recipes are fast, intelligently done, and the book (which you should get) explains everything, including the appropriate choice of recipe for your problem. I've used at least 30 of the routines from these guys and they have all been rock solid. If I had a problem with any of them, it was because I messed with the routine, not because there was a problem with the supplied software. I have yet to run into a numerical issue that these guys do not have a great solution for.Anyone familiar with the book knows that using the book's dynamic memory allocation routines (provided in Appendix D in my edition of the book and included in the software) allows you to start arrays anywhere you like, 0,1, or 1001, it doesn't matter. These dynamic memory allocation routines also have other major advantages such as minimizing the needed memory for a large simulation by allowing you to easily create new arrays as you need them, discard others immediately when you are done with them, adjust the size of an array according to the need at a specific point in your program, etc. Their way of handling this is so convenient that I never have had a memory allocation need that it does not meet. But this is just one detail; the main thing is that their attention to detail is at this level throughout. I cannot imagining going to another reference.Get the book, read it as needed (you don't need to read a lot to solve a specific programming problem), and do numerical analysis with as much ease as there is to be had in C or C++ programming."},{"Title":"Numerical Recipes Example Book Pascal","review":"Strange that I should get this book after I stopped using an old fashioned programming language and started using Mathematica.There are still algorithms used in this text that haven't been \\"built-in\\" in Mathematica.

I even stuck with the books after Neiderman started writing them, and helped run the biggest (at the time) internet fan club for her. I grew out of her books somewhere after the Melody series, and since then haven't read her books that often. However, this book caught my eye. \\"Dares to break all the rules\\"! That's what the cover said! So I picked it up, and hey- April is short, sensitive, and overweight. Well, that does indeed sound different, I think to myself. How nice it'll be to read a book with a chubby protagonist, I wondered how the issue of her size would be dealt with.Well, let me say this: poorly. Very, very poorly. Throughout the entire book April does not once ever think anything nice about herself or her body. She's criticized constantly for her size, and she refuses to stand up for herself. It's not at all an exaggeration to say that at least once every five pages there is some mention of her being \\"overweight\\", \\"obese\\", \\"20 pounds too much\\" or some other phrase that points a negative view on herself. There's huge focus on her dieting and on her sister and father being angry with her for doing things like - oh my god - eating a meal! To say that I was disappointed in this book is an understatement. In a world where there are so many young girls with eating disorders and self esteem and self image issues, this book only goes to further perpetuate it all. It's funny, because I always laughed at the typical moaning of VCA's characters over their \\"bony collarbones\\", but at least those characters appreciated their bodies for what they were, in spite of their flaws.There are other issues in this book - yes, there's a homosexual theme. Yes, it's predictable. There are so many stereotypes floating around in this book that it's ridiculous. Brenda, the jock lesbian. Peter, the Native American whose sole purpose in the story is to tell April about native lore and to \\"follow the wheel.\\" Of course, there's the chubby April, who's fat because she's lazy and eats too much.I would say that the one and ONLY positive part of this book is in the way that it deals with Brenda and Celia's relationship - very straightforward and without a lot of explaining. Their relationship just is what it is, and there's not a lot of controversy around it.

The only reason I read the April Shadows was because my roommate had both books, and since it was free... why not?Even free, I still feel used and wasted. These two books are NOT VCA. Nowhere even close. April is not a good VCA name like Heaven, Dawn, or Ruby. The titles did not make sense. April wasn't a real heroine. There were no horrible, dark secrets (her father's secret was laughable) and no real family secrets at all. This book focused a lot her stumbling (and unrealistic) explorations of her own sexuality.

There's no suspense AT ALL. In the first few pages where we hear about Mr. Hyde, I pretty much deduced that Matt Taylor was in fact sick and that's why his behavior changed. No suspense. I knew the sister would end up gay--I don't agree with that lifestyle, but since I enjoy VC books (which occasionally had incest), I knew to expect one of the two. Figured out which it would be once they started pimping the fact that she never went on dates, boys liked her but she didn't give them the time of day, BLAH BLAH BLAH. It's all so very cliche. The story isn't interesting. April is a wimp, and halfway through the book, nothing about her has changed. It's making me feel as if it's not worth finishing. And that's disappointing b/c when I first started reading VCA books in school, I couldn't put them down....loved the Casteels, the Cutlers, the Adares, the Landrys, Logans, and to an extent, the Hudsons. I would search high and low in my county's libraries for an entire series just so I wouldn't have to wait to read the next one. Not soo anymore.

However, it does not have the darkness and disturbed nature that one expects from V.C. Andrews. April is a girl who finds herself in quite a few tragic and unpleasant situations, but not anything near the horror related in \\"Flowers in the Attic\\" or even more recent works like \\"Melody.\\" Sadly, V.C.

It makes me sad."},{"Title":"April Shadows (Shadow Series)","review":"For many moons readers have been complaining about how similar all The VCA books have become.This one is different. And that is a plus.The story (by A.N.) offers a change-up to the franchise and is welcomed.For once we do not have to put up with a raging beauty, but a regular girl who is trying her best to cope. The lesbian theme is different from previous novels.The characters are written with feeling and depth. Brenda, Celia and April are easy to understand. I've yet to read the sequel, but have found this book to be a breath of fresh air compared to the last few (A.N.) novels.Note to (A.N.) author: Please feel free to change the formula; it's gotten old and needs to be refreshed. We will still follow you."},{"Title":"April Shadows (Shadow Series)","review":"Longtime fans of V.C.Andrews' books will be shocked to find that the adolescent narrator of this story is NOT a stunningly gorgeous young woman whose amazing beauty and budding sexuality make her prey to the pruient interest of men far older than she. They will also be surprised that the focus of the story isn't going to be this fair maiden's first physical relationship with a member of the male gender. Also, the heroine is not a graceful dancer, talented singer, gifted artist or promising pianist. She is not in any way connected with a fabulously wealthy family in possession of an enormous estate with a goofy name, and she is also sure who her parents are and not attracted to anyone in her family. Truly, this book strikes new V.C. Andrews ground!Instead, April, heroine of the book, is overweight, short, not particularly talented at anything, and confused about her sexuality. I liked this book and thought it was original and refreshing. It confronted the reality of being a teenager: that many adolescents go through awkward phases where they are confused about their identity and who they really are.Although the book treds familiar V.C. Andrews' ground by having April be beset by successive family tragedies, the story does break with the familiar V.C. formula by introducing themes such as lesbianism, cocaine use and...um, ventriloquism. Ok, it was a little weird at parts, but it somehow dealt with things like homosexuality in a mature way while trying to introduce some of the gothic \\"horror\\" elements we expect from these books.It treats its heroine in a surprisingly sensitive way. April is a lovable character who is more recognizable than many other girls who have been in V.C. Andrews books. She isn't accepted by her peers but we root for her to find her way in the world because she is a kind and caring person. I think the book took a realistic look at issues such as weight-loss and teenage sexuality. April doesn't magically take off her excess weight at any point in the book; she struggles with eating as a coping mechanism and relapses, gaining back more than she had lost originally.When she is worried that she might be gay, a common worry that most straight adolescents have at some point or another (after all, their closest relationships are often with members of the same gender), the book does not insinuate that the worry alone means anything about her future.Her sister, who actually is gay, is one of the strongest V.C. Andrews characters in a long time. Brenda is a survivor and her character was well-developed and believable. She loves her sister but tries to suppress her own needs by putting on a tough front when confronted with a crisis.Overall I really liked the book and thought it was brave. It did deal with issues I've never imagined Andrews would. Although the book was bizarre, it was a page turner and kept me interested. And despite the lurid and ridiculous nature of some of the plot twists, the major themes were dealt with in a mature and responsible way. I think this book would be comforting to adolescents. I think gay teens or teens who struggle with weight would particularly appreciate this new plotline. And although I didn't have April's particular set of problems, I think every teenager can identify with feelings of isolation/ being different/wondering if you're normal/attractive enough. So that would appeal to anyone.However, I kind of miss the formula, too. Part of why we like these books is the fantasy aspect-I think we all like to imagine that we will find out that we're actually a lost part of some aristocratic American dynastic family and will soon be dressing up for the society balls, that as young teenagers we might be having an affair with a sophisticated older man, etc. Of course in retrospect I'm glad I wasn't 16 and dating someone more than twice my age, but the fantasy was fun. So bring back the fantasy after this series. In the meantime, I look forward to finding out what happens to April..."},{"Title":"April Shadows (Shadow Series)","review":"I have always loved these books however I feel this is not the best one I have read. It's ok."},{"Title":"April Shadows (Shadow Series)","review":"I love any thing V C Andrews or her ghost writer writes. April Shadows has a five rateing by me."},{"Title":"April Shadows (Shadow Series)","review":"My book was about a girl named April. She was an outcast in school and doesn't have many friends. She has an older sister named Brenda and she's a few years older than April. Brenda is an all star athelete, and is all around good person. In the begining of the book April talks about her life before her dad turned into \\"Dr. Jkyle\\". She talks about how their life was and how they laughed all the time and had fun. Their dad is turning meaner and meaner every day and they have no idea why. He comes home late almost every night, and when he has to fly out for buisness meetings he ususally forgets or just doesn't bother to call them at all. It makes the family very upset. In the book he even forgets about Brenda's birthday. Later on in the book you find out that her dad leaves them in the middle of the night, and they have no idea why. A few weeks after a letter came in the mail talking about payments to this one facility. It was about 4 hours away, but they decide to go and see if their dad is there. When they get there, they find out that he put himself there because he had severe brain tumors and hardly had a chance to live. He didn't want to tell the family about it or make them sad. He thought it would be best to just get up and leave without saying good bye. They are so devestated by what happens they don't know what to do. They come back their house and everything changes. Their mother gets really weak and small. Brenda is more furious than ever, but April doesn't really change that much. Brenda gets accepted to Memphis with a full scholorship for basketball. It gets really lonely at the house with just April and her mom. Brenda finally plans a visit home and brings her \\"new friend\\" along with them. Her name is Cecila. They are room mates at college, and they are together 24/7. You eventually find out that Brenda and Cecila are actually lovers. April doesn't know what to think of their relationship, and doesn't really bother thinking about it. April and her mom were planning on going to see Brenda at one of her all star games, but her mom cant' go because she felt ill the morning they were suppoes to go. So April takes the car with her mother's permission and travels to Memphis. She stays with her sister and Cecila in another room. After the big win of the game April calls her mother to check up on her and she is acting wierd, but April doesn't question her. She gets a phone call the next day about her mother and the next door neightbor told them to hurry home quick. It just so happens that her mother killed herself that night by taking too many sleeping pills. They are both devistated, with two parents gone they don't know what to do. April, Brenda, and Cecila buy a small house with a studio apartment. April lives in the apartment. April meets a boy named Peter smoke at a chess club meeting. She goes to the meetings twice a week to see him. She gets him to come along to one of Brenda's games, and he does. April actually likes him a lot, but she's afraid of what might happen. A little after that Cecila comes onto her and Brenda walks in and sees them and flips out. The next morning April decides that she's going to run away, and find her Uncle. Her uncle is a traveling magician, and is actually pretty good. She drives for a day straight to El paso and finds her uncle. She is on the road with him for a while, and finds out about his drinking problem. He drinks away his sorrows every night, and eventually he gets really sick. She walks in on him dead in his bed room one morning, and she doesn't know what to do. She goes to the nearest house she could find for help. The people help her, and the cops come for the body. The woman who owns the house has her stay with h er until she figures out what she's going to do now that she has nobody to live with. The book ends there when she's at the house, and there's a second book to it so it will explain about her adventure about the house that she's living in now."},{"Title":"April Shadows (Shadow Series)","review":"Seeing people disgard this book, souly because it has homosexuality contained in it. well, the world also has homosexulity in it and the sooner people realize it and stop thinking as if we all were in the dark ages where people were be-headed for things like that, the better. Anybody who has read flowers in the attic series and liked it and wrote a review saying this book should't heve ever been published is one of the biggest hipictrits i have ever had the misfortune of having my eyes rolled across their reviews for this magnificent and defiant book. and defiance in a book is a rare but key quality in a memorable book that will be remembered for generations to come. such as myself. i read this book and i'm fourteen but i even know more about beautiful literature than some of these pig-headed, hipicrital, old bitties that think back to pilgrim eras and customs when women only wore black and gray and weren't allowed an oponion. and now that i see how some women take their oponion that many women died trying to uphold, and say things like \\"i threw it away the second i finished it\\" or \\"it is soft core porn\\" or \\"the homosexuality it disgusting\\", really makes me sick and sad to know that the women who died for our oponions, would be turning in their graves if they could read the horid way people have dishevled this beautiful and heartfelt book."},{"Title":"April Shadows (Shadow Series)","review":"... this book is another winner.It's filled with dramatic events that cause more dramatic events just like V.C.

Another dysfunctional situation as well as a character many can relate to, to get to know.Glad to see gay issues out of the closet and onto the page. The Uncle and his big doll make for a wonderful twist(ed) addition, too.Now, on to book two of the series. Good!"},{"Title":"April Shadows (Shadow Series)","review":"Aah... so once again I, the biggest fan of Mr. Andrew Neiderman, get to review this latest V C ANDREWS novel. It is my pleasure and my priviledge to do so!April and Brenda are two very different sisters. Or are they? April is chubby and shy and Brenda is athletic and outgoing. And Brenda prefers women. While it takes April a while to realize it, once she does, she struggles with her own identity. After the deaths of both their mother and father, things spiral downhill pretty fast for the girls. Brenda is so clearly unhappy and takes out her frustrations with her athletic prowess. And you never really trust Celia -- Brenda's lover -- because you just know that she is so coyly trying to get on April's good side... with disastrous results!Intrigued? You will have to read this novel for yourself. It is never my intent to outline the novel for you. Instead, it is my intent to look at the overall novel and compare it to the writing style of the original VCA.I am so happy that this novel took place over years, not over days or weeks. You really get a good character perspective as you watch them all grown and change. While I wish Brenda was stronger (she whines a lot and she knows it) you have to consider her age and the things she goes through.My hat is off to Mr. Neiderman for his sensitive handling of Brenda and Celia's love affair. The words homosexuality, gay, and lesbian are never mentioned (to the best of my memory). Dyke is used once. Cleary Mr. Neiderman has an understanding of what these young people are going through and he treats them all with dignity, respect, and caring. Ms. Andrews would have done the same thing.I am bitterly disappointed that the number of books in the latest series are limited. While WILLOW was the standard-formula VCA 5 books, the GEMINI series (Celeste) was only 3 books and the APRIL series appears to have only 2 books in it. I still hope for more GEMINI books.All in all, Mr. Neiderman has provided us life-long fans of VCA with another great novel, one that is tender, sensitive, and exciting at the same time. Bravo, Mr. Neiderman, bravo!"},{"Title":"April Shadows (Shadow Series)","review":"While I totally agree with 'Justice' that this book refreshing breaks many of the traditional 'VC Andrews' cliched formulas (that I, frankly, get tired of-I could tell you most of the stories without even reading the books!), you can still see some writing on the wall with the excerpt from the next book. Let's see, a jealous 'relative' who dropped off their kid for someone else to raise coming back and raising cain? A lecherous boyfriend of this 'relative' who I somehow suspect will have something sexual to do with April. Sound familiar?Sadly, the most interesting character, Peter Smoke, was delegated to another stereotyped 'bad boyfriend' role. Wouldn't it be nice if just once these boyfriends were nice, and DIDN'T die?Still, as you can see from my rating, it was one of the better VC Andrews books in quite a long time."},{"Title":"April Shadows (Shadow Series)","review":"This book took a plunge like most the other books the ghost writer has written. Once through Dawn series the books are boring, not enough tragedy or gothic porportions that gave V.C. Andrews the following she had. He is basically running on a name, with the exception for Olivia, he has yet to produce anything worth reading. April Showers included, a book to go where none have gone before, Lesbianism is not daring, nor should homosexuality in general be a taboo. V.C. Andrew trusts should reconsider and turn this around as to who should be working with Ms. Andrews visions instead of fluff."},{"Title":"April Shadows (Shadow Series)","review":"First let me say, that I admire Mr. Neiderman for daring to be different.I admire him for NOT having that beautiful heroine, and I admire him for introducing homosexual relationships in a non-isolating way.However, I felt that the book itself was fairly boring. There were some interesting moments (Peter Smoke and Luke), but I felt that the book was not really going anywhere. I also thought that more chapters would be dedicated to April's father's storyline, as that was what the blurb talked about on the back.Personally, I enjoy the gothic, somewhat twisted stories better than this. I like the Andrews/Neiderman stories that have events that would never happen in real life. However, I thought that this was more of a \\"drama\\" than a \\"gothic\\" novel, and that I could find similar stories in the young adult section of the book store.In conclusion, Mr. Neiderman, I salute your efforts for trying something different, but I prefer the gothic novels with the beautiful heroine."},{"Title":"April Shadows (Shadow Series)","review":"So the gay relationship in this book is \\"sick\\" and should be spat upon . . . but all the rape and incest in the other books was perfectly acceptable and wholesome?"},{"Title":"April Shadows (Shadow Series)","review":"V.C. Andrews/Andrew Neiderman breaks some new ground with this novel. April Taylor, an overweight, self-conscious girl, comes from a family of high achievers, but is not one herself. Her father vanishes from the picture early on, then her mother, leaving her with her sister Brenda and Brenda's partner. After observing Brenda and Celia's relationship and comparing it to some that she herself has had, April begins to wonder if she might be like them.The gay/lesbian theme is handled quite tastefully, while not exactly hiding the relationship from view - after all, this is the 21st century, with same-sex marriage in the forefront of the news. Overall, this is the first *really* good V.C. Andrews novel since Andrews died and Neiderman took over. I look forward to the next and hope that the Shadows series is not as abbreviated as some of the others."},{"Title":"April Shadows (Shadow Series)","review":"Hmm....So far no bad reviews. I've visited this page since the book came out waiting for the oh-so-thought-provoking and unevitable review titled \\"ewwwwwwwwwwwwwww!\\"Like some other reviewers have stated, this book does break a lot of ground, and in an impressive way. Right away, we have some new character types. First of all is April Taylor, who is overweight and suffers from low self-esteem because of this.Her sister Brenda is athletic and outgoing. She also breaks a lot of ground character-wise. She is not a \\"wicked jealous older\\" sister \\"or really her step-sister\\". Although there's times that she does come across as mean and insensitive, there is always a reason for it. Another interesting twist to the story is that her sister prefers women to men, and this is handled in a sensitive, very open-minded manner.Her parents fall more into the generic VCA formula, and readers will recognize them.I did like this book and will be looking out for the next one."},{"Title":"April Shadows (Shadow Series)","review":"Finally a book that is almost worthy of true V.C. style.

This book has a good moral but too much foreshadowing. You can easily guess how things will work out. Also, what's with the cliffhanger at the end? Is Mafatu dead, unconscious, or just exhausted? Sperry just cuts it off and gives some background information. I'm just unimpressed by this book and I don't recommend it."},{"Title":"Call It Courage","review":"This book, which was first copyrighted in 1940, is still a good coming-of-age adventure, except for ONE BIG PROBLEM: racist imagery. The people the young South Seas islander hero must outwit and outrun in order to return to his homeland are terrifying \\"blacks,\\" \\"savages,\\" \\"eaters-of-men.\\" This stereotyped characterization might have been acceptable to some in 1940, but society has since come to realize the harm it can cause to Black children's self-image and other children's attitudes toward Black people. To ethically introduce this book to a child requires either blacking out offending words (!) or prefacing and interspersing the reading with lessons in sociology and history, and even then, there's no assurance that damage won't be done. Why take the chance when there are so many other good books out there?Newberry-awarded books engender such trust.

Mafatu, a Polynesian boy of 15 years old, has an intense fear of the ocean. At the age of three he was nearly killed when his mother drowned. Now he must conquer his fears. He goes off on his own and finds the courage within him. The story (probably for ages 9 to 13) starts off on the island of Hikueru in the Tuamotu Archipelago east of Tahiti at a time before European ships and missionaries had arrived. Apparently, Sperry, who had traveled throughout the South Pacific, based his story on an old and true Polynesian tale."},{"Title":"Call It Courage","review":"Robert Heinlein once wrote that &quot;Courage is not the absence of fear--it is the conquest of fear. The man who is truly fearless is not courageous. He is also a fool.&quot; Young Mafatu, a Polynesian islander, fears the ocean. This is something akin to a cowboy fearing cattle. His fear causes him a great deal of discomfiture and makes him an object of scorn and ridicule.Sperry tells the story of how Mafatu (which means &quot;Stout Heart&quot;) faced and conquered his fear. I read the story some 40 years ago as a young child. Although I wasn't really searching for anything other than the subject matter for a book report, I came away from &quot;Call it Courage&quot; with something far more important than a long-forgotten grade.Simply, elegantly, Sperry explores the nature of courage and helps the young reader to come to a better understanding of that most misunderstood quality."},{"Title":"Call It Courage","review":"The story of Mafatu's adventure on the isle of the eaters of men is unforgettable. Some 30 years ago I first encountered this book in my elementary school library and it remains vivid in my memory. It is the story of a young boy, Mafatu, who lives on an island yet fears the sea that killed his mother years ago. Mafatu decides to face his greatest and deepest fear--the sea--and sets off on an adventure, ending up not only conquering his fear of the sea but successfully confronting such life-threatening challenges as a hammerhead shark, a sharp-tusked wild boar and, finally, angry man-eating islanders. It is the kind of story where just when you think things can't get worse, they do. But Mafatu finds out that he is able to overcome every challenge and returns to his home island in triumph.Mafatu's story should be required reading for children preparing to face a world every bit as dangerous as the open ocean and filled with hazards no less serious than sharks and cannibals."},{"Title":"Call It Courage","review":"call it courage is one of the best books for any person who likes a good short book.The book is about a young boy named Mafatu his name maens stout heart.

Mafatu overhears some boy's talking about him, so, accompanied by his dog, Uri, goes out to sea to try and prove himself.I liked this book because it was descriptive, so I could easily picture in my mind what was going on.

This was one of my favorite books growing up, and encouraged me to learn as much in the way of practiacl skills as possible, even if it wasn't cool, or was somehting that boys arent supposed to learn.

Mafatu is a boy of about twelve living on the Polynesian island of Hikueru, who has lost his mother to the sea and is deathly afraid of it. One day, to conquer his fear, he sets out himself and winds up a castaway on a volcanic island.The thing that fascinated me as a child reading this was Mafatu's ingenuity -- the construction of the outrigger canoe, the making of his clothing and food, teaching himself to hunt and build and survive. While I wouldn't have wanted to be so far from home, in some ways I wanted to be him, experiencing that world half a planet away. TV shows like Survivor have nothing on this.The ambiguous ending (I prefer to think it's a happy one, but that is by no means clear) is a satisfying, if bittersweet, wrapup to one of the greatest, most intense, most incredible adventure stories that any child could ever enjoy.

It was written by Armstrong Sperry. My favorite part was when Mako and Alfa got stuck on the island. The part that was the worst to me was when Mako was made fun of. My favorite character was Mako.

I would recommend this book to a friend."},{"Title":"Call It Courage","review":"The book i read was called The Thief by Megan Whalen Turner. This book is set up for the midieval times because they dont use guns very often. Instead they fight with swords and ride horses. I like this book because it was very well depicted by the author, and thats why I gae it five stars. The plot of the story begins shortly after telling about the main character named Gen. gen gets into trouble when he bragged about stealing the king's seal and gets chained up to a wall in the prison.The magus comes and asks Gen if will come with him to steal a valuable item. Oh yes and Gen's faveorite thing to say is &quot;I can steal anything&quot;. Well they set off to Attolia the neighboring country in wich the item was hidden. Gen almost ges killed once but the magus and his traveling companions take him to Ediss the neutral country between Attolia and Sounis.

But I felt that CalL it Courage had some good ideas. This book had some boing ideas and needed to tell more about his characters. let me tel ou a little about the author. I think that the author should tell more about Mafatu's mother, becausee ifArmstrong Sperry told her name and maybe what she looked like it might have described Mafatu better. Armstrong Sperry should have told more ideas about all his characters. He could have at least given specific hair and eye color. Some parts of this book were exciting and some were not. Like the prt when Mafatu kills the octopus and save his dog. Now this book was not a book that a lot of people would like to read.

If I were him I wouldn't of let all of those people make fun of me. He was very courageous to kill that shark, i don't think I could of done that!

I think the author did a good job because he explained a lot about this scene. It also was the most interesting part in the story. This is almost my favorite part because Mafatu becomes a hero. The author did not do a good job explaining the part about Mafatu's mother. He could have told were she was born what she looked like and her hair color.

For shelter he builds a hut of bamboo and in case he needs a quick get away he starts building another canoe.

The same things happen too much, storms, dangerous sea creatures, making fishing gear, etc.However, the book is pretty descriptive. I don't think this book deserves a Newbery Medal at all. I don't think it deserves any medal; a Newbery Honor at the most. The book talks about a boy called Mafatu (the name means \\"stout heart in Polynesian\\"), who is afraid of the sea after a horrid experience with his mother at sea while collecting sea urchins when he was young. He doesn't go fishing like all the other boys do because of his fear of the sea. Other boys laugh at him and make him angry. Mafatu tries to prove himself and goes out to the sea.

This books takes you through the adventures that Mafatu has and shows what he learns and how he grows. This book is a fast and easy read. It is very predictable and I would recommend it to younger kids."},{"Title":"Call It Courage","review":"Call it courage is a well thought out book. It is about a boy name Mafatu. His mother died in the sea because she did not listen to the fishermen&#65533;s warnings to her. His homeland called him a coward because he was afraid of the sea. So when he was feed up with the teasing he left to prove himself worthy and gain respect from his father. You will have to read the book to find out what happens to Mafatu during his journey. I would recommend this book to people that love the sea. Keep in mind that about 2 chapters out of 5 are about the time he was in the sea. But it was adventurous. You used for shadowing to guess what would happen. One thing I did not like about the book was that the boy always won his battles. He needs defeat to so he does not think he can win every battle or obstacle he comes to."},{"Title":"Call It Courage","review":"This story is about a boy whom people believed didn't have any courage. My favorite part was when he was on the deserted island and he had to fend for himself. I liked it when he set a trap for fish, made a knife and found a spear, killed a big shark and a boar and an octopus. This took place in the middle of the story. The setting is on an island near Australia. This story is encouraging because Mafatu, the main character, developed all kinds of courage. Read the book and find out how."},{"Title":"Call It Courage","review":"As a boy, I dreamed of adventure. I ran through the woods fighting imaginary enemies, carving bows and arrows, erecting lean-tos and tents. I loved the outdoors, with all its beauty and danger. \\"Call it Courage\\" was one of my favorite books as a preteen, capturing these dreams in exotic and hair-raising fashion.Mafatu is a 15 year old boy, whose name means \\"Stout Heart,\\" and yet he is anything but courageous. After a harrowing experience in his early years, he fears the sea and endures the ridicule of his father and his island people. Determined to grow up, Mafatu sets out with his dog, Uri, and an albatross, named Tivi, to face the wild sea and all that it contains. In a canoe, he rides the waves, survives a hurricane, and finds himself on another island where the eaters-of-man seem to come for their dark dances and rituals.As Mafatu becomes a man himself, he knows his time is dwindling before the eaters-of-man return and threaten his survival. If he is to be victorious, he must conquer his old fears and despair, fighting creatures of the deep, as well as those who walk the earth. In so doing, he has the chance of being accepted by his people back home--or going down in story as the fearful one.The writing is descriptive, timeless, and beautiful. The characters are few, but rich in portrayal. The settings are unlike most we ever read of in books, and in rereading this, my heart once again raced as Mafatu faced the hammerhead shark, the wild pig, the giant octopus, and the angry ocean. This book is a classic, and for good reason."},{"Title":"Call It Courage","review":"The biggest shortcoming of this book is that it is too short. It glosses over long periods of time and so many of the things that Mafatu did that it leaves questions and holes in the story.The author does use the word \\"blacks\\" in a negative way, but \\"eaters-of-men\\" is not derogatory - there truly are/were cannibals on some Pacific islands.The ending is well done, leaving the reader unsure of Mafatu and Uri's survival."},{"Title":"Call It Courage","review":"I just stumbled upon this book and I was absolutely blown away as I had never heard of this book before. I even got my father to read it and he loved it. This is a book for all ages and something for everyone to love and appreciate."},{"Title":"Call It Courage","review":"Like the majority of other reviewers, I was struck by the excitement and adventure of this story. While the exotic setting surely plays its part in drawing the reader deeper into the tale, it is also the underdog nature of the story's main character, Mafatu (Stout Heart). The reader will surely identify with the inner nature of all humans to challenge the personal fears that we hold within us. Mafatu actualizes these challenges in his conflicts with the sea, personified in the Tahitian sea god, Moana. With his two animal companions, Uri, the dog, and Kivi, the albatross, Mafatu sets out to overcome his fears, to grow into a new and mature person. Young and older readers will learn much about Polynesian cultures and even learn some Tahitian language. There is also a spiritual part of this story which has often been overlooked by others. Mafatu constantly prays to and gives thanks for his survival, well being, and growth to Maui, the Polynesian god of the fishermen, who like the Greek Prometheus is responsible for giving fire to humankind. In the end, with the help of his animal friends, he is able to courageously and ingeniously overcome all of the internal and external challenges and thereby rightfully claim his meaningful name.One caveat is that the \\"eaters-of-men,\\" i.e., cannibals, are made out to be black, irrational and dangerous. While the story is simply a story that was first published in 1940, some youngsters may come away from the story with a distorted view of race."},{"Title":"Call It Courage","review":"Call it Courage by Armstrong Sperry is the story of a boy named Mafatu who was afraid of the sea.

He gets lost on a deserted island and must learn to fend for himself. The villagers all assume that this clumsy boy could not make it one day on his own, but he does very well indeed. His Robinson Crusoe-like adventure is one that folks like us could not survive, since he was more prepared than we could ever hope to be since his people lived off the land and sea already. By the way, in 1972 the Walt Disney studio made a very very nice live action version of this for their weekly tv show and you can do a search for the vhs version and get a used copy here at Amazon."},{"Title":"Call It Courage","review":"Mafatu, whose name means Stout Heart, is a 12- year-old Polynesian boy living on the rocky atoll of Hikueru. As a child he watched his mother drown; ever since he has been a prisoner of the understandable terrors of his maritime environment. Worse still, his fear of fishing has embarrassed his father, the chief, for all the village knows that his son is a cowawrd. Desptie his nimble fingers and quick mind, he seems fit only for woman's work, yet his heart burns with shame at the vicious taunting of the other boys and his father's humiliation. He longs to redeem himself in the eyes of his people and earn the his father's pride.This book has been a classic tale of survival for over 50 years, yet I had not heard of it until I found a Pb version. It read swiftly, albeit with little dialgoue. I wish the author had gone into more depth about how Mafatu fashioned the tools he neded to survive on the small island. It was interesting to learn about the man-eaters and their most sacred taboo: scacrifices to a monstrous stone idol on the Forbidden Island. The island that saved his life after a gruelling ocean voyage could prove his deathtrap.This slim volunme is appealing because it presents a young boy with a clearly-defined dream: to return in triumph as a brave warrior to his people. He has to clarify his goal and work out the details of each step in the process, but the arrival of the cannibals is ill-timed. He must face and conquer his fears of the ocean; he reveals the spirituality of this Pre-Columbian people by praying often to Maui. When threatened by elements of the sea, he hurls challenges to Moana, whom he feel has been stalking him since he almost drowned at the age of three. I admrie his courage to defend his faithful canine companion and the many times he must overcome real terror at his own physical peril, to achieve a greater goal. His will to live and ingenuity are a great inspiration; this story shows that even pre teens are capable of great achievement."},{"Title":"Call It Courage","review":"Call it Courage is about a young boy named Mafatu.

When Mafatu reaches another island, adventure ensues when he has to learn to survive on his own and return to Hikueru with pride and courage.This book was all right because it was entertaining and interesting, but the thing I didn't like is that it's very simple.

Realizing their indifference to him, he sets out to sea alone in his canoe, taking only his dog and a few tools. That night he is caught in a storm, in which he loses his paddle and all his tools, and he washes up on an island where cannibals are known to live. He builds a shelter and canoe and chooses to survive; while living there he kills an octopus, a boar, and a shark, and faces the human terror of ritualistic cannibals, barely escaping with his life. At the end of his journey he returns to his village having proved himself a man.The story is set in a mythical Polynesia, but is written in a European voice: at one point the author describes a canoe caught in a current \\"like a millrace,\\" a term which is decidedly foreign to this island culture. The great weakness of this book is that the tribal societies which provide a backdrop for the story are caricatured: The tribal fishermen represent noble savages, living so close to nature that they become \\"ill at ease, charged... with an almost animal awareness of impending storm\\" (3). Conversely, the cannibal tribe represent a class of wordless, brutal primitives -- dancing with oiled bodies, beating drums around fires and stone idols, wailing, and shouting with guttural voices. Mafatu appeals throughout the story to Maui, \\"god of the Fishermen,\\" and repeatedly challenges his nemesis Moana, the Sea God. Sperry's Maui, however, hardly resembles the Polynesian trickster named Maui, and the Moana of the story is only a personification of the sea (In some of the languages \\"moana\\" does mean sea or ocean.)No one having read this book should believe they have learned anything about the real Polynesia -- it is no more a story about Polynesia than Little Red Riding Hood is about the European forest. Notwithstanding this, if a reader can accept that Call it Courage is a lesson not in history but in moral courage, they may benefit from the moral example this hero represents. Although Mafatu is limited by his youth and inexperience, he faces great dangers and survives, facing down one fear after another. By making critical choices under pressure, and by refusing to succumb to the elemental, animal, spiritual and human forces arrayed against him, he finally wins his victory. This coming of age is an accomplishment any young boy can aspire to."},{"Title":"Call It Courage","review":"I really liked this book because it was about a boy that wanted to change is life.. that wanted to take a chance and face his fear of the sea.. although at first it didn't go very well, it was all worth it in the end. It kinda makes you look at your life and fears that you have and makes you want to face those fears and over come them. but in another way it makes you want to never give up on what you are trying to accomplish at that point in you life.. and to never give up, becasuse it will be worth it in the end. I would recommend this book to anyone and everyone, because it teaches you a good lesson in your life and i really listened to it, and i hope that anyone that reads this book will listen to it to. I liked that he had a bird that followed him around and a dog that never left his side, it's like the dog had an idea in his head that he was suppost to stay with him and never leave his side, through thick and thin.. kinda like a friend, but only he couldn't talk back. i think that this book deserved the newbery Medal award, because it was really good."},{"Title":"Call It Courage","review":"A South Pacific hurricane nearly killed Mafatu, a Polynesian Island boy, when he was three. Currents from the impending storm had carried the canoe that his mother navigated out to sea, where the hurricane-sized waves capsized it. Clinging to the outrigger pole, Mafatu's mother managed to fight off sharks and dehydration long enough to reach a coral reef after several days adrift: \\"At hand lay a cracked coconut; the woman managed to press the cool, sustaining meat to her child's lips before she died\\" [p10]. Ever since, Mafatu was afraid of the sea.This book was originally written in 1940 and is illustrated by the author. It's five chapters are subtitled \\"Flight\\", \\"The Sea\\", \\"The Island\\", \\"Drums\\", and \\"Homeward\\". It is a Rite of Passage story where Mafatu is teased and taunted by his mates because of his fear of the sea. Eventually Mafatu can no longer tolerate the jeers nor the silent contempt that his dad holds for him, and he sets off in a canoe with his two pals - a dog and albatross, to run away from the island of taunts.Out in the Pacific Ocean, a storm and its currents grab the boy's craft taking it on an unknown course while its waves rob the craft of its stores and supplies. Mafatu and his dog, Uri, are battered at storm's end and the albratross, Kivi, must step up and guide the gang to land - The Island. Exploring the island, he discovers it is used by the \\"eaters-of-men\\" to make sacrifices to a statue - he had landed on Forbidden Island!The remainder of the book is about how Mafatu comes of age while learning to survive and be resourceful. When he and his dog eventually return to their home island with the eaters-of-men in hot pursuit most of the way, they return (thanks to Kivi's navigational assistance) to a see a cold father no longer cold and jeering villagers no longer jeering. Mafatu, the Stout Heart, has proved he has earned his name."},{"Title":"Call It Courage","review":"Call it Courage was written by Armstrong Sperry. It's a story about a boy who was afraid of the sea because Mona the Sea God took his mother away when they were out in a canoe. Then Mafatu became afraid of the sea.

He is afraid of the water because he once almost drowned. While he was drowning, his mom came and saves him. The mom died though. I like this book because it is almost like the Island of the Blue Dolphins. He is lost on an island. There he makes canoes and weapons. I also think it is an excellent book because Uri fights a shark for a knife that he made out of a whales bone. After that, he has to fight a squid that almost kill him.

It also told about how Mafatu had courage and how he was brave and strong after his mother was taken by the sea. This book was full of adventure.The best part of the book was when Mafatu found the statue on the forbidden island. He was walking through the woods and was surprised to find this statue in the middle of nowhere.The two story elements that were the most vivid were the theme and the characters. The theme was cconguering your fear. Mafatu needed to face his fears of survive on his own. He was successful throughout the story. The author did a good job of describing Mafatu and the people he met. I was able to see in my mind what each person looked like."},{"Title":"Call It Courage","review":"I was introduced to this book when my teacher read it to the class when I was in grade 2 or 3. Years later, I picked it up and read it again. I enjoyed this book so much more the second time around. Reading it when I was older, I realized how heart-wrenching the ending was. Say what you will, but it made me bawl my eyes out, and I was 15! Obviously, it was below my reading level, but that's no reason not to read this book.

And, overshadowing all, is Mafatu's one terrible discovery -- the island he is currently on is a sacred ritual meeting place for cannibals!Can Mafatu prove himself, construct a new canoe (his old one was lost) and flee before the dreaded \\"eaters-of-men\\" return and exact a terrible revenge upon him for profaning their \\"motu tabu\\" -- the Forbidden Island?---There are a few typo's (very few, and very far between) -- a \\"runtogether\\" word on occasion, for example, or the word \\"galaxies\\" spelled with two \\"l\\"s (\\"gallaxies\\"), and the like. But otherwise excellent.My main complaint with this Kindle version -- and the reason I only gave it four stars instead of five -- is that apart from the front and back covers, THIS BOOK IS NOT ILLUSTRATED in any way whatsoever.In PRINTED versions, there are at least two possible sets of drawings for this book, depending on which illustrator is doing whichever printed version you have (I believe one set was done by Mr. Armstrong Sperry himself); both sets are REALLY excellent; and neither one is included in this Kindle edition. While this probably accounts for this Kindle edition's extremely low cost, it is a definite trade-off -- I would very gladly have paid a LOT more in exchange for a full set of illustrations.Overall, though, a truly excellent value, and I do recommend its purchase!"},{"Title":"Call It Courage","review":"The book was enjoyable. My kids really loved the book, as well as my friends daughters. Everyone loved the book."},{"Title":"Call It Courage","review":"I bought this book to read to my 9 year old grandsons. They were captivated by it and planned for reading time ; something they had never done before."},{"Title":"Call It Courage","review":"This book is the reason most people still know of Sperry's work. It has been in print continuously for nearly sixty years, a testament to the endurance of this story's appeal, and the influence of a Newbery Medal."},{"Title":"Call It Courage","review":"Mafatu is afraid. His mother died in the sea and now he fears it. All his people know of his fear. His father is saddened by his fear.At last, Mafatu decides to face his fears. He sails off into the sea and ends up on a remote island. He must confront sharks, dangerous man-eating people, lack of food and water, an octopus, and a lack of a ship to return home.Wonderful book for discussion."},{"Title":"Call It Courage","review":"Have you ever read the book called Call it Courage? You haven't, I'm going to tell you a summary and what I think about it. There was a boy \`'Mafatu'' that went out to the sea with his dog ''Uri'' to proof his courage. He went there because everyone thought he was afraid of the sea. On the way he lost his knife, and almost lost his dog, when he got to the island he found another one. But there weren't any people. He had to fight lots giant animals. He had to hunt his food and take care of his self, and when he went home he would proof his courage. I think that it is a good book because it shows people that you should face your fears, and not be afraid. I think he was scared to go out to the sea alone. I know I would be scared. It didn't matter how old he was, he still tried to face his fears. I think this book should be graded a 5 because I think it encourages us to not be afraid any more. To face what were scared of. If you are a person that wants to proof your courage, than you should read this book. That is what I think about this book."},{"Title":"Call It Courage","review":"This is a book about survival.

It is geared for 4th graders but our entire family learned from it and appreciated the moral(s) of the story."},{"Title":"Call It Courage","review":"This is a good story book. It's just like Robinson Crusoe and Swiss Family Robinson. Those were both good books. Now I read this and I thought Robinson Crusoe and Swiss Family Robinson is better. So read those first then this.In this book, all the Indian groups around tell a story about a kid that is in a canoe and the canoe crashes and he lands on a different island. He is stuck there. He can't contact anyone. So he is stuck on the island and he has nobody to talk to and nothing to eat.One day, he meets a guy named Uri. He helps him find food and shelter. They worked together and so they found a bunch of birds one day because one of the birds the kid remembered from his tribe place. Then, one day, people found him because he started to yell and scream and they took him back to the tribe's place. They were happy that they found him. The Tribe Leader was happy to see him the most. The Tribe Leader was happy he was home because the Tribe Leader was his dad.I didn't really like this book so much but I thought other adventure books! So go get this book at the library or buy it.

It is simply the best backup software solution out there.The only two serious competitors in the marketplace are Legato Networker and Veritas Netbackup. They are decent for small (less than 100 systems that need backing up) installations. However, if you want to backup thousands of computer systems and deal with as few backup-servers as possible, then Tivoli Storage Manager is really your only choice. The largest disaster recovery systems in the world use Tivoli Storage Manager.Of course, TSM does come at a hefty price... there is a lot of up front time required when setting it up. You need to know lots of very basic information about the hardware and software that you are going to use TSM with. This then allows for a lot of power in how you deal with that data though. It can manage thousands of terabytes of information storage on thousands of computer systems. It is very powerful.IBM Tivoli Storage Manager used to be called other things in the past...the best known being ADSM -- Adstar Distributed Storage Manager. The main mailing list in the TSM world is still called ADSM-L. Find out more info about it at www.adsm.org.This book is a guide to many of the TSM Internals that a system administrator would need to know. If you are going to be using ITSM/TSM/ADSM... then you should get this book. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Beet Queen (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"How many ways are there to hate this book? Let's get started.First, the characters are so feeble and unsympathetic I foundmyself not caring what happened to them. From hobosexual Karlto mediocre Mary, and oh yes, Dot. Dot is a not-so-gentlereminder that the characters in some novels should be spayedor neutered before they get a chance to randomly breed. Thereare 2 characters of interest (Russell and Fleur), but theycontribute about 3 pages to this monstrosity of a book.I had to read this monumental waste for a literature class. Inormally like to read, but this book nearly beat the readingbug right out of me. Even if I had not been required to readit, I might have finished it anyway in the expectation thatsomething interesting would (finally) happen. Bad news, folks:it never does. The same utter pointlessness continues right onthrough the last page.I don't want to keep you hanging by a thread here, so let me getright to the point: This book is awful."},{"Title":"The Beet Queen (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"On a cold spring morning in 1932, fourteen-year old Karl Adare and his eleven-year-old sister, Mary, arrive by freight train in Argus, North Dakota. Abandoned by their mother, they have come to look for their mother's sister, Aunt Fritzie, who runs the House of Meats, a butcher shop, with her husband. The two Adares lose each other. Karl is frightened by a dog and runs back to the boxcar, and Mary runs the other way, toward town. And so begins the forty year saga of a family, and a community.Through the years the family holds together through the tenacity of relationships, in a fierce and passionate drama, filled with Erdrich's dark humor. Changes sweep across their lives - birth, death, madness. Change also comes in the form of a growing sugar beet industry. Ms. Erdrich story chronicles Mary's life, as she puts down roots in Argus. She also keeps track of the tragic and sensitive dreamer, Karl, on his endless road journeys. He seem to compulsively flee emotional ties, and yet returns to Argus, again and again. At one point Karl says, \\"I give nothing, take nothing, mean nothing, hold nothing.\\" He struggles with connection - with the past, and with his family and community. Mary's astounding dreams and fantasies also play an incredible and surreal role in the novel.Themes of parenting and abandonment, jealousy, sexual obsession, and great love play out with passion in Ms. Erdrich's complex and believable characters, as does her portrayal of people's aggression and the self-destructive side of human nature. Her narrative is written with beauty, clarity and pure magic. This is not an easy book to read, nor is it always pleasant. It is, however, well worth the effort.Like many of her characters, Ms. Erdrich has a foot in two worlds. She grew up in Wahpeton, North Dakota, near the Bureau of Indian Affairs school where both her mother, of French-Ojibwe descent, and her father, of German descent, taught. She writes movingly about Native Americans \\"whose nobility resides in their ability to make their lives work.\\""},{"Title":"The Beet Queen (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I picked up this book at a second hand store. It had a dedication in the inside cover. It had been a gift for Mother's Day, and it read: &quot;To the Queen of the house, because she can't be Beet!&quot;.Erdrich has the special touch to make surreal situations so very believable. I love the parallel drawn with the plane rides, how in one case it is a beautiful woman running away from responsibility, and on the other it is a not-so-graceful woman running away from scorn. The birthday party scene is one of the most hilarious that come to mind, with the cake spinning out of control and Mary still singing Happy Birthday to You, while the guests are showered in frosting. And Mary's fall in the ice and the revered imprint of her face... How surreal can this book get?!?!In my opinion, it makes sense to read this book first, followed by Love Medicine (93), followed by Tracks (89).I first learned of Erdrich in some anthology, where i read her short story Fleur (now, that's a scary character, who appears in all three books!)"},{"Title":"The Beet Queen (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Louise Erdrich once said that her novels fell \\"together like a quilt, a crazy quilt,\\", and The Beet Queen is no exception. The author has constructed a powerful novel out of many voices and individual stories. The novel begins in 1932, with young Mary and Karl Adare getting off a train in Argus, North Dakota by themselves. A moment of fear sends Karl running back to the train, and Mary in the other direction, towards her aunt's house. This division between them sends them on different paths. Mary grows up as the despised cousin of lovely Sita, the foster daughter of Pete and Fritzie who own a butcher shop. Karl is eventually sent back to Minnesota to grow up in a Catholic children's home. The people who know them - Sita, Celestine, the Chamber of Commerce president Wallace Pfef, and finally Dot, the Beet Queen of the title - add their voices to weave a story that goes beyond Karl and Mary to include the entire town of Argus. Spanning forty years, the novel encompasses changes not only within the characters but in the town and the times in general.Erdrich's characterizations are complex and heartfelt, especially since the multiple points-of-view allow us to see the characters from both inside and out. When characters describe the same incident from different perspectives, we get a deep understanding of what is at stake for each.The Beet Queen is one of Erdrich's finest novels. Fans of Erdrich's will recognize some of the characters that appeared in the earlier Love Medicine and in her later books, but you don't need to be familiar with the author's work to become engrossed in this one. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Beet Queen (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"From the mesmerizing first chapter I was hooked.

I just wanted to keep reading and reading to find out what would happen with each of them next.Each chapter has its own narrator and we often learn of an event from more than one perspective.

I was so disappointed in this novel. It did not meet my expectations. I expected the wise and wonderful writing I encountered in The Master Butcher's Singing Club, but was given plot twists that were just plain silly. The author ruined her opporunity to say something profound with Sita's death by throwing in dead body humor a la \\"Weekend at Bernie's.\\" Although for the most part I found her characters compelling, I felt like this book had very little to say.

The characters are flat and emotionless, with minimal dialogue. I think the author must have written a bunch of absurd plot twists on bits of paper and pulled them out of a jar as she was writing. A mother abandons her children by jumping on a stunt plane at a fair. Two orphans get off a train, the boy sticks his face in a bush, gets attacked by a dog, jumps back on the train and doesn't see his sister for 20 years. The sister wakes up with her hands glowing blue. A guy is having a conversation, the suddenly starts jumping on the bed, flips off and breaks his back. Readers that think the metaphors are deep and meaningful are simply afraid to admit that they just DON'T MAKE ANY SENSE! Why is it so hard to find a simple, entertaining bit of fiction these days!"},{"Title":"The Beet Queen (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I have mixed feelings about this book. It probably arises from the fact that I had to read and do a report on it for a college course.It is not my kind of novel, but I give it a slightly passing mark anyway."},{"Title":"The Beet Queen (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"So many things happen to the characters (which are about twelve or so of them), it's hard to keep track and think back of who relates to whom. The beginning is exciting because so many things happen, but then near the end, it gets boring because so many outragous things are happening and they do not become believeable or shocking anymore (like Sita dying in her garden and Russell dying on the float in the parade). It becomes so depressing at the end how everyone is sick, dying, dependent or crazy. I do not understand the deep symbolism in this book and sometimes I couldn't even tell if something was really happening or the writer was trying to trick me.It's ok, nothing spectacular, interesting read."},{"Title":"The Beet Queen (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I found this novel to be enjoyable to read, with unexpected events occuring around every corner. The dark humor fits in well with the story line and it keeps the reader motivated. While the ending appears to leave the reader hanging with respect to some characters, it really makes you think about what the reason for that is. Why don't we know what happens to Jude? Maybe it is because Jude is the only character in the novel who has his needs met -- all the other characters endure a life long struggle for one need or another. The author uses strong symbolism which can be cryptic, yet challenging. It's definitely worth the read."},{"Title":"The Beet Queen (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"Erdrich has that special touch, to make surreal situations so very believable. I love the parallel drawn with the plane rides, how in one case it is a beautiful woman running away from responsibility, and on the other it is a not-so-graceful woman running away from scorn.

Nobody is perfect here, motives are always mixed and all actions have unintended consequences. The writing is strong and quirky, full of painfully hilarious situations. The characters are distinct and memorable, each acting out of his or her inescapable logic. This book makes me want to read the author's previous novel, Love Medicine."},{"Title":"The Beet Queen (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I bought this book for $1 at a book sale. At first, I enjoyed it. I have read Louise Erdrich's \\"Love Medicine\\" years ago in a literature class and, from what I remember, I enjoyed it for the most part. However, there was a lot of symbolism and mysticism which made that book a little difficult to read. This one had a lot of both of those elements as well. But this book became a nightmare after maybe 100 pages. The stories are very fragmented and numerous. There were too many characters and narrators, too much unfinished business, and to me, pretty much all of the characters were unlovable. I respected the aunt and uncle of Sita, but thy were whisked out of the book much too soon. I felt sorry for Mary & Karl as children, at first, being abandoned by their mother, but as they grew up, they became totally unlovable and annoying. Even Celestine became a character I didn't respect because of the brat she raised. I did not like the way Sita's death occurred. It was just bizarre & annoying to me. Every major character in this book had a bleak and depressing progression of their life. I would never read this book again and unfortunately, after reading this one, I will probably never read any more books by this author, even though I know that she is a highly respected and talented author. However, her style of writing is just not for me. I plan to donate this book to a library an I'm not even sure I can finish the final 30 pages. Ugh! If you are a fan of hers, or enjoy books heavy on symbolism, and many unanswered questions, you may like this book. I did not."},{"Title":"The Beet Queen (G K Hall Large Print Book Series)","review":"I am a fan of this author after reading The Master Butcher's Singing Club and Love Medicine- both of which I highly recommend.

None really jump off the page or do anything out of this world. They're all dysfunctional. One thing I am sure...these kind of books are not my cup of tea.

Hewitt was a lecturer at Union Theological Seminary, and Suzanne R. Hiatt was a faculty member of the Episcopal Consortium for Theological Education.This 1973 book is not simply an examination of the question of the ordination of women in the church, but is a very broad survey, including chapters such as The Will of God and Working Women; Sex and Religion; Subordination; Jesus and the Twelve; Anglicanism as the 'Bridge Church'; Roman Catholics and the Ordination of Women; The Oversupply of Clergy(!); The Force of the 'Yes, But' Arguments, etc.They admit that the view that priesthood is 'not just another profession' is a \\"widely held view among Christians.\\" (Pg. 24) They then discuss the deep-seated reverence for male priests as \\"keepers of the mysteries,\\" nostalgia for the Victorian church, and adherence to patriarchy as believed to be the \\"proper way to organize society.\\" (Pg. 25)They note that while the Victorian attitude toward women is \\"virtually dead\\" in society, \\"there are those in the church who strive to preserve it.\\" (Pg. 30)Later, they make the observation that a woman wearing vestments resembles \\"more what women wear than they do the garb of men,\\" and that when a woman breaks bread and serves the chalice containing wine, \\"we suddenly recognize that she has served a meal and done the dishes, just as women do at home.\\" Even hearing confession leads us to recognize that \\"women are the listeners and conforters at home, too.\\" (Pg. 43)In regard to the objection based on \\"masculine biblical imagery,\\" they point out that \\"Christians must assert that God cannot be comprehended and classified by the language with which we speak of him.\\" (Pg. 59)Although the matter has long since been settled within the Episcopalian church and many other Protestant denominations, the issues discussed herein are still of considerable relevance to Catholic and evangelical discussions about the ordination of women."},{"Title":"The 5 Minute Veterinary Consult: Canine and Feline","review":"Tilley's 5 -Minute Veterinary Consult book has been an extremely valuable asset to my library. When the CD-Rom came out, it was even more useful in that immediate and current information can be retrieved much faster than picking up a book. It is faster since topics related to a case can be searched for and reviewed with a touch of your mouse. This information can be quickly printed and given to clients to further understand their pets diagnosed condition. This printed information alone is priceless! A client that has something in hand and can follow and confirm their veterinarian's diagnosis and treatment, helps establish the trust a client needs to have in their pets doctor.I reach for my 5- Minute Vet Consult CD-rom more than any other resource in my library. It is very accurate and has a surprising amount of detail to assist in the diagnosis, treatment and prognosis of each topic. The drug search is a very helpful formulary for those quick reference needs. The most recent CD has a good number of cytology and radiographic images attached to the topics. These can be enlarged to see more closely the great detail.In my opinion the 5-Minute Veterinary Consult CD-Rom was one of the best reference investments for my practice.

Derex's subjects fill parts of his camera frame in ways which trained designers admire; the forms enhance the communication by their basic shapes. &quot;Expressive&quot; individuals reveal themselves &quot;emotionally&quot; during the exposure. Spontaneity, combined with &quot;expert lighting&quot; and experienced encouragement of the photographer, create images which will outlive us all. This book's wording is pithy, direct and clear in message. I felt present in the studio during the shoot at times.

There are very few pictures in this book that are even in focus. I can tolerate soft focus but these are just bad. There was one image in the book that was o.k. and the photographer even said it was not planned, he just tripped the shutter as the subjects were playing around. The shots that he staged and set up are just terrible. I will stick with getting information and inspiration from &quot;Hollywood Portraits: Classic Shots and How to Take Them&quot; by Roger Hicks and Christopher Nisperos and also &quot;Fine Art Children's Photography: Techniques and Images in Black &amp; White&quot; by Doris Carol Doyle.

They sing songs for local towns people for mere pennies, and eat and sleep in the barns of the local farmers. He was not always a beggar boy. His parents died, and living with the local pastor was just too much on him, so he ran away.Krabat is plagued by dreams of a voice, telling him to come to the mill in the Kosel of Fen, although he knows not where this is. He ignores it for the better of two days, and on the third day he decides he must go to this mill. On arriving at the mill he is met by the Miller, he informs Krabat that he will be his apprentice, and gives him room and board. He awakes in the middle of the night to eleven ghostly faces, claiming they are the Miller's journeymen, and for not to fear because they will not harm him.It is not long before Krabat realizes that things are very strange here at the mill in the Kosel of Fen, and he's determined to find out what is going on. It is not right for young men to be able to do magic, although it is quite helpful at times, and he must know everything that is happening, and why.This was yet another book that was dropped into my hands by a friend from work. He insisted that it was an excellent book, and that I just \\"had to read it\\". I picked it up not even two days ago, and started digging into it. I soon realized, that yes, it was good. I enjoyed the aspect of magic from this book, although there was quite a lot of repetition, and that began to grow annoying for me. The book is set into three parts, each being what goes on in Krabat's three years of being at the Mill. Each part was basically the same, although characters changed, and some events were a little different, or just explained more. I had to give this book a 3 for rating, because yes, I did like it, but it's not something I could say I loved."},{"Title":"The satanic mill","review":"Krabat follows his dreams to a mill.After some time at the mill he tries to escape."},{"Title":"The satanic mill","review":"I read this years ago, as a child and in Russian, and I still remember the feeling of genuine dread (and triumph) this story inspired. Even as I think of it now, I feel the hair rise on the back of my neck. The evil in the book does not chase after you--it waits for you to come to it, and invariably, you do. In that sense, the title THE SATANIC MILL is unfortunate--you expect the mill to be Satanic; in Russian translation, the book was called simply KRABAT (the main character's name), and you did not quite know what to expect.The story begins as a young boy named Krabat, somewhere around present-day Eastern parts of Germany, falls asleep wandering, and dreams of ravens crowing. Their message is for him to go to the mill some miles away, to sign up as an apprentice. Which he does, of course, and soon learns that it is no regular mill. (Nor is it quite Satanic, actually--for it is not Satan who runs it). He may stay, or he may go; if he goes, he will learn magic from the Miller himself. Of course, he stays--and becomes one of the apprentices, who turn, at their Master's command, into black ravens. All peachy so far--until the cleverest (and the kindest) of all the apprentices dies an unnatural death--but not before having made his own coffin and dug his own grave.In the (happy) end, of course, Krabat will have to choose between love and good and fairness--and magic. Between being a regular boy and a powerful Miller himself; but such a choice will not come to him easily--and he will have to fight for his life, and that of his love.My favorite characters in the book were the idiot Yuro and the Great Pumphut, who gives the Miller a run for his money. The story is very creepy (or I think it would be for a 13-14 year old; I know it was for me), poignant and beautiful."},{"Title":"The satanic mill","review":"It is a shame that this book is out of print... find a copy if you can! Although it contains very little gore or violence, it is one of the creepiest books I have ever read. It is an excellent account of the manner in which evil attracts and then enslaves the will. Krabat learns to use extraordinary power at the mill, yes, but only at the price of enslaving his being to the evil miller. The manner in which the miller dominates the wills of his workmen is truly horrifying. Since magic is ultimately about power and domination, it can only be defeated by its opposite, self-giving love. Krabat finds this salvation in the humility of a village girl.This book is the alternative to Harry Potter that I have been looking for as reading material for my kids. It is surely creepy, but not too creepy for 12 year olds and up. The Potter books treat magic and evil as something trivial that can be toyed with impunity. The Potter kids find they can defeat the most horrifying evils with a few magic tricks and a little cleverness and courage. Evil deserves more respect than that, because it is far more dangerous and powerful, working primarily through corruption of the will. Preussler is a master at depicting this process, with the miller breaking the wills of his apprentices through pointless work. Eventually, the men are so dominated that they acquiece in their own deaths, literally digging their own graves.This is a wonderful book. It leaves the reader with a lasting impression of the dangerousness and horror of evil, as well as the power and joy of agape - self-giving love."},{"Title":"The satanic mill","review":"I first read this book when I was a kid, and have re-read it several times since. I gave it to my husband as a gift, and although usually he is not too thrilled with the books I pick, he loved this one.Krabat, the protagonist, is a young orphan who starts working as an apprentice at a mill where black magic and witchcraft are at work. The miller has made a deal with the devil, and each year one of the apprentices has to be sacrificed by the miller to keep his side of the deal. Some of Krabat's friends end up dead. Krabat, however, finds salvation through his love, a singer from the nearby village. She is able to rescue him from certain death and put an end to satan's reign, even when the miller casts an evil spell, because her love for Krabat is stronger than witchcraft.Otfried Preussler accomplished a miracle with this book: It has a captivating storyline which has the power to keep even adults fascinated, while at the same time the book sends a strong ethical and moral message about temptations and the power of love.There aren't too many children's books out there which can bridge the gap between adult readers and children. This one does. And it does it exceptionally well."},{"Title":"The satanic mill","review":"I read this book as a child about 25 years ago, and it seems as if it was just yesterday. I read the German version which is simply titled 'Krabat'. I think the English title might prevent people from buying it, and that's a real shame. This is a very special story that I look forward to sharing with my children."},{"Title":"The satanic mill","review":"The Satanic Mill by Otfried Preussler is a great book to read. It is about a begger boy called Krabat who gets called to a mill in a dream. The mill is also a Black School. He met a female singer, and they both fell in love. Krabat wanted to leave the mill, but to do that the Singer (the book did not give her name) had to pick him out while he and all the other miller's men were in the form of ravens.This book is very creepy, mysrerious, and unpredictable which, I think, is great. There are several things to focus on, so it doesn't get boring. It's very nervewracking, too. All in all, it is one of the best books I have ever read. I give it a five-star rating."},{"Title":"The satanic mill","review":"I bought this book in 1974 for 30p, purely because of the title. At the tender age of 11 I loved it.

They presented witty and lucid summaries of their books, Lanham focusing on revising at the sentence level and Williams on paragraphs. Although their books have gone through several editions since, the core concepts remain the same. Both self-teaching books are on my amazon Listmania's list \\"Expository Writing: Top Ten Books.\\"In the preface to \\"Revising Prose (5th edition)\\" Lanham notes: \\"Writing may have been invented to keep bureaucratic accounts....As the world has become bureaucratized, so has its language....Revising Prose was written as a supplementary text for any course that requires writing. Because it addresses a single discrete style, \\"Revising Prose\\" can be rule-based to a degree that prose analysis rarely permits. This set of rules -- the Paramedic Method --in turn allows the book to be self-teaching.\\"In each of the five editions of \\"Revising Prose,\\" Lanham added fresh examples and exercises to its core content: the Paramedic Method comprising eight steps as follows.1. Circle the prepositions;2. Circle the \\"is\\" forms;3. Find the action;4. Put this action in a simple (not compound) active verb;5. Start fast - no slow windups;6. Read the passage aloud with emphasis and feeling;7. Write out each sentence on a blank screen or sheet of paper and mark off its basic rhythmic units with a \\"/\\";8. Mark off sentence length with a \\"/.\\"Basically, Lanham's Paramedic Method advises you to delete prepositional phrases and \\"is\\" forms and replace them with active verbs.Below are four brief examples and a test-yourself exercise from the book.Original sentence: \\"Physical satisfaction is the most obvious of the consequences of premarital sex.\\"Revision: \\"Premarital sex satisfies!Obviously!\\" (page 3).Instead of 12 words, 4. Lanham labels this achieved concision as the \\"Lard Factor.\\" It's computed as the number of words in the original sentence minus the number of words in the revised sentence, divided by the original number of words. Here, the Lard Factor is: 12 minus 4, divided by 12 equals 0.66 or 66 percent.Original sentence: \\"Perception is the process of extracting information from stimulation emanating from objects, places, and events in the world around us.\\"Revision: \\"Perception extracts information from the outside world\\" (page 8).Instead of 21 words, 7. The original sentence has five prepositions, the revision just one -- preposition deletion ratio of 5 to 1. Lard Factor computes to 66 percent.Original: \\"In light of the pervasive problem of overcrowding at UC Lone Pine, providing another coffee house on campus would offer the university's growing population some kind of compensatory convenience.\\"Revision: \\"Overcrowded UC Lone Pine needs another coffee house\\" (page 70).Lard Factor: 75 percentOriginal: \\"Hypertext was invented to facilitate the process of navigating through a presentation of interrelated topics.\\" Revision: \\"Hypertext was invented to navigate through interrelated topics\\" (page 72).Lard Factor: 55 percentIn this complete book, Lanham provides 35 exercises for the readers to try on their own. Let's pick one at random.Exercise 14: Original: \\"The manner in which behavior first shown in a conflict situation may become fixed so that it persists after the conflict has passed is then discussed\\" (page 154).My revision: Next, discussion proceeds to behavior persistence after conflict.Instead of 26 words, 8.Lard Factor: 70 percent.If the original sentence comes from one or more authors, I'd revise it: Next, I/we discuss behavior persistence after conflict.Lard Factor: 73 percent.or: Next, I/we discuss post-conflict behavior persistence.Lard Factor: 80 percent.Try it. You'd probably do better than my quick efforts.In \\"Revising Prose,\\" his witty and blessedly brief book, Lanham gifts a five-star jewel to all expository writers.[Addendum: Richard Lanham's also appears in a less expensive versionLongman Guide to Revising Prosethat reprints the 134-page main text. The excluded 30 pages comprise a brief glossary of grammatical terms and 35 exercises for the reader. Since the 35 exercises in the complete book do not present the author's solutions anyway, I suggest an easy procedure to make either version self-teaching as follows.First, read the book through -- it won't take long; it's slim.Second, note down on an index card each example of the flabby sentences in the main text that includes the author's solution.Third, do each of these examples on your own and compare your solution with the author's.(For my sample solution to one of the 35 exercises without the author's solution, take a look near the end of this review of the complete book.)]"},{"Title":"Revising Prose","review":"Take a deep breath, ignore the hefty price tag, and click Add to Cart. Lanham does a fantastic job providing simple techniques that allow anyone from the the casual writer to the technical writer streamline their prose to create clearer and more powerful sentences, paragraphs, and documents. As an English major, this book was by far the most helpful book I read to improve my writing."},{"Title":"Revising Prose","review":"I first read this book in 1980 as a graduate student and it changed the way I write. I still remember the shock I felt then at learning that academic writing did not have to be tedious, wordy and stuffy. Everybody to whom I've given this book (back before it became so expensive)has also found that it radically changed their writing for the better."},{"Title":"Revising Prose","review":"Professor Lanham correctly finds the problem with the Official Style people pick up as they go through school and their jobs. They write noun-heavy, passive sentences that pile up prepositional phrases on each other. Having diagnosed the problem, though, his Paramedic Method for solving it worships at the altar of his Lard Factor, the ratio of his revised sentence to the original sentence length. Since he only deals at the sentence level, he rewrites each gargantuan sentence into exactly one smaller sentence, and this is where he goes wrong and often loses the meaning of the original sentence.For instance, he takes this sentence:Pelicans may also be vulnerable to direct oiling, but the lack of mortality data despite numerous spills in areas frequented by the species suggests that it practices avoidance.And turns it into:Pelicans seem to avoid oil spills by avoiding the oil.Even by his own method, this sentence is far too long. It could just be:Pelicans seem to avoid oil spills.But, he goes on to ask immediately after \\"Have I left out anything essential?\\" He at least asks the question, but he doesn't answer it. This is where he fails. A good reviser retains meaning and has to ask himself what the original sentence actually asserts. Lanham is distracted by turning one sentence into one shorter sentence that his Paramedic Method doesn't stop to consider if one sentence should turn into two or more sentences. Assertions, the very reason we communicate, should be the priority.In the Pelican example, there are several assertions:* There is no mortality data* There are numerous oil spills in the area* Someone thinks pelicans might be vulnerable to direct oiling (as opposed to shipping?)* The oil doesn't seem to affect pelicans* Someone (who?) guesses the pelicans just avoid the oilIn Lanham's revision, he only conveys the last assertion, which is not only the least interesting one, but the least supported one. Most of the original sentence is about someone's conjecture about the problem and its effect. The qualifications are necessary to let the reader judge the information correctly. The revision removes that completely. A better, but longer, revision might be:We think pelicans are vulnerable to oil spills, but we haven't found many dead pelicans among the numerous oil spills. Maybe they avoid the spills.I find the proper analysis also lacking from his discussion of the active voice, where he might use an active verb but doesn't choose the right actor. That sentence is not about pelicans. It's about someone drawing conclusions about pelicans. Even in Lanham's own writing, the passive voice is common and misguided.He's quite proud of \\"skotison\\", the word he uses to describe inflated prose, and uses an example of Alexander Pope's translation of a poem into plain english. Pope's satire isn't the basis for an editorial philosophy though, as it loses almost all intended meaning just as Lanham's pelican example does. Poems don't exist to codify a series of actions. Instead, they try to describe perception and feeling, using imagery as best it can. Simply saying \\"shut the door\\" does not do that. It's cold, sterile, and utterly boring.As such, if you are not a writer or an editor, this is a decent enough book to start your revisioning education for your own material. However, it's not a good enough guide to become even a decent editor. There's too much that the Paramedic Method ignores."},{"Title":"Revising Prose","review":"This slim writing guide by Prof. Lanham is a must have for anyone in the writing field, the business world or the government.In under 150 pages, he attacks the &quot;Little engine that couldn't,&quot; &quot;is,&quot; &amp; &quot;to be,&quot; verbs, peoples' over use of prepositional phrases and the official dialoug.&quot;Revising Prose,&quot; uses strong verbs to get the Lanham's points across. HE breaks down his style and shows the reader how to use his &quot;Paramedic Method,&quot; of reviewing and editing.To hold his tradition in mind this review shall be short and to the point: students, politicians and the corporate world NEED this book to make themselves heard. Easy to follow and well written."},{"Title":"Revising Prose","review":"One of the most informative and entertaining books I've ever read. This book teaches concise writing methods.

Starting from analysis and reconstruction using small number of rules, progressing to the philosophical question of why you should revise prose, this book remains interesting after multiple readings. I can't speak hightly enough of it. A true eye opener."},{"Title":"Revising Prose","review":"If you read this book, you will discover how to recognise what is wrong with bad writing, and how to transform it into good writing.Having read this book, I can recall books I have read in the past which used tedious stuffy prose, and convert it mentally into better language. Good prose has an operator, an action, and an object. It does not have passive verbs such as 'is.' If you take the is out and replace with a more active verb, your writing will glitter and glow.Winston Churchill said: 'We shall fight on the beaches, we shall fight on the shores.' Operator we. Action fight. Object beaches.He did not say: 'Hostilities shall be commenced on the coastal perimeter.' Unspecified operator, action, and object.In addition, you can learn much more than this, the academic style has become somewhat too popular, although there may be contexts in which it is appropriate, but if you wish to polish up your prose, and make it vastly more dynamic, you can do this in a matter of hours with this book, and eliminate a lifetime of passive noun styles.Other lessons include using 'is' less, the less you use passive verbs like is, the more powerful, and attention grabbing your prose will become.If you're like me, it will change your whole understanding of writing style, an enable you to make your point clearly, briefly and succinctly, in about half the words you normally use. More active prose leads to a more active and clearer mind.Here on Amazon due to a searching glitch you may come upon an expensive version of this book. You can find a version by the same author, same publisher #Longman#, almost the same title, and exactly the same book for a fraction of the price.Longman Guide to Revising Prose: A Quick and Easy Method for Turning Good Writing into Great Writing. I wonder if you found this helpful.I recommendAnalyzing Proseby the same author, if you can get it at a reasonable price. Most of all, I recommend you check outShakespeare's Wordcraft #Softcover#which explores the language patterns of Shakespeare."},{"Title":"Revising Prose","review":"I have the second edition (1987) and it cost me all of $2 on a secondhand stall. I'm sure the current $38 pricing is from some idea of marketing it as a school textbook to be purchased in bulk...an interesting sidelight on the way publishers see the schoolbook market...or the desperate need of corporations to get remedial aid for the illiterate college grads they have to hire. But, pricing aside, it is in many ways an amazing book.Many guides to writing English will tell you, in a general way, to avoid unnecessary complication, use active rather than passive verbs, and so forth. Lanham goes beyond this by really digging into the components of a sentence and the way they may be linked together by essentially useless prepositions and the feeble \\"is.\\". The \\"Paramedic Method\\" brute force approach to rephrasing is a breath of fresh air. It deals with what I've seen defined as \\"Valueless Complexity.\\" (The topic was business processes, not language, but the term applies nicely.)Also, I liked Lanham's philosophical ruminations on the \\"Official Voice\\" and why indeed it exists. Some sharp analysis there on our interactions as social beings, and the role played by language. Another plus: the excellent and concise summary of English grammar in the Appendix. And another: the importance of the the SOUND of prose.Now, that said, I have a few reservations (the 4-star rationale: really 4 1/2!):Sometimes his rebuilding of a complex piece does indeed change the author's original thought. Well, the new thought may or may not be better than the old thought, but we're going beyond \\"revising prose\\" here.In 1987 he was just beginning to come to terms with the electronic word processor. It led him into some rather unsuccessful (to me) ideas about using oddball typefaces to help understand sentence structure. Would be interesting to know what the current editions have made of all that.Then, if this error is repeated in later editions - for shame! He lambastes some writer for correctly using the word \\"supersedes\\" and thinks it has a \\"c\\" in it! An English professor yet! Obviously not much background in Latin and the history of word derivations.And finally, he's happy with \\"Who's kicking who\\" versus \\"Who's kicking whom.\\" Sorry, Richard, I don't buy it. It doesn't sound more natural to me - it grates like squeaky chalk.But a heck of an interesting book."},{"Title":"Revising Prose","review":"In brief: this book is amazing. Lanham will teach you to write with precision and clarity; and he will help you with revising and self-expression. Academics must read this book - and especially graduate students. Buy this book and internalize the 'paramedic method'. Take a deep breath, and read your thesis or dissertation with red pencil in hand. Get ready for a shock. But as you dissect your prose, you will improve as a writer. Immensely. I swear it."},{"Title":"Revising Prose","review":"I have the 2nd Edition with the $8.00 price tag still stuck on it. 20 years ago, this was a required text for Technical Writing. Now I'm writing my first technical book, and picked it up the other day. What a shock! It's still relevant, quick, funny, and very inspiring. How many college texts hold up that well?Here's the thing. Revising Prose practices what it preaches. It shows how to mercilessly cut filler, sharpen your opinion, and ultimately to say what you really want to say. That it does this in much, much less than the usual 300 pages shows that it works pretty darn well.Let's face it. You pay much more for a small diamond than a big piece of cubic zirconium. This is a true diamond of a book."},{"Title":"Revising Prose","review":"I first encountered Professor Lanham's book in 1980 when I was a freshman at UCLA. It introduced me to \\"active versus passive voice,\\" an issue that stalks many people's prose. Years later, after writing professionally, returning to college, and becoming a public relations/marketing professional, I rediscovered the book. I found myself even more appreciative of Professor Lanham's \\"Paramedic Method.\\" I quoted the professor and his method in an article I wrote for BtoB magazine:[...]This is THE book on effective writing. Buy it and refer to it often."},{"Title":"Revising Prose","review":"I like this author and believe he is right about writing. Also, most Yale undergrad students use him."},{"Title":"Revising Prose","review":"I've been using Lanham's \\"Revising Prose\\" video (now available on DVD) in my university writing classes for years--it's a bit clunky, but entertaining and lucid. In a nutshell, it provides a concise, powerful method for evaluating and improving sentence clarity and structure, thereby remedying the \\"official style\\" (convoluted and murky sentences with passive-voice constructions and strings of prepositional phrases). The book is essentially an extended and supplemented explanation of the revision strategy Lanham calls (in both his book and DVD) the 'Paramedic Method,' which entails the following 8 steps:1. Identify the prepositions in a sentence, then eliminate as many as possible by replacing them with possessives, by avoiding redundancy, etc.2. identify the passive verbs3. Find the expressed or implied action4. Restate the action with an active verb5. Rewrite the sentence with a fast start, avoiding mindless introductions6. Read the sentence aloud with emphasis and feeling7. Mark off the sentence's basic rhythmic units, eliminating \\"laundry list\\" formulations and repeated sentence patterns8. Count the words in the sentence and try to reduce them by halfThe weakness of \\"Revising Prose\\" is a direct consequence of its strength--it is the very essence of simplicity. Its eight steps are easy to apply and easy to remember. It also limits itself to sentence revision, rather than paragraph or text revision. In fact, \\"Revising Prose\\" is more a concision rubric than a style handbook. Hence, it provides neither the detail nor the scope of books like Joseph Williams' \\"Style: A Lesson in Clarity and Grace\\" (which I highly recommend, by the way). Nevertheless, since Lanham's book performs its chosen task superbly, it constitutes a fine addition to any library of writing improvement materials and will no doubt prove helpful to any writer. My only reason for downgrading the rating from 5 to 4 stars is the ridiculous price, which is unfortunately typical of Longman titles."},{"Title":"Revising Prose","review":"I got clear through high school, college, and grad school without finding the process Richard Lanham lays out so concisely in this book. I was always told that revising meant planting my posterior in a chair and just muscling through, and I told my students that, too. Imagine my shock to find that a simple eight-point process for revising most kinds of prose has existed, in black and white, for over thirty years.Lanham's revision structure dismantles sentences, removing what he calls the \\"Lard Factor,\\" leaving prose that is active, streamlined, and comprehensible to general readers. I was initially bothered that Lanham's system favors sentences over concepts, until I saw that repairing damaged sentences exposed weak ideas. This process turns flabby, uninspired prose into something people would actually want to read.Moreover, Lanham proves revision important beyond academia. Business, legal, and other official writing is often overstuffed and weak, frequently concealing flaccid thinking. Lanham shows how excising the crap reveals the real heart of the message, the heart writers often conceal.Lanham occasionally wanders off the ranch. His asides expound libertarian politics incidental to writing, afflicted with rah-rah boosterism that infects his chapter on Electronic Prose. A devotee of new tech, Lanham gets excited about the tools electronic writing makes available. But anyone who's sat through most PowerPoint lectures or celebrity Twitter feeds knows that ability to say things in new ways doesn't give people something worthwhile to say.These problems aside, Lanham's uncomplicated but potentially revolutionary system offers hope to writing students and teachers, business writers, lawyers, and anyone else who needs to revise their work. It also offers a glimmer of hope that language as a weapon of obscurity can be beaten. I'd like to give this book to every teacher in America."},{"Title":"Revising Prose","review":"The book explains a simple method to analyze and rewrite a sentence. The first fifty pages felt redundant, but slowly changed my view of writing. I now don't look at copy the way I used to. I'm using the method to write this review.

I do not mean what we are taught in School, but how to write in the business world which is very different for what we are feed in School.

Even though thisfamily lived thousands and thousands of years ago, they weren't so different from us. In fact, what I particularly liked about this book is that the main characters, while still ape-men, are talking and thinking like modern people. Ernest's father and his uncle keep arguing how &quot;Modern Technology&quot; (i.e., fire) is dangerous, and how maybe they should go back to the trees. Despite that, they are STILL ape-men: when Ernest's brother finds a wife, Ernest keeps thinking how amazingly fat she is - meaning, truly gorgeous!Even though this book was very humoristic, it was also intellectually stimulating. It offered some very interesting points about how many things which are the cornerstones of human life started.

These experiments put Ernest and his brothers in all kinds of interesting predicaments (which, frankly, beats beating flints all day long) as they hurry to advance their horde out of the Pleistocene era into a new and glorious future.This is not a slap-stick funny book, it is an intellectually funny book that also has hilarious moments. I had to go for the dictionary a few times, which was funny in and of itself--getting the dictionary to look up a big word that some caveman is using. It's also an allegory of sorts, a stop and think kind of book. Even while I was laughing my head off about Uncle Vanya warning Father about the dangers of progress and telling him to go back to the trees, I could. . . well, I could see both sides--hear myself in both sides actually. I've never read a book like it, quite frankly. I picked it up because Terry Pratchett mentioned it as his all time favorite book and I can see the attraction. It's one I will have to read again, digest, laugh and think over some more.Lewis' writing is wonderful; droll, dry wit and amazingly detailed description sandwiched in with just darn good writing. His pictures of family life are so real that I dare say he's warped any historical notions I may have had of the Pleistocene era. Overall, this is just a masterful book, but I recognize that I may not be for everyone because it's a book whose humor is not just laid out for you--you have to think a little too."},{"Title":"The Evolution Man or, How I Ate My Father","review":"This is a gem of a book, but it's a rarified thing. We live today in a world of fiction that has been heavily influenced by movies and television. Today's fiction assumes we have no prior knowledge, and it spoon-feeds us everything we need for the purposes of getting through to the end. In the past, however, books were frequently written with the assumption of a great deal of external knowledge. A trivial example of this is the use of Latin tags: it assumes (i) the reader knows Latin, and (ii) the reader knows the entire work from which the tag is taken. A writer, using this device, can create ironic counterpoint. But of course it doesn't work at all if the reader doesn't know Latin and doesn't recognize the tag.Likewise with The Evolution Man. Unless you come to it with a great deal of external knowledge, much of it is just flat and not funny at all. This is a book full of bone-dry English wit, not in-your-face jokes. It was written by a highly educated writer for his own amusement and that of his friends, all of whom had equivalent knowledge to his own. The jokes, therefore, worked for this audience and continue to work for readers whose range of knowledge is equivalent. But for everyone else, \\"fugeddabahdit.\\"For those readers who do appreciate the quasi-Dickensian counterpoint between erudite language and physical squalor, the conceit of a sub-human worrying about his exact location in geological time and possessing a consciousness of the need always to evolve, always to think of the next big thing, this is a wonderfully funny book. It combines several critiques of then-current sociological and psychological dogma with a perceptive view of the different kinds of human motivation and the outcomes they predicate. It also shows clearly how technological progress is a slow and sequential thing: until you have fire you can't have hardened spear-tips; until you have hardened spear-tips you can't have arrows, and therefore bows. There's a ladder of necessary preconditions for any advance, and the author gently leads us up this ladder. By doing so, the book give us pause to consider the wretched condition of prehistoric hominids and prompts us to be profoundly grateful to all the nameless innovators stretched out across time whose creations enable us to live warm, secure and comfortable lives. And the book accomplishes all of this and more in a style that is a delight to read. We see Uncle Vanya railing against progress when his brother creates the domestic fire - and Vanya rails most often against this unnatural innovation when the nights are cold and damp. Likewise Vanya protests against the unnaturalness of cooking meat before eating it, and comes to protest repeatedly as his teeth fail him and his digestive system can no longer cope with the roots and tough vegitation that formerly constituted his natural diet. Points are made with subtle humor throughout the book, which is its main charm. Nothing is belaboured.But this is not a book for the casual reader, for whom it will largely be disappointing."},{"Title":"The Evolution Man or, How I Ate My Father","review":"This book is very easy to read and intoduces anthropology to the layman in a witty and light-hearted way.

It took me some pages to get into the spirit of the thing; so I would urge you to persist if the first sections do not make an impression on you. It has been pointed out at other reviews that there are similarities with the TV cartoon series The Flintstones as they deal with prehistoric humans with anachronistic elements. In the Flintstones the jokes often come from the anachronistic use of technology; in the book the development of the technology seems less anachronistic, if one accepts that all the new ideas (fire, exogamy, etc) were due to one man alone. The jokes come mainly from the way the characters talk; they seem to know all the right words for what is going on and the respective contemporary concepts about human evolution. It is interesting that both book and TV series came out at the same time. The book was first published in England in 1960 while the Flintstones first season started in September 1960.

To be precise it's a fun book though it never got me to laugh out loud or think that I might. It's an easy book, something that can be read through in an airline journey to make it more pleasant. It's a bit of a book that makes you want to nod in acknowledgment of human nature.But my main standard for four star is that it crosses my mind that I might want to reread it and I'd have to say not so much. In short I could recommend it as fun and light reading."},{"Title":"The Evolution Man or, How I Ate My Father","review":"This book was recommended to be by a French friend. It was as funny as he said it was. It points out the beginnings of human nature as man evolves and advances and some resist change.

And I've read the gamut of funny books, from those by Douglas Adams to Art Buchwald to Bill Bryson.Roy Lewis (re)creates a prehistoric tribe that has all the dry practicality of a mid-20th century American or English suburban family. In fact, that's essentially what they are; they just happen to live in a cave in the Pleistocene. The humor of Lewis' characters lies in the prescience he imbues in them: they are keenly aware they are evolving, and they'll do everything they can to do it right. Thus the laughs are in the modern parallels: the book was first published in 1960, just after a decade of the post-war, space-age optimism--tempered with a healthy dose of fear of the Red Menace--that flooded the United States and Europe. In short, Lewis' prehistoric family maintains the same \\"can-do, future's so bright\\" outlook that was found in much of the post-war 1950s West. Consider the opening lines:\\"When the winds blew strongly from the North, bringing an icy reminder that the great ice-cap was still advancing, we used to pile all our stores of brushwood and broken trees in front of the cave, make a really roaring fire, and tell ourselves that however far south it came this time, even in Africa, we could meet it and beat it.\\"The stone-age family is kept on track by the father, who is ever concerned with his brood's evolutionary progress and is always vigilant for any sign of regression. Upon seeing a child still crawling at age two, he yells: \\"We started walking upright back in the Miocene, and if you think I am going to tolerate the destruction of millions of years of progress...you are mistaken. Keep that child on his hind legs...\\"Of course, as the subtitle of the book indicates, even the most foresighted caveman will fail to make fire eventually. And then the next generation takes over. You can't stop progress. But you MUST read this book."},{"Title":"The Evolution Man or, How I Ate My Father","review":"First heard of this one on an NPR segment entitled \\"what to read instead of shooting yourself in the middle of winter.\\" It gets funnier with each re-reading.

It is not a thoughtful or researched commentary of society. It's purely a novel for the pleasure of the reader. I had never even heard of Barbara Cartland when I first came across the film version of this novel starring Helena Bonham Carter. That film, I must admit, was quite... well... dramatic. However, I enjoyed the basic storyline enough to try out the book. I'm glad I did.The novel begins with the innocent, yet honest, Selena learning that her father lost not only her beloved home in a poker game - but that he also wagered Selena in the game as well. And lost. That same night, Selena's father commits suicide leaving her without a home or father and \\"engaged\\" to a man she has never heard of, Lord Justin Vulcan. Upon meeting Selena, Justin makes no remarks upon their betrothal, merely takes Selena to his ancestral home, Mandrake. Like in the film, here the drama builds up quite a great deal, including smugglers, abductions, poisoning, murder, etc. In my own opinion, I feel like all of this drama worked much, much better in a novel than on film - maybe because you understand more of what's going on in various characters' minds.All in all, however, the love story between Selena and Justin melted my heart (Yes! I admit it!) and all that excessive drama, to me, couldn't distract from the main plot of the story - which was, of course, the love story. Cartland's style in this book reminded me a lot of Georgette Heyer - but with a bit less humor, maybe more akin to Heyer's Devil's Cub. And, if I think ANYTHING is like Georgette Heyer, it's definitely good."},{"Title":"A Hazard of Hearts","review":"This story surrounds a girl who becomes the property of a Lord, when she is lost in a dice game. This story has it all, an evil mother, a &quot;ghost&quot;-ly father, and the requisite love story. This book will not disappoint, I guarantee it."},{"Title":"A Hazard of Hearts","review":"I was prompted by the film based on this story to read the book. This story is better than other Cartland ones in that the plot is less formulaic and simplistic but with some twists.Serena Staverley's father, Sir Giles Staverley, was a compulsive gambler. One evening, he lost everything -- all his money, his house and even Serena's inheritance and herself to Lord Vulcan of Mandrake.Feeling despondent, he deliberately had himself killed in a duel. So Serena, now an orphan, was taken to Mandrake where she met a lot of people and adventures. Lord Vulcan intended to marry her off to an eligible suitor and did not count on falling in love with her himself.There was much action and excitement created by family secrets, intrigues, smugglers, secret passages and caves, blackmail, abduction, murder, sword fights, duel and romance...etcI must say that the book is tame compared with the movie which is much more colorful and engrossing in the beautiful settings of opulent stately mansions , splendid gardens and lush countryside. Helena Bonham-Carter( according to Barbara Cartland herself)is the ultimate virginal and innocent heroine Serena.She is so cute and lovely. Marcus Gilbert ,who plays Lord Vulcan, is handsome,urbane and charismatic.It is sweet to see the romance develop between the two protagonists.

After an extensive search of used bookseller I finally found it. Now, I have the DVD version of the TV movie. I enjoy re-reading this Barbara Cartland classic Regency romance book, then watching the DVD version.Though Barbara Cartland won't be every romance readers' cup of tea, she was a British romance writer who lived an interesting & vast life.Sadly, there were too few Regency romances made into TV original movies of Barbara Cartland's stories, featuring some legendary movie stars. They were expensive movies to make. What cameos & gems she shared with her romance lovers!"},{"Title":"A Hazard of Hearts","review":"I cut my romance-reading teeth on Barbara Cartland and that was wa-ay back when. So she has a special place in my heart and this book being my very first has a special place on my keeper shelf. I purchased it for re-reading.The characters- sweet Serena, tres outre Justin & his dashing friends, the mad Marchioness & her decadent set, the aristocratic dirty old man, the smugglers- and the setting of fabulous stately homes and glittering parties were all so finely limned that it captured a 10 year old's imagination, paving the way for later historicals, other romance genres and abiding Anglophilia.This is one of the earliest BCs which makes for great reading because these stories were written with a sort of earnestness and greater care lacking in later stories. These early Cartlands were followed by prolific output via Bantam books which were shorter stories though still fun. After Bantam...well, it seemed to me another writer has taken over the same name, the spirit was simply not there and the quality became assembly-line ho-hum goo.I always say that 60% of a book's appeal depends on its heroine, for me, that is. The thing about Barbara's heroines is that they are just too young, sweet and spirituelle for the 21st century. It doesn't help that heroines dialogue is overwhelmed with ...(dot, dot, dot & interminable breaks), something to be avoided in case of future reprints. But everything else in her stories is bang-on. The dialogue, vocabulary, phrasing is beautiful British English, I like her plots, adore her fascinating trivias about historical figures and events, her stately home descriptions are to-die-for, I love her masterful aristocratic heroes who in my mind's eye look either like Lord Granville Leveson-Gower or the Duke of Grafton. Barbara depicts that whole early 19th century world with admirable familiarity instead of mere book-source knowledge. The lovely bookcovers are in themselves highly collectible.I will read the early & Bantam Cartlands any day over numerous Regency authors of today. If one admires Barbara's works and is looking for a very similar author whose heroines have slightly more gumption wouldn't go amiss with Caroline Courtney's Regency romances.One last thing- Hazard was made into a movie starring a very young Helena Bonham Carter and the fact that it's a B-movie in no way affects its watchability."},{"Title":"The mathematical theory of relativity,","review":"I should take the first reviewer more seriously before buying this book. Since he received such a negative feedback, I thought - here we have another one who can't understand math. Well, there is not a single looking math equation in this book, all equations are gibberish. I'm quite familiar with General Relativity and have most of the essential books, and saw all kind of weird equations in my life, but have never seen equations like:O Afly 0X V y Ooxfjy O nx jand the rest is about the same. I feel awkward to give a single star (should get zero) to a great classic book by Sir Arthur Eddington, but it is not for the book, it is for the abuse of Amazon, or the publisher called - General Books. I think however that I understand the problem - there are two printouts; the other is by Cambridge University Press (four times more expensive), and its typesetting via Amazon's Look Inside looks fine. I bet that it worth five stars. So again, I'm referring to General Books edition, not to Eddington's book in general.(and I apologize for possible typos in my review; I've just received this book and I'm mad as hell seeing the abuse of a such an important work)."},{"Title":"Bright Eyes, Brown Skin (A Feeling Good Book) (A Feeling Good Book)","review":"A charming foursome, Alexa, Ethan, Jordan, and Olivia enjoy a day in kindergarten.

Honestly, it took me years and years to get through it. I even had to buy a 2nd copy, because I kept getting frustrated and throwing the first copy across the room until it was destroyed. So yes, this book requires a substantial effort to read.But the payback!! I've gotten more return on investment from this book than from any other book I've ever read. If you dilligently read and master this book, you will be able to analyze and solve problems your collegues just can't.The basic idea behind Kolmogorov complexity is straighforward: a good measure of the complexity of an object is the length of the shortest computer program which will construct that object. From this basic idea an amazing variety of insights and powerful techniques have been developed, and this book is quite comprehensive in cataloging and explaining them.For computer scientists and working programmers, probably the most useful result of Kolmogorov complexity would be the \\"Incompressibility Method\\", which is a powerful technique for the analysis of the runtime of algorithms. Typically, it is relatively easy to figure out what the best case or the worst case runtime of an algorithm is. Until now, it was hard to calculate the average runtime of an algorithm, because it usually involved a tricky counting problem, to enumerate all possible runs of the the algorithm and summing over them. The incompressibility method eliminates the need for doing these complicated enumerations, by letting you perform the analysis on a single run of the algorithm which is guarunteed to be representative of the average runtime of the algorithm. If you program for a living like I do, this will give you an edge, because if you can accurately predict that the worst-case runtimes almost never happen, you can usually simplify and streamline your programs by optimizing it for the average case. If your competitors are wasting time optimizing for a worst case which almost never happens--at the expense of _not_ optimizing for the average case, you win bigtime.For philosophers of science and AI/knowledge representation folks, the most useful results of Kolmogorov complexity are probably the contributions of Kolmogorov complexity to Baysianism. To be a Baysian is to follow a two step process: (STEP 1) for every possible sentence, assign to it a number between 0 and 1 which represents how certain you are that that sentence is true. This initial assignment should be a probability distribution over all possible sentences. It should be a \\"good\\" probability distrubution, but of course it won't be perfect, since you don't know everything. (STEP 2) when confronted with new evidence, e.g. an observation, update your current \\"good\\" degrees of belief by using Bayes' law, to yield a new \\"better\\" set of degrees of belief.The Baysians always had a good story for Step 2--just use Bayes law. But until now, they were mostly hand-waving on Step 1--what would constitude a \\"good\\" initial probability distribution? There were many proposals (e.g. maximum entropy) but all proposals had benefits and drawbacks. What Kolmogorov complexity provides is the so-called \\"universal\\" distribution, which is guarunteed to be a \\"good\\" initial distirbution. This book devotes much time to explaining and exploring this, and shows how previous techniques, like maximum entropy, minimum description length, etc all can be seen as computable approximations to the (unfortunately uncomputable) universal distribution. This really gives a nice framework for evalutating and formulating good prior distributions.After remarking on how hard this book was to read, I should emphasize that this is not due to bad writing on the part of the authors! Indeed, after throwing the book across the room, I was always drawn back by Li & Vitanyi's most engaging writing style to pick the book back up, dust it off, and have another go at it. If it were not for their wonderul ability to expain a very complicated subject matter, I never would have gotten through it.An unsung hero of this book is Peter Gacs, who wrote a set of lecture notes which really could be considered to be an Urtext for this book. If you tackle this book, I highly recommend that you also get ahold of these notes, because it is sometimes very useful, when trying to puzzle out a difficult argument, to get another description/explaination of it from a different point of view. These notes are available on the web, just google for \\"Lecture note on descriptional complexity and randomness\\" by Peter Gacs.If you're up to the challange, then buy this book, dilligently read it, swear at it--then swear by it."},{"Title":"INTRODUCTION TO KOLMOGOROV COMPLEXITY AND ITS APPLICATIONS","review":"The theory of Kolmogorov complexity attempts to define randomness in terms of the complexity of the program used to compute it. The authors give an excellent overview of this theory, and even discuss some of its philosophical ramifications, but they are always careful to distinguish between mathematical rigor and philosophical speculation. And, interestingly, the authors choose to discuss information theory in physics and the somewhat radical idea of reversible computation. The theory of Kolmogorov complexity is slowly making its way into applications, these being coding theory and computational intelligence, and network performance optimization, and this book serves as a fine reference for those readers interested in these applications. Some of the main points of the book I found interesting include: 1. A very condensed but effective discussion of Turing machines and effective computability. 2. The historical motivation for defining randomness and its defintiion using Kolmogorov complexity. 3. The discussion of coding theory and its relation to information theory. The Shannon-Fano code is discussed, along with prefix codes, Kraft's inequality, the noiseless coding theorem, and universal codes for infinite source word sets. 4. The treatment of algorithmic complexity. The authors stress that the information content of an object must be intrinsic and independent of the means of description. 5. The discussion of the explicit universal randomness test. 6. The discussion (in an exercise) of whether a probabilistic machine can perform a task that is impossible on a deterministic machine. 7. The notion of incompressibility of strings. 8. The discussion of randomness in the Diophantine equations; it is shown that the set of indices of the Diophantine equations with infinitely many different solutions is not recursively enumerable; with the initial segment of length n in the characteristic sequence having Kolmogorov complexity n. 9. The discussion on algorithmic probability, especially the test for randomness by martingales. 10. The Solomonoff theory of prediction and its ability to solve the problem of induction. 11. The treatment of Pac-learning and the resultant formalization of Occam's razor. 12. The discussion of compact routing; the optimal space to represent routing schemes in communication networks on the average for all static networks. 13. Computational complexity and its connection to resource-bounded complexity. 14. The notion of logical depth, i.e. the time required by a universal computer to compute the object from its compressed original description. 15. The connection between algorithmic complexity and Shannon's entropy. 16. The discussion on reversible computation, i.e. logically reversible computers that do not dissipate heat. 17. The treatment of information distance, i.e. for two strings, the minimal quantity of information sufficient to translate from one to the other."},{"Title":"INTRODUCTION TO KOLMOGOROV COMPLEXITY AND ITS APPLICATIONS","review":"When is an object &quot;random&quot;? Kolmogorov (and others) argue that one could measure randomness by the shortest description, i.e. computer program, that generates it.This simple idea leads to a beautiful mathematical theory and a powerful tool as one can show that random objects have several interesting properties.Li and Vitanyi have written this wonderful monograph on the area covering the depth of theory and applications not seen anywhere else. They give a clear and complete descriptions of many of the important concepts in the book. I have used this book twice in teaching graduate courses on the topic.This book is a must have for anyone interested in a serious mathematical treatment of Kolmogorov complexity."},{"Title":"INTRODUCTION TO KOLMOGOROV COMPLEXITY AND ITS APPLICATIONS","review":"The book provides all the tools needed for a productive use of the theory. Written by leading experts in the field, the book is both a fascinating introduction as well as a comprehensive reference for experts.The authors are careful to place the development of the theory in its historical context, give a face to the main players in the field and explore frictions with other lines of thought. But the main storyline is the mathematical world of Kolmogorov complexity. Neccessary background knowledge is provided, most proofs are given and the open problems are presented. Most chapters are more or less self sufficient, making it possible to skip those that are of less relevance to you. In the later chapters much thought is given to the different fields of application.A third edition is in the making which will include recent advances.

This book is intended for serious students of computer science or those who have some similar training - it is definitely set up as a textbook. However, that being said, if you have the background the authors' delivery is fist-class and very clear.The reviews below give more than enough information so I won't belabour the Kolmogorov complexity here. Suffice it to say you won't find the subject detailed more fully in any other reference work in existence today.However, this book does need to be revised and updated. There has been a lot of development in the field and the sections overviewing Solomonoff's work, in particular, could be expanded. Also, I found it hard to believe that nothing about the 'philosophical' importance of the whole induction question - this is at the core of many very important questions and should not be treated trivially.There should also be some overview of two other areas that, in combination with the theory outlined in this text, are starting to form the nexus of a \\"new kind of science\\" (definitely not Wolfram's pathetic attempt). I refer to some information regarding non-classical logical systems as well as anticipatory computing systems.

I was going to be a cowboy for the rest of my life.&quot; Those are the words of Tim Holt later in his career, quoted in this magnificent book by author David Rothel. Tim Holt was a great &quot;B&quot; western movie cowboy star of the 1930's-1950's. His post-WWII western movie series that ran up until 1952 has to rate as the best series of &quot;B&quot; westerns ever made, with good acting, directing &amp; production values, a lot of action, and great on-location photography. In many cases the RKO films made from 1947-52 should be more accurately referred to as &quot;A-&quot; westerns. The stories are always enjoyable and pleasing, and you can tell the good guys from the bad guys. Tim Holt was a fine actor and also appeared in several first class films such as Orson Welles' &quot;The Magnificent Amersons,&quot; and with Humphrey Bogart in &quot;Treasure of Sierra Madre.&quot; In his westerns he presents himself as a warm, easygoing &amp; friendly cowboy with a good sense of right and wrong, a real hero. He is often drifting between jobs when the stories begin. This book is the first and only book about his life and films. I was born after his last westerns were filmed, and happened to discover the movies in the mid-1970's, after Tim Holt had already passed away (at age 54). I took an immediate liking to him as he presented himself in the movies, and when I later went to libraries and book stores to try to find information about him, found nothing except a few brief sections in several western film books. One paperback I found, &quot;Great Western Heroes,&quot; published in the 1970's, gave more information than the other books, but not enough. Tim Holt has been a western hero to me since I saw the first movie, and it was a real joy to discover that this book existed when I found it on amazon.com. It's well worth the price. The book is well-written and is solidly bound with excellent print &amp; photographic reproduction, has a great color cover of a more recent painting of Tim Holt, and is just loaded with a treasure trove of information on him. Childhood photos, reviews of all his films with accompanying pictures, copies of newspaper articles and his obituary, interviews and commentaries with his co-stars and fellow actors and family members, even copies of articles and interviews from western film magazines of the 1940's-50's. And some mysteries about his family life, his work after he walked away from acting (at age 33!) and did the rodeo circuit and shows, and the cancer that killed him are revealed here too. It's impossible to really express what a great book this is, and the author David Rothel deserves all the credit for the extensive research and effort he put into this magnificent volume. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Tim Holt","review":"Being the granddaughter of Tim Holt, I know a lot about him. But for someone who doesn't, this is the best book to read and learn about him.

The romance is fun, too."},{"Title":"Unsuitable Attachment (New Portway Reprints)","review":"AN UNSUITABLE ATTACHMENT might be called the most typical of Barbara Pym's novels, which is a bit surprising because it was one that was famously rejected by her publisher in the mid 1960s, leading to her long spell when she did not publish until she was famously rediscovered over a decade later (and was nominated for the Booker Prize for QUARTET IN AUTUMN). All the types you'll find in other Pym novels--the unmarried woman leaving the bloom of youth doing research or filing work for others; the gentle vicar; his eccentric wife; the preoccupied anthropologist--are present here, and the central questions (as always) center upon marriage and happiness in distressed but genteel circumstances. This is not one of the Pym books that absolutely knocks your socks off for either its humor or its construction, but it's still well crafted and very funny (in Pym's gentle and unsurprising way). There's a great cat that figures as much into the plot as nearly any of the humans, and a splendid and very recognizable set-piece of most of the major characters taking a vacation in Rome where they flirt with one another (always one of the preoccupations of any Pym novel, and probably why she has so often been compared a bit misleadingly to Jane Austen)."},{"Title":"Unsuitable Attachment (New Portway Reprints)","review":"Perhaps my favorite of all Pym's novels for its poignancy, humor, sly social observations, its recognition of social and economic changes going on in England at the time, its wry accounts of workplace interaction, its great treatment of class, the Church, love in its many forms, courtship......A superb comedy of manners......Not cool or brittle, though: Pym loves her characters."},{"Title":"Unsuitable Attachment (New Portway Reprints)","review":"In 1977, Philip Larkin (who was offered but declined the honor of Poet Laureate) famously co-authored an article in the _Times Literary Supplement_ in which he described Pym, who had just published her seventh novel, as \\"the most underrated writer of the 20th century.\\" That acclaim from a respected source helped, but she still never achieved the sort of recognition she deserved from the general reading public, and it's a puzzle why that never happened. Several of her books, in fact, were rejected by publishers when first written and were not published until after her death, years later. That's the case with this one, which was actually written, and was set, in 1963.Like many of Pym's books, the principle themes are the often confused relationships between men and women, who seem never to quite understand each other, and the unsettled place of the church in modern Britain. Ianthe Broome, the properly raised daughter of a canon of the C of E, is left in moderate comfort by her late parents. She works as a librarian (an acceptably ladylike profession), which doesn't pay much, but she still has enough money to buy a small house in a not-posh area of north London. She becomes acquainted with the residents of the nearby parish vicarage, the Rev. Mark Ainger and his wife, Sophia, and the latter almost immediately begins trying to find her a husband (apparently seeing that as one of the primary duties of a vicar's wife). Sophia's unmarried younger sister, Penelope, is in the market, too, and the two women decide her best bet would be another new resident in the neighborhood, anthropologist Rupert Stonebird. (An academic is nearly always an acceptable husband, however dull and otherwise intellectually engaged he might be.) But what will they do if Rupert shows a preference for the slim, well-dressed, nicely presented Ianthe? But then John Challow comes to work at the library, a young man five years younger than Ianthe, and with a background in small-time acting, who nevertheless takes an immediate interest in her, somewhat to her confusion. (He, of course would be entirely UN-suitable in the eyes of all the other women in the story.) Next door to the vicarage live veterinarian Edwin Pettigrew and his unmarried sister, Daisy, whose mission in life is to minister to small animals, whom she is convinced are being mistreated by practically everyone -- especially foreigners.That's the principal cast and Pym brings them into contact with each other and watches their reactions and the assumptions (usually incorrect) they form about each other. And nearly all of them are sympathetic characters, even the often irritating Mervyn Cantrell, Ianthe's and John's boss at the library, and who also covets Ianthe -- or her heirloom furniture, at least. The chapters dealing with the parish field trip to Rome are especially good, with the newly-arrived English ladies immediately setting off in search of a cup of tea, while Daisy, who has packed a supply of tinned cat food in her capacious purse, is hopeful of discovering indigent Italian felines. But during their visit, Ianthe also discovers quite another, somewhat unsettling side to her friend, Sophia. The interesting thing is that the flavor of Pym's writing is almost Edwardian -- matching the mindset of many of the characters -- and the reader may forget that the setting is actually the early 1960s, until some casual reference yanks one back to the present (which is now forty years in our own past). It may simply be that this sort of gently written, quietly amusing English comedy of manners is simply too old-fashioned to appeal to 21st-century readers, but that's a shame."},{"Title":"Unsuitable Attachment (New Portway Reprints)","review":"If you like novels of manners, this is a good one set in a modern period.

I am a fan, but when I read it, to my dismay I found it a very unpleasant book. The famous lightness of wit is quite absent, replaced by a turgid narrative about a group of sad unattractive characters, none of whom are even satirized, and for whom I felt nothing at all. Worse still, the Church, although always quietly present in her works, seems to have got such a grip on the writer's psyche, that she is unable to put together three lines without some reference to it, even when it is irrelevant to the action. My feeling is that she had come to the end of a long creative spell and needed a long rest. And this is what happened.

Her husband has arranged to borrow a huge Cambridge house close to the University, but Faith senses that something isn't right about the house--a sensation reinforced when she discovers an ancient diary that recounts the story of the wife of a former owner--who was held captive and raped by her husband. Faith's problems with her husband's new job are reinforced by the sexy graduate student who seems intent on meeting with Faith's husband every time she gets the chance and the emergence of Faith's old boyfriend--now apparently a client in a homeless shelter.Author Katherine Hall Page surrounds the reader with Faith's daily life--her business as a caterer, her sister's upcoming wedding (and baby), the gossip of Aleford where Faith had lived and her husband had preached until the move to nearby Cambridge. So much so, however, that the mystery doesn't actually get started until the book is halfway over.Page's smooth writing kept me turning the pages through this mystery but Faith wasn't especially sympathetic as a character, resourceful as a sleuth, or clever in escaping from danger. THE BODY IN THE ATTIC is a nice enough quick read but that's about all."},{"Title":"The Body in the Attic","review":"When I read her first book, _The Body in the Belfry_, I was delighted to believe I had found another mystery author I could enjoy. This was the next one I read (out of sequence, I know), and in the wake of her debut... so disappointing. The title is misleading, the pace is slow, the ending fails to satisfy. So much of the story seems like filler for an uninspired plot.Moreover, Faith evolves in this installment into a shallow character even as Page tries to make her dynamic. As a mother of 2 myself I was hoping to find a food snob who could juggle it all, but instead I met a mother whose primary objective seems to be to find other places for her children to be so that she can better indulge in reading a diary she finds and shares with the reader (more filler).I thought this was a strategy similar to moving Jessica Fletcher to teach on a city campus in NY, but Page departs from more than the village of Aleford."},{"Title":"The Body in the Attic","review":"I've read all 14 of the Faith Fairchild mysteries and every year I've anxiously awaited the next installment. This year was a disappointment. In previous books Faith has come across as interesting, resourceful and has really been in the meat of the mystery. In this book she's merely a bystander for most of the mystery but still manages to have her typical damsel in distress moment.Ms. Page's description of the character is also beginning to grate on my nerves since everything Faith eats, wears or encounters is fantastically fabulous. Faith doesn't need to be Martha Stewart. Just once it would be nice to see Faith cook something and be disappointed with it. How would Faith handle that? Faith Fairchild is starting to come across as judgemental rather than sympathetic.The one saving grace in this whole book was Ms. Page's method of telling the historical story. I was eagerly reading hoping to encounter another journal entry before it was time to put the book down.Quite honestly, I'll still look for book 15 next year. Hopefully Ms. Page can find a way to renew this reader's interest in the series for another 15 books."},{"Title":"The Body in the Attic","review":"I became an avid reader of Katherine Hall Page's wonderful mysteries after reading an article about her in The Tufts Criterion, the alumni publication of Tufts University. In my estimation, The Body in the Attic is her best work yet. The protagonist, Faith Fairchild, is maturing as a mother and as a caterer. In some ways, perhaps she is an alter-ego of the author herself. While the two concurrent plots of the mystery provide a really good read, other themes such as balancing family with career, gourmet cuisine with urban homelessness and hunger, and ministry with personal fulfillment, are also of central concern. To be sure, there are feminine frills, presented with a delightful touch of humour, i.e. comments on accessories and designer clothes, but at its heart the novel delves in a lighthanded way into some rather serious issues of modern life.Because Faith Fairchild's husband, Tom, is a minister, there is a spiritual overtone as well. But the religious theme does not usually enter through his character, not in previous works in which he is pastoring, nor in this one where he teaches at Harvard Divinity. Rather, it is Faith the minister's daughter and pastor's wife who usually interjects the element of living with meaning and integrity. In this volume, it is intriguing that the victim's diary is also the vehicle which speaks of God's love, as well as of the moral issues and dilemmas that spring from a commitment to live with some sort of integrity during the intolerably evil imprisonment within her home.Then, too, the pleasures of food are presented throughout the book in a number of interesting ways. While this is true in all Katherine Hall Page's mysteries, the catalog of luscious-sounding restaurants that actually exist in Cambridge and Boston are worth researching on-line and exploring in person. Readers who live in the greater Boston area are doubly blessed.Finally, it is worth obtaining a copy of this book for the narrative pages which follow as a sort-of postscript. Of special note in all Katherine Hall Page's works are the recipes, but as more a reader than a cook I really enjoyed this particular volume's notes on both comfort food and comfort reading. The author provides a lengthy list of authors one could curl up with for a long time to come.In addition to our author's reading suggestions, I also look forward to curling up with a long list of future novels by this author. I wonder if she is as delightful a person as Faith Fairchild and her fictional friends. May Katherine Hall Page continue to bless us with years of new reading pleasure!"},{"Title":"The Body in the Attic","review":"Faith Fairchild's husband Tom is becoming discontented with his life as pastor of a church in Aleford, a small town in Massachusetts. Because of this, he feels that he can't turn down the offer of a chance to fill in for a divinity professor at Harvard for a semester. Surprisingly, big-city girl Faith feels sad to pull up her roots from Aleford, if only for a little while. When she reaches their house in Cambridge, she feels a sense of foreboding, as if something mysterious has happened there at one time. Her feelings prove to be true when she finds a diary written by a woman who was literally held as a prisoner by her husband in the house in the 1940's. Meanwhile Faith encounters an old boyfriend named Richard at a homeless shelter and he tells her that he is doing undercover research for a new book he is writing. She begins to meet with Richard and does not tell her husband Tom about the meetings. This particular plot twist did not sit well with this reader, particularly since Faith is very vocal about her jealousy over one of Tom's female graduate students who becomes friendlier to him than Faith would like. Eventually the questions brought up by the diary and by Richard's presence are answered, and this latest &quot;Body&quot; book ends with some of Faith's favorite recipes. This is another good entry in the series about the caterer and the pastor."},{"Title":"The Body in the Attic","review":"I enjoyed this one. Very nice character development, as in the past, and good story line. A nice mellow read. A series is difficult to sustain, but the author has done well by this one. I certainly recommend it. I do hope there are more coming."},{"Title":"The Body in the Attic","review":"Rev. Thomas Fairchild seems to be going through a mid-life crisis. At least that is what his wife, Faith, believes. Understanding he needs a break she agrees to a temporary move to Cambridge, MA, even though she did NOT like the way Thomas went about telling her. Faith and their two children will housesit for Professor Ted Robinson while Thomas teaches a semester at the Harvard Divinity School.While working at a homeless shelter, Faith comes face-to-face with an old boyfriend, Richard Morgan. Richard claims that he is not really homeless, but doing research for a book. Then Faith finds a diary in the old house's attic. The diary is from a past resident of the house, a miserable wife who had been virtually a prisoner in the house by her husband. The more Faith reads, the more curious she becomes. And there is still someone alive, today, who does not want the information in the diary to get out.**** Sections are choppy, especially toward the beginning of the book, and I found myself getting confused. But it soon smoothed out and became a great mystery. To me, the novel was like reading an older version of the Nancy Drew series, a clean mystery with only a touch of real danger. All-in-all, readers will find this one to be a great way to spend an afternoon of light reading. ****Reviewed by Detra Fitch of Huntress Reviews."},{"Title":"The Body in the Attic","review":"Faith Fairchild uproots her family to join her husband on a short stay in Cambridge. She misses her home and familiar surroundings but is soon fascinated by the town, its people and the history hidden in the walls (and the attic!) of the house they are staying.Not one of Page's best but certainly worth reading."},{"Title":"The Body in the Attic","review":"I love this series, Faith is a wonderful character and never gets stale for me. This book appealed to me because it dealt more with relationships and didn't have a boring subplot as did The Body in the Lighthouse. I was intrigued with Faith's range of emotions about Richard and Tom and enjoyed reading the diary entries of Dora. Without giving too much away, there is a twist in this book regarding the title that differs from previous Faith Fairchild mysteries, I was a bit confused until I was about 2/3 through the book. Personally, I wish Tom wasn't such a stick in the mud, Faith seems too young and vibrant to be with him. Also, Faith must have amazing metabolism as she eats her way through this whole book and never seems to have to work it off. This is a nice, light mystery and a quick read. I'd highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Body in the Attic","review":"I have enjoyed all of the Faith Fairchild series, not least because their milieu is familiar to me. Caterer Faith Fairchild reluctantly follows her husband. The Reverend Tom is taking a sabbatical leave to spend teaching at Harvard. Faith doesn't like being uprooted, especially because Tom didn't discuss it with her in advance. The family relocates to a historic house in the Brattle Street area of Cambridge. Two major plot lines run through the book; Faith runs into an old flame at a soup kitchen and her children find a post-World War II diary in the attic. Sometimes series' heroes seem too perfect to be true, but here Faith and Tom have their occasional warts on view.The Body in the Bonfire is still my favorite of the series, but this comes close."},{"Title":"The Body in the Attic","review":"While I enjoyed this installment of the series more than the last few, I did find it be somewhat confusing, with too much going on.Faith has never been a likeable character to me, but she seems to get worse with every book. She's always come across as pompous and superior, but with Ms. Page throwing in tons of French words and phrases, the books on a whole are starting to come across as arrogant as well.Still, not a bad way to spend a couple of evenings."},{"Title":"The Body in the Attic","review":"Thomas Fairchild, the minister at the First Parish Church in Aleford, Massachusetts, is tired of taking care of his flock, exhausted from their demands and needing a change of scenery. He arranges to teach at the Divinity School in Cambridge which means his wife Faith and her two children have to find a place to live. It is fortunate for them that Professor Ted Robinson needs a housesitter while he is on sabbatical in California.While working at a homeless shelter, Faith meets Richard Morgan an old boyfriend who disappeared from her life before she met Thomas. He tells her that he is working undercover so that he could write a book about the plight of the homeless. They meet several times before he again disappears from her life. While worrying about Richard she finds a diary about a woman who lived in the house she is now occupying, a wife who was imprisoned by her husband. Little does she know that reading that diary gets her kidnapped and almost gets her killed by a person who has everything to lose if the contents of the journal are made public.Anyone who wants action should give THE BODY IN THE ATTIC a miss as it dwells more on the emotions of the heroine and the woman in the diary. Although the plot meanders in places, readers get a good understanding what it means to be a minister's wife who doesn't want to be a reflection of her husband's career choice. The mystery subplot is exciting because it takes the audience totally by surprise. Katherine Hall Page writes a very compelling tale about the sins of the past having an impact on the present.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Body in the Attic","review":"I've enjoyed many of the Faith Fairchild mysteries. The unreality isn't a problem in a cozy--so First Parish lets the Rev. Fairchild (apparently) spend summer in Maine. But this one--I couldn't even read it. I don't buy a cozy for scenes of abuse and torture. Then, as someone mentions, she is terribly jealous of one of his graduate students, but doesn't mind sneaking out with an old boy friend.

They are full to the brim with first class colour photographs and to reproduce these in a book is an expensive process. Whether they are about the beautiful Livebearers, new strains of which are coming into the aquarist trade or in this case arguably the most beautiful freshwater tropical fish species, they are the most comprehensive identification books you can buy. They never become dated because as new fish become available to the aquarist trade the books are updated. There is plenty of literature on Livebearers but none better than this.Normally the books do not really deal with the basics of fish keeping, there are many and varied books that do that. They are in the main a fish identification encyclopaedia.

Students Who Took Vegas for Millions","review":"Wow, I was so impressed by this book. I enjoy math related subjects, but the idea of card counting had never crossed my mind. Yes, there is one chapter thats is a 'how to' on card counting but this book is the story of 6 college students from MIT that, well, 'took vegas for millions'. I was shocked at the amount of money that went through their hands. I do wonder how factual the book is. It is supposed to be a true story and at one point the students in the book play cards with famous basketball players. But either way, I just couldnt' put the book down. Nice suspense."},{"Title":"Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T. Students Who Took Vegas for Millions","review":"You won't be disappointed by this book. It delivers on telling a very interesting story of how a group of nerds (and I use the term affectionately) figured out how to profit from a systematic method of counting cards in blackjack. I enjoyed the main character and his story, and several of the scenes are really gripping. No doubt about it--you will keep reading right through the exciting conclusion of the book.However, the book has a few flaws. One major premise of the book is never really proven, which is that the nerds were ever in any real danger. As a result, the drama is not as taut for me as the writer probably would have liked. Also, as a Boston native, a few editing gaffes really stood out for me. As an example, at one point in the book, Sudbury, MA is lumped together with several blue collar and urban towns. Anyone who knows Boston knows that Sudbury is leafy and wealthy. Such small errors may not bother some, but they drive me crazy.Aside from that, though, the book is worth a read if you are interested in the subject matter or nerds, or both."},{"Title":"Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T.

A great read!"},{"Title":"Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T. Students Who Took Vegas for Millions","review":"First of all, I would like to stress the fact that I hate to read. The only time I pick up a book, is when it deals with something that I extremely interested in. Blackjack is one of my passions in life, and let me tell you, Bringing Down the House offers one of the best gambling stories you will ever read about. The plot is outstanding. It is based on the real life account of Kevin Lewis, and how he became part of an M.I.T. based Blackjack team that created new and superior methods of card counting. Ben Mezrich's account of the story, takes you through step by step of what really happened. The reason I really enjoyed this book, is because it reads like it is completely fiction. It is that enjoyable.Kevin Lewis' methods are discussed in detail during the course of the story which makes this book impossible to put down. Everything from how to count, to the signals that the team used. As the story progresses, the amount of suspense increases because the team becomes closer and closer to being taken down. The book starts out making you think that Kevin and the rest of the team are invincible. But, as time goes on, you begin to realize that the story is just like any other having to do with gambling. One way or another, the house always wins. The book's best feature perhaps is the essay written by Kevin Lewis himself at the end of the book. You get a first hand account from Kevin on how to count cards and beat the casinos.I usually can't stand to read at all, but this book had me glued to the pages. The plot, card counting techniques, and extremely authentic recreation of the events make Bringing Down the House a must read book."},{"Title":"Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T. Students Who Took Vegas for Millions","review":"Ben Mezrich's story about a group of geniuses from MIT who decide to use their skills to turn casino odds in their favor is one of those amazing-but-true stories that is absolutely captivating, in spite of the average reporting abilties of the author.The students' plan is simple: use their exceptional math skills to count cards and put the casinos at a massive disadvantage through the use of a team strategy. The plan works magnificently for quite some time, and the nerdy kids find themselves hobnobbing with celebrities and sports stars. After a while, however, things begin to go bad: personalities clash, and the casinos start closing in on the team, making for some very interesting and dangerous situations.The story really is fascinating, from the sheer brain power of these twentysomething students to the amounts of cash they are pushing through the casinos to the double life each one is leading. The reporting, however, leaves something to be desired. The author leaves a lot of questions unanswered (for instance, did Kevin Lewis ever tell his father about his other life?), and the whole book has a 'names have been changed to protect the innocent' feel to it.As stated before, the story is incredibly entertaining, but ends with a bit of a whimper. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone, but would warn them not to expect a fantastic finish."},{"Title":"Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T.

Granted, I was tired so it wasn't necessarily the book's fault and, in fact, now that I went back to the first book later it was actually pretty good. Just not riveting enough to keep me awake and reading.THIS book, however, kept my attention for the entire 2 hours of the second leg of my flight and I found myself speeding home from the airport so I could read more. I finally arrived at home about 11pm and finished the book at 4am. Couldn't put it down. Great writing but and even greater story.I'm not a big gambler or blackjack player but the people involved and the systems they employed to beat the house were just amazing.

The only problem is that you will finish it in a few days because it is so good!"},{"Title":"Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T. Students Who Took Vegas for Millions","review":"Apparently one can also learn about kings, queens and aces at MIT. More specifically, probability theory is put to work with a very profitable return. I suspect Fermat would have been impressed. logicalreviewer hit upon the few logical issues I had with this book as well. In addition, it reads like a screenplay with each chapter ending with a \\"fade to commercial\\" type dramitic effect. Kind of silly effect for a non-ficional account of an interesting story. The last paragraph of the story felt contrived.That said, it is a fun and quick read. I did enjoy the story through the noisey writing style. Under the tutelage of a rebel professor, a small group of MIT students use a forty year old counting theory updated to reflect modern gambling technology. It is called card counting throughout the book, but in reality it is a developed skill that allows one to determine probablility at any given point in the game of blackjack with a six deck shoe. Unlike the character in \\"Rain Man,\\" these students didn't have to remember the order of every card delt. They refined a system that allowed for rapid calculations. Quite a simple method if you want to win against your buddies in a home game. However, in reality the students are quite intelligent and applied this simple methodology to a very complex application. Under the careful watch of the dealers, bosses, supervisors, casino cameras, lights, dancers, servers, crowds, other players, and many distractions found in a casino, keeping track of a deck position and then taking advantage of it is quite another challenge. It is quite clear that the average person can not do what they did.Overall this is an interesting story of a few bright people who used their ability to rapidly calculate probabilities and swing the blackjack odds, normally in favor of the house, in their favor. While legal, this practice is not accepted by the casinos because the odds are with them and they want to keep it that way. You get caught and they will make you leave. The trick is not getting caught and that is 90% of the challenge in the story. The suckers throwing their money away twenty four hours a day will keep coming. The casinos are happy to have them just as long as they are not from MIT!"},{"Title":"Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T.

You will always be wondering if this person or that person is on a counting team. It made me look back to all the time sI visited a casino and wondered if I played next to one of these people. This is a thrilling, gripping book that takes you from the street of Boston to the lights of Vegas with stops at Casinos in Chicago, Conn and the Bahamas. Ben Mezrich make feel like you are right there, almost a witness to the action. The events in teh book take place in teh 1990's which for some reason make sthe book all that more enjoyable.

It reads like a fast-paced fiction novel, and the whole time I was reading it I kept pausing to think, &quot;Hey, this isn't fiction. It really happened&quot; and this only made the book more interesting. The insider's view into the world of high-stakes blackjack and the lives of serious card counters was fascinating. I had no idea that card counters worked on finely-orchestrated teams. Although I knew that Kevin's card-counting days were going to come to an end (heck, this book wouldn't have been written otherwise), it was still suspenseful as I waited to find out HOW and WHEN his blackjack days ended. This was a highly entertaining book, a fun and quick read. I definitely recommend it."},{"Title":"Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T. Students Who Took Vegas for Millions","review":"I agree that this book is a amateurish retread of other 'beat the house' books. Ken Uston's Million Dollar Blackjack from the early 1980's (20 years ago!) was a lot more interesting and certainly more original. I didn't see Uston mentioned once in the book, whic is odd, especially in the tehcnical appendix by the team leader. If you like these kind of stories, you might want to try and find the Eudemonic pie (Thomas Bass, The Eudemonic Pie (Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1985)) which is out of print and is again supposedly a true story about some santa cruz students who built embedded wireless roulette prediction computers that they mounted in their shoes. This was back in the 1980s!For me the writing is heavy handed. Perfect for a hollywood screenplay, like Crichton. Lowest common denominator."},{"Title":"Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T.

Someone else should have written it though."},{"Title":"Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T. Students Who Took Vegas for Millions","review":"I enjoyed this book as a cheap thriller. I liked the way that Mezrich details the mechanisms of team play, and I enjoyed watching this machine of team play in action. Other reviewers are right on the book's shortcomings: ho-hum prose, shallowly conceived characters, a sometimes didactic and uninteresting &quot;blackjack educational filmstrip&quot; voice, cheesy dialogue and the annoying and unnecessary chapters involving the author in interviews with present-day vegas types. I am going to add another to this litany of charges: Mezrich's &quot;immaturity,&quot; specifically his tendency to offer colleges attended and academic majors as characterization. He has an annoying way of introducing new characters by emphasising where they went to school and what they majored in, instead of their personal qualities.I guess that what distinguishes these characters really might be their college majors - they seem otherwise so united in cynicism. Indeed, one of the unexpected and unsettling insights of this book is that students at places like Harvard and MIT, unattracted to intellectual life, only imagine themselves as better equipped to satiate their greed. I would hope that most men and women, by the time they reach the ages of the characters in this book, have outgrown such identities. That they haven't in Mezrich's book is either a remark about real &quot;MIT kids&quot; or a sign of his limited world view.But I did enjoy this book, mostly because of its richness in detail on the team's tactics."},{"Title":"Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T.

When I had finished reading the book I felt like I had been to Boston, learned to count cards, gambled in Vegas and knew Kevin Lewis personally.

Basically, one of the team members spilled his guts to the author and this book is that plus a few stray interviews. The writer manages only the tiniest of glimpses into how the casinos dealt with the teams. There is very little history of the team itself.I feel the author could have worked harder to set the scene and show more evidence of background research. It couldn't have hurt to hear from other voices in the casino universe, especially other blackjack players.Not exactly Bob Woodward level reporting, but there was enough color (amidst a fair amount of purple prose) and more than enough suspense to keep me turning the pages until 1 AM on a school night."},{"Title":"Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T.

For someone who seem to have a bright future ahead of him and has things that most people only can dream of: MIT diploma, upper middle class family, a girlfriend who is about to go to med school, a 6 digit salary. Yet he prefers the lifestyle of Vegas: professional cheerleader girlfriend, VIP access to strip clubs and five star hotels, having multiple fake IDs, carrying thousands and thousands of dollars on your body nervously though airport.This really makes me wonder under certain circumstances, anyone of us, given the chance, probably would choose that kind of lifestyle.

Students Who Took Vegas for Millions","review":"I do not think that Ngubu or the reader from London,Uk read the book very careful or have much knowledge about card counting themselves.. the author did a fine job and did alot of research about the topic.. he didnt just interview Kevin Lewis and took his word about it.. he verified all info via independent sources... first of all just because your a expert card counter does not mean you will win 100% of the time.. the popular misconception is that if your a card counter you know what every card that is coming out is (though its theoritically possbile through shuffle tracking but its not 100% accurate).. card counting just gives you a probable guess as to high cards to low cards left in the deck.. it will not tell you for absolute fact the next card is a ace of spades (or whatever card).. when the deck is rich in high cards it is in the players favor (high cards bust dealers hands and gives you the chance for a blackjack and to double down bets) when it is rich in low cards it its in the Houses's favor (less likely to bust and more probable to beat your hand)...when you know the &quot;count&quot; you vary your bet accordingly.. bet more when rich in high cards and bet less when rich in low cards.. as for Ngubu saying why didnt they just go to casino's around the world.. if you were more informed of blackjack history since the 70's lets say. u would know that the casino's hire a Private Investigation firm that helps them keep tabs on card counters.. no matter how a expert card counter you are sooner or later they will put 2 and 2 together and see a common thread/link.. similar faces in disguises, same people at the same casino's at the same time but do not acknowledge each other etc... but anyways this PI firm keeps a book that is called The Griffin Book that has photos and information on card counters and cheats.. and that book is sent worldwide to casino's.. so that answers your question.. in fact one MIT BJ team (there are several not just the one in the book) was caught in Monte Carlo and escorted out of Monte Carlo by the police but were allowed to keep there winnings... as for the reader in UK.. he/she is obviously no mathmatician (yet makes judgements about such) and is definelty not a card counter because UK doesnt understand card counting to begin with just thinks if your a expert you will never get caught.. as for blackjack teams being done in the 70's .. yes you are right it was .. by a legend actually.. Ken Uston (he perfected the Big Player role &amp; he also sued Atlantic City casinos and won which now u can count cards in AC without getting banned but they will make it difficult for you to do so by changing the rules to blackjack or only letting you bet the minimum while everyone else at the table can bet whatever they want etc.).. but he was banned from every casino there was eventually cause his face got recognized and he was one hell of a expert and there is no refuting he wasnt.. What the MIT team did was keep records of there playing sessions, fed it into a computer and came out with solutions to any playing problems at the table through mathmatics etc.. as for blackjack in general you have no knowledge of it except probably basic rules of the game.. if you studied it you would know that in the short run anything can happen if your a card counter (major losing streaks included) but in the long run if your a expert card counter and do it perfectly you will come out ahead... Anyways i recommend this book to anyone who is aspiring to be a card counter as well as people who like to hear that david vs goliath true stories still exist... It is suppose to be made into a movie being produced by Kevin Spacey.. though im not sure what title the movie will be because &quot;Bringing Down the House&quot; was recently made a movie starring Steve Martin and Queen Latifah that had nothing to do with blackjack... anyways read it you'll love it period.."},{"Title":"Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T.

That makes it both a light and easy read, but it also leaves you wondering (like many of the other reviewers) &quot;How much of this is true?&quot;. I understand the concern of the many reviewers claiming that the numbers don't &quot;add up.&quot; To that, I just have to say, &quot;I don't really care.&quot; This book isn't primarily a documentary. It is just a really entertaining and addicting read. The goal is not to teach you how to beat the system; it isn't to document how they beat the system. Like the title says, the book is primarily a story about the &quot;Six M.I.T.

This will ultimately wind up at garage sales galore in about a year, so save yourself the money and go to the library and check it out or wait for all of the $0.01 Amazon Marketplace specials that will inevitably appear come about Christmas time.I hope this review gives you the incentive to read this book, but also does not give you the exagerated expectations of so many other reviews (including the cover reviews) that have been circulating.

The author did a great job on his main character's ongoing moral dilemma: Is it acceptable to gamble using methods that while not illegal are definitely considered cheating by the casinos."},{"Title":"Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T.

More important, however, was the question of whether one should pursue a vocation which only earns good dough (like gambling, day-trading or late-90's internet ventures) or one which improves the world."},{"Title":"Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T.

He gives his players enough positive and negative characteristics to keep them real without loading down the story with extras. The math and logic within the story is not too complex for even a novice poker player (which I am.) The Robin Hood undertones offset the bad-boy antics of the main character. Book-speak aside, this book makes me want to take a trip to America's playland and get a glimpse of the life that these folks had the fortune and misfortune of living."},{"Title":"Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T. Students Who Took Vegas for Millions","review":"Kevin Lewis is a MIT graduate who was recruited to one of the greatest card counting teams, lead by one of the greatest card counters in the world. They lead Kevin thru the mock trials, they battered him with tests and they try to make him fail, but he succeeded. Now that he is part of the team he has joined the dangerous underworld that only few know about. They travel from casino to casino trying to blend in, hoping not to stand out or their jig will be up. Their plan is to take over Vegas and milk it for all that it is worth. The team begins to live in fear, constantly looking over their shoulders for that watchful eye that follows them around. They start getting to anxious and they begin to show their hand which starts to attract attention from all different directions.Bringing down the House is an extremely enthralling book. The constant flow of action and danger reels you into its' strategically planned storyline. The transformation that happens to Kevin Lewis from his MIT academic swim life, to Big Player card shark makes the story so much better. The thought of being able to change out of your skin and niche, to be put into and alien situation intended to convince people that you are someone else encourages me to go out and do something dangerous and new. Conspiracy and betrayal through out the book keeps you hungry for more. I recommend this book to any reader that enjoys captivating books with an urge to find out the possibilities that one could do that so many thought were impossible."},{"Title":"Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T.

As a student of probability and statistics, I am naturally interested in the numbers and odds in gambling. This book tells a story of some MIT gambling teams who used their smarts to make millions out of Las Vegas casinos. They only needed two things to achieve their goals: card counting and team work. The buildup and suspense were quite fascinating. With so many TV shows on poker tournaments nowadays, it's hard to imagine that we won't see this story on big screens very soon.I am a little disappointed with the ending. It's anticlimactic. With the amount of money and risk involved in this story, you would think the ending would be a more exciting one.

Students Who Took Vegas for Millions","review":"I bought this book at an airport bookstore before a long business flight as a take-your-mind-off-work-are-we-there-yet type exercise.However, it was much more than that and in fact a genuine page turner at that! I found that it was well written, simple enough not to tax your literary skills, but in no way so elementary as to insult your intelligence.The basis of the story genuinely interesting without becoming melodramatic or beyond reality. Being an engineer from a similar engineering school myself and having attended around the same timeframe as well, I could identify with many of the characters, their surroundings, their uncertainty about both the present and future at the time and their desire to do something different and more challenging even if a bit sinster. Though I never recalled hearing blackjack or even Vegas (perhaps Bahamas, but for different reasons!!) whispered across my campus, I can't help but wonder what might have been.As you can see, I rather enjoyed this book, and if you share a similar background with me or at least attended college, I think that you will find this an absolutely wonderful.Those were the pros; the cons are but two and minor at that. I didn't particularly enjoy the flash forward, return to the main story type writing that occured from time to time between the chapters. I found that in most cases the present day chapters added nothing of real value to the story and just broke the momentum. In hindsight this between chapters was probably the best place to put it, but in the end it stopped the flow. The other con was that the story at the end was a bit rushed. I'm still not sure what happened in the end.All in all: Absolutely enjoyable read for any college grad of the 90's."},{"Title":"Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T. Students Who Took Vegas for Millions","review":"Some of the best-written books are nonfiction written by novelists. It allows the reader to absorb a real story that has added weight with the benefit of a narrative to make it dramatic. These elements are the key to the success of Bringing Down the House.The entire opening is a mini drama in itself, maybe the blackjack equivalent of Indiana Jones trying to get the idol at the beginning of Raiders of the Lost Ark. Without knowing any of the story we are put into the setting of a young man named Kevin carrying a million dollars trying to escape a casino before the managers take him downstairs followed by the drama of whether the protagonist can get the cash money through airport security.When we catch our breath we start to get the linear story of how our hero came to be where he was that night. The book speaks to two powerful desires within us. The first is the rebellious longing to outsmart authority and the second is the desire to use our wits to get rich.The plan was genius in construction but easy in operation. Counting cards has never been difficult and it's perfectly legal, but it's so easily spotted by pit bosses that players get barred for trying it. That's the trade-off. How long can someone count cards and make money before they are found out and asked to never return? I won't ruin their scheme, because it's part of the genius of the book.What's great about the book is not just the plan itself but the many experiences our hero lives as he achieves his goals. He meets celebrities, stays in the best suites for free and gets great seats to the biggest boxing matches of the year. He lives the life of a gilded age Diamond Jim in a Las Vegas suite on the weekend, only to return to his rundown dorm during the week.Like all biographies are really longings within us to improve our own lives, Bringing Down the House demonstrates that raw ability can yield results with the proper discipline and effort, even when the methods and tactics aren't universally supported. Imagine what this brainwork could be doing in the realm of cold fission."},{"Title":"Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T. Students Who Took Vegas for Millions","review":"Forget what the critics assail about Mezrich's writing style: if you are a fan of casinos, especially of blackjack, then this book is a great read. Those who are not casino aficionados are not likely to be as impressed, but serious and even casual players should find the rob-the-casinos storyline to be very entertaining. It is a great look into the life of the serious card counter and also a wonderful portrayal of how unabated greed and callousness can ultimately destroy a blackjack player."},{"Title":"Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T. Students Who Took Vegas for Millions","review":"Others have written about the holes in the descriptions of the blackjack strategy and games, and how there are very few accounts of their failures -- surprising since their strategy would only give them a 1-2 percent edge on the house, so they should lose, big, close to half the time. Descriptions of those losses, and the anxiety and doubt they would produce, would have added a lot of dramatic tension. Instead, the book feels kind of adolescent: look at how the kids walked in and picked the pockets of the casinos right under their noses. It doesn't feel so much David vs. Goliath as kid vs. grown-ups.Since this is the first purportedly non-fiction book by Mezrich -- who has written several novels -- you would hope accuracy would be high on his mind, but it doesn't seem to be. A nit: he describes Boston's tiny Chinatown as covering five square miles; as a Harvard grad he should know it actually is well under one square mile.Others have described the writing style with glowing terms; I found it to be pretty flat and prosaic. I had just read Michael Lewis's &quot;Moneyball,&quot; and Mezrich's prose suffered in comparison -- none of the wit, little of the energy."},{"Title":"Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T. Students Who Took Vegas for Millions","review":"It seems that every one holds out for the one possibility to make their millions. And perhaps it is just a matter of how far we will go to get them. Bringing Down the House is the story of men and women who are smart enough to earn their millions, and in a way they do. They refine a method of card counting that is the key to open the vault of the casinos around the world.What is interesting about Bringing Down the House is once they have a taste of what is possible the greed takes over. It becomes more than a weekend excursion. The money takes over. The risks they are willing to take for the money become greater. Even when their lives are clearly in danger many in the group choose to press on.Brining Down the House traces the path of greed in their lives. It is helpful and enlightening in ones own life. How much will you sacrifice for money? Your family, reputation, character, loves and safety. And in the end what will you have to show for it. A fast and interesting read. A definite suggested book."},{"Title":"Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T.

I picked up the book on a Tuesday night and could not put it down. I finished it 5 hours later at 3 a.m.! The intrigue behind six twenty-somethings learning how to count cards and work as a team playing blackjack nationwide to handily win thousands...millions of dollars is unbelievable. The fact that they mingled with celebrities, were ushered around in limo's, stayed in 4,000 square foot hotel rooms and were catered to hand over fist are perks to all the money they were making.The author seems to work hard to develop the characters. In this non-fiction story, it's not needed. The four year timeline flows smoothly. The up-and-down action kept me reading.I won't stay up to watch late-night television, but this book kept me on the edge of my seat."},{"Title":"Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T. Students Who Took Vegas for Millions","review":"I chose this book because my boyfriend's mom recommended it to me. Also, my brother had told me about the event that the book is about, and I wanted to know more about it. Thirdly, I play poker with my brothers and their friends all the time, and Bringing Down the House is about blackjack and casinos.The book is narrated by the author, who retells the events of an MIT Blackjack team. This true story is centered around a member named Kevin, and it starts at the point that he is first recruited to join the team by his dropout roommates. He spends ten hours every day training with the team to learn how to count cards. After two months of training, the team tests him to see if he is ready to play in the real world. He passes this test, and the team sets out for Las Vegas.The team, organized and led by the card-counting legend Micky, travels to Casinos in and out of Vegas every weekend under fake aliases. The players play the roles of rich kids spending their parents' money recklessly, prosperous Japanese businessmen, and everything in between. Their high-roller budgets and frequent visits earn them presidential-suite treatment and friendly invitations to complimentary shows and boxing matches by the casino managers.However, certain members of the team that are also investors get greedy, and they decide to cut Kevin, who has also become an investor, and other members of the team out. Their reason for doing so is that unlike them, Kevin and the other dropped members do not consider the team play in casinos every weekend their main job. Kevin also works in a research lab, and two others are lawyers. So Kevin makes his own team, which travels much less and more leisurely.Unfortunately, by this point, casinos begin to realize that they have lost millions of dollars to their \\"honored high-rollers,\\" and hired private investigators from the casinos begin to recognize the team play. Playing blackjack in Vegas gets more and more dangerous, which leads to suspenseful moments, dangerous adventures, and crucial decisions.I am really glad I chose this book. Not only was it suspenseful and exciting, but it also showed me the bad side of Las Vegas that many people do not think exists any more. When the city was run by the mob in the 1940s and 1950s, card-counters and cheaters frequently disappeared and were beaten. However, the MIT team operated from 1994 to 1999, and it received the same threats and harsh treatment."},{"Title":"Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T.

Say, during the summer?Well, as the ABBA song says, \\"I'll have to go to Las Vegas or Monaco. And make a fortune in a game; my life will never be the same. Money, money, money!\\"Would kids do such a thing? Um, you bet.Can the house be beaten? Obviously. It can even be beaten at roulette if you find a defective wheel. Blackjack is favorable to the player, but you have to be able to count cards acceptably and have a big enough bankroll to make winning likely. And you won't win for long. The casinos will notice that you are winning and will not care why. They'll simply blacklist you.Are M.I.T. students the ones to try it? Well, the M.I.T. mascot is the beaver. Just as the beaver is the engineer of the animal world...In this suspense-filled book we find out. No, silly. Not whether the M.I.T. students are the animals of the engineering world. Whether the M.I.T. students can win.Will their training at M.I.T. help them? As an M.I.T. cheer goes, \\"Why are we going to win tonight and do so well? We've got the Devil on our side 'cause Tech is Hell!\\"The students mastered keeping a simple count. You call all cards above a 9 \\"-1\\" and all those below a 7 \\"+1.\\" Doing this well takes plenty of practice! A big plus count is very favorable for the player. You should divide the count by the number of cards remaining to get a truer count.If you have a team, it's easier. That means there are several card counters. All they need to do is tell someone (by code words or signals) what the count is and that person can sit down and bet huge sums right from the start. If the casino shuffles the decks whenever someone new sits down, that's no problem. They can simply wait for the decks to become good. They can do the counting themselves or even have others count for them. When the decks are good, they raise the size of their bets. We find out about a few miscellaneous advanced techniques that some of the players used to get even more of an advantage.Of course, the team has to act the part. The players have to act like mildly inebriated high rollers. Or beginners. Or something other than what they really are. If the house gets suspicious, they have to split, fast. And by \\"split,\\" I don't mean splitting the hand, but getting out of the casino. They need to stay calm as they do so.Speaking of acting, do you wonder what happens when a sexy Las Vegas lady walks up to one of the M.I.T. guys and asks him to buy her a drink? Well, in this book, we find out.Of course, even with the odds favoring you, you are still gambling. We see the team grab over $300,000 dollars in a single night. But we also see a player lose $100,000 on just two consecutive hands.And your life really is never the same. In addition, for better or worse, you can't just keep doing it. The casinos do figure out who you are eventually.I thought the book was fascinating. I recommend it."},{"Title":"Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T.

Students Who Took Vegas for Millions","review":"It really comes to me as a surprise that this book received such high ratings. In my opinion there aren't much to be praised. First, the story itself is unremarkable. It is about a group of post MIT students trying to make quick money from playing blackjack at casinos and living double lives. It would be unfair to criticize a book for not meeting my personal expectations, but reading the title, I expected something more spectacular -- for e.g., a towering event that led to literally \\"bringing down a house,\\" or an ingenious betting scheme that would leave no one unimpressed. The book had neither, not even a build up. Well, the last 1/3 of the book, which covered the cracking down of the team, may be seen as a build up, but even the crack down was not a result of the team posing a serious challenge to the \\"system.\\" The team had simply been making more money than the casinos had wanted (the protagonist, Kevin, later reveals that they had more than 30% return on investment for each of the 5 years he played). The story telling also leaves much to be desired. I really doubt that any of the team members was in it \\"for the game itself,\\" as the author puts it. Other than their appearance, ethnicity, and credentials readers get little information about the characters involved. Finally for the team's scheme, which happened to be my primary motivation for reading this book. As mentioned earlier, there is nothing new in the betting scheme itself. \\"Counting cards\\" literally mean keeping track of the cards dealt, although in a cumulative way: cards numbered two to six are counted as 1, ten and face cards -1, and the remaining 0. Roughly stated, players place high bets when the running count is high (which directly implies that there are more ten & face cards remaining in the shoe). The scheme the team actually used is only slightly complicated than this -- read the final chapter subtitled \\"An Essay by Kevin Lewis\\" at a bookstore if you are interested. The scheme worked for the team not because there was anything special about it but because the team worked as a team. It doesn't take a MIT graduate to figure this out."},{"Title":"Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T. Students Who Took Vegas for Millions","review":"I know nothing about cards and have never gambled or visited Las Vegas. I fail to see the pleasure in the experience. This, no doubt, has colored my view of this book. I found it tedious. There are too many inconsistencies for it to be even close to being true. The style is flat and has little interest beyond the straight story. By the end of the book one knows little more about the characters involved than at the beginning (beyond their callowness). The experience of gambling is described so poorly that it is difficult to gain a sense of its excitement and what it means to the people involved. One is left with the feeling that their only motivation was money. Also, if this book is meant to be factual, I would have expected to find something from the casinos (beyond a couple of rather trivial cameo appearances from \\"interesting\\" characters). It would have been interesting to hear from the other side of the fence.Even if it this books is true its only excitement is that someone made lots of money whilst associating with celebrities and strippers. I believe that there are other professions which have similar characteristics and would at least make more interesting reading.If you have an interest in gambling I suggest that you save your money and experience the reality. If you have no interest in gambling then just save your money."},{"Title":"Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T. Students Who Took Vegas for Millions","review":"This book is clearly not a work of non-fiction, and labeling it as such is dishonest at best. For example, the author states that their betting system was developed by MIT students in the mid 90s. However, this exact system was described by blackjack expert Ken Uston in his 1992 book &quot;Million Dollar Blackjack&quot;. Uston states that he used his system throughout the 70s and 80s to make millions of dollars. Additionally, the author's melodramatic tone becomes annoying after the first half dozen pages. For these reasons, I would NOT recommend this book."},{"Title":"Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T. Students Who Took Vegas for Millions","review":"The story of Kevin Lewis and some other MIT kids of Asian descent, who were hand-picked by a former MIT prof to count cards in Vegas. Backed by \\"shady investors\\" that they supposedly never met, the team used a decades-old method of card counting (a modified version of \\"hi-lo,\\" based on the number of high cards left in the deck) and some interesting hand signals to collectively rake in the millions. This is Mezrich's first non-fiction book, and it shows; oh does it ever show. There is a small \\"details have been changed\\" notice under the copywright info, but this does not justify Mezrich's copious use of detail and conversation that could not possibly be known to him, let alone accurately reported. It's no great sin to use created conversation to capture the feel of a true event, but it's disingenuous of the author not to at least acknowledge what he's done. And while I don't want to call him or Lewis a liar, the tacked-on drama (beatings in the bathroom of an off-shore casino; a break-in; a solitary poker chip left ominously on Lewis' table) seem a bit too much ripped from just the style of thriller that Mezrich is apparently accustomed to writing. In sum, there might be an interesting story here, but this book (while admittedly fun to read) with its flat drama and unsymapthetic characters (aw, poor Kevin, making a great living at a trading firm, trying to \\"get out\\" of the humdrum existence of the MIT grad with the house and two cars... boo hoo, guy) isn't great."},{"Title":"Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T.

Students Who Took Vegas for Millions","review":"I am very disappointed that this book was published and gained so much popularity. I myself play blackjack, as do many others. But it is exactly this kind of publicity (as enjoyed by others-- such as Thorpe, Wong...) that alerts the casinos into making those changes that are injurious for the player-- bad table rules, auto-shuffling, etc. Yes, it is the popularity of these blackjack-secrets books that have helped inspire all those changes. Even the narrator at the end concedes that blackjack is increasingly a difficult game today. Then why, pray tell, would he help write a tell-all book that will only usher in more casino \\"crack-down\\"?The casinos read the same books, and I am certain WILL continue to retaliate. Disclosing a very valuable system, which apparently many independent groups follow, may help weave an interesting story and give the author(s) a little bang for the buck for now. But in the long run, it will only collectively hurt all the blackjack players. Table rules will be changed so that the casinos can recover more of the edge lost to the counters-- the effect of this is that the probability of winning becomes worse for counters AND non-counters alike (those using basic strategy)... along with all those folks who might consider taking up blackjack in the future. Thanks a LOT, author(s). Enjoy the limelight now. But you should know that you have also dragged into it many other resentful players who would have much rather preferred playing in the dark. Because of books like this one and all its publicity, serious players will now have to worry about being a bit more cautious, and possibly needing to devise new strategies to \\"beat the dealer\\" in response to the changing rules.

Students Who Took Vegas for Millions","review":"Ben Mezrich's BRINGING DOWN THE HOUSE is a marvelous book, a nonfictional account of beating the house in Las Vegas that reads like a Ludlum thriller. Even though I am not a &quot;casino person&quot; or a patron of Las Vegas or Atlantic City, I was captivated by this book within the first twenty pages and couldn't put it down. What more can you ask of an inside story than that it be so entertaining?Mezrich tells his story through the eyes and actions of Kevin Lewis, an MIT pre-med student recruited into a blackjack syndicate engineered by a former MIT professor named Mickey Rosa. We watch Kevin's eye-opening introduction to high roller life in Vegas, then follow him as he learns the System: card counting techniques, the art of determining when a blackjack table is hot, and how the con is pulled off by assuming outrageous character roles. As Kevin becomes increasingly consumed by the thrill of beating the casinos, his personality, his values, and his life change dramatically.BRINGING DOWN THE HOUSE maintains a great sense of pacing, bringing us into the System enough to appreciate its workings and to feel the pressure of always needing to be one step ahead of the casinos. Mezrich explains the rules of chance and probability admirably, making the underlying mathematics understandable to any non-mathematical layman. More Vegas-knowledgeable readers may find things to quibble with in this book, and some may tire reading about such intellectual prima donnas and being told how extraordinarily intelligent they are. Mezrich's yarn is so well told that most readers will be captivated by this inside look at the high roller casino world and willing to overlook such minor objections.Mezrich neither moralizes about his characters' actions nor philosophizes about gambling as a business that preys on human greed and frailty. However, his book does raise the question why such talented and intellectually capable young men and women would forego their academic careers to enter a sleezy, bottom-feeding, culturally bankrupt world? Big money and fast women were no doubt attractions, but like computer hacking, it seems to have been mostly about beating the system at its own game. For these high school nerds turned MIT nerds, finding such a non-conforming, adrenalin-engaging use of their mental talents might have been the high school jock's equivalent of getting a shot at the NBA or NFL."},{"Title":"Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T.

The overall picture is accurate, although the prose is a little sophomoric.

Students Who Took Vegas for Millions","review":"A gripping story told in prose redolent of Sidney Sheldon and Jacqueline Susanne, I enjoyed the book immensely but reading it gave me the feeling I get from bingeing at Mickey D's. I fear that if Mezrich listed his favorite writers, they'd be the people banging out those books with shiny silver covers in the paperback rack at the airport. At times the prose is so annoying it knocked me off track from the story, which is the book's strength. Mezrich never met an adjective or adverb he didn't like. Cliches abound, too. \\"Kevin's heart thumped as he saw the roll of bills.\\" \\"Then, suddenly, a bright glow erupted, first formless, then mushroom-shaped. In a moment, the city became visible, the amazingly bright lights of downtown feeding into the long, radiant Strip and its mammoth hotels . . . the newly opened, sleek, dark glass Luxor Pyramid . . . the shimmering, emerald-green MGM . . . the Mirage, its bright red volcano spitting flames into the sky.\\" The people in the book count cards to win money; someone should have counted Mezrich's modifiers and blue-penciled them out to make this a first-rate read. Still, the story is so interesting the book is worthwhile. Too bad that Mezrich makes flesh and blood people seem like ink and gel cartoons. The book is a guilty pleasure, one you shouldn't deprive yourself of if the subject matter is the least bit interesting for you."},{"Title":"Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T.

After all, how many different ways can you say, \\"I had lots of money on the table. I took a hit. I won/lost\\" and keep it fresh? Have you ever watched someone playing blackjack? What seems like high drama to the person whose money is on the line; is quite boring to almost everyone else.Nor did I expect a How To on some easy way to bring the casinos to their knees. As this writer explains--that situation just doesn't exist.What I did expect (and get) was a straight forward discussion on taking on the casinos for big bucks. In an unflinching manor the author accurately described the true odds of Joe Blow winning in blackjack and what it is like for a few very inteligent, highly motivated, people who worked very hard, turned the odds in their favor, then had the guts to spend big money in order to prove themselves right. All that and a bit of a morality play thrown in as the \\"favored few\\" aid in their own demise.I agree that a better writer, probably, could have done more with the material. But then again, a different writer might not have brought the same qualities out of the material that made the book so interesting (at least to me)."},{"Title":"Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T. Students Who Took Vegas for Millions","review":"I bought this book to feed my appetite for behind-the-scenes information about Las Vegas. However, my BS-o-meter kept flicking off the scale, as various aspects of the story seemed extremely unlikely. First, contrary to what the reader is led to believe at the outset, the team's primary means of obtaining a statistical advantage over the house was a basic, balanced \\"hi-lo\\" counting method, which, knowledgeable people will tell you, isn't very powerful and produces only a slight advantage. (It's difficult to imagine anyone making the huge killings this group supposedly made in the relatively short timeframe indicated in the book.) Second, I can't conceive of any Las Vegas casino, even in the bygone days of the early 1990s, allowing players to flit from table to table--especially in VIP pits--playing five-figure hands. (These people aren't, and never were, so stupid that they wouldn't have known what was going on.) Third, the idea of a player leaving town with tens of thousands of dollars in high-denomination casino chips, and then showing back up the following weekend--or whenever--and playing with those chips, with no marker or cash buy-in, and without raising suspicions, heavily strains one's credulity. (These places keep very close track of their high-value chips and would know when a large quantity of them has left the premises--and why would the typical high-roller leave town with a boatload of chips?) And finally, although the author hints that the group experienced the ups and downs that one would expect with a ~0.1% statistical advantage, the rate at which this team apparently won suggests a much-higher, impossible advantage. (Card-counting, difficult though it is to do well, does not require mathematical genius, and the fact that one may possess mathematical genius will not--contrary to the implicit suggestion planted by this book--turn him into some kind of super-freak card-counter.)In short, this book, well-written and interesting though it may be, reads like fiction. I have no doubt that MIT students have played team blackjack and have even been moderately successful, but this story is simply too much to take at face value."},{"Title":"Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T. Students Who Took Vegas for Millions","review":"According to a Boston Globe article here ():\\"\\"Bringing Down the House\\" is not a work of \\"nonfiction\\" in any meaningful sense of the word. Instead of describing events as they happened, Mezrich appears to have worked more as a collage artist, drawing some facts from interviews, inventing certain others, and then recombining these into novel scenes that didn't happen and characters who never lived. The result is a crowd-pleasing story, eagerly marketed by his publishers as true - but which several of the students who participated say is embellished beyond recognition.\\"Moreover, the Globe continues, \\"Both Mezrich and the book's publisher, Simon and Schuster's Free Press, see nothing to apologize for. The book, they point out, was published with a disclaimer (in fine print, on the copyright page) warning that the names, locations, and other details had been changed, and that some events and individuals are composites, created from other events and individuals. Nearly all the details and facts in the book were culled from his research, Mezrich says, and where they were compressed or creatively rearranged, the fundamental truth of the story he tells is undiminished.\\"***So--like the fake Holocaust memoir and the false story of the white girl who grew up black L.A. street gangs--we have here a fictional book which is purporting to be pure non-fiction. It's being marketed as non-fiction. And it isn't. It is, at best, a broadly fictionalized account rather than a recounting of the actual occurrence.I would not object to paying for an entertaining piece of fiction on the subject. I would not even mind if the book were being marketed as a fictionalized account.It's the \\"well, we know it isn't what actually happened, but so what?\\" attitude that I find reprehensible."},{"Title":"Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T. Students Who Took Vegas for Millions","review":"I picked this book up from FLL's bookstore when I had a 5 hour wait till my flight, and I couldn't have been happier with my decision. It might have been the way it was just a random book I picked up, so I dont want to hype this book too much, that way you will have the same experience I did.It's a very fast paced reading. It's not a book with gobs of scenery and hidden meanings, which really adds to the book because it gives it the feeling of being told the story first hand, instead of reading a polished work of literary art. It was enough to keep a 18 year who doesnt read for fun very often interested in the Fort Lauderdale Airport until his flight boarded, then couldn't stop reading during the flight, then the drive home and and even had to pick up the moment he finished unpacking his bags.I'd love to give Ben Mezrich all the credit, he did a great job with this story. But as the book starts, it shows the main character Kevin telling him to write a book about his life and Ben sceptical. Then eventually, after listening enough he gives in. He was given a gift from God, any writer (well, good writer) could turn a story this interesting into a bestseller.I cant wait for the movie to come out, but so far things dont look good. Im not sure if you have seen the previews, but if you havent and you are planning on reading the book, keep it that way. They make sure to say that it was \\"inspired by a true story.\\" That doesnt mean \\"follows\\" or \\"is pretty much like\\" it means \\"we took this story and it gave us an idea of what to make to put onto the big screen.\\" The movie looks phenomenal, dont get me wrong. Im just hoping they wont turn this great story into the Vegas-movie hollywood cut-out.As you can see by the 5 stars, I obviously enjoyed it very much. I reccomend to anybody who likes fast-paced action-packed stories who doesnt spend most of their time with their nose in a novel and just wants to have fun following Kevin take Vegas by the balls."},{"Title":"Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T. Students Who Took Vegas for Millions","review":"This book is about an MIT graduate's adventures in a blackjack team where he learns how to count cards and win big bucks against the casinos.The first 70 or so pages cover Kevin's introduction to blackjack and the team concept, and his training. After that the book really takes off and describes highlights of his experiences over the next 4 years. It covers the good times and bad, the play, the parties, the barrings, the team discord, and the danger.Alot of the book strongly reminded me of Ken Uston's adventures back in the late 70's and early 80's. This book implies the team concept was new to them, but it's all been done before.If you have bought other blackjack books and are interested in blackjack, you will definitely enjoy Kevin's adventures. Be warned, this book does not cover anything about how to count cards and does not introduce any systems."},{"Title":"Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T. Students Who Took Vegas for Millions","review":"\\"Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six MIT Students Who Took Vegas for Millions\\" is a delicious look at unlikely winners.I'm no great fan of gambling, and see what gambling boats are doing to lower the quality of living as they creep up around Chicagoland. Hence, I derive great pleasure from reading about how a few smart kids beat Las Vegas at its own game.Statistically based on finding suckers and losers, casinos 'always' win. And, if you discover a way to beat a casino, you get kicked out. The only ones to stay are those who won because of luck, not smarts (because the house knows they're likely to lose it all). MIT is known for bringing in and graduating kids who know math about as well as math could be known. Usually, the school is asociated with cranking out thick-glasses, math-geek gerbils who spin the wheels of science. They are more likely to win Nobel prizes than blackjack. Still, they are smarter than most of us, and really aren't the thin stereotype we imagine.This story has so many angles to enjoy. The underdog winning. The geek beating the tough guys. Basic math and quick thinking winning. And of course, these kids are doing what most of won't do: win a boatload of money.Let's bring DeNiro, Hoffman, and some other great stars together, as well as a few of the \\"Revenge of the Nerds\\" crowd to get a made-for-TV movie going. I'd watch it.I fully recommend \\"Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six MIT Students Who Took Vegas for Millions\\" by Ben Mezrich.

Students Who Took Vegas for Millions","review":"\\"Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T. Students Who Took Vegas for Millions\\" is simply a rip-off of Ken Uston. In his books: \\"The big player: How a team of blackjack players made a million dollars\\" and \\"Million Dollar Blackjack\\" Uston explains how he and his team actually did make big bucks playing blackjack. Mezrich's tale is a pale shadow of the real life and times of Ken Uston.Uston also made card counting legal in Atlantic City by taking his exclusion from the casinos all the way to the Supreme Court and winning. Somehow that decision hasn't been applied to the casinos in Nevada. They still have \\"the right to refuse service to anyone\\" for any reason whatsoever. As a result of Uston's activism, the Atlantic City casinos have had to resort to playing only multiple deck blackjack which is not as potentially profitable as single deck blackjack.In Mezrich's story, the protagonists take advantage of the better Las Vegas blackjack games, but they and Mezrich fail to appreciate the full importance of team play, which smoothes out the extreme volatility of the game, or to give credit to the casinos for not employing idiots. For a better perspective on the volatility of blackjack and the competence of casino staff, you should read Stanford Wong's \\"Professional Blackjack\\" or Ford's \\"How To Gamble At The Casinos Without Getting Plucked Like A Chicken\\".The commercial success of \\"Bringing Down the House\\" is proof-positive that P.T.

There are several reviews that provide you a synopsis of this book, so I won't repeat one here. It is a very entertaining book and a quick and easy read. You don't have to fully understand the game to enjoy the book; however, you had better FULLY understand the technique described in the book before you attempt to employ it at an actual casino. Like flying airplanes, doing it is harder than reading about it, and mistakes are costly.

Students Who Took Vegas for Millions","review":"I have told so many people about this book and it just doesn't get old to tell it again. I have been a gambler for a lot of years and blackjack was really my first experience in casino gambling. Back then I bought several blackjack books and read and studied with the idea that I could make an income playing. Like most players, I never really understood the finer points or the relatively small edge a single player/counter had against the house. This is an enjoyable, fast read that sometimes reads like fiction but enough documentation has been provided to lean toward at least most of the story being true. Anyone who has played and been around blackjack for a long time can remember Ken Huston's \\"Million Dollar Blackjack\\" book and the big player stories which are so similar to the ones described here. To assemble a team like in this book is many blackjack players' dream of a lifetime. I couldn't put it down.

Students Who Took Vegas for Millions","review":"In the summer after his Junior year at MIT, Kevin Lewis' double life began when he was invited to join one of the MIT Blackjack teams operated by a former assistant professor at MIT, Mickey Rosa. Funded by shadowy investors to the tune of $1 million, Lewis and his team spent the next 6 years taking trips to casino centers around the country under fake names and IDs with wads of hidden cash, often strapped under their clothing, raking in a sizeable return on investment with their system of card counting explained in detail. Strippers, VIP suites, rubbing shoulders with celebrities, front row tickets to sold out shows etc. all became a part of Lewis' life.This was Ben Mezrich's first non-fiction endeavor, and a respectable one at that. A supercharged account of how the casinos were taken legally for a few years in the 1990s. Included in the book is a detailed explanation of how the MIT Blackjack card counting system worked."},{"Title":"Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T.

The first 75 pages or so set everything up, sometimes a little slowly, then from that point on it seems to pick up alot of momentum and I literally could not put it down from there to the end. That's where the team makes its first trip to Las Vegas with the new guy Kevin (the lead character of this story) and the adventure really begins.I didn't really care for the \\"flash forward\\" present day chapters that intermingled with the chronological story that took up the rest of the chapters. And I didn't care for the excessive background descriptions of everything and everybody's histories.Stop reading now if you don't want to read a couple of *minor* spoilers.............There were some scenes that seemed a little too outrageous to be true, like one of the main players getting beaten up in the Bahamas the first time they go there, by somebody who may or may not have been tracking them when they were in Vegas. And near the very end, what happens to his married friends' apartment and then what somebody leaves on Kevin's kitchen counter that causes him to really rethink how safe his card-counting career is...those situations seemed almost too Hollywood to be true.

Yeah, the prose is a little pulpy and a bit awkward at times, but the story is a structuralist's dream, with a narrative arc that propels the story along. It's the kind of book that you can't pull down, even as you notice that it doesn't have a lot going on below its surface.There's a lot of things that could be sorted out and explored. We don't know much about the characters other than their surfaces. The entire world of this book has a truncated and fragmented feeling. The text seems unconcerned with a larger world of meaning, giving it an oddly insular feeling. Also, some of the aspects of this ostensible work of nonfiction seem a bit stretched to highten the drama.And yet, it was a very fun read indeed.Couldn't help feeling as I was reading that it would make an excellent movie. It would have elements of movies that have been popular, such as Rain Man, Ocean's Eleven, Goodfellas, and Revenge of the Nerds, but there's enough novelty in the premise to keep it fresh. A film could play on a visual level with some of the underdeveloped themes, such as the notion that blackjack functions as a solvent of the identity, that it leads the team to adopt new identities, at one point actually leading them to disguises, professional prosthetics and theatrical makeup. Also, in contrast to some of those movies, this one wouldn't feature self-assured, slick con men played by someone like George Clooney. Rather, this could use the talents more of someone not as \\"Hollywood\\" would could turn in a more nuanced role as an MIT geek who happens to play at being a high roller. (Dean Cain has \\"the look\\" mentioned in the book).Oddly enough, this doesn't make me want to go to Vegas. The life described seems hollow and disconnected from any meaning. (Also, I feel I'm too old and jaded to go chasing after pots of gold!) However, reading it was a fun way to spend several hours."},{"Title":"Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T.

I seriously doubt if this will ever be made into a film, considering the subject matter and how Vegas investors most likely have ties to the entertainment industry; but, it would make a GREAT suspense/action thriller. No, I take that back: it IS a great suspense/action thriller. My only beef, if I had to have one, is the somewhat weak ending.

His description of the high roller lifestyle in Vegas takes you to the tables playing sums you watch others wager with the adrenaline rush like you were part of the team. I bought the book in Boston having just missed him at a book signing and had a hardtime finishing the conference.

Anybody who knows anything about gambling knows that you don't throw around $500 chips and not get a visit every minute from the pit boss. Not to mention, your picture is taken everywhere you go and passed around casinos. Furthermore, they recognize card counting by bet variation and throw you out.

The only thing I wondered about the book was how much of it was the honest truth since its more interesting than most fiction."},{"Title":"Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T. Students Who Took Vegas for Millions","review":"I first heard about this when I read that Kevin Spacey had purchased the movie rights to the book and after reading it over the course of five or six days I can see why he snatched it up.This will make an excellent film.I've never read much about card counting or blackjack. All I knew of it came from movies like Casino or through my research on the game for my last job as an internet gambling software developer. BDtH covers some of the basics of the game, enough for people who haven't sat at the felt with enough knowledge to follow through but not so much to bore those who are \\"experts\\". It also introduces more details on card counting and other ways to increase the player's odds against the casino from the inherent disadvantage usually present in the game. Many times throughout the book it is noted that card counting is not illegal in the U.S., but it is obviously frowned on and policed by Vegas casinos and those suspected of doing it are banned for life and can be arrested if they returned to a casino they've been banned from. The key to being a successful card counter is being skilled at both playing and not getting caught. But individual card counters never get very far because the range of bet fluctuations needed to hold an advantage over the house makes the counting very obvious and gets them banned in short order (rumours of much more severe punishments from casinos during the mob era are mentioned as well...think Joe Pesci taking you for a drive in the desert). That is where the smart group of MIT students story begins during a decade marked by incessant greed.I don't read non-fiction very often, and this is Mezrich's first published attempt after six fiction works, but he tells a good story and his basis for the material is really interesting. It's not a particularly long book and I was left wanting more; more information on others in the book and more answers to the questions that multiplied in my head in the closing pages of the book. Even so, I recommend this book to everyone, but perhaps wait for a paperback edition if you are going to buy it."},{"Title":"Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T. Students Who Took Vegas for Millions","review":"Bringing Down the House describes a few years in the lives of a handful of cocky, largely socially-clueless MIT nerds who bring their math skills to Las Vegas for enormous profit. Card counting is their game, combined with an elaborate network of aliases, codes, teamwork, and later, disguises. The intracacies of their plan, while not hard to understand, were nevertheless brilliant, and clearly gave them an advantage over the casinos. Their techniques were clearly described in BDTH, complete with analogies and tricks to make blackjack and the way to beat its odds even more comprehensible to the non-player.The players got fantastically greedy around the same time the casinos got more sophisticated in their methods of tracking cheats and card counters. You get the impression that main character Kevin Lewis and his gang were very, very lucky not to have gotten in more trouble than described in the book (which amounted to a slap on the wrist, really); and you also appreciate the amazing, disgusting greed that kept the group going back for more despite obscene winnings and warnings that would have scared smarter (socially, that is, not book-wise) people away. Las Vegas, and the nation's casino network, really, became too small a place for their card-counting organization to operate, especially when you learn that MIT operated several teams (and that the tech school wasn't the only game in town, either).Mezrich does a great job of devising dialogue and scene details that could not have been remembered to the same degree. He also adds an element of credibility to the tale by going through some of its subjects' steps himself, such as transporting cash strapped to his person through airport security, and counting a few rounds in a major casino. What he doesn't do, however, is make the reader like any of the main characters- they all come across as phony jerks who slip too easily into slimy alter egos. There are a few times when Mezrich tries to keep \\"the real\\" Kevin Lewis separate from his gaming personas, and describe him as winsome in the process, but to no avail. Lewis, Martinez, Fisher, etc. were too convincing in playing slimeballs, and acting like they thought the world was their oyster, to calmly come back to Earth and resume their humble Boston identities.There was also some \\"David-vs-Goliath\\" nonsense spouted by the card players, who viewed themselves as valiantly undermining evil corporate casinos as they counted at the blackjack tables. The nobility of their efforts quickly became dubious, though, with each mention of big money spent at strip clubs, steak dinners, and tipping bar doormen. These were all kids of privilege, too, by the sounds of it, and most likely ended up working for the very evil corporate world that they foolishly imagined themselves railing against.Although this story was tightly knit and felt complete, there are some missing pieces that I'm still curious about: who were some of the people responsible for funding the MIT teams (i.e., who provided the seed money for the gambling excursions)? Who ratted out Kevin Lewis' team, and who was responsible for the shakedowns and threats that scared them away? Why would the players confide in author Ben Mezrich, without fear of retaliation or dragging down anyone else still in the game?"},{"Title":"Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T.

Reading it makes me regret that I never had the opportunity to do the same thing.The book did have some problems though; I found the way that the author liked to intersperse the book with chapters from the present to be somewhat annoying. For example, there is a chapter where the author (and not the protagonists) interview a security official at a casino, to have him describe their &quot;card counter countermeasures&quot;. The author was trying to foreshadow and build up the suspense, but I found it to be filler. That particular chapter should have been in the appendix, in my opinion.

It's been around - in one form or another - for almost two decades. Recently, we've taken things to a whole new level. And we want to invite you to come aboard.\\" \\"We're going to hit Vegas.\\" Naturally Kevin was skeptical at first.\\"So you guys cheat at cards?\\"\\"Absolutely not. We don't alter any of the rules or mess with the nature of the game. We use our brains to take advantage of arbitrage opportunities. Blackjack is beatable - so we beat it. We beat the heck out of it.\\"Over the next four years, this MIT Blackjack Team made their way through Chicago, Louisiana but mostly the bigger casinos of Las Vegas, aptly known as \\"Sin City.\\" They brought aliases, disguises, plenty of cash, and, more importantly, their winning system, which included secret gestures and code words. They fully understood the statistical nature of Blackjack and took full advantage of it. But, as always, there's a lesson to be learned. \\"The most important decision a card counter ever has to make is the decision to walk away.\\"Exhilarated right from page one. I enjoyed the intensity of the game, the outrageously high stakes and the excitement of the casino world. I was taken to places I've been before (and reliving the experience) and places I've only heard about. Much of the excitement came from knowing that, although this reads like a fiction novel, it isn't. This is Ben Mezrich's seventh novel, but his first non-fiction."},{"Title":"Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T.

Ben Mezrich does a great job of recreating the story of Kevin Lewis and all of the other genius card counters.

This is one of those books that you just can't put down once you start reading. The amazing true and recent story about some MIT kids who went into Vegas and took millions. It walks you through the events as seen by one of the kids, how he got into it, what he did to stay in it, how he played blackjack with NBA stars like Patrick Ewing and how he ultimately was forced out of the action. Anyone who has ever gone to Vegas has dreamed about winning big, what these people did was amazing and even more amazingly it was legal! After reading this book you will want to grab a deck of cards and try to do what they did.

I still can't imagine what it would have been like to have sat next to Kevin, Fisher, or Martinez betting thousands of dollars per hand and taking home millions of dollars per person. The author makes you feel like your right there in the casino, winning and losing along with the whole MIT team. This book is very easy to read. At times I couldn't put it down because the action was so intense. By the time your through reading it, you might want to quit your job, leave your family, and move to Las Vegas in hopes of becoming a professional card player."},{"Title":"Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T.

I zipped through this easy read in a few days, perhaps more interested in the story than others because I knew these people in college. I loved the 'fictional' descriptions of old friends I recognized immediately.This is an entertaining, fast-paced read, and the fact that it's true makes it that much more exciting. Who cares if there are some narrative discrepancies?I can't wait for this movie to come out. It's going to be better than Good Will Hunting, The Recruit, and Blown Away put together."},{"Title":"Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T. Students Who Took Vegas for Millions","review":"When I first heard that there was a book by a bunch of MIT students on a trip to Vegas, I was less than interested. Then I found out the book is about how they took a team card-counting scheme to the City of Sin and walked out with millions. Finally the word-of-mouth hype got the better of me, and I decided that maybe it was worth reading.I decided wisely. This was probably the most fun I've ever had reading non-fiction. Follow six MIT students across the US hitting casino after casino getting rich, getting popular, and eventually getting in over their heads. From Vegas to Foxwoods, these guys counted cards like no one ever had before. Their system utilized a basic card-counting strategy, but at a team level. They revolutionzed and perfected the team card-counting process so that it was nearly impossible to spot. But eventually they find that all good things have to come to an end.Either way, this book was great. Not only fun to read, but quick as well. You can probably tear through this in a weekend. If you like Blackjack, if you have ever tried to count cards, or even if you've never played the game before, this book is a trip that shouldn't be missed. My only regret is that casino-owners all over the world have read this by now and will be paying closer attention for the MIT system. Too bad...."},{"Title":"Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T. Students Who Took Vegas for Millions","review":"Despite recent allegations of factual inaccuracies and narrative exaggerations, most prominently in a recent Boston Globe article, Mezrich still cranks out a thoroughly engaging read. I finished this book in five days, which is fast for me, especially considering I had a major paper due on the fifth day. This book is compelling, although not the most well-written work I have ever come across. The prose is adequate, no more, no less. The lead characters are reasonably well-developed, but again, there is substantial room for improvement in that regard. The hook is the story, which draws you in even if you are not a gambler.Even considering that certain events and characters are fabricated to varying degrees, plotting is \\"Bringing Down the House's\\" greatest strength. The story moves quickly and believably. As Mezrich points out numerous times, card counting is not illegal, so casino bosses can't have you arrested and won't physically harm you if you get caught. Unlike in the unfaithful movie adaptation \\"21,\\" the worst that will happen to you is that you will get thrown out of the casino and eventually blacklisted. No running through kitchens away from vengeful security guards or any such nonsense like that - maybe twenty or thirty years ago your health and safety would be in jeopardy, but not today or even in the 1990s, which is when the book is set. Mezrich is smart enough to not try to convince you otherwise; the producers of \\"21\\" are not (he also didn't include a pointless romance with the main character and one of the female players). Even in the sole scene when one of the players does get assaulted (not by a casino security guard), it is presented in a way that doesn't stretch credibility, even though it never actually happened. The same can be said for the book's denouement, which is also largely fictionalized.While it should be noted that the group of MIT students in this book are not the progenitors of the card-counting techniques or team strategies to \\"beat Vegas,\\" that doesn't change the fact that their story is still quite interesting. One serious issue I take with this book is that the non-fiction label is questionable; putting a vague disclaimer at the book's beginning does not justify the kinds of manipulations performed on the existing material. Nevertheless, despite its numerous problems with authenticity; writing style, which is a bit flaccid; and characterizations, some of which are a little generic, it's a quick read that is worthwhile, if not entirely rewarding."},{"Title":"Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T.

So why I'm I reading about a group of narcisists who like to go to Las Vegas and gamble. Because when David beats Goliath it becomes an adventure, if David does it more than once it is then a true life survival story.The fact that a extremely astute person can get even a little of the edge over the great gambling institutions is intriquing. The idea that this little edge can be levereged further by using a team is brilliant. So brilliant the casinos go to great lengths to make it impossible. The battle of these underdogs vs. the storied Vegas with it's greed and power ups the ante (no pun inteded).It is downright fun watching Vegas go down even if the hubris these privileged primadonas exude seems to make them less like you and me and more like jerks. If they weren't going up against an entity detested more than \\"big oil\\" we may not root them on...But, you will root for them as they leave carnage in the pits because you know given the opportunity, you would do the same (hopefully you would not let it become your life and religion since your moral compass balances you).Ben Mezrich's book is a bit slight, but is fun and you'll likely zip through it in a couple of sittings because it has good tension and the constant thrill provided by the six is palpable as they manipulate the odds."},{"Title":"Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T.

Also, I liked the main character, Kevin Lewis, and how he began to question that person he was turning into and the lifestyle that he had chosen.

Students Who Took Vegas for Millions","review":"Bringing Down the House is Ben Mezrich's non-fiction story about how college students took Las Vegas for millions of dollars. If you didn't know this story was non-fiction before you started reading, you probably would have never guessed it. The book has almost all the aspects of a good novel, in which there are characters who some could identify with, as well as a unique personality, and a good plot. The only quality the book lacks is a great ending, which the author has no say in because of how the true-life story played out. This is one of the few weaknesses of the book. The book includes some great characters like Kevin Lewis, Fischer and Martinez. All of them have very unique personalities. Kevin Lewis is a whiz kid from MIT who just wanted to have some fun. Fischer was a big, burly guy on a mission to break Vegas and make a living off of it. Martinez is a free spirited, fun-loving guy who also wants to make some money and have fun. Ben Mezrich does a great job expressing the emotions and the personalities of the book, making this one of the major strengths of the book. A final strength of the book is the ability of the author to show life in Vegas.This is Ben Mezrich's first non-fiction book, and it is impressive. Ben has written seven other books throughout his career as a writer. These include, Reaper, which was turned into a TBS movie. His books have sold over one million copies in nine different languages. He is also a 1991 graduate of Harvard.The movie, based on the book, 21 has probably helped make more people aware of Mezrich's story.

Students Who Took Vegas for Millions","review":"Anyone who has played blackjack will get an immediate rush and contact high from this book. It is the true story of \\"Kevin Lewis\\" who with a group of friends from MIT took casinos all over the country for hundreds of thousands of dollars. Actually \\"took\\" is the wrong word, because what they did was perfectly legal card counting, which seems nearly impossible with a six deck shoe. Legal but verboten to casinos, who took it VERY personally. Actually what they did was not new, the same disguises and team play had been done earlier by a genius named Ken Uston, back in the 70's. But \\"Kevin\\" and his team took it to a new level and you have to admire the brilliance of their play. You also get to view firsthand the greed and abuse of the casinos and are secretly rooting for Kevin and his team to break the bank. A reviewer on the inside jacket of the book said that this story made him want to gamble. It had the exact opposite effect on me. No amount of money could make it worth the threats and harassment they faced once they were \\"made\\", and it wasn't only the casinos who were after them. But for anyone who has gambling in their blood, this is a fascinating look at the Las Vegas of today, along with Indian reservation casinos all over the country. UPDATE: Enjoy the book, but stay away from the stinker of a movie, which I saw yesterday.

The story is already interesting, but Ben Mezrich managed to bring it to life. The author managed to keep you on your toes and wanting to read more. With this book you will not become a master at card counting but you will begin to get a better understanding of the art and you can get a grasp on the concept. The author's style of writing is different than many others. He does not take the extra time to explain every single detail, but instead has just enough to let you make a picture and not enough to make you fall asleep.

It started as a team of six MIT college students playing blackjack in their dorm, and learning a way of \\"counting cards\\" called the hi-lo theory. They then took their skills to Vegas where they then met money and the trouble that goes with it. The author Ben Mezrich was able to get inside the group and get the inside story to make one novel that gets you from start to finish.Bringing Down the House relates to anybody who has ever gambled or even thought about it. The book is even a little bit of manual on how to play blackjack, it even tells you how to count cards and cheat your way to the top. It tells you how far casinos go to bust you, and how you get treated in the \\"back room\\". It shows you how the \\"whales\\" treat the dealers, and how a thousand dollar tip is nothing to blink at.

Students Who Took Vegas for Millions","review":"Mr. Mezrich hits his stride in the book with this one passage:\\"Kevin looked around the room at the cabal of young blackjack players. When it was just Martinez and Fisher, it seemed seedy but manageable. Two rebellious geniuses siphoning money from the casino. But this was something else- organized, calculated, put together by a charismatic adult with bad teeth and a brilliant pedigree.\\"I liked the writing, as it had a good, escapist and sarcastic tone. However, taking this story, as it is told, as fact is too much of stretch for me. Rather, Mezrich embellishes every chance he gets, and in hopes of getting the book optioned for a movie, has written something that reads little more than a first-treatment for a script to be produced by the likes of Dreamworks or New Line Cinema.While I see it as more fiction than fact, Bringing Down the House does possess a few redeeming merits. The kids, bored with the usual academic games which they have thoroughly mastered and fully excel at, decide to turn their attention to the oldest and lowest form of the Vegas Heist- card counting. The kids, all of them brilliant, all of them pampered, cultured and most importantly, cocooned, seek to break out of their rut by sticking it to The Man. The trouble is, The Man in this case has a history of dealing a death hand to people who try to cheat him.Which, in my mind, makes this story much, much less than credible. Mezrich overtly tries to imply throughout the book that Las Vegas has parted with its more colorful and violent gangster roots, and all activity in Sin City is above-board and legitimate. If you believe that, then you also believe in such lovely fantasies as the Tooth Fairy and Santa Claus. Rather than going legit, the Good Fellahs who run Vegas have found a way to legitimize their thoroughly illegitimate activities. Only now, much like the Asian protagonist with the Anglicized name, the hoods running the big gambling houses also have Anglicized their names.In the end, this book definitely qualifies as every (male) nerd's wet dream. It shows geeks on the inside- hobnobbing with celebs, beautiful (and preferably big bosomed) girls at their beck and call, swank digs, and free-flowing booze on demand, and as such represents more of an unattainable fantasy than the more pedestrian reality.Why do I say this? Because the author always shows them winning. Granted, in one scene they lose a small amount, and in another, they get roughed up a bit, but in the end, they win big. This is not what happens in the real world.In sum, enjoy this book as really good faction, but please, whatever you do, don't act on it, as you might the reality to be much more painful (and permanent) than that which Mr. Mezrich depicts."},{"Title":"Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T.

Kevin always knows people from phisics and linear algebra classes that he took and those are classes you take in the first year of an engineering course, altough he was already in his senior year when the story begins. There are no mentions of specific details about MIT (even I know about the Infinite Corridor) or more specific engineering courses that the main character might be taking. There are also several mentions to students that are in the &quot;honors track&quot; or that &quot;honored in molecular engineering&quot;. As far as I know, MIT does not have honors lists, only two or three awards per class if that. And how about a part Chinese, part Brazilian guy named Jason Fisher? Also, why would the casinos spend so much money hosting guys that won tons of money. I always thought that their interest was in atracting big money losers. And how stupid would the casinos have to be so as not to notice right away a guy that checks in under two different names.It might just be the bad writing, but the book left me with the impression of being a total fake as non-fiction.

My guess, is most people would award at least one or two less stars. True, there are some exciting scenes which drive one to turn pages, but I suspect the interest in, and praise of, this book is due primarily to the fact that people believe, or want to believe, the story about how these college students made a killing playing blackjack at various casinos, by using basic card counting techniques, and playing as a \\"team\\" (alerting the main player as to when the deck became slightly more favorable to the player).I have played blackjack many many times and have never seen any decent player split tens under any circumstances, even with a \\"ten rich\\" deck and the dealer showing six. With these players, this seems to be a common strategy . Have you ever been to a casino on a typical Saturday night? Could a seat be available for a \\"team player\\" to jump right in when the deck gets \\"ten rich\\"? Have you ever seen anybody in the VIP section bouncing around from table to table like these players apparently did all the time?The fact is that anyone can claim that he won big in a casino, but, unless that player is directly observed, or the contents of his wallet monitored, one simply cannot tell if he's telling the truth. In other words, the claims made in this book are totally unverifiable, and most likely false. (Isn't it interesting, for instance, how the main character makes tons of money at the tables, but seems to have difficulty paying his rent).Alot of the reviewers say that they planned on using the card-counting techniques espoused in this book to clean up at the casinos. Did anybody actually have success doing this (besides, of course, the casino owners, who probably enjoyed this book very much)? I didn't think so."},{"Title":"Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T.

Kevin Lewis, Martinez, Fisher, and others did just that 25 times a year for five consecutive years. Bringing Down the House by Ben Mezrich tells the story of six MIT students who learn to count cards and win millions in Vegas.Led by a slightly crazy former MIT professor named Mickey, the MIT team revolutionized the way casinos thought about card counters. Kevin Lewis, at the time, was Mickey's newest recruit. After passing numerous tests given to him by the team, Kevin gets his chance to play in Vegas with the team. His first attempt was a success and he was instantly hooked.Kevin Lewis was an exceptional student, from his high school prep school days through his admittance to MIT. Kevin was a student who never deviated from focusing on his studies. His recreational activity was being a member of his college swim team. Nothing exciting ever happened to Kevin, so when he was asked to join the card counting team he saw it as a way out of his very mundane life. Up until that moment, Kevin's biggest worry was missing a day helping his professor in the science lab. This particular character attempts to take one giant leap from geeky scholar to high roller. These two traits being so incongruent took him on journey with no set boundaries where he had no control. In the end Kevin realized that taking risks must be tempered with cautiousness.This is the first book that I have read for school or pleasure that I did not want to put down for one moment. This novel is an intriguing non-fiction novel that reads likes fiction. It is hard to believe that this actually occurred, but the author brings the reader back to reality in the end when there is no final closure as the characters continue to live there lives. I would suggest this book for anybody of any age who enjoys the fine line between fiction and reality."},{"Title":"Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T. Students Who Took Vegas for Millions","review":"This has got to be one of the most intriguing non-fiction books of all time. It's basically how a group of MIT students combine together and take millions from major Casinos. Using team play, sound probability, expert training, and skill, they do the impossible and create havoc for the Casinos, and later themselves.This book describes it all, and yes, it's better than any made up story a fiction writer could produce. Mezrich describes how Kevin Lewis became involved in what later became a lifestyle of glamor, big money, and even woman. Kevin goes from a geeky swimmer at MIT to a big player winning big money.Mezrich knows how to weave the story. First he discusses the introduction, then the frightening orientation. He delves into the mathematics, the strategy, and how the teammates fit into what character roles. He shows how intricate the team aspect of blackjack works, and how they capitilized on it. Both seedy and genious, it sheds a whole new life on blackjack and casino gambling.After that, he then starts showing how Casinos work, especially how they treat you when you're a big player versus when you're a card counter. Without giving too much away, this story not only deals with the winning, but also with the repercussions. Mezrich brings into the lifestyle, not only with the glamor, but also the suspense and terror that accompanies it.This books is one of those few books that you cannot put down. It's a great story and most importunely, a great eye-opener. To top it off, it's all true.No one who reads this will be able to gamble the same way again. No exaggeration. Just pick up this book. I bet you can't put it down (terrible pun intended)."},{"Title":"Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T. Students Who Took Vegas for Millions","review":"Like other reviewers, it only took me a several hours to read. I like gambling stories (I'm a poker player) and I've read both of Michael Konik's books, which are also great. I would consider this a one of the top gamblers' story out there, not quite up-there as Alvarez' &quot;The Biggest Game in Town&quot; or Konik's &quot;More Gambling Stories&quot;, but close.I thought his writing was very smooth and really put you in the &quot;action&quot;. I entirely believe the details of Kevin Lewis' life as a counter as I worked for a software company based in Lincoln, MA and was told many times that the co-founders - all of Asian decent and MIT grads! - were part of the MIT blackjack team. (I don't know which one but their stories are similar to what Lewis tells.) So, I just had to read this book since I knew some of the MIT team personally.As I read the stories, it was not hard to imagine that they could've been on the very team he was on!So, if you like gambling stories, add this book to your collection . . . ."},{"Title":"Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T. Students Who Took Vegas for Millions","review":"I read an excerpt of this book in Wired Magazine and could not wait for it to come out in paperback. I was not disappointed. By now all readers know its about 6 brilliant MIT students coached by a former mathematics professor (Mickey Rosa) into a cool, cunning, and colorful cabal of casino raiders. For anyone who has been to Vegas it will conjur up memories of the flight to the desert, the gaming, the girls, the &quot;high-rollers&quot; and the over the top events that are all part of the magic of Sin City. But the twist here is that the player actually beats the house.Be prepared to be entertained. Though other reviewers were disappointed at the authors style or technical errors, the author develops his story through the narrative voice of one main MIT student(Kevin Lewis). Mezrich's pace, character development, transitions and story-telling ability are evident in just about every page and truly qualify this book as a page turner. Readers who like the &quot;can't put it down suspense&quot; of a Ludlum, will love this book.In an almost surreal aside, as I was 200+ pages into this enthralling book, I looked up to my TV to see none other than the &quot;real&quot; Mickey Rosa winning a Blackjack tournament at none other than the Mohegan Sun Casino. Is truth stranger than Fiction? Read the book and decide for yourself!! Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T. Students Who Took Vegas for Millions","review":"I have never been to Las Vegas; the last time I was in Atlantic City if there were casinos, I certainly didn't know about them; I have bet and lost a few dollars in slot machines. In other words, I know next to nothing about gambling and absolutely nothing about a gambler stacking the odds in his favor through intelligent, obsessive, dizzyingly difficult planning.Ben Mezrich's BRINGING DOWN THE HOUSE is bound to become a movie: it is non-fiction that reads like one of the most exciting, fascinating novels you could pick up. Briefly (and simplisticly) six M.I.T. &quot;nerd&quot; students set about to win big at the tables in Vegas...and they did...by learning to count the cards in games of Blackjack. Sound simple? Well, the planning and execution that this entails is unbelievably hard, especially for someone like myself who is no good with math and/or numbers and has no patience for details, whatsoever.I don't want to give away too many of Mezrich's surprises, but I promise you that his book is absolutely impossible to put down. When I didn't have a huge grin on my face, my mouth had dropped open in shock. This is a REAL caper adventure...one that I think I'd love to be a part of, but, upon reflection, know that it takes stronger hearts than mine. The guys who opened up their lives to Mezrich deserve everything they got. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED"},{"Title":"Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T.

Students Who Took Vegas for Millions","review":"I felt compelled as a former professional blackjack player to write a review of this popular book having just finished reading it this afternoon because it is fraught with exaggerations, half-truths, and fictions. I second the reviews that portray this book negatively from a technical perspective - John May's in particular. If I were a casino owner, I'd be handing this book out to every player who walks through the door because it continues to foster the myths of blackjack as a beatable game. Most wannabe card counters don't have the bankroll, discipline, or skill to even begin to approach beating this game. Long, long losing streaks are part of the scene, but the cards always seem to fall right for our band of heroes and the losing is nothing more than a minor annoyance.By the way, I sat right behind John Thompson, Patrick Ewing, and John Starks at the Foreman-Moorer fight at the MGM Grand. There were no young Asian men anywhere close to them as the book asserts. The tickets were comped by the Desert Inn, not the MGM.MIT players did not invent card counting, the simple HiLo count, shuffle tracking, or team play. Team play descriptions can be found in Ken Huston's book \\"Million Dollar Blackjack\\" that is now over twenty years old.I also find the \\"investor\\" story less than compelling - particularly during the timeframe the author indicates. Would I rather invest my money in a bunch of twenty something card counters or put my money in the high flying Internet stocks of that era with returns like 100-300%?The real story is that Mezrich is going to make a small fortune from the sale of the movie rights, to which I say \\"Pretty good scam, kid!\\" Now that's bringing down the house PT Barnum style!"},{"Title":"Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T. Students Who Took Vegas for Millions","review":"I'm not a blackjack player, but I do enjoy a good book. \\"Bringing Down the House\\" is a fast exciting read. But as I read I wanted to know more. Was the author being honest? After reading more than a hundred reviews I gained a new perspective in terms of the author, the subject, and the book critics.Readers who don't play the game, if they excuse some of the author's errors, will enjoy this book. It read likes fiction. If you take it at that level, with the understanding that some of what you're reading is true, you'll probably enjoy it immensely. You'll have to ignore some of the author's mistakes. For example, when he writes that Kevin's cheerleader girlfriend is touring with the Rams in the _spring_ it's pretty obvious that something is very wrong. Was the author misled? Maybe Kevin, the central character, was dating a cheerleader for the professional Arena Football League and wanted to spruce up his story by making her an NFL cheerleader? Hard to say. But it causes credibility problems given how glaring this mistake is.The second issue here is the depiction of playing blackjack. In the last chapter \\"Kevin\\" acknowledges that there will be periods of time where one loses and that it takes a huge bankroll to carry you through to the other side. That really isn't depicted in the book. One gets the impression that these MIT kids swooped in and kicked butt on every pass. The truth of matter is likely somewhat less glamorous. They probably won a lot and lost a lot, but came out ahead in the end.Another issue critics have raised is that anyone can count cards and one doesn't have to graduate from MIT to do it. Given the final chapter that seems to make sense. The author is guilty of some hype by stressing the MIT angle (let alone the fact that the title is extremely misleading). And \\"Kevin\\" is certainly guilty of embellishing his story and stressing parlor tricks (cutting the deck and playing so that a specific card is either given to the dealer or the player) over logical play.Then there is the issue of the math presented in the book. It's never clear just how much these people won. Some point to \\"Kevin's\\" claim at the end of the book that they never got less than a 30 percent return each year on behalf of their investors. Some charge that this proves there winnings were unimpressive. However, if Kevin's statement is taken along with the author's, then they did quite well.So do the math. The author states quite clearly that investors got 12 percent of the take. Say you have a total investment of 1 million dollars. The investors get 300,000. Now do the equation: .12x = 300,000. With x equalling total profit you get the total sum of 2.5 million dollars. That comes out to a 150% profit - not 30%! For every million they brought into the situation they took out an additional 1.5 million - each year. If (and it's a big if) this is true that makes for a fairly good profit margin.There seems to be two schools of thought regarding this book and its effect. There are those who think that the author gave away key secrets and has jeopardized card counting for all blackjack players. Then there are those who say the casinos love this book and would be happy to hand out copies to gamblers because it gives the impression that they can easily beat the house - which means more money for them. The truth is likely somewhere in the middle. To succeed at this, at least on the scale presented in the book, you likely need a large enough bankroll to absorb expected losses (which aren't really depicted in the book) and the ability to play intelligently and patiently. Chances are, the average gambler cannot do this. So perhaps its a little bit of both. The casinos like the false hype and are scared at the same time that someone will come along who can actually walk the walk.Last Word: Enjoy the fast read, but don't get caught up in the hype."},{"Title":"Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T. Students Who Took Vegas for Millions","review":"This book was a fun read, but one would have to be remarkably credulous to believe that it is non-fiction. Other reviewers have pointed out some of the obvious fictions. Here are a few more: People have been talking about team play for at least 20 years. There was nothing about the system used by the students that was particularly unique or clever. In fact, they used a very, very basic counting strategy. What's interesting to me is that the book seems plausible to people because its about MIT students. However, trained monkeys could pretty much run the system described in the book. The only advantage that being MIT students may have given these people is the arrogance to try to pull it off (and more important, probably the parents' money to get started).The spot cutting stuff was completely absurd.I have been &quot;banned&quot; from playing blackjack at four casinos in Vegas (its not hard to do--sit down at a high stakes table, start varying your bets significantly, and its likely to happen if you win). What casinos do not do is break into your room and rough you up when you are banned from playing. In fact, they have always been overly solicitous to me. I have been able to stay in the casinos (including as a guest when it has been places I am lodging) and play any games other than blackjack. I have even continued to receive comps after being banned from blackjack tables. And, fortunately, they haven't found out when I have been out of the country and chased me down to beat me up(laughable).This book was a huge besteller. If this team really did what the book claims, do you think that the members would now be popping up all over the media? Undoubtedly. However, given that its primarily fiction, I expect that we won't hear much from the MIT blackjack team(s)."},{"Title":"Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T. Students Who Took Vegas for Millions","review":"I suppose you could say this was a page-turner, since I did, and that it was a successful book since it left me wanting more, but I felt like the author left out a lot of detail that would have made the book even more of a forceful experience for the reader. Still, I am recommending the book. It won't necessarily add to your body of knowledge, but it will keep your interest. If you like the writing style of Mark Bowden, then you will probably like the way Mezrich writes. They are similar. You can read it easily in two evenings after work."},{"Title":"Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T. Students Who Took Vegas for Millions","review":"I did enjoy this book, and read it rather quickly. My problem is with the writing. The story is told in a way that forces the author to commit to writing in present tense and therefore he has to recreate conversations between the main \\"character\\" and other people he has possibly never met (I say possibly because he never mentions interviewing some of the other major players in the story). As you read, it smacks you in the face that every single character has the same voice. They all say the same things in the exact same way. I know that they all are of simmilar education and background, but surely they have different voices. My friends and I all come frome the same background, but we all don't speak with exactly the same perspectives.That being said, the story is good enough to push past the bad writing. It follows a predicatable arc, but I like it when the little guy screws over the big guy, so 4reading about these geeks taking it to the casinos was fun.Don't look for this to be an instructional book (there is a bit of arrogance that comes through the text that if you are not an MIT genious, then you can't dream of acheiving their success), in fact the main man in the story writes an essay at the end that basically says that the casinos have found a way to make their system of conting cards harder. He then hints that he and his genious friends have worked out a better system. i don't know, but I smell a follow up book."},{"Title":"Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T. Students Who Took Vegas for Millions","review":"Sure, a few parts were a little unlikely, especially the Bahamas incident, but most of the skepticism I'm seeing in the reviews is misplaced. I belonged to a blackjack team for a few years and the parts about how this team worked (there have been several MIT teams) rang true for me. I suspect I've even met some of the characters.Regarding winning: A good team playing good strategy has a positive edge over the house. If they have enough players putting enough hours in, the team should tend to win most of the time, just as the casino tends to win against normal players. Regarding staying in the hotels: most normal players who bet $500 a hand don't play anonymously - they expect special treatment. They expect to get a limo, free food, shows, a nice suite. To turn down all the comps actually can look a little suspicious and might even make you MORE likely to get spotted as a counter. Plus, you could waste a lot of time getting to and from that off-strip room, and time is money.Moving money around like they did is hard to avoid if you're doing weekend trips - you fly in Friday night, you want access to your money right away. Plus, the person who needs the money next might not be the one who had it last, and you can't safely give the whole team access to a safe deposit box in another state.Anyway, I recommend this book to anyone who is curious how big-money blackjack teams work. It's a good read."},{"Title":"Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T. Students Who Took Vegas for Millions","review":"Ben Mezrich takes a potentially fascinating (and true) story that could have shone at the keyboard of a more talented writer and turns it into a listless and shallow book that is too thin to even function as a doorstop. The book never goes beneath the surface of the characters in a way that enables any connection at all, never really explains what specific talents make for a successful blackjack player, and altogether leaves too many loose ends hanging and unresolved. Repeated failure to establish context or factual reasons for some of the elaborate behaviors described in the book is another flaw. For example, the gamblers/players go to great lengths to hide the cash they bring to Las Vegas but we never learn whether the reasons are related to any specific laws or what they are trying to gain compared to the option of simply stacking bills in carry-on luggage (on domestic flights). Finally, I was disappointed when I figured out the scale of the enterprise and determined that the absolute numbers involved were much smaller than the title and publisher's hype would imply and the returns on investment were much more modest than one might expect.If the author was a stereotypical MIT grad who never saw the inside of a classroom where writing was being taught, then one might understand how this book might have been published for the curiosity value. According to the book jacket this is not the case, however, so its stands [droops] as a monument to the poor judgments of a publisher and editor who should have told the author to start over.If I had not been on a trip where this was the only book I had with me, I never would have finished reading it."},{"Title":"Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T. Students Who Took Vegas for Millions","review":"This book is an account of the the MIT kids who used brains and wits to become highly successful card counters. They used the basic hi-lo method, which can identify those intervals in a game when the deck is such that the odds are with the player. This allows a counter to adjust his bets in accordance with the favorabiliy of the deck, and grind out a modest profit over a long period of time. A counter could not adjust his bets too much or he would be spotted as a counter and asked to leave the casino.The MIT kids worked in teams and improved upon this method to make it more lucrative. The key to their success was placing a consistently low betting card counter at various tables and using signals to insert a heavy betting player into a game when the deck was favorable. Thus, they only made the huge bets when they had the odds, and the person who actually did the counting was not noticeable. Their story is a fascinating one, but it would have been a lot better if someone else had written it.The author's annoying snobbery runs all through the book. He comes across as a self-annointed high priest of multiculturalism, showing his contempt for lesser mortals, such as businessmen, hicks, white men in bowling shirts, and people from the Midwest - which is a pejorative term in this book. Of course, he throws in a gratuitous (and unbelievabley trite) anecdote about a successful black card counter.He also tries way too hard to show off his writing skills, and ends up adding about 50 pages of worthless detail. Here is how he describes someone picking up the phone: \\"He wiped his hands on his jeans and chased down the incessant sound. He found the portable jammed beneath one of the couch cushions and kicked off his shoes as he pressed the rumbling hunk of plastic against his his ear.\\"Its a great story if you can tolerate an idiot author.--- For a good description of the hi-lo method, and other technical strategies similar to those used by the MIT kids, read \\"Professional Blackjack\\" by Stanford Wong."},{"Title":"Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T.

Students Who Took Vegas for Millions","review":"Based on a true story, \\"Bringing Down the House\\" offers comedy, suspense, drama, and the feeling that you too have won millions and that you're ready to take on the house, just by reading it. Kevin Lee, an MIT student with amazing skills in math, was recruited by two friends to join them in a Blackjack club at school in the mid 90's. From here, the book takes us on a neon-filled and highflying spree as Kevin and his team travel to and from Las Vegas, winning millions by taking advantage of the house rules. The book slows down when the action suddenly stops as the author, Ben Mezrich, takes us from the 90's to present time (2002, when the book was published) where the he tracks down main players to interview them. These parts lack the spark the other scenes offer. When Kevin is on his first gambling escapade, he learns all new casino terminology. These jargon has actually helped me understand a lot more of the dialogue from the Ocean's Eleven movies. All in all, \\"Bringing Down the House\\" is a fun and fresh experience that lets you walk away with more than a read and hopefully a stack of chips. I'll bet you'll like this book!This MIT student should get a Ph.D. in 21."},{"Title":"Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T. Students Who Took Vegas for Millions","review":"Is it really possible to beat the casino at black jack? This true story by Ben Mezrich chronicles how a team of MIT students studied Basic Strategy and developed an intricate queuing system designed to capitalize on favorable odds and ultimately win money from the house. The book reads like a suspense thriller novel with all kinds of twists and turns, mutiny, subterfuge, dark alleys, shady men in dark suits, complex video surveillance, private detectives, false identities and pretty much anything you've seen in your basic thriller centered around Vegas.The story follows Kevin Lewis who begins as a straight A MIT engineering student and is recruited to be a member of the MIT black jack team. He learns how to count cards and determine ways to increase the probability of winning at blackjack. If played by oneself, a skilled card counter may have a 2% advantage over the house. But when working in tandem with a team, much larger returns can be made.The teams used different role players such as spotters, gorillas, and big players. Spotters sit at a table and play the minimum bet while counting face cards and low cards. Low cards are 2 through 6 and receive a point value of positive 1 and high cards are 10 through Ace and receive a value of minus 1. The 7 through 9 cards have neutral value. Each time one of these cards is played the spotter either adds or subtracts from the total to determine the probability of drawing a high card. High cards favor the player over the house. So when the count gets high, the spotter signals the big player to come in and put down big money. This allows large bets with high probabilities of winning. The big player then leaves the table when the count drops back to unfavorable odds. In casino play, they commonly use 6 decks of cards at a time so the counter improves his or her ability of predicting favorable outcomes the deeper into the deck (or horseshoe) that the game goes. The best hand is if the player hits black jack or 21 which pays out 1.5 times the bet. By working as a team, wins are maximized. The system doesn't guarantee winning every time but over a long period of time allows for a good team to win and make lots of money.The team would fly to Vegas on weekends strapped with as much as half a million dollars strapped to their bodies going through airports and play in the big casinos. Eventually the casinos began to notice patterns of players who consistently won and would ask them to leave to stop the outflow of money. Casinos hire private investigating firms to help identify cheaters and card counters. Eventually, the MIT team is found out and begins getting barred from playing in any casino. They try to circumvent this by developing disguises but these end up failing in time as well.Some of the members of the team ended up walking away with hundreds of thousands of dollars up to as much or more than a million dollars in winnings over the course of a few years. Card counting is perfectly legal and is not considered cheating since it does not alter the outcome of the game. Casinos clearly do not like to lose money so try to limit losses by identifying card counters.The amateur should not think he or she can emulate the success of these MIT students. They practiced and practiced countless hours and memorized charts, patterns, signaling systems, and dealt many many hands of Black Jack before even entering a casino. Keep in mind that they were also some of the most brilliant students at MIT which speaks for itself.The reader should be cautioned that there is a good bit of graphic detail about the seedy side of Vegas, the gambling industry as a whole as well as some moderate violence. If the book were a movie, it would easily be rated R."},{"Title":"Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T. Students Who Took Vegas for Millions","review":"Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T. Students Who Took Vegas for Millions was quite a read. Ben Mezrich is quite an author.For decades the genius students at M.I.T. have been cracking codes and creating systems to analyze every facet of our lives and naturally they've been using their talents to solve some of the most involved mathematical challenges in human history: games of chance. Of all the casino games, Blackjack has history. Every card played affects the outcome of each subsequent hand. That effect is a probability and is measurable, predictable, and actionable. This was the basis of the Card Counting teams.Mickey Rosa, an eccentric former professor and mastermind behind the M.I.T. teams, took card-counting to an unprecedented level. What he did was to predict when decks would be hot and when they wouldn't by using spotters who'd signal in the big betters only when the table was ready to pay off. In this way, the average income for the team would be staggering, but there was no way for the casinos to identify the counter and no way to finger the team.Kevin Lewis is the engineering wiz kid whose uncanny mathematical mind and generic Asian-American looks gets him invited to try out for the team. After a grueling training session and three levels of testing, he's accepted onto the team and from there he goes on a roller coaster ride of student by week and Las Vegas high-rolling jet-setter by weekend. The money was large, the women were beautiful, and celebrities plenty.This is the story of everything that's beautiful about gambling and everything that's ugly about greed. It's about the bright lights and glitz of modern Vegas and how the ugly face of old Vegas lurks in the shadows, still running the show.You've got to read it to believe it.- CV Rick"},{"Title":"Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T.

It's an excellent pre-Vegas read as it sets the scene quite well."},{"Title":"Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T. Students Who Took Vegas for Millions","review":"Bringing Down the House is an entertaining and quick read. Guided by the experience of a rebel professor and a former \\"dinosaur\\" card-counter, a small group of MIT students put an old counting theory to play at major casinos across the country. The underlying principle behind card counting is that a deck rich is tens, face cards and aces is favorable for the player, whereas a deck rich in small cards is good for the dealer. To gauge the richness of the deck in good cards, the player will keep track of the cards that have already been played by assigning a point value to each of them. Thus, the MIT team assigns a value of +1 to 3, 4, 5, and 6, and -1 to tens, face cards and aces. Everything else is 0, or neutral. At the beginning of a deck or shoe the count is 0; then the counter constantly adds and subtracts from the count according to the cards played. Under the scrutiny of the \\"Eye in the Sky\\" - the dealers, pit bosses and casino managers - keeping track of a deck position and then taking advantage of a highly positive count seems quite challenging. Mezrich makes it unequivocal that the average person cannot accomplish what the MIT team did - and in the process reveals in detail comic team gimmicks to avoid being caught by the house. A truly high-adrenaline read if you have the slightest interest in Blackjack!"},{"Title":"Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T.

It was a quick, easy, entertaining and even suspensful page turner.I have always loved gambling and Vegas and the image of the two. I don't really buy into anyone really being able to beat Vegas (those hotels aren't built cheap!!!), but it was fun to think about it happening while reading this book. Made me think, all those times I have been in Vegas or at the Grand Victoria here in Chicago, is that person just a card counter calling in the big guy, because it seems at everytable that one guy will come around plunk down a larger bet then the rest of the table and get a blackjack and just like that they pick up and leave. Hmmm!!!Anyway, a great book and would suggest anyone looking for a good read, pick this one up."},{"Title":"Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T. Students Who Took Vegas for Millions","review":"Ben Mezrich has written a fascinating account about Blackjack counting by MIT students. This reads like a fiction novel even though it's true. The thing I found intriguing is that counting is not illegal, even though you can be kicked out of a casino for doing it. One of the things he explains is how teams work in counting, which I never understood. Basically, one person sits at the table and gambles the same amount each time. He is also counting the cards, and when the card count is favorable to the player, he calls over his buddy -- who immediately bets high. This makes it hard for the casinos to spot the card counters because the money starts out high from the gambler instead of progressing upward.I enjoyed this book from beginning to end. It amazes me how much money the ring of MIT students accumulated in a few short years. It makes you want to learn how to count cards. I highly recommend this book for anybody who's ever been to Vegas, loves a good crime-type caper (even though what they did was legal!), or just likes a well-written story."},{"Title":"Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T.

However, I must say that I am not 100% sure it is all true, based soley on two things stated in the book that I know 100% for sure are NOT true. 1) NFL cheerleaders do NOT go on the road with the local team, and 2), the next time I see someone walk past a cocktail waitress in Vegas and snatch a drink off her w/o serious repurcussions will be the first time I see it. I realize these may be considered petty issues, but it immediately made me wonder how much of the balance is true. One would kind of like to believe in the whole story, but I'm not too confident in that.

Students Who Took Vegas for Millions","review":"&quot;Bringing Down the House&quot; tells an interesting story about several young kids chosen to learn card counting methods and entrusted with hundreds of thousands of dollars in an attempt to take casinos for all they are worth. The pace of the story is often frenetic and it is a quick read, both of which are nice for a plane ride or quick holiday book, but this isn't something that will stick with a reader. The title leads readers to believe that this describes epic events in Las Vegas, but instead it is a bunch of kids who legally take advantage of the rules of black jack and win a lot of money for themselves. It is amusing and actually amazing, but nothing that will leave a lasting impression. It also doesn't really teach effective lessons about counting cards. It describes some basic techniques, but certainly isn't a &quot;how-to&quot; guide. I don't know that all readers are looking for these characteristics, but if you are, look elsewhere.

Quickly these MIT geeks are corrupted by the life of sin in Vegas although they do keep their eye on the ball and rake in the money.But nothing lasts forever and the team faces internal issues as well as the casinos increased efforts to stop card counters.

BDTH provides hours of entertainment leaving you salivating for the next chapter just to see what wacky Kevin will do next. The book teaches you how to BEAT THE SYSTEM by giving you a sideline view of how their method succeeded. PLUS, the last chapter actually gives DIRECTIONS HOW TO MAKE YOUR OWN TEAM and the methods they used. Bravo to Mezrich for his first endeavor in non-fiction. A must-read with hopefully many more to come...There's a reason why this book has been on the NY TIMES BESTSELLER LIST for FOUR WEEKS in a row!"},{"Title":"Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T. Students Who Took Vegas for Millions","review":"Mezrich is such a stupendously terrible writer, even if this stuff was true, you would never believe it the way he writes. His writing is lazy, unconsidered, and is absolutely RANK with the smell of embellishement and outright fabrication. There's simply no way to take writing this atrocious seriously; the fabrications and embellishments are so transparent, the mind boggles at how he got this sold as non-fiction.One last note: Mezrich never states that he changed names or places to protect anyone. According to the book, the protagonist was in the Weston, MA public school system until high school. I was in the Weston public school system at the same time; in fact, according to the chronology, Mr. Lewis was either in my class or the one below me. I have the yearbooks from Mr. Lewis' last years at Weston. He's not in any of them, not anywhere. If Mezrich changed his name, fair enough. If not, who on earth is this guy?"},{"Title":"Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T. Students Who Took Vegas for Millions","review":"This is an entertaining story of Six MIT students who fleece Las Vegas for millions.This book makes very entertaining reading if you have no serious interest in blackjack beyond the superficial glamour of the casino world. I read it in a couple of sittings. The personalities are vivid, the pace of the story sweeps you along, and the finale is somewhat unexpected and disturbing. Read as a thriller with a blackjack theme, the book is well worth the cover price.From the perspective of the blackjack enthusiast the value of the book is limited. The question of how to make a spectacular profits given the low % advantage associated with card counting or even the other more advanced techniques of shuffle analysis the blackjack team use, is addressed, but never really answered.The team never appear to have a losing streak of any sizeable length. As card counters know, this is pure fantasy. The negative fluctuations (losing periods) associated with counting or count-based strategies are extreme and may last months or even years. Some selective editing has obviously been applied here, or this team of players experienced a winning streak of such abnormal length they must have fallen off the bell curve. This is a far greater problem than the exposure question which the book focuses on as the major difficulty facing advantage gamblers.On the human level, Mezrich connects well with the emotional schizophrenia of his subjects. The alienation of the casino lifestyle has rarely been better expressed. However, the dialogue is at times forced and artificial. There are none of the pauses, misunderstandings or irrelavancies of normal discussion. While that is essential to move the story forward in a work of fiction, this supposedly all happened, so it gives the book a credibility problem-if they didn't talk like that, what else has been changed?An essay by &quot;Kevin Lewis&quot; at the conclusion of the book exacerbates the problem: Lewis appears familiar with the basics of blackjack advantage play, yet makes a very surprising error. His recommended betting schedule is too aggressive by (at least) a factor of four. It would result in virtually certain ruin for the gambler if actually used in play. It seems incredible that such an apparently talented player would make such an elementary error. The book would be better off without this section, since as a whole its value to advantage players is negligible or harmful.I must thank Mezrich for stimulating interest in blackjack generally, but I'd caution anybody against taking up the blackjack lifestyle on the basis of this book. Its extremely tough to make it at the highest level and very few actually achieve it without extreme dedication to developing their skills, and huge capital investment. In contrast to the glamourous picture portrayed here, many card counters lead isolated quasi-nomadic lifestyles without purpose or direction.If you want to waste an afternoon then buy this book, you won't be disappointed. If you want to improve your blackjack skills, then pick up something here by Ed Thorp, Stanford Wong or Arnold Snyder.John May (Author of &quot;Get The Edge At Blackjack&quot;)"},{"Title":"Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T. Students Who Took Vegas for Millions","review":"Breezily written reportage: MIT students use mental calculations and crony canvassers to beat casinos at blackjack. *Bringing Down the House* is long on slick characterizations and predictable descriptions of Vegas high life but short on details that would give profound interest and authority. &quot;Kevin Lewis's&quot; 5 page afterword is worth as much as the first 250 pages; refinements of strategy are more newsworthy than the tightening grip of surveillance or thuggery of casino goons. The details of face recognition software tantalize; I would have gladly read more about how it works. One would like also to have seen fleshed out ubermensch &quot;Micky&quot; or, if Ben Mezrich had real moral insight, the psychology of the dramatis personae.A decent read while waiting for the dentist.

What I did not expect was an exciting story about a man with a double life. I found myself holding my breath at the end of chapters until I could flip the page and see what happened next. Kevin's story about living with his two lives, trying to bring them together, resolving that they had to be seperate, and their inevitable collision (picture George Costanza declaring, &quot;My worlds are colliding!&quot;). More engaging than some of my favorite novels, the seemingly endless rising action to the climax inspired me to follow my own passions, and seek out things in life I can pour myself into."},{"Title":"Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T. Students Who Took Vegas for Millions","review":"I liked this book because it is true. Often times books about successful gambling ventures are annoying to me because it sounds as though the author is bragging and not much more. This book is different because it explains how the main character accomplished his goal. It explains how his hard work paid off and the mistakes he made along the way. It is funny to think that problem for these geniuses was not retaining the data like it would be for the average player, the trouble for them was carrying out the When I finished the book I felt more knowledgable about the casino industry and my own limitations in playing blackjack. If you don't know before you read, you will soon learn that blackjack is a game that can be beaten.Like some of the other reviewers I would like to see this book made into a movie. I would just hope that it maintained the emphasis on gambling rather than dramatize the vice. To stay true to the book they would need some actors of Asian decent to pull it off. I look forward to seeing it."},{"Title":"Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T.

It's the engrossing story of how a small band of MIT students managed to work as a team playing Blackjack and win $3 million plus from Casino's in Vegas. While the students did nothing illegal it becomes very obvious that the Casinos were less than amused with the student's success. The stories of what the Casinos did to try and stop the students ring true and may discourage a reader from learning how to count cards.

The MIT students did succeed in counting cards successfully but the author embellished the story to the point of fiction in many cases.

For a much more interesting look at card counting read another book called \\"Striking It Rich: Golf in the Kingdom with Generals, Patients amd Pros\\". I enjoyed this book immensely. It was written by an MIT grad who actually did the card counting and it shows. It is also about MIT and medicine (the guy is now a plastic surgeon) and golf (he is a pro golfer also) but the chapter on his former life as a card counter is fascinating and much more informative that BDTH."},{"Title":"Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T.

The story focuses on \\"Lewis\\" and chronicles how he is brought into the group and becomes entranced by the excitement and the money.The book reads like a novel. The author's background in fiction may have influenced his nonfiction style. While it's possible that the author takes minor liberties with some of the facts, the book DOES make for an enjoyable read.The team has great success due to the fact that their approach is much more efficient than the standard card counting strategy used by individual players. With multiple players sitting at the tables keeping track of the \\"count\\" and a \\"big player\\" roaming around, the big player can move from table to table when the conditions are favorable for winning.A rudimentary explanation of the card counting methods used is given, but the book is definitely NOT an instructional manual on how to make money in Vegas.

Wow -- it exceeded my expectations and that's why I'm giving it 5 stars. I couldn't put it down. The writer excelled at developing the suspense of the story -- he competently built a sense of looming danger or disaster, even though the entire time I believed that, because this is non-fiction, the likelihood of a truly dangerous climax was slim (i.e., Hollywood-style mob hits), otherwise it would have been made into a TV movie of the week already. Even given that, I could not wait to read how it all ended. However, one big caveat -- the writing is very clumsy and the characters are thinly sketched. Moreover, I think the writer wants you to care about them, which is hilarious considering that he could not have painted more unlikeable, money-grubbing, shallow, elitist characters if he tried. Read for the excitement only -- you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T. Students Who Took Vegas for Millions","review":"The book was a really fun read, but much of that was due to the fact that the story was true--or was it?Two aspects of the book kind of caught in my craw:(1) The overall impression the book sought to convey was that these guys were getting rich. But when specific winnings were mentioned, they often didn't seem that large, and when details of their gambling schedule (times per year) slipped through, when multiplied by the winnings, it didn't seem to come out to any more than a salary at a normal job. I'd like to read the book again and take notes on all the specific facts mentioned and figure this out in more detail.(2) The book seemed to imply that this was all legal. But they used aliases backed up by false IDs and Social Security numbers. Fake drivers licenses? This has got to be a felony.Finally, this book has been out a while.

Rather a morality play of how brains and a superior education do not save you from turning into a greedy idiot when it comes to easy money. I think that most people (and I include myself in this) who really work for a living and survive on basic common sense would have been happy with a couple of months of profit from their card counting method. Most people would have gotten out when the getting was good. It was rather pleasant watching the whole spoiled bunch sliding down into casino hell. And you just knew that they were going to end up turning on one another. I had no admiration or sympathy for these people. I just felt like yelling \\"Oh, grow up already!\\" It was this sort of thinking that led to the Wall Street meltdown. Too much power in the hands of college students who believe they are smarter than the restof us and have no responsibility toward the rest of the world. And it is pathetic that they are being turned into heroes or role models.The book itself is readable although a bit uneven. And the jumps backward and foreward through time are not handled very well.

At times there are names mentioned in passing, who are apparently part of the \\"team\\", but I have no idea who they are.\\"Kevin Lewis\\" is a likable protagonist, but due to the lack of character development, I began to stop caring about him towards the end of the book. Part of the joy of reading books that are turned into movies is getting more insight in the people behind the characters.

I was extremely surprised to find that the book was so much more that the boiled down movie. Granted, I know books are always better than the movie it is based off of, but this seem to be in a complete different ball park. That being said, I thoroughly enjoyed reading the account of the MIT card counters in Las Vegas.The book is interesting because you get a progressively more and more complex and threatened lifestyle as you move through time. This injects natural adrenaline and action into each new chapter. There was always the threat of violence in the background, even though counting is legal, so you continually read on as you anticipate the conflict as it brews. I was sad when I was done reading it and there was no more to read, but in the same light it had also come to a natural conclusion that felt right.On the other side I was a little saddened as well by a simple Google search that showed that Mezrich admitted to slightly fictionalizing some of the story. This goes without saying in most nonfiction, though, as the narrative effect that makes it so readable, that I expected this was the case before I did a little research. Obviously a lot of the sidelines of the other characters, like Fisher and Martinez when they went out of country to gamble, where fiction, building a story around rumor (such as hearing that they had conflict and were banned, and that Fisher had a black eye; the guess is the narrative around this story that Mezrich used).In the end I really didn't care. I know there was truth to a lot of the basic facts of the MIT team, and that there was fiction around some of the more fascinating aspects, but when it all came down to it it was an enjoyable read. Enough said for me. I would recommend to others despite learning that some of the story was fictionalized.4 stars."},{"Title":"Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T.

Students Who Took Vegas for Millions","review":"(4.5 stars, actually)Over the past ten years, \\"creative\\" nonfiction has become quite popular, spurred in no small part by the success of John Berendt's \\"Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil,\\" among others. This book ought to serve as a paradigm for the genre: it reads like a novel, yet is based--and I use that term loosely--on fact.Mezrich pads the book a bit, stretching out the third-person narrative by splicing in first-person accounts of the background research he did. This is why I deducted a half star from the rating...this isn't a perfect book, but it's damned good anyway.Another flaw, and possibly an unavoidable one in this genre, is the amount of cinematic detail provided in the account. Nobody can accurately remember the vast amount of descriptive detail and dialogue put forth in the narrative; you know there's a good bit of authorial embellishment occurring when even the gestures of the characters are described with more detail than anyone can recall about what they had for lunch yesterday. But that's the nature of the beast: the book wouldn't be nearly as entertaining if Mezrich had followed the rules of Reporting 101 and stuck to the facts. Truth be told, I don't care if he spins the details out of thin air, as long as the gist is right."},{"Title":"Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T.

Students Who Took Vegas for Millions","review":"This book is way over-hyped for what it really is. For anyone who has ever played blackjack, or spent any time in Vegas, there are too many inaccuracies and half-truths to just pass it off as anything but a fictionalized version of a partially true story and a not very intriguingly written account at that.If you want some light reading while you're flying to Vegas this will do, but you won't gain any deep insight to what really happened.There are far more interesting books regarding Blackjack and Las Vegas. You might start with \\"The Big Player\\" by Ken Uston (circa 1977).

The author takes the reader on a thrill ride of the stress and danger of pitting yourself against the casino industry.The premise is that a group of exceptionally smart Math students form a team to win a LOT of money from casinos around the country. Their approach is legal -- but that doesn't mean the the casinos are necessarily happy about the approach. The students use acting, disguises and a lot of sheer guts to win big money.The author intertwines the story with present day interviews of the &quot;team&quot; members and stories of himself attempting the tactics. The overall book was very entertaining.I was afraid that this would be more of a &quot;how-to&quot; book on the process of playing winning blackjack -- and while that is included in small part, the books focus reads more like an exciting fiction novel.This could easily have been a Crighton or Grisham novel."},{"Title":"Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T. Students Who Took Vegas for Millions","review":"but a quick, entertaining read nonetheless. As others have said, it could have been much better. I think the author must have written this book just to make money, rather than to explore what would be an interesting story without the distracting, obvious exagerations. I suspect some of the problem may have been the \\"source\\" the author had to work with. The guy comes off as a bit of a loser despite the attempt at a flattering portrayal.My 76 year old mother picked up this book after I left it at her house and even she noticed obvious contradictions and inconsistencies.

Students Who Took Vegas for Millions","review":"This is a fun book. You don't particularly get the feeling the author had to work that hard, although it sounds like he had a few scary moments of his own. This is light reading, but worth devoting a night to, just for the excitement of wondering if they were ever going to get caught. Doesnt really approach the topic from all sides, really just the MIT students viewpoint. I didn't see any quotes from the so-called goons or anything. If you can't get to the casino to play some black jack, the next best thing I guess. Can't believe they made that much money, even with their system. Could identify with the guy who lost two hands in row for $50K, probably happened more often than admitted in this book. Okay though."},{"Title":"Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T. Students Who Took Vegas for Millions","review":"I want to like this book. I want to be able to say that it's possible to beat Vegas, and that if you're smart enough and diligent enough, it's possible to walk away with millions. For all I know, it may be true that you can beat Vegas. But this book doesn't tell me that.What this book tells me is that a writer interviewed a bunch of people purportedly involved in this scheme and that he tried to create profiles of all of these people to create largely fictionalized characterizations of people involved in a scheme that may or may not have existed, and, if it did exist may or may not have been successful.In other words, it's quite clear that, in descriptions of the group's actions, and their personalities, the author engaged in a bit of artistic license, probably to protect the identities of the participants.This is all well and good, except it comes at the expense of cogency and interest. In short, there is nothing in this book that engages the reader, other than the idea that you can walk away from Vegas with millions. But I didn't find myself interested in the characters. I wanted to be interested in them, to learn about their backgrounds and their personalities, and the traits they each brought to bear on betting.Alas."},{"Title":"Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T. Students Who Took Vegas for Millions","review":"I feel like I need to review this book as a reader and not a gambler. Other reviewers here have posted on the plausibility of this book, and they have many good points. It is likely that a substantial portion of this story was fictionalized either for effect, or by the inevitable inaccuracies that come from reporting someone else's story. I mean, who hasn't told what they intended to be a fully true story to an observer and not exaggerated a bit here and there. Or for that matter, perceived something one way, only to have their perception challenged by someone else. Let's not get too hung up on truth with a story that is clearly meant to be entertainment not a historical record.So my review will ignore plausibility, in the same way that one should with Hollywood films, and will instead focus on the literary and dramatic value of the book. Overall, I have to give it a mixed review on quality, but a pretty positive note on the entertainment level.To say that the book can get a little hokey at times is to put it lightly. It feels like, with the abounding heightened prose, the book is being told by college students who have had a few too much complimentary champagne. It doesn't quite stoop to Swifties (look it up) or anything, but every once in a while you are forced to put the book down and just take a breath to cleanse the mental palette. Dan Brown has nothing on Mezrich's ability to overwrite a simple description into an inflated series of similes. But that's the style, right? If we wanted simple, adverb-free writing we'd read Hemmingway.But this criticism should not ignore the fact that the book is well paced and sticks to an effective dramatic structure that makes it a compelling read. It's light enough for a plane trip or the beach, and if you have a fondness for the popular gambling/casino genre (Ocean's Eleven, Casino Royale, Rounders) it will more than satisfy."},{"Title":"Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T.

It's an amazing story, especially considering it's true. I didn't think there would be much suspense to the story, but man was I wrong. The way the author tells it, he hints at something that could be coming, and sometimes it does, sometimes it doesn't. I loved it. For those looking to buy a book to learn how to count cards...this isn't it! This isn't even really a book about basic strategy. They talk about it VERY little since it's needed for the story, but the book is focused on the journey of one young man (20s for most of the book...my age) through Vegas, Atlantic City, and finding himself and his place in the world.I can't recommend this book enough.

Although it is impossible to know to what extent the basic story it true, it sounds plausible enough that one believes it could happen.It's written in a casual manner, so you don't have to be highly educated to understand the language, and this style works for the subject matter.I listened to the audiobook version, and the reader was good."},{"Title":"Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T.

Students Who Took Vegas for Millions","review":"Fantastic! Although author Mezrich reminded us a few too many times that he's a Harvard alum, he otherwise wove a fascinating tale of smart little guys vs. casino corporations. The basic card counting scheme is well-known, but the team featured in this book used psychology to play even smarter, by using teams, so that the tell-tale signs of a single card counter weren't there. For these guys, the game was an investment, a mini-corporation, not a fun hobby or pasttime. They didn't do this to relax or for the free beer; they were hard at work trying to make money when they were gambling.This is a great look at a scam and is recommended to any non-fiction, gambling, or math lover."},{"Title":"Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T.

But the author writes with such a show-offy, hamhanded style he manages to get in the way of the action more than a few times.

My favorite example, from page 68: &quot;Somewhere over Chicago, the sky went black on the other side of the glass egg at Kevin's shoulder.&quot; And his technique of jumping back and forth from the story to the present day just takes the reader out of the action.Still, quite worth a read.

Students Who Took Vegas for Millions","review":"Here's why you shouldn't read this book: this is Mezrich's first attempt at non-fiction, and it shows. What could have been a highly interesting book for the scientifically-inclined reader is, at times, turned into something that borders on trashy entertainment. When I'm reading a book about blackjack-playing \\"geniuses\\", I'm not particularly interested in their sexual exploits or cheap analogies between strippers and casinos. Also, as someone who is a stickler for details, I found some of the science in the book to be conflicting. Some of the practices he describes in the book go completely against the theory that the MIT team came up with. Any reader who pays attention will notice this, and an explanation by the author about these conflicts would have been nice. If you're looking for truly hard science w/ explanations, you won't get it here.Here's why you should read the book: If you like blackjack, gambling in general, or the concept of a few smart kids *legally* fleecing large corporations, this book is extremely entertaining.The scientific concepts are explained so anyone can understand them, and there's a nice afterword by one of the MIT team members.

The main strength of the book is its entertainment value. I read the book from cover to cover in a single session. Although the writing is at times pedestrian the author certainly knows how to keep his audience captivated. Much of the book reads like a spy novel with subterfuge, violence, glamour and money.The main drawback of the book is its deviation from factual content. The author makes it seem as if losing is a rare occurrence whereas in blackjack it occurs very regularly. Playing blackjack is glamourised, with the author describing high stakes gambling with famous celebrities. The reality is professional blackjack is not very glamorous and involves grinding at the tables for countless hours in less than salubrious conditions.If you are seeking some light entertainment the book is highly recommended however for a more realistic view of professional blackjack I would look elsewhere."},{"Title":"Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T.

Both are very good and highly recommended.This inside look at casino security and card-counting was very exciting. Seeing how a group of regular kids ( well, genius regular kids ) could learn to exploit an edge and take the big casinos for money, makes for a great story.I am not a gambler. Well not a gambler in the sense of giving my money away to the casinos, because I know the odds are rigged to the benefit of the house. I did like reading details about how these MIT students found a very slight probabilistic edge and then built a team to exploit that edge. Pretty much the same way traders and hedge funds make money every single day. But the house, like the market, figures these things out and changes the game. The only difference is the market will not \\"take you for a one way ride into the desert\\"I highly recommend the book or the movie."},{"Title":"Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T. Students Who Took Vegas for Millions","review":"This story tells about the rise and fall of super-smart-MIT boys and their forays into card counting. From nerdy campus watering holes to plush Vegas VIP rooms, Bringing Down the House is a modern-day morality tale.The main character, Kevin, is a smart college kid who is seduced into an expert and tightly run card-counting operation comprised mainly of his fellow MIT students. Using a relatively simple scheme of tracking low and high cards, a counter who is placing minimal bets can signal a high-stakes player over to a table just as it's heating up. Over the course of a few years, these kids made millions up and down the Vegas Strip. Using costumes, fake ids, elaborate accents and well-developed characters, Kevin and his friends not only made mega bucks, but they also had access to the high-roller lifestyle, with the free suites, drinks, dinners and gorgeous women.Eventually, however, the casinos figured out their game, and a cat-and-mouse game followed. Mean casino managers, tough security thugs would chase them from their rooms, out of casinos and eventually, at least for Kevin, back to the straight and narrow.The book is fast-paced and straightforward, but at times Ben Mezrich's writing feels a bit stilted, and some of the dialog doesn't ring true. And the ending, while it ties up a lot of loose ends, is strangely unsatisfying. Apparently, there are few repercussions even after all the drama.In spite of any criticisms, however, the book is a fun read, particularly if you like blackjack or perhaps are on your way to Vegas. It certainly will make you wonder who's watching you."},{"Title":"Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T.

The best part of the book is the description of the noodle heads getting the living crap kicked out of them by a couple of goons sent to the Caribean by the evil empire of casino owners. I've never wanted the &quot;hero&quot; to take a fall so badly in my life, and I love beating casinos for big wins. I'm just guessing, but somewhere between 10 and 50% of this book never happened, and the stuff that did happen is fairly boring. Don't doubt that card counting works, but do question how a tribe of skinny dweebs from a math college got past the Vegas casinos systems for so much cash. Pure drivel."},{"Title":"Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T. Students Who Took Vegas for Millions","review":"Ben Mezrich won the lottery with this story, and he was at least smart enough to not tear up the ticket.The story is nothing shy of fascinating, and Mezrich was just talented enough to not mess it up. Oh but he tried. His overuse of Creative Writing 101 literary techniques and his fascination with the italics button bordered on distracting. He also managed to contradict himself in a span of two paragraphs. How the heck did he publish several other novels is beyond me.Contrary to the theme of the novel, sometimes it IS better to be lucky than good. Look no further than Mezrich's good fortune in having this story dropped in his lap for proof of that axiom."},{"Title":"Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T. Students Who Took Vegas for Millions","review":"Got this book a few days ago for Christmas. While the writing style leaves a little something to be desired (feels a little shallow at times), the content of the story and the experiences of the characters was riveting throughout. Like many other reviews have already indicated, I couldn't put the book down. I'm usually a slow reader, sometimes taking weeks to finish a book, but I finished this one in just a couple of days. I suspect that the entire book is not as factual as it could be. It seems a little too unbelievable at times. I suspect that the true events did not happen as dramatically as described in the book. Probaby had some embellishment thrown in to add suspense and drama. But one thing's certain ... this version of the story is very exciting and entertaining! I would love to see a movie made out of it."},{"Title":"Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T.

The flaps and the intro tell you more or less how things are going to turn out."},{"Title":"Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T. Students Who Took Vegas for Millions","review":"Ben Mezrich's instincts were right.When Kevin Lewis let him in on the sophisticated card-counting scheme he and other MIT students used to take Vegas for millions, Mezrich knew he had fodder for a compelling story.This nonfiction tale, told with the expertise of an in-depth feature reporter, gripped me from start to finish. I devoured the book in just a day, reminding myself again and again that the story, except the names, was actually true.I recall that Roald Dahl, who normally favors fiction, had the same instinctual reaction when he learned of the Mildenhall treasure. When a farmer discovered ancient silver in a field, he spun a nonfiction story is every bit as compelling as his works of fiction.I hope that Mezrich, who has already authored six novels, continues to be on the lookout for nonfiction stories to tell. Vibrant writing and thoughtful, daring research made this story top-notch."},{"Title":"Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T. Students Who Took Vegas for Millions","review":"Looks like Ben Mezrich can join the ranks of James Frey, Dave Pelzer and Kathy O'Beirne, who write fiction but call it non-fiction. After reading this book I decided to do some online research. Didn't take long to find this comment in Wikipedia \\"In 2008, Boston magazine and The Boston Globe investigated the accuracy of Mezrich's non-fiction, identifying occasions in his blackjack books where scenes were invented out of whole cloth.\\" Very disappointing to discover another best seller that is so fabricated yet purports to be telling the truth."},{"Title":"Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T. Students Who Took Vegas for Millions","review":"I'm of two minds about this book. On the one hand, I am duly impressed that these students managed to take the 'big houses' of Vegas for as much money as they did. On the other hand, I found it very hard to get over the author worshipping at the alter of MIT. And by this I mean that the author took every opportunity to let you know that these weren't just any students who took Vegas for millions, they were MIT students.My beef with the author's love of MIT aside, the premise of this book is fascinating. To learn or hear of people, in this day and age, being able to make bucket loads in the Vegas casinos, is fascinating. What's more, the author presents the story in such a fashion that it is almost part story, part 20/20 documentary. He (the author) does a nice job of explaining to you exactly how the students managed to make all of their money from the casinos, while at the same time sprinkling enough information in each chapter to keep the reader interested to find out if the protagonists will make it rich, or get caught in the process.Everyone gambles. But it is only a few lucky people who have learned to gamble well and make money. And if you're interested in getting a glimpse into the lives of those who do gamble for the big bucks, then this book is for you."},{"Title":"Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T.

Students Who Took Vegas for Millions","review":"I don't know much about casinos, but I do know that the parts about Teri Pollack the supposed LA Rams cheerleader are not credible. According to this book, she &quot;made her living off her looks: she was a rookie cheerleader with the Rams.&quot; (page 104)Now, this is silly. NFL cheerleaders basically work for free. They get a nominal sum and a couple tickets for each game.But much worse, on page 139 we get this: &quot;The cards did continue to fall in their favor, and they had stellar weekends beginning with New Year's and running all the way to Memorial Day. Kevin saw less of Teri during this period--football was in full swing, and she was traveling with the Rams most weekends--but...&quot;Football is in full swing between New Year's and Memorial Day? Hellooooo? In what universe? A ludicrous assertion that completely undermines the credibility of this book."},{"Title":"Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T.

Pictures of casino bosses."},{"Title":"Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T.

Students Who Took Vegas for Millions","review":"This was a bout some MIT students that could count card and they ended up winning millions of dollars. I really like the book it is one of my favorites, I would read it again and that is saying a lot because I hate to read jest for fun. The thing I really liked about this book is it was an interesting subject matter. The other thing I really liked about it was the author Ben Mezaich really knew what he was talking about because he learned ho to count cards from the people in the book. The thing he did the best is he told a story, he did not jest write down all the facts. That was the thing I like best about the book because if the book was about how they where playing Black Jack then that would of gotten boring really quick, but he made it a story. The other thing that made this book a really easy read is his writing style, it was jest really straight foreword. He would not spend too much time describing the way the cards float across the felt like some authors would of dune. The only problem I had with this book is it was too short, I would of liked it if it was longer jest because I did not wont to stop reading the book. I always wonted to know what was going to happen next, that is why I would give this book 10 out of 10 and I would recommend that everybody should read it."},{"Title":"Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T.

Students Who Took Vegas for Millions","review":"Ben Mezrich knows how to tell a story. He takes us along with Massachusetts Institute of Technology's (MIT) Black Jack team on casino assaults from Las Vegas to the Bahamas. We experience the life of high stakes gamblers... the fabulous hotel complementary rooms and the casinos' violent response to big talented winners. He briefly discusses the theory of card counting among team players early on, but saves the details for the last chapter. Ben also admits that the casinos have adapted by implementing continuous card shuffling machines. As a computer programmer with designs on lotteries, I felt a connection to fellow Boston area college students with a plan and the determination to follow through. I hope they make a movie out of this."},{"Title":"Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T. Students Who Took Vegas for Millions","review":"Bringing Down the House, if you don't already know, is a non-fiction (or so they say) card-counting story about some MIT kids who make millions with a team-based blackjack scheme. I have been fascinated by card-counting for quite a while so when I heard about this book I knew I would enjoy it.And I did enjoy it. But the writing is sometimes so bad that it makes me reconsider my own writing potential. I mean if a line like &quot;I found the thrill of the game almost as addictive as the field of consulting,&quot; without any hint of irony or mockery, can make it into a NYT-bestseller, I could probably come up with something that sells, right?But I guess writing ability has very little to do with book sales, just like musicianship has nothing to do with record sales, and intellegence has nothing to do with Harvard Business School admissions. Selling lots of books requires a hook, just like a hit single requires a hook. Get 'em hooked and you've got yourself some sushi.And the theme of greed/American Dream/capitalism is a great hook, especially when put into the context of a crime story, or something that resembles a crime story (card counting is not against the law). Stories that depict everyday people taking advantage of flaws in the system are always going to be successful. Because it makes people think they can do something similar. Make something out of their lives.The problem is that the characters in *Bringing Down the House* don't hold much potential for pathos. They're all spoiled rich kids who think they're smarter than everyone else. Or at least the author thinks they're smarter than everyone else. But counting cards is not rocket science. It's more like counting cards. You have to know how to add one and subtract one from double-digit integers. If your count is +9, you need to be able to add and subtract one several times per hand and calculate that the count is +12 at the end of the hand. You need to be able to follow all the players' hands, or else the count is meaningless. It takes practice to make it look like you're not counting. And it becomes obvious to the casino if you start betting erratically and making large bets on seemingly bad hands, and then winning 60% of the time. So, you do what anyone else with a public-school education would do: you get your friends to help. This is what the brainiacs at MIT figured out. The real brilliance is in the fact that they actually did it, and pulled it off (if the story is in fact true.. I don't know how to verify it, and I'm sure all the names are changed). The logistics of putting together a blackjack team seem quite daunting. You've got to find a bunch of pretty smart people (ok - not so hard at MIT) who have &quot;the look,&quot; are willing to be trained, and have the guts to participate in something quasi-criminal.*Bringing Down the House* is a perfect book for a long plane flight or a sick day. The writing is aimed at the lowest common denominator, and the story is barely plausible, but it's easy and fun to read with a fair dose of suspense.P.S. On the back cover of the book, it says this is &quot;one story that Vegas does not want you to read.&quot; Give me a break. How many thousands of dumbass frat boys will read this and convince themselves they can get rich? This is the ultimate in free advertising for post-mob Vegas."},{"Title":"Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T.

Some people in their reviews seemed to take it too serious looking into the specifics of MIT etc. Its an exciting story that is probably going to be a movie, but if you are going to spend more time worrying about the tax issues involved with moving this money around, then its not worth the time."},{"Title":"Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T. Students Who Took Vegas for Millions","review":"I purchased this book, because when I went to Las Vegas, I couldn't believe all the security they have in the Casinos, how they track you since you enter the place, but now, after reading this book, I understand why.It is an excellent non-fiction book, that is so well written that you become immerse in a fiction read. It is an incredible story, hard to believe that happened in such a place like Las Vegas full of &quot;eyes in the sky&quot; and experienced personnel.I highly recommend it, so if you like non-fiction wonderful stories, this is a must read."},{"Title":"Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T. Students Who Took Vegas for Millions","review":"From beginning to end, 'Bringing Down the House' was absolutely amazing. Mezrich does a great job describing the characters (all real), as well as describing their rise and downfall as Blackjack kings and queens. I was captivated with the story through the entire book.

Finally I was in a bookstore and ran across the book, picked it up and purchased it. When I got home I sat down and dove into the first chapter. But after every chapter it seemed foolish to put the book down because it was so good, and I thought, well written. The book does read like fiction, but that is what amazes me - reading about a lifestyle that should exist only in movies. Backrooms, PIs, cheating, deception, VIP suites, people losing over 100 Grand in 2 hands, absolutely amazing stuff."},{"Title":"Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T. Students Who Took Vegas for Millions","review":"This was a very interesting and fast-paced reading. However, it was short on substance at times. I wished the author would have painted a better picture of Kevin Lewis' interactions outside of Vegas' glitz and glamour; at the same time, I understand that this would have decelerated the momentum of the story.I can definitely see this turned into a screen play, with Hollywood sprinkling in more drama and action (just in case the average viewer does not find the concept of card-counting and fast-times with A-list celebrities interesting enough)."},{"Title":"Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T.

Students Who Took Vegas for Millions","review":"Mezrich hits it to you in a Hunter S. Thompson sort of way, weaving his personal experience traveling with the nerd herd in with the glitzy glamor of vegas nightlife. His prose taps in on a cutting-edge style unique to Mezrich. BDTH provides hours of entertainment leaving you salivating for the next chapter just to see what wacky Kevin will do next. The book teaches you how to BEAT THE SYSTEM by giving you a sideline view of how their method succeeded. PLUS, the last chapter actually gives DIRECTIONS HOW TO MAKE YOUR OWN TEAM and the methods they used. Bravo to Mezrich for his first endeavor in non-fiction. A must-read with hopefully many more to come...There's a reason why this book has been on the NY TIMES BESTSELLER LIST for FOUR WEEKS in a row! Another book that I highly recommend is &quot;he never called again.&quot;"},{"Title":"Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T. Students Who Took Vegas for Millions","review":"After I'd read two chapters, I was hooked. I normally take several days to read something like this (during train rides to/from work), but I just couldn't put this one down! I finished it off within 48 hours.This is a non-fiction work, but it reads like a mystery/crime novel. It's a very easy read and Mezrich mixes present-day flashbacks with a solid chronology of the exploits of the MIT Blackjack Team. It was just amazing to see what these kids accomplished, and at the same time was horifying to see the tactics that the casino owners would use to intimidate a small gang of self-proclainmed geeks. The way the book flows, you almost feel like you're there on the casino floor with the Team. You revel in their successes and you feel their pain when the pit bosses and casino managers &quot;back room&quot; them.A thoroughly enjoyable reading experience."},{"Title":"Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T.

Aside from the gambling 'strategy' that is obviously the subject of the book, it is good reading on how Vegas works - no, how it REALLY works.A quick read, I read all but the last 4 chapters on my flight from Boston to Dallas and it made me wish I was better at numbers so I could hop on a flight to Vegas and try out what I'd read.A great book about Vegas - I hope someone turns it into a movie because it would really be exciting!"},{"Title":"Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T.

Students Who Took Vegas for Millions","review":"This is a terrific account of MIT math wizards taking on big time casinos and winning at blackjack. The author tells the tale so well that you do not need to be a blackjack expert or a frequent visitor to Las Vegas or casinos to enjoy the book.The writing is good and Mr. Mezrich seamlessly blends the history of these players with his own present day participation and research.The characters seem to be out of fiction which makes the story even more interesting. The way they played their roles - as well as blackjack - was entertaining as well as a testament to their talents.I expected and got a fairly captivating account of these MIT nerds taking on the casinos. What I did not expect, and what made this book a five star from a four was the mysterious ending. From a straight-forward account it turns into a riveting page turner I could not put down. Strongly recommended for anyone who enjoys gambling, casinos, David and Goliath yarns or just plain good reading."},{"Title":"Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T.

The one time I went to casino, I spent 25 cents and left after I lost that. However, I couldn't put this book about gambling down. It was a well written narrative of how computer nerds use their math knowledge to do what they weren't supposed to do. I normally read non-fiction of true crimes and adventure so this wouldn't usually fit into my library.

As as so many other people have mentioned, it wouldn't be believable if it weren't a true story.My mom's never been to Vegas. Occassionally, a group from her work visits the riverboats in Indiana and she plays some nickle slots. Other than that, she has no interest whatsoever in gambling, blackjack or card counting. However, all we talked about the weeks following Christmas was the book.I finished Bringing Down the House in a weekend and have subsequently reread it a few times.

I'm bad about starting books and loosing interest, but not with Bringing Down the House. I never stopped, and wished it wouldn't end. In fact, in the last few chapters when the book is winding down, I felt like I was on the way home from a great vacation. Now I have to plan another trip! Man I've got to get to Vegas for real and hit the action, no card counting though."},{"Title":"Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T. Students Who Took Vegas for Millions","review":"TO QUICKLY BACK UP what other reviewers have written here:That this is going to be a movie eventually is a foregone conclusion. In fact, in my opinion, the author probably wrote this with an eye towards that goal. This would explain the \\"exaggerations,\\" referred to by other reviewers that I would also say exist within this book. After reading this book, you'd think these \\"teams\\" were printing money, with no losing whatsoever. Anyone who knows anything about card counting knows it is not a gravy train where you earn the next 5 years rent money EVERY weekend! When you find out these teams earned a total of $4 million (divided among home many members?), you're quite shocked, because you would have figured after reading the authors' prose that they all retired multi-millionares. Then again, being a bunch of MIT geeks who don't have the self-confidence to get laid in a brothel, they probably just got fleeced of most of their winnings at the strip clubs they frequented. I could just hear them say, \\"Hey, I think that blond with the fake breasts really likes me. Maybe if I tip her again she'll come up to the hotel room we got at the Westward Ho.\\"Seriously, though, this goal of a movie would also explain some of the cliche-ridden dialogue and seemingly over-dramatized portions. What the heck? If I was writing the book, I would do the same thing and cash in on the movie options.As an aside, I would back up the theory that winning at blackjack will soon become obsolete. With face-recongnition technology, and other items mentioned by other reviewers, blackjack rates of return will go so low as to not be worth it anymore. IF YOU WANT TO WIN IN VEGAS, you have 2 better choices (with the obvious caveat that you better have some skills at either of these): 1. sports wagering, 2. poker. Why? In both, your profits come from other gamblers, not the house. The house gets their cut in poker, or the vig in sports wagering, So they could care less how much of SOMEONE ELSE's money you are taking."},{"Title":"Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T.

Not only did I find the topic interesting, but I enjoyed the authors way of drawing the reader into the world of these MIT casino hoppers. I give the book four stars due to the fact that the author wasn't as vivid as one might think a novelist should be. Then again, this was suposed to be mostly fact and not a novel. Not once did I take offense to the authors use of his knowledge of Boston to further detail the story, nor did I find the fact that he changed the names of certain people and locations.

Students Who Took Vegas for Millions","review":"If you have a gambling problem, do not read this book. It is a great book, but it will certainly make you want to start playing Blackjack.I could hardly put it down. I thought that &quot;Poker Nation&quot;, about Texas Hold'em Poker, was an excellent book. This one is even better, but about Blackjack.The characters come alive and you feel your own adrenaline pumping, both in the good times and bad. I nearly felt like running away when the characters were frozen stiff. Good stuff.Fortunately, you do get a grasp of how hard it is to beat the house, and now you know some of the ways that it gets even tougher. Kevin Lewis, one of the main characters, gives an excellent brief essay at the back about card counting, bidding and money management.Definitely a book to get if Blackjack is your game. Even if not, this is great quick reading for sheer entertainment."},{"Title":"Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T.

Students Who Took Vegas for Millions","review":"This was a great, well-written story about a group of MIT students who gambled the casinos out of a few million dollars. The action flows and it is a quick read. It is not the whole story, however. It is the author's first attempt at non-fiction and the lack of research shows. 95% of the story comes from one source (one of the students). His other interviews include a stripper and security expert, both who are not major players. I expect that other authors will write books about these teams and include information from interviews from more players, dealers and casino employees. Anyway, great book but it leaves you hungry for more."},{"Title":"Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T. Students Who Took Vegas for Millions","review":"Mezrich's chronicle of the exploits of a gifted team of mathematicians is as compelling a morality tale as anything I have encountered recently. It is a quick read--very interesting. However, the book leads you to ponder the changes in the lives of the characters wrought by the easy money. The supposedly \\"easy\\" money comes at a terrible cost.Forget the fact that the casinos do not hesitate to use any necessary means in order preserve their advantage; forget that casinos give an unlimited budget to the detectives and surveillance necessary to snare the player who beats the house--regardless of the legality of the player's methods; forget the wildly successful forays of the MIT teams; as the reader gets behind the excitement of the story and the pleasure of seeing a few students exact huge gains from the casinos any conclusion must bear in mind that the portrayed lifestyle does not enrich the lives of the characters--even as it enriches their bank accounts. Though it was perhaps not the intent of Mr. Mezrich, a close reading of this book shows that the house still exacts its advantage.The moral lessons are universally applicable. In order to pursue their scheme, the prodigiously gifted mathematicians are required to adopt a facade of utter hedonism. However, it soon becomes clear that the lifestyle cannot be easily disengaged. We perceive that there is no free lunch--a significant price is being paid. I'm sure many will disagree with me, but I think that honesty is the best policy no matter whether the house deserves to be taken or not. It seems apparent that the no-holds-barred pursuit of money is ultimately worthless if not dangerous."},{"Title":"Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T. Students Who Took Vegas for Millions","review":"After having read Mr. Mezrich's \\"Burning Down the House\\" I feel that I could go down to Atlantic City and make a killing at the blackjack tables. (Yes, I know, a little bit of knowledge is a dangerous thing.) At the same time, I also do not feel that I learned very much about human character, or, for that matter, even the characters in this book. The story suggests that we are going to learn about \\"six\\" M.I.T. students, but it really only focuses on one - and, even that character, we truly do not get to know. I can't argue that this was not a fun story to read (though at times it became repetitive, even predictable), but it was also as disposable as a magazine article - and from a second-rung magazine (i.e. People, Sports Illustrated) at best. Enjoy."},{"Title":"Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T. Students Who Took Vegas for Millions","review":"I loved the book! Being a lover of gambling, and blackjack in particular, it was jsut a FUN book. Despite that it is based on true events, I have little doubt that it is written in a very melodramatic way and greatly exaggerated at parts. That's why I gave it a 4 instead of a 5. In terms of entertainment-- it is a MUST! It will bring out all those romanticised thoughts you ever had about gaming ten fold."},{"Title":"Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T. Students Who Took Vegas for Millions","review":"You know the phrase that cheating doesn't really amount to anything except in this case when the card counting teams from MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) organize, rehearse, and prepare to take money from casinos whether Las Vegas, Atlantic City, or the casino boat in Chicago, Mohegan Sun or Foxwoods in Connecticut. Sadly, the book is really for people who enjoy gambling at the casinos like myself. I'm not a high roller. In fact, I'm so far down on the todem pole of rollers that I barely qualify for comps at all. Anyway, the book is a lot more interesting than I thought it would be only because I am fond of playing card games. I just think that the whole idea of card counting and these teams ruin and take away the fun of the sport. Unlike Poker, blackjack can be beatable if you know the system. Then again, it still takes away the fun of playing. Yes, you lose money but you have to be prepared to lose when you walk in the door. Gambling is chance and randomness rolled into one. The house or casino takes their cut and they are going to always have a heads up. When I read about how the kids began to live double lives, I felt sorry for them. I felt sorry for Mickey Rosa, the MIT genius who brought the teams together and trained them. They decide to go without him and if I was on the team, I would have left at that point. Enough was never enough for the players, they wanted more. They got off the adrenaline and high of beating the house at times. The players were more like actors than players. When I go to a casino, I don't expect anything but to break even or lose some money. I don't expect to get it back but that's the fun. If this book has a lesson, it's enjoy the game and stop worrying about cheating and card counting. The house managers know better and they have security, pit bosses, and cameras everywhere. They follow the high rollers for a reason especially if the house is losing. By following the high rollers, they know what they like and if they are going to gamble thousands at a time, they are profitable to the house. Everybody uses everybody in gambling and casino industry. Gambling like prostitution has been around since the beginning of time. If you can control your gambling habit, you are better off. Don't spend a lot of money or worry too much about the cards. You are there to enjoy the game and pray for the chance to win some money. Don't bet your life savings, your house, your car, your children's college fund, your savings, or your plane tickets because you won't see it again. The house doesn't care if you go broke as long as you do it there."},{"Title":"Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T.

Smart kids beating the house at blackjack seems like fiction...but this is non-fiction.And as it turns out, the book is about a lot more than how some card counting MIT grads beat Vegas...it's also a lot about how Vegas beats them and in the process helps the main character rise above the shallow riches of Vegas (or at least that's what he and Mezrich would have us believe).The story is certainly interesting, and becomes more than a mere re-telling with Mezrich's skillful construction, particularly his insertion of himself into the story in a way which makes you feel as though any one -- including you -- could be a card-counter for a day."},{"Title":"Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T.

Also it's a great introduction for the movie 21: Blackjack. If you're interested in card counting this isn't a \\"how to\\" book, although there is a essay in the last chapter on card counting that makes a more in depth description on the subject, it's more of a novel based on real facts.

We all like to hear secrets, and we all like to hear underdog stories. Spelling out detail for detail how the MIT students made their millions, the author takes you through the eyes of one of the men involved from when he begins his journey and on to his double life involving card counting and high stakes gambling. You have to give the writer a little creative license, as the story was all retold to him, and certain conversations were likely added in order to make what occurred make more sense to us-- the reader.This was, in fact, my one problem with the book. It was a little overwritten in some places. If you have any knowledge or know any history about Vegas, or know anything about the game of Blackjack at all, it may get a little tedious to read the writer's elementary attempts to slip some facts about these items into the story in a not-so-subtle manner, making some conversations between characters appear stifling and rigid.

You admire the MIT students for their mathematical brilliance, but their lack of social skills is readily apparent in the way they keep tempting fate and risk getting whacked by private investigators or casino security. My only issue with not rating it higher was that I found the narrative to be over-written. There are way too many metaphors and adjectives in these pages.

The story is interesting, and keeps you captivated enough so you won't put it down. But a light pleasure read. The main negative I have with this book is that it really isn't that well-written. While it is an easy read, the author shifts in and out of 1st and 3rd person narrative a lot, not only chapter by chapter, but also within pages.

Students Who Took Vegas for Millions","review":"Have you ever wanted to go to Vegas and not lose money? This book is about six kids who do just that. They go through the ups, the downs, and everything in-between. This book is very enjoyable to anybody who enjoys playing card games and wishes to learn about a blackjack team who beat the casino.In my opinion bringing down the house is a very well written book. This book really prooves that blackjack can be beaten.Six kids (and eventually more) learn several ways of card counting. The one that was most used by the team was the hi lo method. Any card 10 or higher is -1 (one less face card in the deck) and any card 6 or lower is +1 (one more high card in the deck) There were six decks in one shoe so this made it easier for the team to win more money. They could get deeper into the shoe (the six decks of cards) without having a re-shuffle so they could count more cards and make more money.One of the more interesting aspects of the book was how the MIT students learned how to work as the team. They had three positions. The positions were spotter, gorilla, and big player. The spotter bets the table minimum burning up low cards until the count got high enough where he/she could signal the big player in and he could have a successful run at the cards. The gorilla is an actor. The act is usually a rich kid who has had too much to drink and can't get away from the blackjack table. The gorilla usually bets the minimum until told by the spotter to raise his bet. The gorilla sometimes hits until he busts just to get a certain card to him. If the gorilla is a skilled shuffle tracker he makes strange bets such as hitting on an 18 or 19 just so he gets the card he wants. When he gets the card he is looking for (usually an ace) he puts close to the maximum bet in the betting circle saying he has to leave and wants to use all his chips. The only time gorilla play is used is when there are only two or three people in the casino. The most important role is the big player. The big player is called into the table by the spotter when the count starts to get high. He then tracks the count himself raising and lowering bets when appropriate. He stays at the table until the count starts getting back toward zero. After he leaves the table he waits until another spotter calls him in.Another reason why this book is so great is because it's real. Six (and eventually more) college kids went to vegas and outsmarted it. Another great thing is the team went undetected for over three years. The eyes in the sky (The vegas cameras on the ceiling) never spotted the MIT players until long after the team had taken vegas for millions.Toward the end of the book the team starts getting a lot of heat. The team disbanded when Martinez and Fisher got badly beaten up at a casino in the Bahamas. Supposedly the man who had it in for the MIT team was Vincent Cole. He was head of Plymouth security which many of the casino's in vegas started using after they found out lots of counters were playing in their casinos. Rumor had it he once back roomed a card counter, he made him go through the usual procedures filled out some papers took his picture and told him to never come to the casino again. Supposedly Cole forced the counter to eat a 500 dollar chip. The guy almost choked to death but the chip somehow made it down. The guy never counted cards again.Even after the team heard the rumors they still didn't want to stop playing. Fisher started a new team and so did Kevin. Kevin's squad was much smaller including only four people including himself. They didn't go to Vegas on a regular basis, it was more like a hobby. Two of Kevin's teammates Dylan and Jill, who were married came home one night to find that their house had broken into. Their safe containing over 200,000 dollars in chips and cash had been taken. Kevin quickly rushed to his house to find everything in order. He sat down at his kitchen table relieved until he saw a lone purple chip right in the center of the table. He looked outside and saw a lone figure standing in an alley way talking on a cell phone. Kevin knew this was it, he had to give it all up now, he couldn't get into anymore trouble or he could get himself into some serious trouble.All in all the MIT team made out pretty well. Totaling around 10 million dollars over 3 years. That isn't a bad three years playing cards in Vegas getting VIP treatment. This was one of my favorite books. I like to play cards myself and i think its interesting when people can beat the odds and make money off Vegas. I recommend this book to anybody who has any interest in gambling or card playing. It is a really suspensful, interesting, well written book and most people would enjoy this book."},{"Title":"Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T.

I thought the chapters scattered in the book that tied the author to the story were really egotistical, and added very very little to the story. And we learn so little about these MIT students as either students or people that the dichotomy of their lives isn't as engaging as it perhaps should be. A story like this is entertaining to read, which earned it a star, and is almost too good to be true, which earns it another star.

Students Who Took Vegas for Millions","review":"After seeing the previews for the movie \\"21\\", I remembered that there really was a group of students from MIT who took blackjack card-counting to a whole new level in casinos. To get the non-Hollywood version of the story before seeing the movie, I grabbed Bringing Down The House: The Inside Story of Six MIT Students Who Took Vegas for Millions by Ben Mezrich. It's a fascinating look into how the MIT team formed, made millions, and subsequently got barred from nearly every casino in the industry.Mezrich is a reporter who was given the chance to interview one of the main players, Kevin Lewis. Lewis was recruited into the group in 1994, and quickly rose up to be one of the \\"Big Players\\" of the team, one who could put on a character, step into a hot table, and make tens of thousands of dollars on a single hand. These weekend raids on casinos continued for the next four years, earning each of the participants an incredible return on their \\"investments\\". Couple that with the fact that the casinos treated them as whales (high rollers), and they were living a life that one could only dream of. Comped rooms, shows, travel, parties, etc... But things started going sour in 1998. The team was showing some major dysfunctional behavior, and a rival team (also from MIT) was threatening the secrecy of the routine. What started as a minor barring from one casino quickly (and violently) spread to nearly every other casino in Vegas. What really surprised them was the speed at which other casinos outside of Vegas (and even the US) knew about them and shut them down. Lewis decided at that point that his life was more important than the money, and left it all behind. The only question that remains is who or what tipped off casino security.Mezrich wrote the book in 2002, so it doesn't necessarily dig deeply into the recent world of casino security. The security technology has only gotten more high-tech since then, and I'm sure that story would be just as interesting as the card-counting story. I was riveted by how Lewis and his team could execute their operation with so much precision, while at the same time having the casinos spend a ton of money to keep them coming back. But greed often destroys everything it touches, and this is no exception. Lewis wanted to be much more low-key when the heat started. But he was overruled by the head of the team, and that decision nearly got some of them killed.In the fast moving world of scams, casinos, and technology, it's amazing that people could get away with this much over such a long time. It makes you wonder what other scams and attacks are occurring these days. Bringing Down The House is a good look at one way it was done successfully. But it almost begs for a follow-up to reexamine the state of casino security six years after the original story ended."},{"Title":"Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T.

His skepticism, and any the reader might have, fade quickly when the story begins to be told. While the writing has some quirks - a metal detector as the modern-day equivelant of Stonehenge? - it moves the story along at a consistent pace while giving you a look inside the lives of a sophisticated group of professional blackjack players who take on a system that does not take kindly to being beaten.

Students Who Took Vegas for Millions","review":"\\"Bringing Down The House\\", by Ben MezrichBlackjack is the only casino game in which what's happened previously determines what's likely to happen next. The fact that the game has odds that can be calculated makes it fascinating for someone good with numbers. That blackjack should come to MIT or vice versa was probably inevitable.In 1963, an MIT professor, Edward Thorp, published a study of the changing odds that occur as certain cards are played in a blackjack game. What he found was that when several low cards (sevens and below) remain in a deck, the odds favor the dealer, and when several high cards (nines and higher) remain, the odds favor the player. That simple observation offered tremendous potential. All a player needed to do was to keep a running tab of the number of low cards that were played versus the number of high cards and he'd know the odds of what cards were likely to turn up next.One person to take advantage of Thorp's study was another MIT math instructor named Micky Rosa. Micky (as he's called in the book) got some students together, taught them a system for counting cards and then, with some serious financial backing, converted them from a student club into a business. The team of six would typically fly to Las Vegas for a weekend, spend two days gambling and then return to Boston with thousands of dollars in winnings.The real story of BDTH isn't so much that some MIT students got good at counting cards, but that they figured out how to do it without being detected - at least for a while. Card counting became popular in the \`60s and \`70s and the casinos wised up quickly. While it was legal, the casinos obviously didn't like it and any card counter would quickly be shown the door. Spotting counters was easy - they'd bet small for several hands and then jump in with big bets until the cards were reshuffled. What Micky did was to take card counting to the next level by turning it into a team sport. One member would play a table until there was a favorable count and then signal another player over who would show up and bet big until the shoe the dealer was working from (usually a collection of six decks) was reshuffled.A story about some MIT students flying to Las Vegas to count cards and beat the houses at blackjack has all of the elements for an interesting read, perhaps one that would fit nicely into a New Yorker or Atlantic Monthly article, but stretching it into a full-length book took some work. There's the suspense of possibly - and ultimately - getting caught, but since what they were doing was entirely legal, it's unlikely that the team was ever in very much danger. There are the problems associated with carrying around large quantities of cash and getting it through the airport security. There's the IRS showing up with questions, but not really a big deal, since everyone was declaring their winnings. There are the heavy-handed security firms that are hired by the casinos to sniff out card counters. There's a little bit of comedy when the team starts wearing disguises to avoid being recognized. There are the luxury rooms and ring-side seats that high rollers are comped with. There are the flesh industry episodes that seem to be a part of any Las Vegas story. There are the problems of keeping a double life a secret. And there are the inevitable conflicts that split the team apart and provide an ending for the story.By Hollywood standards, it's all really quite trite. What's new this time and what carries this story is only that it's real. Mezrich does a good job and while the reader suspects at some points that things are getting stretched just a hair, it's the sort of thing the reader is willing to accept. It's not an Elmore Leonard story. There are no dead bodies. No-one gets thrown in jail, or for that matter even threatened with it. And you're never waiting to find out who done it. But it's nevertheless a good read.As a post-script, card counting is probably dead. By introducing continuous shuffling machines, the casinos have made counting virtually impossible. After reading BDTH, one has to wonder what took them so long."},{"Title":"Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T.

It is easy to suspect that the casino interests are behind this ridiculous farce. Casino managers like nothing better than catering to pin-heads who have money to burn.Yes, blackjack can be a positive expectation game for the players. But not like this. Even the best blackjack players in the world can only wring a 2% advantage out of the most favorable varieties of blackjack and then only on paper; or, in the casinos, only if the dealers, pit bosses and eye-in-the-sky are all asleep, drunk or dead.Any knowledgeable gambler, casino employee or competent mathematician will tell you that you have to bet a spread of at least 10 to 1 in order to for card counting to significantly improve your chances. About the third time you bounce a bet up to 10 times your normal bet (when the count is good) a pit boss (with several large security guards in tow) will politely tell you that your action is a little too strong and will ask you to take your business elsewhere.But, don't take my word for it; check it out with the experts.Read Thorp's \\"Beat the Dealer\\", the book that started the whole card counting craze.Or, read Griffin's \\"The Theory of Blackjack\\", another mathematician's analysis of the game.How about: Stanford Wong's \\"Professional Blackjack\\", which is considered to be definitive, even at MIT.Then, there is Ford's \\"How to Gamble at the Casinos Without Getting Plucked Like a Chicken\\" that gives you an honest take on winning at blackjack in about 30 pages."},{"Title":"Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T.

I think Mezerich took Ken Uston's \\"Million Dollar Blackjack\\" and just put another story behind that book. I sense slight plagiarism here. He even uses the same nicknames as Uston did, such as \\"Big Player\\" and \\"Gorilla\\".I thought that the writing was very jumbled. There were also many problems with facts. There is not a \\"Plymouth PI agency\\", it is the Griffin book that has all the pictures of the big counters and undesirables. More untruths was the ease of grabbing a drink off of the cocktail waitress's tray. That won't happen.I seriously don't think that any part of this book is true. A group of MIT students can certainly improve on Ken Uston's techniques, but they don't. They don't even use his more advanced counting techniques. Certainly a bunch of brainiacs can adeptly use them. That in itself is suspicious."},{"Title":"Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T.

It bothers me tremendously that this book is billed as non-fiction and was listed on non-fiction bestseller lists. As soon as it became obvious to me that the book was fiction (which should happen very quickly if you approach the book with any sort of a critical perspective), it became difficult for me to enjoy the book.

How they worked on it and practiced is part of the story that makes it great. This is a great book on how some \\"nerds\\" took Vegas and other casino's for millions. You probably know that if you are looking at this review so I will just tell you that the story and how it is told is great, from the way they were recruited to the reasons some of them left. It is a roller coaster ride from the high's of winning (strapping tens of thousands of dollars to their body in order to fly) to the low's of winning (being followed, having their home broken into, etc.) and everything in between (having to wear disguises to play in the casino's).

Leave it to MIT students to figure out a way to win millions from the Vegas casinos! It was definitely intriguing to read about their strategy and \\"game playing\\" and how not to get caught! Probably amazing is more like it! The book opened a new dimension to card counting that was a real eye opener to me.As glamorous as it all seemed, with all the money being won and lost, I was glad that the author also brought into play the repercussions on getting caught as well as losing. The allure of millions of dollars along with a proven system of beating the cards and brainy students from MIT proves to be a powerful combination, as the author finds out first hand. Successes as well as failures are portrayed and one can really see how the \\"gambling fever\\" takes hold and is a hard habit to shake. Broken relationships and marriages are a given, as is seen first hand.The story is amazing and again, this one of those books that you just can't put down!!! One has to keep reminding oneself that the story is true! With all the high tech security systems in place now, I am wondering if the MIT card counters still have the same success as they once knew and if they are still at it!Absolutely fascinating read!

I liked the premise of kids beating Vegas at its own game and that part of the book is quite compelling. You will like the kids in the book - smart, clever, resourceful and all that you would expect from a group of MIT students, drop outs, and grads. Unfotunately the author takes what seems like for-ev-er to get to the meat of the story. The last 20 - 30 pages of this book are really the good part but the pages leading up to that are slow with metaphors and similes that read too much like a college creative writing class for my liking.

This is apparently fact that reads like fiction and will catch up the reader in the story of how some kids from MIT learned card counting and how to hit a big time casino as a team, each with their own roles and walk out with millions, over time. Black Jack is the only gambling game played in casinos where it is possible to gain an edge on the house. The explanation of card counting gets a little thick for me, but then I didn't go to MIT.

This was inventedover thirty years ago. They played in teams. Again,a lot of people have done this. I believe this was alsodone in the seventies. They got caught. Not evidenceof great skill there.

Students Who Took Vegas for Millions","review":"Ben Mezrich, up to this point, has been a writer of novels. It shows, badly, in this allegedly-true tale of bored students beating the odds at blackjack. The stories are told with a novelist's flair for dialogue and action, none of which the author actually witnessed.Certain parts of the book stretched my suspension of disbelief nearly to the breaking point. Prime examples are the famous scenes where the students go through airport security with tens of thousands of dollars in cash strapped to their bodies. It's a very nifty bit of action and suspense, but it seems wholly implausible. Also, the repeated mention of duffel bags \\"overflowing\\" with casino chips: genuine casino chips are quite heavy in large quantities, yet Mezrich makes no mention of the students attempting to look inconspicuous while lugging a 100-pound duffel bag through a crowded casino. And a description of a purported robbery, where a wall safe is torn out of an apartment wall by unseen menacing figures: one would imagine literally ripping a wall to pieces would get the attention of those in the neighboring apartments. Yet Mezrich reports all of this as gospel fact, no skepticism is ever found in his narrative.I'm not accusing Mezrich of an intentional falsehood. I suspect there's a grain of truth underlying the story. Perhaps a group of whiz-kid math majors really did set out to study card counting. However, as the story has been related to Mezrich only secondhand, I suspect he may have been conned into buying a bigger story than the truth would support. The rest is simply the case of a novelist's creative talent filling in the gaps and punching up the action."},{"Title":"Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T. Students Who Took Vegas for Millions","review":"Other reviewers have pointed out obvious problems with the account told here. I had to look at the page several times with the &quot;football season&quot; reference...as I could not believe the author had the NFL season backwards...But more than that, I can tell you, even in the 90s, the late-to-mid 90s at that, there is no way you could easily get such forms of ID that were PASSABLE at a major casino where you are cashing thousands of chips, checking in and out routinely. Can you get a cut and paste ID that could fool a bouncer at a local campus? Yes...but when you are talking so much money, they don't play around, if there are any questions, your ID will be scrutinized.No Casino would even DREAM of allowing &quot;thugs&quot; to break into your room. Regardless of whether you were an MIT &quot;geek&quot; &quot;nerd&quot; whatever, or a &quot;high roller&quot; from Boca, one thing is clear, they (the Casino) KNOW you have money. They would not put themselves in such jeopardy, criminally or as far as civil remedies. When you rent a hotel room in ANY state in the US, that is considered your HOME, your domicile, and you have the same rights (and requirements they have a warrant) as you would your home (with one exception, and that is &quot;hotel/motel&quot; ops, which verify that no other adult is staying in your room that is registered, but that is not an issue here).In his comments about Shreveport...again, no police departent is going to send out patrolmen to make sure those &quot;nerdy&quot; MIT guys got out of town with their cash...and never came back. The shotgun reference was classic overdramatization. If these guys got their money from the casino as they said, there would be no need for the police to get involved, or even be ASKED to be involved by the casino.I could go on, but there is a vast array of problems with this book, and overall, the players and all the &quot;crazy, whacky stuff&quot; they get involved in, don't really sound that (street) smart. For that reason, their apparent &quot;cool&quot; attitude going thru airports and dealing with dealers, pit bosses, managers, etc...seems incongruent from other aspects of their personality we get.The interviewing he does, is crappy and appears sporadic, and doesn't shed light on some of the biggest questions the reader might have.I picked the book up at an airport...it read like a poorly written script. It WOULD be a fun movie, IF it has a good script writer and decent actors. The couple in the book will be a nice melodramatic device giving the plot some more depth.I bet Vegas can't WAIT until it comes out and they get a fresh crop of 20-somethings (they can smell the 6-person bookings as I write this) who are going to really &quot;take them down&quot;...it all adds to the mystique and allure of a place like Vegas.The author will be liked by everyone but true card counters."},{"Title":"Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T.

After watching the movie I decided to read the book. I normally don't watch a movie unless I've read the book first. In this case, I'm glad I watched the movie first. The movie made it easier to understand the nonverbal and verbal cues they used to count cards.It seems to me like the producers and writers just took the idea of counting cards and how the MIT kids did it and then Hollywood-ized the rest.As a standalone, the book was good. Not only did they hit Vegas but they also a steamboat casino in the midwest, an Indian casino on the east coast and Atlantic City. The main character, Kevin joins the team because he is tired of his ho-hum life (because I'm sure life at MIT is so ho-hum).Anyway, if you've watched the movie and are interested in a more factual and realistic setting in how they earned millions, you should read the book.

Students Who Took Vegas for Millions","review":"Ben Mezrich tells the story of a card counter of Blackjack, Kevin Lewis, and how Blackjack changed his life forever. In Bringing Down the House, he tells the inside story of six M.I.T. students who took Las Vegas for millions of dollars. Ben Mezrich, a Harvard graduate has written eight books, and this book has been made into a movie, titled \\"21\\". Ben Mezrich did a very good job in accomplishing his goal of letting the world know the exact story of how college student became rich. He interviewed many people, and all of them were from different backgrounds. During these interviews, Ben Mezrich was thorough and included everything that occurred in the interviews. During the time that Kevin counted cards, he had met people that one would not see every day and many very extremely peculiar. In one chapter, Mezrich meets with one of the pit bosses that Kevin was acquainted with, though this man knew him as David Lee, and Mezrich interviewed him, and wrote that he could not believe the stories this man was telling him, as many were more dangerous than one would think. In another chapter Mezrich met one of the women at a club that helped Kevin during his \\"working\\" days. She was a bright woman and she knew how to work Vegas, she assisted Kevin in working the casinos. During the story of Kevin and his Blackjack team, many of the accomplishments that were carried through were unbelievable. There is no one else that has lived the incredible, daring life that Kevin Lewis has, and I believe that Ben Mezrich captures the story perfectly. As I would read, I felt as if I was right there in Las Vegas with Kevin's team, playing the night away."},{"Title":"Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T. Students Who Took Vegas for Millions","review":"Bringing Down the HouseBy Ben MezrichBy Hannah ChavezBen Mezrich gracefully combines his fiction like writing with the true story of the lives of six M.I.T. students, who legally won millions of dollars at blackjack, in his first non-fiction book, Bringing Down the House. In his book, Mezrich attempts to give the reader the inside scoop on a card counter's life and explain how those six specific students teamed up to carry out a nearly undetectable system.Mezrich is the author of nine other books. He graduated from Harvard and worked several other jobs before publishing his first book, Threshold. Now, in Boston, Ben Mezrich is a columnist for the Boston Common and a contributor for a magazine in the UK called Flush. Two of Mezrich's books, including Bringing Down the House, have inspired movies. The film rights have also been sold for his most recent book, Rigged. Whether it is his journalistic habits kicking in or just part of the fun, Mezrich often gets involved in his research. For example, while writing Brining Down the House he smuggled two hundred and fifty thousand dollars past airport security and went up against the Japanese mafia while researching for his book, Ugly Americans.Taking such risks seems to have paid off. He portrays Kevin Lewis's exciting story in an electrifying way that kept me on the edge of my seat at every moment. I learned the basics of blackjack and was taught the mathematical logic behind counting cards. The book also explained how to stay under the radar while counting at casinos.Overall, the book was well written. The facts of card counting, and even a little Vegas history were subtly snuck into the story, so it was insightful, yet not boring. However, there were a few minor details that could confuse some readers. In the book, for instance, Mezrich changes the names of his characters without giving the reader much of a warning. Even so, the book was very enjoyable and I recommend it, especially to people who enjoy math as much as I do."},{"Title":"Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T.

Casinos as a rule tend to be fairly wise in keeping an eye on the trends of cheating. For a bunch of novices to go this far really gives it a 'rise of the little guy' feel. One of the questions the book raised for me was is it really cheating if you know the game backwards and forwards?A really good story (It would make a GREAT movie and I would be surprised if it's not made into one) that makes you think and entertains.

Students Who Took Vegas for Millions","review":"A fascinating, almost unbelievable story about five MIT students (some were dropouts) who took Las Vegas casinos for three million bucks over a five year period They did it by counting the cards in Blackjack shoes, never once revealing what they were doing. Just reading their story makes it sound easy, but it was far from that. The participants, mostly engineering majors, were young, energetic, supersmart, and willingly accepted a lifestyle of rigid personal discipline. Although they did have some fun interspersed with intense periods of rugged concentration at the gaming tables, their \\"gambling\\" junkets from Connecticut to Las Vegas were serious business.Probably not many are aware that for over twenty years, there has been a Blackjack Club in existence at MIT. A few years ago, a team of Blackjack players was assembled from among Club members. The team elected to spend their spare time studying and playing the game of Blackjack, aided by exhaustive computer analysis. Their goal was not to get the best Blackjack hand, but to beat the dealer.Why Blackjack? Over an extended period of time, Blackjack is the only card game that is beatable. It is subject to continuous probability meaning that the cards you see will affect the cards you are going to see. Winning at Blackjack is a matter of figuring out how to take advantage of the game's continuous probability, but to do so, it's necessary to have enough money to withstand severe swings of the game against you.Using what were then, many advanced strategies, the team played Vegas casinos for five years, with never a losing year, and never earned a return of less than thirty percent playing high-stake tables. Their actions were perfectly legal because they didn't alter the game, change the nature of the game, or alter the rules. They discovered, however, that the casinos finally did catch on to what they were doing. They, of course, could not be prosecuted, but casinos have other ways of dealing with patrons who beat the house...Considering the heavy personal discipline of mind and body the players went through in the course of the five-year junket, it would seem they earned their money. After five years of play and over three million dollars later, there is a surprise ending to this gambling saga. A true story full of excitement, intrigue, and a revealing inside look at America's gambling industry."},{"Title":"Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T.

He paints vivid characters with enough flaws to stoke your enthusiasm (who likes their Good Guys perfect?) and make them believable. And he keeps things moving. That there aren't long ruminative, \\"literary\\" stretches didn't bother this reader.

I was disappointed in it though, because it really wasn't well-written, the content could have been covered in many fewer pages, and the narrative didn't have a realistic voice. I also thought this book would have more math content, and be written to a higher-level reader. The author was a bit self-aggrandizing, a real turn-off. It was an interesting story and worth reading from the cultural literacy perspective, but it could have been a much better book."},{"Title":"Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T. Students Who Took Vegas for Millions","review":"If you read lots of gambling/blackjack books, this probably belongs in your library. However, if you read lots of gambling/blackjack books, you might be disappointed with this book -- you'll recognize much of the information Mezrich presents from other sources. He quickly tries to get all of the \\"standard\\" card-counting information presented in the book for those that don't know much about card-counting.....but he tries to convince the reader that he had actual conversations with key people in the book where he learned this information. It comes off feeling very fake. Then, he changes the names of places, people, private investigators/agencies.....without offering a caveat or expaining that he will be doing it. And why should I/we believe anything else that he has written? He has added a lot of fiction to what is supposed to be a non-fictional story.....and done a very poor job of it at that. His style is pitiful -- but, again, if you read a lot of gambling books, you'll be right at home here. He gratuitously mentions landmarks in Boston, again & again & again, just to prove that he knows the city & to try to lend credence to the story.Based on all the positive reviews here -- I wouldn't be surprised if some of these reviews aren't the \\"fictional\\" work of interested parties -- I was hoping to find a well-written gambling book about an incredible interesting topic. Instead, I found another poorly-written gambling book. It's not difficult to stand out in this genre; the competition leaves much to be desired, so it doesn't surprise me that many have praised Menrich. If you buy this book, understand that you are not getting the \\"inside story\\" -- you are probably getting 60% fiction, 40% non-fiction; you are getting three hours worth of reading, and you will have to wade through a lot of crap just to reap what little value there is in the book. It's too bad someone hasn't written the real \\"inside story\\" about the MIT teams. There's something I would happily pay $.. for.If you are considering purchasing this book, search the web for other reviews outside of Amazon. I believe that the Boston Globe published one that comes much closer to the \\"real deal\\" than the ones posted by Amazon users thusfar."},{"Title":"Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T. Students Who Took Vegas for Millions","review":"After reading an excerpt in Wired magazine, I excitedly ordered &quot;Bringing Down the House&quot;. Overall, it's a great story: supergenius kids living a rockstar lifestyle in Vegas, but unfortunately Ben Mezrich (author) comes up short. This is his first attempt at non-fiction, and it shows. Some flashes of actual interviews and unfabricated dialogues appear throughout the work, but it left me disappointed in the end. This work should have let the facts, and the people behind them, speak for themselves, instead of relying on an unnecessary fiction-like framework."},{"Title":"Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T. Students Who Took Vegas for Millions","review":"Halfway through the book as the team arrives at the MGM Grand I'm on the verge of tears as I'm certain they won't get a decent table. But they do; relief washes over me in an awesome wave. I can almost feel the cool rush of oxygen saturated casino air fill my lungs as I turn each page. I can hear the slot machines buzzing as they randomly turn out winners every few minutes. I can also feel the sides of my cheeks starting to hurt when I realize I have been smiling so big for too long.This book instantly transports you to Vegas, and then right to the cushy seat at a black-jack table. Short sweet, and to the point. The pages turn over almost as fast as the cards at the tables. If I had to describe this book in one word it would be \\"fun\\".Remember what it felt like when your best friend had Algebra II 4th period, and you had it 5th period. Remember how he would give you all the answers at lunch for the test you were about to take all year. Having that feeling of knowing you can't loose is what it must be like to be the main character Kevin Lewis or any card-counter for that matter. Of course winning 5 hands at one table at $10,000 a hand is probably a bit more exciting that getting that A+ on a math test in 8th grade.I can't wait to see the movie, and for that matter get to Las Vegas. It is appalling they had to name it \\"21\\" so it wouldn't be confused with the Steve Martin and Queen Latifah Train-wreck with the same name. If you want to take your mind away from your boring life for a few hours and transport yourself to America's playground without having to hop a flight, then this is the book for you."},{"Title":"Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T. Students Who Took Vegas for Millions","review":"A previous review suggested that only 60% of the story is true. I chime in only to tell you unequivocally that the story is 100% true, although some things have been left out. How do I know? I was on the team a long time ago.I was surprised that they gave away as much information as they did, because I would think that some are still employing the system in a slightly altered form. If you're curious, because the list in the book stops at 18, the words for 20 and 21 were cigarettes (20 in a pack) and beer (the legal drinking age). I think it may have been a better read to embellish a little or to include some relevant non-blackjack stories involving the members, but as written it is all true."},{"Title":"Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T. Students Who Took Vegas for Millions","review":"This is a somewhat entertaining book that might have rated four stars if it were true. Under no circumstances would this book be rated five stars--it is just not that well written. Now that the movie is out, which itself plays fast and loose with the contents of the book in order to entertain us (since the goal in the movies is rarely truth), the book's veracity is getting more attention. Read the other negative reviews here as a starting point. Then read the article in the Ideas section of today's Boston Globe Ideas section. A synoposis--the author plays fast and loose with reality, and many of the people involved with the team don't recall many of the 'facts' the author claims they were involved with. One glaring example is a team member being beaten up by casino goons. It apparently never happened, but certainly makes for exciting narrative, doesn't it? If you want an engaging story, it might be worth reading. If you want non-fiction, look elsewhere."},{"Title":"Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T. Students Who Took Vegas for Millions","review":"A great read. Also enjoyed the movie \\"21\\" after the book. It's the story of a group of M.I.T. students who count cards as a team in order to win money playing blackjack. I particularly enjoed watching Liza Lapira!"},{"Title":"Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T. Students Who Took Vegas for Millions","review":"If you are a geek that dreams to become rich in a Vegas-way and use your math analysis brain then it is a book for you. I loved every bit of this book with great background about Vegas behind the curtain (or behind the nice wall). I am going to Vegas this for a 24-hours getaway with my wife and I am sure to watch around my for the sky-in-the-air, and the pit-bosses, and those security guards that patrolling the area around the black-jack tables. As Kevin Lewis wrote, BJ is the ONLY game in Vegas that the history influence the future and any card out of the shoe is less in the deck.Read it and try to be careful when you implement it. This is a game for the grown-ups."},{"Title":"Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T. Students Who Took Vegas for Millions","review":"It was a easy read, interesting - I had seen the movie prior to reading this book and so I knew the story. Liked the development of the characters in the book better than the attempt in the movie, fast paced, very understandable.Good story."},{"Title":"Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T. Students Who Took Vegas for Millions","review":"If you go into a casino thinking you'll win on a consistent basis you are only fooling yourself unless you are playing blackjack and are a trained card counter - in other words you're a casino's nightmare in action. A well trained team of blackjack card sharks can drain a casino as this book shows, but it's not simply card counting skill that is needed to do this, you also need an awareness of your legal rights in the particular casino you are working in (laws differ in states and countries and on Indian reservations as to what is \\"cheating\\") and an ability to play a part and not \\"look\\" like a card shark (eg old or young white guy).This was an interesting, if somewhat superficial book. It's obvious a lot has been left out of the story as the details aren't particularly fantastic in a lot of areas, and you couldn't learn to card count at Vegas reading this book, but it might give you some ideas if you already know how. For people who have a passion for cards and know Vegas well I suspect this book will be a bit old hat and it might give some future MIT students some bright ideas - but no matter how bright you are the casinos will find ways to tighten security so they can catch you and bar you with their equally bright security services so I found this an entertaining read, but it's not something I'd bother reading twice."},{"Title":"Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T.

Great addition to any vacation!"},{"Title":"Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T. Students Who Took Vegas for Millions","review":"I read this book last year on summer vacation. I brought it to casually read on the beach through out the week, but instead read it all in one day. It was so riveting that I could not put it down.Once I read the book, I bought the movie - major disappointment. The movie was terrible and did not follow the book. They took certain liberties in the movie to make it more \\"Hollywood\\" but they just didn't have too (in the movie for instance, the main character's dad passed away, but in the book, he's alive and well and provides an interesting backdrop to the plot).Buy the book, skip the movie."},{"Title":"Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T.

Great buy and a perfect addition to any library public or private!!!"},{"Title":"Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T.

You won't be bored or disappointed if you get it."},{"Title":"Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T. Students Who Took Vegas for Millions","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book, which I actually read after seeing the movie. I was not surprised that they made some changes and added and subtracted some things for the movie, but I have to admit that I was surprised at how much they went out of their way to make the movie bankable. It was a bit frustrating to discover that they literally made up huge chunks of the movie because they obviously didn't think the whole \\"overprivileged Asian kids beating Vegas\\" was dramatic enough.As for the book itself, I was surprised to find, after a bit of research, that there was hardly any truth to it whatsoever. I reference a Boston Globe article that so many others have in their reviews:[...]Although I understand the changes that were made the lies that were perpetuated in the movie for drama's sake, it frustrates me that Mr. Mezrich essentially fabricated so much of this book simply to make it more \\"interesting\\". I would have read it had it not ever mentioned these MIT kids being chased out of Vegas casinos or suffering beat-downs at a casino in the Bahamas.That said...it is still an interesting story and at least Mr. Mezrich did a decent job of telling it. It's a good read but anyone who picks it up needs to know that it is really more a work of fiction than of non-fiction."},{"Title":"Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T. Students Who Took Vegas for Millions","review":"Book was like new and delivered as promised. Great book for a great price. Very easy transaction. Thank you!"},{"Title":"Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T. Students Who Took Vegas for Millions","review":"Author Ben Mezrich is on the streak of a lifetime, with his top-selling, wildly flawed, heavily fictionalized \\"history\\" of a well-known blackjack team getting made into a movie by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. Pretty impressive. MGM, after all, as Mezrich notes in a recent interview, is \\"the same company that owns most of the large casinos in Vegas.\\" (See the February, 2004 Kuro5hin interview at http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2004/2/5/5855/53465.) The only problem with this observation, like many of the major and minor details in Mezrich's book, is that it isn't true. Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, the movie company, and MGM Mirage, the casino company, are totally separate corporations, just as Mezrich's Las Vegas and the real Nevada town are totally different. Mezrich may be the only gambling writer in America who doesn't know these elementary facts.For four years I've supported myself and my family by counting cards in American casinos and winning at blackjack. It is a tense, weird, exhilirating life, and I would love for more of my friends to understand it. This book doesn't help. Not only is the grade-school prose tedious. Not only are the technical blackjack details, on those few occasions when Mezrich summons the pluck to try tackling them, incorrect or misleading. The dramatic structure gropes and falls flat. The journalism is scandalously lazy and erroneous. Above all, the spirit, the eclat that card counters muster to wage our little war against casinoland is missing. Mezrich doesn't get it and can't report it. He hasn't been there and he doesn't know, his scanty experimental plays with MIT alums notwithstanding. If you want to know what gamblers are like and how we live, skip this drivel.Look instead at legendary hustler Amarillo Slim's new memoir, Amarillo Slim in a World Full of Fat People. Look at Jesse May's insuperable poker novel, Shut Up and Deal, which more than any other book depicts the dark heart of the professional player. If it's blackjack history and the activities of the major teams you're into, read Ken Uston. If you want to understand the technical aspects of the game, get Don Schlesinger, Arnold Snyder, Peter Griffin, and, for old time's sake, Ed Thorpe. If you want to learn how a notorious high-stakes counter makes his way in the world, read Ian Andersen's Burning the Tables in Las Vegas. There's so much good gambling writing out there, with so much real-life experience underlying it, that wasting time and money on Mezrich is a sucker's bet."},{"Title":"Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T. Students Who Took Vegas for Millions","review":"This is a fast and explosive read. It's a true story that's so high-powered that the tension never ceases and I was thrust into a roller coaster ride that kept my eyes glued to the pages.The story is told through the eyes of the author, who met one of the students at a party and was so intrigued by his outrageous tale that he was compelled to put it into a book. This is a story of a group of math whizzes, most of Asian descent, who used the art of card counting, worked as teams, and legally won as much as 4 million dollars during the few years they spent their weekends in the Vegas casinos, living the high life.They strapped thousands of dollars to their bodies with Velcro to get the cash onto planes, used false names, and were always on the lookout for Las Vegas personnel who would sometimes personally escort them out of the casinos. They also learned about the seediness of the gambling world, greed, the way the Vegas corporations work. Of course they all went through changes. And eventually, it had to come to an end. Some of it is kind of scary too. But mostly, it's about beating the odds and living with a constant adrenaline high.Well, reading this book is an adrenaline high of it's own. It put me right into the action and kept me there for the whole 257 pages. I loved it.
