In delicate, intricately observed close-up, this novel makes us privy to the private lives of residents of a quiet street over the course of a single day, to the hopes, fears, and unspoken despairs of a diverse community: a single father with painfully scarred hands; a group of young club-goers just home from an all-night rave, sweetly high and mulling over vague dreams; and the nervous young man at number 18 who collects weird urban junk and is haunted by the specter of unrequited love. What eventually unites them is an utterly surprising and terrible twist of fate that shatters their everyday, ordinary tranquility, and all that they take for granted. A prose poem of a novel with a mystery at its center that  recalls To The Lighthouse or Mrs. Dalloway  (The Times), If Nobody Speaks of Remarkable Things was the recipient of the Somerset Maugham Award and the Betty Trask Award, and was named one of the best books of the year by the Los Angeles Times.

Not a flower stirs; the trees forget to wave; the grass itself seems to have ceased to grow; and all Nature, as if suddenly become conscious of her own profound mystery, and feeling no refuge from it but silence, sinks into this wonderful and indescribable repose. Such was the morning in June, when, issuing from the embowered and high-gabled old home of his fathers, Pierre, dewily refreshed and spiritualized by sleep, gayly entered the long, wide, elm-arched street of the village, and half unconsciously bent his steps toward a cottage, which peeped into view near the end of the vista. The verdant trance lay far and wide; and through it nothing came but the brindled kine, dreamily wandering to their pastures, followed, not driven, by ruddy-cheeked, white-footed boys. As touched and bewitched by the loveliness of this silence, Pierre neared the cottage, and lifted his eyes, he swiftly paused, fixing his glance upon one upper, open casement there. Why now this impassioned, youthful pause? Why this enkindled cheek and eye? Upon the sill of the casement, a snow-white glossy pillow reposes, and a trailing shrub has softly rested a rich, crimson flower against it. Well mayst thou seek that pillow, thou odoriferous flower, thought Pierre; not an hour ago, her own cheek must have rested there. \\"Lucy!\\" \\"Pierre!\\" As heart rings to heart those voices rang, and for a moment, in the bright hush of the morning, the two stood silently but ardently eying each other, beholding mutual reflections of a boundless admiration and love.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=T05LCwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"This is Passover","description":"Sarah is excited to celebrate Passover!

The artistic flourishing of the monasteries has received a good deal of attention, but the violent and varied wars have in recent years gone unremembered. In Wars of the Irish Kings, David Willis McCullough has turned back to the earliest accounts of these struggles to present a rich tapestry of Ireland's fight for its identity. Beginning with the legends of ancient wars and warriors, moving through a time when history and storytelling were not separate crafts, into a time when history was as much propaganda as fact, Wars of the Irish Kings tells of tribal battles, foreign invasions, Viking raids, family feuds, wars between rival Irish kingdoms, and wars of rebellion against the English. This collection is peopled with familiar names: Cuchulain, Finn MacCool, Brian Boru, Mad King Sweeney, Strongbow, Edward and Robert Bruce, Queen Elizabeth I and Lord Essex, Hugh O'Donnell, and Hugh O'Neill. Battles formed the legends and history of the land: the Da Dannan meet the Fir Bolgs near Sligo, Brian Boru faces the Vikings at Clontarf in Dublin Bay, High King Rory O'Connor confronts the English invaders near Waterford, O'Briens battle the English (and other O'Briens) at Dysert O'Dea near Limerick, guns are carried for the first time in battle at Knockdoe near Galway, the Bruces from Scotland and their Irish allies overwhelm the English at Connor in Ulster, and Hugh O'Neill ambushes General Bagenal near Armagh. The book ends near Cork in 1601 when the English defeat O'Neill and his Spanish allies at Kinsale. Common people as well as kings appear in these pages. A foot soldier in the early days of gunpowder accidentally sets off a disastrous explosion, a harper's disembodied head is sent by error to the king of England, who displays it as that of the king of Ireland, and a Welsh camp follower named Alice is given the job of executing Irish captives during the English invasion. The sources for these stories and many more range from ancient manuscripts telling of mythical battles to a seventeenth-century siege diary. There are excerpts from such Irish literary masterpieces as The Cattle Raid of Cooley (The Tain), the monumental Annals of the Four Masters, passages from Gerald of Wales's account of the English conquest in the twelfth century, pages from an Icelandic saga, and even a blistering letter from Queen Elizabeth I to her inept commander in Ireland (\\"You do but piece up a hollow peace . . . \\").

Blissfully unaware, they form a connection that knows nothing of race or class hierarchies defining their society. Then one night, after American troops occupy Guanagaspar, their deep friendship is exposed and severed.

Yet the uninitiated may be surprised to learn that Jewish mysticism has been practiced for thousands of years. First published in 1929, The Holy Kabbalah is Arthur E. Waite's guide to these esoteric teachings. Divided into twelve books, with five appendices and a detailed index, this heavily researched volume traces the origins of Kabbalah and examines its influence (if any) on astrology, alchemy, and freemasonry. Including a close look at Kabbalistic literature, and sections on the Zohar and the Ten Sephiroth, this volume will serve as an excellent introduction to the secret tradition for those wanting to learn more about Kabbalah out of scholarship or curiosity. American-born British author ARTHUR EDWARD WAITE (1857-1942) was cocreator of the famous 1910 Rider-Waite Tarot deck.

Those were the words Lieutenant Commander Robert Copeland calmly told his crew as their tiny, unarmored destroyer escort rushed toward giant, armored Japanese battleships at the Battle off Samar on October 25, 1944. This action-packed narrative history of destroyer-class ships brings readers inside the half-inch-thick hulls to meet the men who fired the ships' guns, torpedoes, hedgehogs, and depth charges. Nicknamed \\"tin cans\\" or \\"greyhounds,\\" destroyers were fast escort and attack ships that proved indispensable to America's military victories. Beginning with destroyers' first incarnation as torpedo boats in 1874 and ending with World War II, author Clint Johnson shares the riveting stories of the Destroyer Men who fought from inside a \\"tin can\\" risking death by cannons, bombs, torpedoes, fire, and drowning. The British invented destroyers, the Japanese improved them, and the Germans failed miserably with them. It was the Americans who perfected destroyers as the best fighting ship in two world wars. Tin Cans & Greyhounds compares the designs of these countries with focus on the old, modified World War I destroyers, and the new and numerous World War II destroyers of the United States. Tin Cans & Greyhounds details how destroyers fought submarines, escorted convoys, rescued sailors and airmen, downed aircraft, shelled beaches, and attacked armored battleships and cruisers with nothing more than a half-inch of steel separating their crews from the dark waves.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=qsFkDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Essex Aircraft Carriers","description":"The latest volume covers the hugely important American carrier of the Second World War.

Professor Cuno uses previously underexploited sources - court records, fatwas, and land-tax registers - to shed new light on changes in the system of peasant land tenure, urban-rural commerce, the rural social structure, and the interplay of formal law with peasant customs and attitudes. The author challenges traditional interpretations of Egypt's past which draw too sharp a distinction between the 'Ottoman' and 'modern' periods, a distinction closely related to the notion that contact with Europe brought on the 'awakening' of the modern nation. Cuno offers a new perspective on changes introduced in the agrarian regime by Muhammad Ali Pasha (1805-48) by comparing them with the policies of earlier rulers. He also refutes the view that cash-crop agriculture, the commoditization of land, and a stratified rural society were nineteenth-century developments, showing instead that they were centuries-old features of the Egyptian countryside. The Pasha's peasants will be of interest not only to students of Egyptian and Middle East history but also to those with a general interest in issues of law and society, peasants, and the making of the modern non-Western world.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=gYWGAAAAIAAJ&dq=The+Pasha%27s+Peasants:+Land,+Society+and+Economy+in+Lower+Egypt,+1740-1858+(Cambridge+Middle+East+Library)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Born grown: An Oklahoma City history","description":"No community in the world had an origin comparable to that of Oklahoma City.

She argues for a more honest, more complex portrait of the true nature of the connections and missed connections among characters and, fascinatingly, between the writer and the reader. D'Erasmo takes us deep into the structure and grammar of these intimacies as they have been portrayed by such writers as Joan Didion, Toni Morrison, D. H.

She asks whether writing about intimacy is like staring straight into the sun, but it is her own brilliance that dazzles in the piercing and original book, The Art of Intimacy.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=PSHKMQEACAAJ&dq=The+Art+of+Intimacy&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Elements of Modern Algebra","description":"ELEMENTS OF MODERN ALGEBRA, Eighth Edition, with its user-friendly format, provides you with the tools you need to succeed in abstract algebra and develop mathematical maturity as a bridge to higher-level mathematics courses.

The father of the U.S. president, the first Barack Hussein Obama, was born in rural poverty in Kenya. His own father was a dominating figure who worked as a cook for the British colonists and broke with Luo tradition when he converted to the Muslim faith. Their household was a severe one from which Barack's mother fled in fear for her life. Despite such domestic turmoil, Barack was as fiercely smart as he was intrepid. Admitted to one of Kenya's premiere private schools, he was later thrown out for his defiant behavior. Adrift in the political churning of Kenya's pre-independence days, Barack attracted the interest of an American literacy worker who took him under her wing. By day, they worked on the literacy primers that would change the lives of illiterate Africans. By night, they often went dancing in the full glare of disapproval of those racially segregated times. She helped him prepare for college in America and in 1959 paid his first year's tuition at the University of Hawaii. The first African student on the UH campus, Barack stood out in many respects. One of those was the young white woman, Ann Dunham, whom he began to date. A year after they met, the couple had a son named Barack Hussein Obama II. Barack did not tell his young wife about the two children he had left behind in Kenya, nor did he tell university authorities about his family back home until much later. Luos were often polygamous and Obama saw no need to part with custom. At Harvard University, Barack joined the academic elite and prepared to take his place among the big men in newly independent Kenya. But Barack's experience at Harvard was emblematic of a life that seesawed between high hopes and cruel frustrations, many of them self-inflicted in drunken furies. Yet the charm, the intellectual brilliance, and the fierce pride in his vision of independent Kenya never flagged.

Lars-Erik Cederman argues that this lack of conceptual preparation stems from two tendencies in conventional theorizing. First, the dominant focus on cohesive nation-states as the only actors of world politics obscures crucial differences between the state and the nation. Second, traditional theory usually treats these units as fixed. Cederman offers a fresh way of analyzing world politics: complex adaptive systems modeling. He provides a new series of models--not ones that rely on rational-choice, but rather computerized thought-experiments--that separate the state from the nation and incorporate these as emergent rather than preconceived actors. This theory of the emergent actor shifts attention away from the exclusively behavioral focus of conventional international relations theory toward a truly dynamic perspective that treats the actors of world politics as dependent rather than independent variables. Cederman illustrates that while structural realist predictions about unit-level invariance hold up under certain circumstances, they are heavily dependent on fierce power competition, which can result in unipolarity instead of the balance of power. He provides a thorough examination of the processes of nationalist mobilization and coordination in multi-ethnic states. Cederman states that such states' efforts to instill loyalty in their ethnically diverse populations may backfire, and that, moreover, if the revolutionary movement is culturally split, its identity becomes more inclusive as the power gap in the imperial center's favor increases.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Mc3xDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Time Twisters (Avon SF, G-1231)","description":"A reference guide to the prices of paperback collectible books and a bibliography of paperback imprints.

It is a praiseworthy contribution to American biography and to Confederate history.   Bell I. Wiley Here is the first critical biography of the Confederate general who commanded the largest theater of the Civil War, the Trans-Mississippi Department, and who held the same important command post longer than any other officer on either side. Edmund Kirby Smith, one of only seven full generals commanding Confederate armies in the field, exercised civil as well as Military authority in the isolated Trans-Mississippi area to such an extent that this part of the Confederacy came to be known as  Kirbysmithdom.  A native of St. Augustine, Florida, Kirby Smith was twice breveted for the bravery in the Mexican War. He spent the 1850s at various frontier posts and at the outbreak of the Civil war hurried to Confederate headquarters to offer his services. Soon he was a brigadier with Joseph E. Johnston in northern Virginia, and he is credited with playing a key role in the rout of the Union forces at first Manassas. In the spring of 1863 he assumed command of the vast Trans-Mississippi Department. At the fall of the Confederacy, Kirby Smith was the last general to surrender. He spent the final twenty years of his life as a teacher and died in Sewanee, Tennessee, in 1893, where he had been a professor at the University of the South. At the time of its origin publication in 1954, this book won the first Sydnor Memorial Award, given by the Southern Historical Association for the best book in southern history.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=4T-UnAdwuMIC&dq=General+Edmund+Kirby+Smith,+C.S.A+(Southern+biography+series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Road from Serfdom: The Economic and Political Consequences of the End of Communism","description":"An interpretation of recent history and a prescription for the future link the collapse of communism to the global failure of this century's concepts regarding collectivism. 20,000 first printing.

It follows the ambitions of Julien Sorel, a young man raised in the French countryside who wishes to rise above his provincial station by climbing the social ranks of Parisian society. Through a series of events, Juliens talent and hard work give way to deception and hypocrisy when he realizes the limitations for advancement of a sincere and honest man of humble origins. Although Julien achieves much which he aspires to, ultimately his pride gets the better of him when he commits a violent crime of passion, leading to his tragic downfall. Through the deep psychological introspection of Julien we see Stendhals unique literary genius, the remarkable way in which he allows readers to live in the minds of his characters. Set against the backdrop of the July Revolution of 1830, The Red and the Black is a narrative which embodies the rich social conflict of that time.

Would you want to fly in a plane designed by people convinced that the laws of physics are socially constructed? Would you want to be tried by a legal system indifferent to the distinction between fact and fiction? These questions may seem absurd, but these are theories being seriously advanced by radical multiculturalists that force us to ask them. These scholars assert that such concepts as truth and merit are inextricably racist and sexist, that reason and objectivity are merely sophisticated masks for ideological bias, and that reality itself is nothing more than a socially constructed mechanism for preserving the power of the ruling elite. In Beyond All Reason, liberal legal scholars Daniel A. Farber and Suzanna Sherry mount the first systematic critique of radical multiculturalism as a form of legal scholarship. Beginning with an incisive overview of the origins and basic tenets of radical multiculturalism, the authors critically examine the work of Derrick Bell, Catherine MacKinnon, Patricia Williams, and Richard Delgado, and explore the alarming implications of their theories. Farber and Sherry push these theories to their logical conclusions and show that radical multiculturalism is destructive of the very goals it wishes to affirm. If, for example, the concept of advancement based on merit is fraudulent, as the multiculturalists claim, the disproportionate success of Jews and Asians in our culture becomes difficult to explain without opening the door to age-old anti-Semitic and racist stereotypes. If historical and scientific truths are entirely relative social constructs, then Holocaust denial becomes merely a matter of perspective, and Creationism has as much \\"validity\\" as evolution. The authors go on to show that rather than promoting more dialogue, the radical multiculturalist preferences for legal storytelling and identity politics over reasoned argument produces an insular set of positions that resist open debate. Indeed, radical multiculturalists cannot critically examine each others' ideas without incurring vehement accusations of racism and sexism, much less engage in fruitful discussion with a mainstream that does not share their assumptions. Here again, Farber and Sherry show that the end result of such thinking is not freedom but a kind of totalitarianism where dissent cannot be tolerated and only the naked will to power remains to settle differences. Sharply written and brilliantly argued, this book is itself a model of the kind of clarity, civility, and dispassionate critical thinking which the authors seek to preserve from the attacks of the radical multiculturalists. With far-reaching implications for such issues as government control of hate speech and pornography, affirmative action, legal reform, and the fate of all minorities, Beyond All Reason is a provocative contribution to one of the most important controversies of our time.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=5iDoCwAAQBAJ&dq=Beyond+All+Reason:+The+Radical+Assault+on+Truth+in+American+Law&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Twelve Weeks in Spring: The Inspiring Story of Margaret and Her Team","description":"\\"My parent needs help, but refuses to consider a nursing home.\\" That s the dilemma facing millions of baby boomers today.

It is all in their heads. From the beleaguered - some would say baffled - silence on the left, this book at long last emerges with a devastating diagnosis of the \\"debate\\" over political correctness. Written with refreshing clarity and wit, \\"Political correctness\\" describes a cultural non-phenomenon brought into being by the desires of new-conservatives. Nostalgic for the simple moral logic of the Cold War, the conservative right has created an evil empire within and conferred upon its enemies - from multiculturalists to postmodernists and poststructuralists - an agenda that demands action from the high-minded. What clearly marks this as a projection, Richard Feldstein points out, is the moralism attributed to the forces of political correctness by their conservative critics. And where, in fact, do we find the obsessive fixation on judgement, morality, and correct and appropriate behaviour, that might make political correctness so reprehensible? It is, Feldstein argues, a central feature of right-wing thinking, projected onto those who reject such black-and-white, good-and-bad views as naive. \\"Political correctness\\" defines this procedure in comparison with the process of psychological projection, in which consciousness transfer onto others what it cannot tolerate. In the case of cultural projection, Feldstein says, the transference is often intentional. This book is not just an essential tool to understanding the way the right deploys this powerful weapon; it is a guide to resisting the cynical use of these tactics in our media-saturated society, one that acknowledges the complexity of life in our multicultural, postmodern world.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=v-j9KimAk08C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Joseph Schillinger: A Memoir (Music Reprint Series)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=8HlBAAAAMAAJ&dq=Joseph+Schillinger:+A+Memoir+(Music+Reprint+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Math Magic: How to Master Everyday Math Problems, Revised Edition","description":"MATH MAGIC revised edition is for all of us who need and want to improve our understanding of math.

From Christmas night of 1776, when George Washington and his troops crossed the Delaware River, to the twentieth century and the saga of Charles Lindbergh s missing infant son, Hopewell Valley has been steeped in history and drama. Rare images gathered from the Hopewell Valley Historical Society and local residents make up this monumental pictorial journey. Hopewell Valley combines the famous and not-so-famous elements of these communities nestled between the Delaware River and the Sourland Mountains. Home to key figures in American history, the Hopewell Valley has also seen important developments in architecture and industry. Although modernization has taken hold, the rural character of the area remains intact. And although the area has been home to well-known faces and events, Hopewell Valley is peppered with the lesser-known faces and places that bring out the full flavor.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=umAxMUMZSiMC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Napalm & Silly Putty 2002 Day-To-Day Calendar","description":"Napalm was invented on Valentine s Day 1942 at a secret Harvard war research laboratory.

That is how Harold Nicolson begins this book. It is an apt opening. The Paris Conference of 1919, attended by thirty-two nations, had the supremely challenging task of attempting to bring about a lasting peace after the global catastrophe of the Great War. Harold Nicolson was a member of the British delegation. His book is in two parts. In the first he provides an account of the conference, in the second his diary covering his six month stint. There is a piquant counterpoise between the two. Of his diary he writes, 'I should wish it to be read as people read the reminiscences of a subaltern in the trenches. There is the same distrust of headquarters; the same irritation against the staff-officer who interrupts; the same belief that one's own sector is the centre of the battle-front; the same conviction that one is, with great nobility of soul, winning the war quite single-handed.' The diary ends with prophetic disillusionment, 'To bed, sick of life.' As a first-hand account of one of the most important events shaping the modern world this book remains a classic.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=IZRKAQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cinderella","description":"With the help of her fairy godmother, a kitchen maid mistreated by her stepmother and stepsisters attends the palace ball where she meets the prince of her dreams.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=HrV0sNImjgoC&dq=Cinderella&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Getting Ready to Help: A Primer on Interacting in Human Service","description":"This practical, inspirational handbook on interacting in human services provides real-world advice on issues such as recognizing and avoiding potentially harmful interactional styles, developing a deeper understanding of behavior, promoting autonomy and i","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=nM8AAAAACAAJ&dq=Getting+Ready+to+Help:+A+Primer+on+Interacting+in+Human+Service&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Bourgeois Blues","description":"A stunning memoir of a gifted young middle-class black man and his struggle to succeed in white America.

While the rest of us worry whether our goals are attainable, those who practice optimism try to achieve theirs.

Dennis, humanity is entering a momentous phase in its history. Being born today is a generation of children that will radically reinvent human society, moving our culture from competition, control, and censorship toward connection, communication, and compassion. The Phoenix Generation's impact will begin to be felt in 2030, but there much to do to prepare for their arrival. The book is divided into three parts. Part one briefly describes the thorny issues (e.g. global warming, nationalism, and food and water shortages) that the solution-oriented ways of the Phoenix will resolve. Dennis posits that the generations of adults living today are the bridge to the Phoenix and he shows how such developments as the worldwide web and the explosion of mobile technologies are paving the way for them. Part two describes the changes in our own consciousness being brought about by technology and what we need to do to speed their arrival. Part three gives details how the Phoenix generation will be different from us. The Phoenix Generation will work toward forming a planetary society a transition more radical than the shift from agrarian to urban life during the Industrial Revolution. These children are being born with increased instinctive intelligence and with a greater degree of inherited wisdom. With them, the quantum revolution begun 100 years ago will become mainstream. This will bring about a shift away from external dependencies (e.g. our dependency on higher education for career advancement). This normalizing of new perspectives, cosmic awareness, and of multi-dimensional realities will usher in a great wave of change. The Phoenix Generation is a deeply positive examination of our collective future.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=WHc8CgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Peak Forest Tramway 1794-1936 (Locomotion papers, no. 38)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ZPsUAQAAIAAJ&dq=The+Peak+Forest+Tramway+1794-1936+(Locomotion+papers,+no.+38)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Fast Eddie, King of the Bees","description":"A hustler searches for truth in a dystopian Boston, in this novel of  comically elaborate twists and turns of plot [and] broad social satire  (Robert Coover, bestselling author of The Public Burning).

And so is the woman who gave it to Jack, the foster mother only days away from dying, her mind eroded by dementia, the family legacy she entrusted to Jack now owned by banks and strangers. And Jack's mind has begun to fail, too. The decades of bare-knuckle fighting are now taking their toll, as concussion after concussion forces him to carry around a stash of illegal painkillers and a notebook of names that separates friend from foe. But in a single twisted night, Jack loses his chance to win it all back. Hijacked by a sleazy gambler out to settle a score, Jack is robbed of the money that will clear his debt with Big Momma Sweet -- the queen of Delta vice, whose deep backwoods playground offers sin to all those willing to pay -- and open a path that could lead him back home. Yet this sudden reversal of fortunes introduces an unlikely savior in the form of a sultry, tattooed carnival worker. Guided by what she calls her \\"church of coincidence,\\" Annette pushes Jack toward redemption, only to discover that the world of Big Momma Sweet is filled with savage danger. Damaged by regret, crippled by twenty-five years of fists and elbows, heartbroken by his own betrayals, Jack is forced to step into the fighting pit one last time, the stakes nothing less than life or death.

If only that were true. The Founding Fathers wanted the judicial branch to serve as a check on the power of the legislative and executive, and gave the Supreme Court the responsibility of interpreting the Constitution in a way that would safeguard individual freedoms. In some cases, like Brown V. Board of Education and United States V. Lopez, the Court fulfilled its role, protecting us from racial discrimination and the heavy hand of the federal government. But sadly, the Supreme Court has also handed down many destructive decisions on cases you probably never learned about in school. In The Dirty Dozen, two distinguished legal scholars shed light on the twelve worst cases, which allowed government to interfere in your private contractual agreements; curtail your rights to criticize or support political candidates; arrest and imprison you indefinitely, without filing charges; and seize your private property, without compensation, when someone uses the property for criminal activity even if you don t know about it! This is not a book just for lawyers. It s for all Americans who want to understand how the Supreme Court can affect our right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.

It traces the life of a boy who never lost sight of who he was or what was expected of him. His formative years were spent during the great depression in an area that had little to offer but where much was expected even when the going proved difficult. It is a story that disguises pathos as humor even though the humor is genuine. It portrays a life fraught with difficulty but where each difficulty is overcome by sheer force of willpower. The writer displays affection for his mother by portraying a person of such great strength and character that one must imagine a giant only to find a thin aging woman barely five feet tall. Each segment of the story has its own unique appeal. One episode dealing with the writer's description of life at a CCC camp is especially compelling. It deals with Polish/American boys interacting with the Catholic Church three thousand miles from home and is sure to bring a tear to the eye of even the hardest heart. Although the entire piece is essentially esoteric it has meaning and purpose to anyone who survived that era. . . .

Martin Edwards got plenty of kudos for his Harry Devlin series, and he should get even more for this one. His DCI Hannah Scarlett is a fine creation.\\"  Peter Robinson, New York Times bestselling author Oxford historian and TV personality Daniel Kind and his new lover, Miranda, both want to escape to a new life. On impulse they buy Tarn Cottage in Brackdale, an idyllic valley in the Lake District that Daniel knew as a boy, a place so remote that the dead had to be carried out over the peaks on pack animals along the ancient Coffin Trail. Tarn Cottage was once home to Barrie Gilpin, an autistic youth suspected of a savage murder. A young woman visitor to the valley had been found laid out on the Sacrifice Stone, an ancient pagan site up on the fell. Barrie fell to his death near the crime scene before he could be questioned. All these years later, Daniel retains his belief in Barrie's innocence and questions his own policeman father's handling of the case. When DCI Hannah Scarlett and her squad launch a cold case review, Brackdale's skeletons begin to rattle. The wild geography of the Lakes District plays against local literary references, all backdrop to the lives of villagers and outsiders drawn to this beautiful spot but for what reasons? The Coffin Trail launches a new series by a master British hand.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=90QIIPtAZ6AC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"THE JEWS OF SILENCE","description":"In the fall of 1965 the Israeli newspaper Haaretz sent a young journalist named Elie Wiesel to the Soviet Union to report on the lives of Jews trapped behind the Iron Curtain.  I would approach Jews who had never been placed in the Soviet show window by Soviet authorities,  wrote Wiesel.  They alone, in their anonymity, could describe the conditions under which they live; they alone could tell whether the reports I had heard were true or false and whether their children and their grandchildren, despite everything, still wish to remain Jews. From them I would learn what we must do to help . . . or if they want our help at all.  What he discovered astonished him: Jewish men and women, young and old, in Moscow, Kiev, Leningrad, Vilna, Minsk, and Tbilisi, completely cut off from the outside world, overcoming their fear of the ever-present KGB to ask Wiesel about the lives of Jews in America, in Western Europe, and, most of all, in Israel. They have scant knowledge of Jewish history or current events; they celebrate Jewish holidays at considerable risk and with only the vaguest ideas of what these days commemorate.  Most of them come [to synagogue] not to pray,  Wiesel writes,  but out of a desire to identify with the Jewish people about whom they know next to nothing.  Wiesel promises to bring the stories of these people to the outside world. And in the home of one dissident, he is given a gift a Russian-language translation of Night, published illegally by the underground.   My God,  I thought,  this man risked arrest and prison just to make my writing available to people here!  I embraced him with tears in my eyes.

Tens of thousands of Texans joined military units, and scarcely a household in the state was unaffected as mothers and wives assumed new roles in managing farms and plantations. Still others grappled with the massive social, political, and economic changes wrought by the bloodiest conflict in American history. The sixteen essays (eleven of them new) from some of the leading historians in the field in the second edition of Lone Star Blue and Gray illustrate the rich traditions and continuing vitality of Texas Civil War scholarship. Along with these articles, editors Ralph A. and Robert Wooster provide a succinct introduction to the war and Texas and recommended readings for those seeking further investigations of virtually every aspect of the war as experienced in the Lone Star State.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=nFR1CAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Jungle Ace: Col.

Kings and Queens of England offers readable profiles of 59 English monarchs from Harold II to Henry VIII, and from Ethelred the Unready to Elizabeth II. Each monarch is elegantly profiled and the impact of their rule on wider English history clearly and concisely described and analysed. For every king and queen there is a detailed timeline, and the narrative is further amplified by display quotations, feature boxes, panels of key biographical facts, and - last but not least - by 135 lavish full-colour images. Ian Crofton recounts a 1000-year tale of murder, invasion, usurpation, adultery, divorce, civil war and revolution in a manner that is as entertaining as it is informative. The Kings and Queens of England is the perfect choice for anyone looking for an illustrated account of the English monarchy from the Anglo-Saxon era to the present.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Xa2ZuAAACAAJ&dq=Kings+and+queens+of+England&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Time Out For War","description":"An Air Force captain recounts his capture by the Gestapo after being shot down over occupied France, his escape back to France, and his involvement with the French underground","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=QxDwyHlwc-QC&dq=Time+Out+For+War&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Accidental Courage, Boundless Dreams: The True Story of One Family's Search for Healing After the Death of Their Young Son and How They Learned to Deal With Loss by Celebrating Life","description":"Accidental Courage, Boundless Dreams is the extraordinary true story of one family that suffered the \\"unthinkable\\" yet triumphed over tragedy.

Dr. Marie Heaton is an anesthesiologist at the height of her profession. She has worked, lived, and breathed her career since medical school, and she now practices at a top Seattle hospital. Marie has carefully constructed and constricted her life according to empirical truths, to the science and art of medicine. But when her tried-and-true formula suddenly deserts her during a routine surgery, she must explain the nightmarish operating room disaster and face the resulting malpractice suit. Marie s best friend, colleague, and former lover, Dr. Joe Hillary, becomes her closest confidante as she twists through depositions, accusations and a remorseful preoccupation with the mother of the patient in question. As she struggles to salvage her career and reputation, Marie must face hard truths about the path she s chosen, the bridges she s burned, and the colleagues and superiors she s mistaken for friends. A quieter crisis is simultaneously unfolding within Marie s family. Her aging father is losing his sight and approaching an awkward dependency on Marie and her sister, Lori. But Lori has taken a more traditional path than Marie and is busy raising a family. Although Marie has been estranged from her Texas roots for decades, the ultimate responsibility for their father s care is falling on her. As her carefully structured life begins to collapse, Marie confronts questions of love and betrayal, family bonds and the price of her own choices. Set against the natural splendor of Seattle, and inside the closed vaults of hospital operating rooms, Oxygen climaxes in a final twist that is as heartrending as it is redeeming.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=UA7SoIsQiCUC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Toys That Kill","description":"A shocking expose of the dangerous toys that are available, including a specific list of toys which have resulted in death or injury and over 250 others which are potentially harmful.

Set in Norway and Iceland at the beginning of the eleventh century, Gunnar's Daughter is the story of the beautiful, spoiled Vigdis Gunnarsdatter, who is raped by the man she had wanted to love. A woman of courage and intelligence, Vigdis is toughened by adversity. Alone she raises the child conceived in violence, repeatedly defending her autonomy in a world governed by men. Alone she rebuilds her life and restores her family's honor until an unremitting social code propels her to take the action that again destroys her happiness. First published in 1909, Gunnar's Daughter was in part a response to the rise of nationalism and Norway's search for a national identity in its Viking past. But unlike most of the Viking-inspired art of its period, Gunnar's Daughter is not a historical romance. It is a skillful conversation between two historical moments about questions as troublesome in Undset's own time and in ours as they were in the Saga Age: rape and revenge, civil and domestic violence, troubled marriages, and children made victims of their parents' problems.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=-gKeHlOdRD8C&dq=Gunnar%27s+daughter,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Existence and Attributes of God, Vol. 2","description":"The Existence and Attributes of God comprises the first two volumes of the works of Stephen Charnock (1628-1680), an English puritan divine who was highly skilled in philosophy, patristics, Reformed theology, and Biblical languages. These volumes are his abiding monument. They are worthy of being compared with the finest in theology. \\"When the existence and attributes of God are called into question, to whom else can we better go than to Stephen Charnock'' . . . ''those [things revealed belong to us and to our children forever]. The material that Charnock discusses is firmly founded in the Word of God'' . . . ''Both the Old Testament and the New emphasize these two things: First, we should study the whole revelation, not just some easy or favorite parts of it; secondly, the study of God's attributes is not dry as dust theology, but is practical; that is, it leads to righteousness\\" (Dr. Gordon H. Clark, from a preface to this great work in a Sovereign Grace edition, 1958). One of the greatest tragedies in these spiritually starved times is the sad fact that most Christians know so very little about their God. It is often said that this is simply because these volumes are exhaustive on the subject. Yet it is clearly filled with sublime expositions of the truth regarding God's existence and attributes. \\"Charnock displays God's attributes not as impersonal abstractions for the mind to juggle with, but as qualities observable in the concrete actions of the living God of which the Bible speaks. The technical terms and sometimes, arguments of scholastic theology are employed, but always with a Biblical orientation. Charnock has no desire to speculate, but only to declare the works and ways, the nature and character, of the God of the Bible. The substance of his doctrine is characteristically Puritan and representatively Reformed.\\" (Dr. James I. Packer, in The Encyclopedia of Christianity, Volume II, p. 410) The possessor of these rare volumes will be blessed by getting acquainted with the incomparable God, and thereby will reach a higher plane of spiritual enjoyment never attained before. To know Him better is to love Him more.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=1HSYbKrVR8AC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dennis the Menace 'Jangle Bells!

The Bitch In the House. This e-book includes an exclusive excerpt from The Bitch is Back: Older, Wiser, and Getting Happier, a second collection of essays from nine of the contributors featured in The Bitch in the House and from sixteen captivating new voices. Women today have more choices than at any time in history, yet many smart, ambitious, contemporary women are finding themselves angry, dissatisfied, stressed out. Why are they dissatisfied? And what do they really want? These questions form the premise of this passionate, provocative, funny, searingly honest collection of original essays in which twenty-six women writers ranging in age from twenty-four to sixty-five, single and childless or married with children or four times divorced invite readers into their lives, minds, and bedrooms to talk about the choices they ve made, what s working, and what s not. With wit and humor, in prose as poetic and powerful as it is blunt and dead-on, these intriguing women offer details of their lives that they ve never publicly revealed before, candidly sounding off on: ? The difficult decisions and compromises of living with lovers, marrying, staying single and having children ? The perpetual tug of war between love and work, family and career ? The struggle to simultaneously care for ailing parents and a young family ? The myth of co-parenting ? Dealing with helpless mates and needy toddlers ? The constrictions of traditional women s roles as well as the cliches of feminism ? Anger at laid-back live-in lovers content to live off a hardworking woman s checkbook ? Anger at being criticized for one s weight ? Anger directed at their mothers, right and wrong ? And well more anger...  This book was born out of anger,  begins Cathi Hanauer, but the end result is an intimate sharing of experience that will move, amuse, and enlighten. The Bitch in the House is a perfect companion for your students as they plot a course through the many voices of modern feminism. This is the sound of the collective voice of successful women today-in all their anger, grace, and glory. From The Bitch In the House:  I believed myself to be a feminist, and I vowed never to fall into the same trap of domestic boredom and servitude that I saw my mother as being fully entrenched in; never to settle for a life that was, as I saw it, lacking independence, authority, and respect.   E.S. Maduro, page 5  Here are a few things people have said about me at the office:  You re unflappable.   Are you ever in a bad mood?  Here are things people okay, the members of my family have said about me at home:   Mommy is always grumpy.   Why are you so tense?   You re too mean to live in this house and I want you to go back to work for the rest of your life!    Kristin van Ogtrop, page 161  I didn t want to be a bad mother I wanted to be my mother-safe, protective, rational, calm-without giving up all my anger, because my anger fueled me.

These comments are not malice or mean in context, but are made out of purity and free spirit, just as adults are at heart. Adults remain children at heart. And sometimes, when no one is looking, even they can be seen drawing outside the lines.\\" This is an excerpt taken from the article \\"Kids Say the Darnedest Things,\\" written by Alison Swade, News Editor for The Leader, an award-winning student newspaper at Elmhurst College, Illinois. As children develop with their friends and families, they learn to speak and write appropriately, depending on positive or negative feedbacks they receive. It is important to capture their sincere and honest thoughts. In this book of poetries, the young Yu children express themselves exactly as they see and question life. There are no restrictions, no rights or wrongs, only pure and good intention. As adults, we often reminisce about our childhood memories; how enjoyable it was just to eat ice cream without worrying about adding inches; or how fast or high we can run and jump without aches and pains. The good \\"old\\" days, so to speak, in truth, is really the good \\"young\\" days. Children grow up in a blink of an eye. To be able to express their hearts and souls in poetries is timeless and everlasting.

Francis A. Schaeffer says that the biblical emphasis is quite different. With God there are no little people! This book contains sixteen sermons that explore the weakness and significance of humanity in relationship to the infinite and personal God. Each was preached by Schaeffer at L' Abri Fellowship in Switzerland to the community that gathered there to work, learn, and worship together. The focus of this collection is the lasting truth of the Bible, the faithfulness of God, the sufficiency of the work of Christ, and the reality of God's Spirit in history. The sermons represent a variety of styles-- some are topical, some expound Old Testament passages, and still others delve into New Testament texts. No Little People includes theological sermons and messages that focus specifically on daily life and Christian practice. Each sermon is a single unit, and all are valuable for family devotions or other group study and worship. Readers will be encouraged by the value that God places on each person made in His image.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=maQNAQAAMAAJ&dq=No+Little+People:+Sixteen+sermons+for+the+twentieth+century&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Virgin and the Outlaw (Silhouette Intimate Moments, No 857)","description":"All Gillian Appleby had ever wanted out of life was to fly.

The chapters on leading contemporary architects have been greatly expanded. There is new material on the later development of Frank Lloyd Wright and the more recent buildings of Walter Gropius, particularly his American Embassy in Athens. In his discussion of Le Corbusier, Mr. Giedion provides detailed analyses of the Carpenter Center at Harvard University, Le Corbusier s only building in the United States, and his Priory of La Tourette near Lyons. There is a section on his relations with his clients and an assessment of his influence on contemporary architecture, including a description of the Le Corbusier Center in Zurich (designed just before his death), which houses his works of art. The chapters on Mies van der Rohe and Alvar Aalto have been brought up to date with examples of their buildings in the sixties.

The Native peoples of the American Southwest are a unique group, for while the arrival of Europeans forced many Native Americans to leave their land behind, those who lived in the Southwest held their ground. Many still reside in their ancestral homes, and their oral histories, social practices, and material artifacts provide revelatory insight into the history of the region and the country as a whole. Trudy Griffin-Pierce incorporates her lifelong passion for the people of the Southwest, especially the Navajo, into an absorbing narrative of pre- and postcontact Native experiences. She finds that, even though the policies of the U.S. government were meant to promote assimilation, Native peoples formed their own response to outside pressures, choosing to adapt rather than submit to external change. Griffin-Pierce provides a chronology of instances that have shaped present-day conditions in the region, as well as an extensive glossary of significant people, places, and events. Setting a precedent for ethical scholarship, she describes different methods for researching the Southwest and cites sources for further archaeological and comparative study. Completing the volume is a selection of key primary documents, literary works, films, Internet resources, and contact information for each Native community, enabling a more thorough investigation into specific tribes and nations.

The book explores the impact that well-defined and carefully integrated processes have on organizational performance.

The old ways of conducting business are out: pushing costs and compromising quality in order to achieve the lowest possible price. The emerging paradigm focuses on the core processes.

One may take many angles as to how one should respond to an inhumane event. The stress and/or outcome of such an event can cause depression, suicide, rage or regrettably more tragedy. To respond to tragedy as to improve one's quality of life can be very difficult, but it is necessary. Ironically, it is easy to react in an aggressive manner because it feels good, but to respond with love is emotionally challenging. This book is written through love. It is not done through timidity, but rather with the intent to lift the hopeless and encourage those who open their heart to the content of its pages. This is a true story illustrating hard work, triumph, adversity, dedication, and commitment, to include a sincere foundation of character through uncertainty. Life is not fair sometimes, but it is still life, and for that one should be grateful. The alternative is to not have life at all. Our action and reaction to living in this world can either prepare us or ill equip us to life beyond. No matter what your faith or belief, your spirit should live forever. Exactly how your spirit continues to live depends on you. As you open yourself to the people in this book, Madeline, Jonathon, Peter, and Samuel, you will see they are similar to you. None were born with special privileges. They were all everyday people with a drive to fly though the heavens. Their journeys to become major airline pilots were more profound than actually being one. The journey to their goal helped them build the strength to sustain what they would endure after they reached their objective. A pilot of a major airline projects an image to the general public. He or she is looked at as middle aged, well-trained, competent, responsible, intelligent, professional, arrogant, controlling, motivated, know it alls. The point you may not be aware of is what steps each pilot goes through on his or her route to earn a place in the major airline industry flying airplanes. We all have a tendency to look at the result with out appreciating the journey. This book is an account of four individuals who endured controversy and, with a combination of heart and spirit, claimed redemption as their lives continued. This is NOT a prescription for every pilot, merely the story of these four. They started without prior knowledge of one another, but it would take them working together to persevere through the process of having the same tragedy impact all of them. Ironically, the impact happened at the same time while they were all located in different places.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=0eVYAAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"My Lord John","description":"If you love Bridgerton, you'll love Georgette Heyer!

A hunt for the American buffalo an adventurous, fascinating examination of an animal that has haunted the American imagination. In 2005, Steven Rinella won a lottery permit to hunt for a wild buffalo, or American bison, in the Alaskan wilderness. Despite the odds there s only a 2 percent chance of drawing the permit, and fewer than 20 percent of those hunters are successful Rinella managed to kill a buffalo on a snow-covered mountainside and then raft the meat back to civilization while being trailed by grizzly bears and suffering from hypothermia. Throughout these adventures, Rinella found himself contemplating his own place among the 14,000 years  worth of buffalo hunters in North America, as well as the buffalo s place in the American experience. At the time of the Revolutionary War, North America was home to approximately 40 million buffalo, the largest herd of big mammals on the planet, but by the mid-1890s only a few hundred remained. Now that the buffalo is on the verge of a dramatic ecological recovery across the West, Americans are faced with the challenge of how, and if, we can dare to share our land with a beast that is the embodiment of the American wilderness. American Buffalo is a narrative tale of Rinella s hunt. But beyond that, it is the story of the many ways in which the buffalo has shaped our national identity. Rinella takes us across the continent in search of the buffalo s past, present, and future: to the Bering Land Bridge, where scientists search for buffalo bones amid artifacts of the New World s earliest human inhabitants; to buffalo jumps where Native Americans once ran buffalo over cliffs by the thousands; to the Detroit Carbon works, a  bone charcoal  plant that made fortunes in the late 1800s by turning millions of tons of buffalo bones into bone meal, black dye, and fine china; and even to an abattoir turned fashion mecca in Manhattan s Meatpacking District, where a depressed buffalo named Black Diamond met his fate after serving as the model for the American nickel. Rinella s erudition and exuberance, combined with his gift for storytelling, make him the perfect guide for a book that combines outdoor adventure with a quirky blend of facts and observations about history, biology, and the natural world. Both a captivating narrative and a book of environmental and historical significance, American Buffalo tells us as much about ourselves as Americans as it does about the creature who perhaps best of all embodies the American ethos.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Ys1msOAETFEC&dq=The+Bison+:+The+Great+American+Buffalo&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Kripalu Cookbook - Gourmet Vegetarian Recipes","description":"Drawing from the philosophies of the famous yoga and health center, a collection of more than three hundred healthy vegetarian recipes provides an introduction to Indian cooking, provides recommendations for preparing meals for children, and includes tips for party planning and entertaining.

One morning, a man wakes up to find himself transformed. Overnight, Anders s skin has turned dark, and the reflection in the mirror seems a stranger to him. At first he shares his secret only with Oona, an old friend turned new lover. Soon, reports of similar events begin to surface. Across the land, people are awakening in new incarnations, uncertain how their neighbors, friends, and family will greet them.Some see the transformations as the long-dreaded overturning of the established order that must be resisted to a bitter end. In many, like Anders s father and Oona s mother, a sense of profound loss and unease wars with profound love.

Recent world events had cast doubt on the relevance of religious belief, and modernizing trends made religious rituals look out of place. It was in this atmosphere that the careers of Scholem, Eliade, and Corbin--the twentieth century's legendary scholars in the respective fields of Judaism, History of Religions, and Islam--converged and ultimately revolutionized how people thought about religion. Between 1949 and 1978, all three lectured to Carl Jung's famous Eranos circle in Ascona, Switzerland, where each in his own way came to identify the symbolism of mystical experience as a central element of his monotheistic tradition. In this, the first book ever to compare the paths taken by these thinkers, Steven Wasserstrom explores how they overturned traditional approaches to studying religion by de-emphasizing law, ritual, and social history and by extolling the role of myth and mysticism. The most controversial aspect of their theory of religion, Wasserstrom argues, is that it minimized the binding character of moral law associated with monotheism. The author focuses on the lectures delivered by Scholem, Eliade, and Corbin to the Eranos participants, but also shows how these scholars generated broader interest in their ideas through radio talks, poetry, novels, short stories, autobiographies, and interviews. He analyzes their conception of religion from a broadly integrated, comparative perspective, sets their distinctive thinking into historical and intellectual context, and interprets the striking success of their approaches.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=C4x-hzHVVNoC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Five Years A Cavalryman Or, Sketches Of Regular Army Life On The Texas Frontier, 1866-1871 (Western Frontier Library)","description":"First published in 1889, H. H. McConnell's Five Years a Cavalryman remains one of the best accounts of what it was like to be an ordinary cavalryman on the post-Civil War frontier. Posted for five years (1866-1871) with the Sixth U.S. Cavalry at Fort Belknap and Fort Richardson, in West Texas, McConnell gives the unglorified inside story on his fellow enlisted men and the officers, reporting candidly on their heavy drinking, their general disorganization, their boredom, and their thievery. Regarding the Texas Rangers, he admits that they might be tolerable Indian fighters, but in frontier towns, where they would engage in \\"shooting scrapes and rows\\" with its citizens and soldiers, they were more a threat to peace than keepers of the same. His tolerant attitude toward Native Americans is evident in his coverage of the arrest and trial of Satanta, Big Tree, and other Kiowas at Fort Sill, in which he grants that General William Sherman's concurrent visit to the post negatively affected their trial. In the foreword to this edition, William H. Leckie summarizes McConnell's frontier career and discusses his attitude toward the Tenth Calvary \\"buffalo soldiers,\\" the Texas Rangers, and officers such as Colonel Ranald MacKenzie. H. H. McConnell settled in Jacksboro, Texas (where Fort Richardson is located), and became a prominent citizen after his service in the U.S. cavalry. William H.

It is argued that such words are and always have been used by educated people to encompass all humanity men and women. Psychological and historical research in the past few years has produced evidence to the contrary: for most people  false generics  seldom if ever convey a female image, nor are they ancient unchangeable rules of the English grammar that have always been used by the educated. Using hundreds of examples, mostly from published sources, the authors illustrate what certain words are saying to us on a subliminal level. Solutions are supplied that range from word substitutions to suggestions for rewriting. Without a trace of self-conscious righteousness, and with refreshing humor, Miller and Swift provide surprising insights into the English language and the ways in which people use it and are used by it. They demonstrate that to be in command of the language, we must find clear, convincing, and graceful ways to convey our ideas accurately. We must recognize and replace exclusive, distorting, ambiguous, and injurious words.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=KY_XiQa5PhMC&dq=THE+HANDBOOK+OF+NONSEXIST+WRITING+FOR+WRITERS,+EDITORS+AND+SPEAKERS&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Campfire Collection: Spine-tingling Tales to Tell in the Dark","description":"A collection of tales designed to be told around a campfire.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=TJbdB_pPYK0C&dq=The+Campfire+Collection:+Spine-tingling+Tales+to+Tell+in+the+Dark&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Islam and the West, the Moriscos: A Cultural and Social History","description":"Shortly after the conquest of Granada in 1492 by the Catholic kings, Muslim subjects in Spain became known derogatorily as Moriscos, Moros, Muhammadans, Hagarans, and Saracens, despite the fact that they were forced to accept the sacrament of baptism. They were relegated to the margin of Christian society, considered aliens in their own land, and subjected to strictures and persecution. In turn, the Moriscos developed their own attitude, which they expressed in an extensive literature in Alijamiado, their Spanish dialect written in Arabic script. This literature was for the most part inspired by Arabic models reiterating Islamic values through the vehicles of history, legends, epic tales, stories, wisdom sayings, and sorcery. Written mostly during the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, Aljamiado literature is significant for the study of cultural change. Islam and the West: The Moriscos is the first comprehensive study of this long-neglected subject. Chejne surveys and analyzes the self-expression of the Moriscos and assesses their status as a minority struggling for survival, placing them in the social context of ideological conflict, the clash of religions and cultures, and differing perceptions. This book provides a more complete picture of the literatures and cultures of medieval Spain.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ypL60E0ZVN8C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"How Do Airplanes Fly?: A Book about Airplanes (Discovery Readers)","description":"Covers the history of flight, from Leonardo da Vinci to modern jumbo jets.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ObiyQlMkCqQC&dq=How+Do+Airplanes+Fly%3F:+A+Book+about+Airplanes+(Discovery+Readers)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Job (Daily Study Bible (Westminster Hardcover))","description":"For decades, millions of Christians have discovered William Barclay's Daily Study Bible to be the ideal New Testament commentary series for both devotional reading and serious Bible study.

But that performance concealed the complexities of the man, baffling most who came in contact with him. Who was the man behind the makeup? Only Lou Cannon, who covered Reagan through his political career, can tell us. The keenest Reagan-watcher of them all, he has been the only author to reveal the nature of a man both shrewd and oblivious. Based on hundreds of interviews with the president, the First Lady, and hundreds of the administration's major figures, President Reagan takes us behind the scenes of the Oval Office. Cannon leads us through all of Reagan's roles, from the affable cowboy to the self-styled family man; from the politician who denounced big government to the president who created the largest peace-time deficit; from the statesman who reviled the Soviet government to the Great Communicator who helped end the cold war.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=7rBLCZuEOswC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Black Heart a Voyage Into Central Africa","description":"Containing more than 600 entries, this valuable resource presents all aspects of travel writing.

But, what if you could just be you in business? Taking a positive approach, this brief distills years of research, teaching, and coaching into an integrated framework for negotiating genuinely. One of the most fundamental and challenging battlegrounds in our work lives, negotiation calls on us to compete and cooperate to do our jobs well and achieve extraordinary results. But, the biggest challenge in a negotiation is to be strategic while also being real. Author Shirli Kopelman argues that this duality is both possible and powerful. In Negotiating Genuinely, she teaches readers how to reconcile the disparate hats that they wear in everyday life with families, friends, and colleagues bringing one \\"integral hat\\" to the negotiation table. Kopelman develops and shares techniques that illuminate this approach; exercises along the way help readers to negotiate more naturally, positively, and successfully.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=a5QaAwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Dark Opals of Harrow Island (Zebra books)","description":"No sooner does Megan Cooper accept a position as secretary at a remote Harrow Island estate than she receives messages warning her to leave.

But the evil influence of the former High Prince Roelstra had not ended with his death at Rohan s hands. And even as Pol grew to manhood, other young men were being trained in the ways of war, youths descended from Roelstra and claimed by Rohan s enemies as willing pawns in what could become a bloody battle for succession. Yet not all players in these games of power fought merely with words or swords.

Nagel is a complete outsider, a sort of modern Christ treated in a spirit of near parody. He condemns the politics and thought of the age, brings comfort to the  insulted and injured,  and gains the love of two women suggestive of the biblical Mary and Martha. But there is a sinister side of him: in his vest he carries a vial of prussic acid... The novel creates a powerful sense of Nagel's stream of thought, as he increasingly withdraws into the torture chamber of his own subconscious psyche.

Notwithstanding the early internationalization successes of Japanese and Korean conglomerates and the more recent international forays by Chinese companies, one must recognize that much of the promise of Asian multinationals leading a  Pacific century  has yet to be realized. Global Future: The Next Challenge of Asian Business is a direct response to growing ambitions of Asian companies to go global and the rising pressures on them to internationalize. Advancements in technology, industry changes, and political shifts have fundamentally reshaped the structure of competition, thus challenging the traditional strengths of Asian companies. For corporations that have grown large on the back of national protection and information asymmetries, the environment has become tougher than ever. By profiling early pioneers and leading contemporary globalizers, the authors show how Asian companies can best  climb the globalization staircase  and develop the strategies and capabilities needed to succeed in a global future.

Horton, a constant threat to Bobby Hull and other offensive powerhouses of his day, led the Maple Leafs to four Stanley Cups in the 1960s, including the franchise's last Cup win in 1967. The powerful defenceman shared All-Star honours with Bobby Orr and Pierre Pilote, establishing him as one of the best defencemen ever. But Tim Horton was more than just a rock-steady rearguard. He dominated on defence. He could step into battle and stop a fight by wrapping his arms around an opposing fighter in the famed \\"Horton Bear Hug.\\" And he was a devoted husband and father, a charitable man lost to the world far too soon. Craig MacInnis has drawn on an all-star roster of talented writers for this remarkable book, including Hockey Hall of Fame columnist Frank Orr, award-winning popculture essayist Mitch Potter, and Buffalo Sabres fan and perennial Leaf hater Doug Herod. From musings on the Leafs' great Cup runs of the '60s to an offbeat piece on Horton's vintage brush cut, Remembering Tim Horton is a quirky, and at times poignant, look back at one of the greatest rearguards ever to lace up skates.

Typically, such a case is based on logical and flawless reasoning, on a sequence of steps that follow inevitably from the hypotheses used to deduce each. In other words, a proof is given establishing that the assertion under consideration indeed holds. Such proofs are clearly crucial to logic and to mathematics. Not so obvious, but true, proofs are crucial to circuit design, program writing, and, more generally, to various activities in which reasoning plays a vital role. Indeed, most desirable is the case in which no doubt exists regarding the absence of flaws in the design of a chip, in the structure of a computer program, in the argument on which an important decision is based. Such careful reasoning is even the key factor in games that include chess and poker. This book features one example after another of flawless logical reasoning the context is that of finding proofs absent from the literature. The means for finding the missing proofs is reliance on a single computer program, William McCune's automated reasoning program OTTER. One motivating force for writing this book is to interest others in automated reasoning, logic and mathematics. As the text strongly indicates, we delight in using OTTER equally in two quite distinct activities: finding a proof where none is offered by the literature, and finding a proof far more appealing than any the literature provides. We believe that the challenge offered by the type of problem featured in this book can be as engrossing as solving puzzles and playing various games that appeal to the mind. Indeed,sometimes, inexpressible is the excitement engendered when seeking a proof with fewer steps than was found by one of the great minds of the twentieth century. A second motivating force resets with our obvious enjoyment of the type of research featured in this book. Like the fancier of fine wines, we continually seek new open questions to attack, whether (at one end of the spectrum) they concern the settling of a conjecture or (at the other end) the focus is on proof betterment. We encourage readers to send us additional open questions and challenging problems. Another factor that motivated us was our wish to collect in a single volume a surprisingly large number of proofs, most of which were previously absent from the literature. In some cases, no proof was offered of any type; in some cases, the proof that was offered was far from axiomatic. None of the proofs rely on induction, or on metal argument, or on higher-order logic. In one sense, the book can serve as an encyclopedia of proofs -- many new and many improved - a work that sometimes extends, sometimes replaces, and sometimes supplements the research of more than a century. These proofs offer the implicit challenge of finding others that are further improvements. In a rather different sense, the book may serve as the key to eventually answering one open question after another, whether the context is logic, mathematics, design, synthesis, or some other area relying on sound reasoning. In that regards, we include in details numerous diverse methodologies are themselves intriguing. For an example, one methodology asks for two independent paths that lead to success and, rather than emphasizing what is common to both (theirintersection), instead heavily focuses on what is not shared (their symmetric difference). Although the emphasis here is on their use in the context of logic and mathematics, we conjecture that the methodologies we offer will prove most useful in a far wider context. We also suspect that, especially for those who enjoy solving puzzles and unraveling the mysteries of sciences, the nature of the methodologies will provide substantial stimulation. This volume introduce some readers to the excitement of discovering new results, increase the intrigue of those already familiar with such excitement, and (for the expert) add to the arsenal of weapons for attacking deep questions and hard problems.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=jTl2AAAACAAJ&dq=Automated+Reasoning+and+the+Discovery+of+Missing+and+Elegant+Proofs&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Restless Evil: A Mitchell and Markby Mystery","description":"It sends a shiver down Detective Superintendent Alan Markby's spine when he hears that a rambler has stumbled on human bones in Stovey Woods in the heart of the Cotswolds.

Trying to separate myth from reality, biographer Elijah Wald studies the blues from the inside -- not only examining recordings but also the recollections of the musicians themselves, the African-American press, as well as examining original research. What emerges is a new appreciation for the blues and the movement of its artists from the shadows of the 1930s Mississippi Delta to the mainstream venues frequented by today's loyal blues fans.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=1eafDAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mining The Middle Ground: Developing Mid-level Managers for Strategic Change","description":"Throughout the late 80s and 90s many companies fell victim to the downsizing trend.

The figures of speech should not be learned the same way as the periodic table of elements. This is because figures of speech are not about hypothetical structures in things, but about real potentialities within language and within ourselves. The \\"figurings\\" of speech reveal the apparently limitless plasticity of language itself. We are inescapably confronted with the intoxicating possibility that we can make language do for us almost anything we want. Or at least a Shakespeare can. The figures of speech help to see how he does it, and how we might. Therefore, in the chapters presented in this volume, the quotations from Shakespeare, the Bible, and other sources are not presented to exemplify the definitions. Rather, the definitions are presented to lead to the quotations. And the quotations are there to show us how to do with language what we have not done before. They are there for imitation.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=XFLFiE2kn1QC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Tree of Knowledge,","description":"A Booklife Editor's Pick \\"Filled with fascinating characters, breathtaking action... this novel grabs one's interest from page one.\\"-Kat Kennedy, The US Review of Books Knowledge is power. It is said that the greatest chess masters can envision a match's outcome ten moves before it occurs. Imagine a person who can visualize ten steps ahead, not simply in the game of chess, but in every human interaction. Imagine a person who can see a punch before it is thrown; who knows what you are going to say before you say it; who can see every political and economic move long before it happens. Imagine a secret that can make this all possible. Mathematics professor Albert Puddles exposes this secret for himself as he is thrust into a murder investigation on the Princeton campus. The discovery leads Albert to delve into ancient religious interpretation and unmask new analytical abilities, all while teaming up with an aging mentor, a curious teaching assistant, and an elite Book Club on a frantic chase across America to recover this world-changing knowledge before it falls into dangerous hands. Albert-now embedded in a national cat-and-mouse political power play-rediscovers a woman from his past and is forced to confront his own understanding of love, rationality, power, and the true limits of the human mind.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=WUo7zgEACAAJ&dq=The+Tree+of+Knowledge,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"James Bond: The Man With the Golden Gun","description":"After being brainwashed to assassinate M, James Bond must win back his boss's trust by taking out \\"Pistols\\" Scaramanga, the world's most deadly assassin.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=O_95MQEACAAJ&dq=James+Bond:+The+Man+With+the+Golden+Gun&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Berlin and Sans-Souci or, Frederick The Great and His Friends","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=NIpUAAAAYAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Chihuly Seaforms","description":"Dale Chihuly is arguably the best known glass artist in the world.

Zog I was a crucial figure in modern Albanian history, creating - or attempting to create - national and cultural identity for a country that had known little stability or sense of identity since the middle ages. He was also the most unusual monarch of the 20th century, described by contemporaries as: \\"a despotic brigand\\"; \\"the modern Naploeon\\"; \\"Mussolini's lackey\\"; \\"the finest patriot\\"; \\"frankly a cad\\". This biography shows Zog as the product of a unique time and place. People who live in secure, stable countries are invited to set aside their assumptions about European monarchy and meet a king who fired back at assassins and paid his bills with gold bars.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=f6cTDQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Sigma Project","description":"A global satellite, neither Soviet nor American, holds the superpowers at bay, ready to unleash its awesome power on the world","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=kTrQzhfoITUC&dq=The+Sigma+Project&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Rival Hypotheses: Alternative Interpretations of Data Based Conclusions","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=RNNMPQAACAAJ&dq=Rival+Hypotheses:+Alternative+Interpretations+of+Data+Based+Conclusions&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"They Died in Vain: Overlooked, Underappreciated and Forgotten Mystery Novels","description":"Mystery experts introduce you to personal favorites: obscure classics, up-and-coming new writers, great books that unaccountably disappeared and lesser-known titles by bestselling authors. ...This book takes you beyond the bestsellers, beyond the familiar, with essays recommending over 100 mystery novels.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=k-0EAAAACAAJ&dq=They+Died+in+Vain:+Overlooked,+Underappreciated+and+Forgotten+Mystery+Novels&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Recreational Nitrox Diving","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=PV8QAQAAIAAJ&dq=Recreational+Nitrox+Diving&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cowboy Bits & Spurs","description":"This book combines \\"Working Cowboy\\" knowledge with \\"Cowboy Collectibles,\\" describing the actual usage, background, and value of cowboy bits and spurs.

Drawing on the popular science writing and science fiction of an eclectic group of scientists, engineers, and popular writers, De Witt Douglas Kilgore investigates how the American tradition of technological utopianism responded to the political upheavals of the twentieth century. Founded in the imperial politics and utopian schemes of the nineteenth century, astrofuturism envisions outer space as an endless frontier that offers solutions to the economic and political problems that dominate the modern world. Its advocates use the conventions of technological and scientific conquest to consolidate or challenge the racial and gender hierarchies codified in narratives of exploration. Because the icon of space carries both the imperatives of an imperial past and the democratic hopes of its erstwhile subjects, its study exposes the ideals and contradictions endemic to American culture. Kilgore argues that in the decades following the Second World War the subject of race became the most potent signifier of political crisis for the predominantly white and male ranks of astrofuturism. In response to criticism inspired by the civil rights movement and the new left, astrofuturists imagined space frontiers that could extend the reach of the human species and heal its historical wounds. Their work both replicated dominant social presuppositions and supplied the resources necessary for the critical utopian projects that emerged from the antiracist, socialist, and feminist movements of the twentieth century. This survey of diverse bodies of literature conveys the dramatic and creative syntheses that astrofuturism envisions between people and machines, social imperatives and political hope, physical knowledge and technological power. Bringing American studies, utopian literature, popular conceptions of race and gender, and the cultural study of science and technology into dialogue, Astrofuturism will provide scholars of American culture, fans of science fiction, and readers of science writing with fresh perspectives on both canonical and cutting-edge astrofuturist visions.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=0pBYuiiTccYC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Martin Yan's Feast: The Best of Yan Can Cook","description":"The author presents 350 recipes from his popular TV program, complemented by clear instructions and his trademark wit.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=GhkCAAAACAAJ&dq=Martin+Yan%27s+Feast:+The+Best+of+Yan+Can+Cook&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Economic Aspects of Argentine Federalism, 1820-1852.","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=xqZDAAAAYAAJ&dq=The+Economic+Aspects+of+Argentine+Federalism,+1820-1852.&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Portable Chaucer: 2","description":"In the fourteenth century Geoffrey Chaucer, who served three kings as a customs official and special envoy, virtually invented English poetry. He did so by wedding the language of common speech to metrical verse, creating a medium that could accommodate tales of courtly romance, bawdy fabliaux, astute psychological portraiture, dramatic monologues, moral allegories, and its author s astonishing learning in fields from philosophy to medicine and astrology. Chaucer s accomplishment is unequalled by any poet before Shakespeare and in The Canterbury Tales and Troilus and Cressida ranks with that of the great English novelists. Both The Canterbury Tales and Troilus and Cressida are presented complete in this anthology, in fresh modern translations by Theodore Morrison that convey both the gravity and gaiety of the Middle English originals. The Portable Chaucer also contains selections from The Book of Duchess, The House of Fame, The Bird's Parliament, and The Legend of Good Women, together with short poems. Morrison's introduction is vital for its insights into Chaucer as man and artist, and as a product of the Middle Ages whose shrewdness, humor, and compassion have a wonderfully contemporary ring.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=0hy3q85lptAC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The history of England","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=1m4KAQAAMAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"You're Going to Love This Kid!: Teaching Children with Autism in the Inclusive Classroom","description":"A practical guide to understanding students with autism and including them fully in the classroom.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=6clKAAAAYAAJ&dq=You%27re+Going+to+Love+This+Kid!:+Teaching+Children+with+Autism+in+the+Inclusive+Classroom&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"An Insider Secrets to Moving","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Sxw-AAAACAAJ&dq=An+Insider+Secrets+to+Moving&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Enchanted Candle: Crafting and Casting Magickal Light","description":"For centuries, Pagan seekers of love, fortune, health, healing, and protection have used candles as a vital part of their rituals.

In the course of his medical practice he reflected deeply on human nature and human problems, and his prolific writings bear witness to his great wisdom and insight. For this completely revised edition, selections from publications of the years 1945-1961, the last fruitful years of Jung's life, have been added, and the book has been reset in a new compact format. The selections are arranged thematically under four main headings: The Nature and Activity of the Psyche, Man in His Relation to Others, The World of Values, and On Ultimate Things. Jung's reflections frequently have a penetrating relevance to today's (and tomorrow's) problems. On prejudice: \\"Our unwillingness to see our own faults and the projection of them is the beginning of most quarrels, and is the strongest guarantee that injustice, animosity, and persecution are not ready to die out.\\" On sex: \\"We are not yet far enough advanced to distinguish between moral and immoral behavior in the realm of free sexual activity.\\" On religion: \\"No one can know what the ultimate things are. We must therefore take them as we experience them. And if such experience helps to make life healthier, more beautiful, more complete, and more satisfactory to yourself and to those you love, you may safely say: 'This was the grace of God.'\\"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=WeE9DwAAQBAJ&dq=C+G+Jung:+Psychological+Reflections:+A+New+Anthology+of+his+Writings,+1905-1961+(Bollingen+series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Tailgating Cookbook: Recipes for the Big Game","description":"The only thing that compares with America's obsession with sports is our passion for eating.

The study of thinking and reasoning goes back to Aristotle, and was one of the first topics to be studied when psychology separated from philosophy. In this Very Short Introduction Jonathan Evans explores cognitive psychological approaches to understanding the nature of thinking and reasoning, problem solving, and decision making. He shows how our problem solving capabilities are hugely dependent on also having the imagination to ask the right questions, and the ability to see things from a completely new perspective. Beginning by considering the approaches of the behaviourists and the Gestalt psychologists, he moves on to modern explorations of thinking, including hypothetical thinking, conditionals, deduction, rationality, and intuition. Covering the role of past learning, IQ, and cognitive biases, Evans also discusses the idea that there may be two different ways of thinking, arising from our evolutionary history.

From a leading cartographer with the British Antarctic Survey, this new collection of maps and data reveals Antarctica as we have never seen it before. This is not just a book of traditional maps. It measures everything from the thickness of ice beneath our feet to the direction of ice flows. It maps volcanic lakes, mountain ranges the size of the Alps and gorges longer than the Grand Canyon, all hidden beneath the ice. It shows us how air bubbles trapped in ice tell us what the earth's atmosphere was like 750,000 years ago, proving the effects of greenhouse gases. Colonies of emperor penguins abound around the coastline, and the journeys of individual seals around the continent and down to the sea bed in search of food have been intricately tracked and mapped. Twenty-nine nations have research stations in Antarctica and their unique architecture is laid out here, along with the challenges of surviving in Antarctica'sunforgiving environment. Antarctica is also the frontier of our fight against climate change. If its ice melts, it will swamp almost every coastal city in the world. Antarctic Atlas illustrates the harsh beauty and magic of this mysterious continent, and shows how, far from being abstract, it has direct relevance to us all.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ANHlDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Water Between Us (Pitt Poetry Series)","description":"1998 Agnes Lynch Starrett Prize winner. The Water Between Us is a poetic examination of cultural fragmentation, and the exile's struggle to reconcile the disparate and often conflicting influences of the homeland and the adopted country. The book also centers on other kinds of physical and emotional distances: those between mothers and daughters, those created by being of mixed racial descent, and those between colonizers and the colonized. Despite these distances, or perhaps because of them, the poems affirm the need for a multilayered and cohesive sense of self. McCallum's language is precise and graceful. Drawing from Anancy tales, Greek myth, and biblical stories, the poems deftly alternate between American English and Jamaican patois, and between images both familiar and surreal.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=BSN-BAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"For His Honor","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=KrKalqBSzXYC&dq=For+His+Honor&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Dance of the Shulamite","description":"A call to a deeper love relationship with the Lord.

ACUPRESSURE FOR EMOTIONAL HEALING offers relief at your fingertips, quickly and safely, for a wide range of emotional problems. It explains how emotional distress becomes lodged in the body as muscular tension and blocked energy, and shows how acupressure can relieve not just the resulting physical symptoms, but also their emotional source--often without the need for extensive talk therapy or medication. Acupressure stimulates the same points used in acupuncture, but instead of needles, firm finger pressure is used on the surface of the skin. The pressure releases neurochemicals called endorphins that relieve pain. As in acupuncture, specific pressure points are connected with internal organs and energy pathways in the body (called meridians) that regulate the flow of electrical energy to all systems. Unlike acupuncture, acupressure can be used safely by anyone, with only the hands as equipment. ACUPRESSURE FOR EMOTIONAL HEALING offers a comprehensive A-Z guide to emotional ailments (from abandonment to worry and obsessive thinking), with fully-illustrated instruction on dozens of precise acupressure point locations and how to activate them, combined with yogic breathing, stretching, and movement routines. Case histories from the authors' practice further illuminate each condition and the path to emotional balance and healing. Most routines can be used independently for self-care and on-the-spot relief. There are also sections on how to use the techniques to help others, with appropriate safeguards.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=SJ1uXUwcTyoC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cooking from the Caucasus (A Harvest/HBJ book)","description":"Collects two hundred and fifty recipes for all manner of exotic, succulent, and healthful dishes from the Caucasian republics of Armenia, Azerbaidzhan, and Georgia","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=SICuAAAACAAJ&dq=Cooking+from+the+Caucasus+(A+Harvest/HBJ+book)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Pastel Step by Step","description":"Introduces the materials, principles, techniques, and methods of painting with pastels and includes step-by-step demonstrations.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=EB6BRAAACAAJ&dq=Pastel+Step+by+Step&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Politics, Leadership, and Justice (Great Books Foundation 50th Anniversary Series)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=tpMMAgAACAAJ&dq=Politics,+Leadership,+and+Justice+(Great+Books+Foundation+50th+Anniversary+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Countries and Tribes of the Persian Gulf (Folios Archive Library)","description":"\\"European pirates at this time in the Indian Seas were very numerous, and were robbing all nations indiscriminately...Having set aside the officers they ran up the black flag and sailed to the Red Sea, where they took and plundered many vessels.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=_eJtAAAAMAAJ&dq=Countries+and+Tribes+of+the+Persian+Gulf+(Folios+Archive+Library)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Freehold","description":"NEW STORIES IN THE BEST-SELLING FREEHOLD SERIES, CREATED BY MICHAEL Z.

Sadness is your superpower. In her new masterpiece, the author of the bestselling phenomenon Quiet explores the power of the bittersweet personality, revealing a misunderstood side of mental health and creativity while offering a roadmap to facing grief in order to live life to the fullest.  Bittersweet grabs you by the heart and doesn t let go.  BREN  BROWN, author of Atlas of the Heart  Susan Cain has described and validated my existence once again!  GLENNON DOYLE, author of Untamed  The perfect cure for toxic positivity.  ADAM GRANT, author of Think Again ONE OF THE MOST ANTICIPATED BOOKS OF 2022 Oprah Daily, BookPage Bittersweetness is a tendency to states of long-ing, poignancy, and sorrow; an acute aware-ness of passing time; and a curiously piercing joy at the beauty of the world. It recognizes that light and dark, birth and death bitter and sweet are forever paired. If you ve ever wondered why you like sad music . . . If you find comfort or inspiration in a rainy day . . . If you react intensely to music, art, nature, and beauty . . . Then you probably identify with the bitter-sweet state of mind. With Quiet, Susan Cain urged our society to cultivate space for the undervalued, indispensable introverts among us, thereby revealing an un-tapped power hidden in plain sight. Now she em-ploys the same mix of research, storytelling, and memoir to explore why we experience sorrow and longing, and how embracing the bittersweetness at the heart of life is the true path to creativity, con-nection, and transcendence. Cain shows how a bittersweet state of mind is the quiet force that helps us transcend our personal and collective pain, whether from a death or breakup, addiction or illness. If we don t acknowledge our own heartache, she says, we can end up inflicting it on others via abuse, domination, or neglect. But if we realize that all humans know or will know loss and suffering, we can turn toward one another. At a time of profound discord and personal anxiety, Bittersweet brings us together in deep and unexpected ways.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=k5k7EAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The God Who Comes","description":"The mystical, ecstatic religions of the Greco-Roman culture, direct threats to the newer Judeo-Christian movements, were obliterated.

In addition to fueling our SUVs and illuminating our cities, crude oil and its byproducts fertilize our produce, pave our roads, and make plastic possible. \\"Newborn babies,\\" observes author Sonia Shah, \\"slide from their mothers into petro-plastic-gloved hands, are swaddled in petro-polyester blankets, and are hurried off to be warmed by oil-burning heaters.\\" The modern world is drenched in oil; Crude tells how it came to be. A great human drama emerges, of discovery and innovation, risk, the promise of riches, and the power of greed. Shah infuses recent twists in the story with equal drama, through chronicles of colorful modern-day characters   from the hundreds of Nigerian women who stormed a Chevron plant to a monomaniacal scientist for whom life is the pursuit of this earthblood and its elusive secret. Shah moves masterfully between scientific, economic, political, and social analysis, capturing the many sides of the indispensable mineral that we someday may have to find a way to live without.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=CT6g7xVTlrsC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Back to Eden: A book on herbal remedies for disease, and other natural methods of healing","description":"\\"...set[s] forth his method of natural self healing based on herbs, a diet that used no meat, dairy products, or eggs, and a life in harmony with the laws of health and nature.

His lyric, deceptively simple prose conjures a world where the default setting is violence, a world of hunting and fishing, gambling and losing, drinking and poaching-a world most of us have never seen. In the chilling title novella (selected for the anthologies New Stories from the South: The Year's Best, 1999 and Best Mystery Stories of the Century), three wild boys confront a mythic game warden as mysterious and deadly as the river they haunt. And, as a weathered, hand-painted sign reads: \\"Jesus is not coming.\\" This terrain isn't pretty, isn't for the weak of heart, but in these deperate, lost people, Franklin somehow finds the moments of grace that make them what they so abundantly are: human.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=xep2gkbdBBkC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Word Pictures in the New Testament","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=f3e2FLCRrEAC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Shadow in the Wild","description":"From A to Z, the Penguin Drop Caps series collects 26 unique hardcovers featuring cover art by Jessica Hische It all begins with a letter.

This strangeness fascinated audiences in nineteenth-century Britain when the idea of the heroic explorer voyaging through unmapped zones reached its zenith. The Spectral Arctic re-thinks our understanding of Arctic exploration by paying attention to the importance of dreams and ghosts in the quest for the Northwest Passage. The narratives of Arctic exploration that we are all familiar with today are just the tip of the iceberg: they disguise a great mass of mysterious and dimly lit stories beneath the surface. In contrast to oft-told tales of heroism and disaster, this book reveals the hidden stories of dreaming and haunted explorers, of frozen mummies, of rescue balloons, visits to Inuit shamans, and of the entranced female clairvoyants who travelled to the Arctic in search of John Franklin s lost expedition. Through new readings of archival documents, exploration narratives, and fictional texts, these spectral stories reflect the complex ways that men and women actually thought about the far North in the past. This revisionist historical account allows us to make sense of current cultural and political concerns in the Canadian Arctic about the location of Franklin s ships.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=u5VaDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Don't make A&P; mad","description":"Five years and more than 100,000 copies after it was first published, it's hard to imagine anyone working in Web design who hasn't read Steve Krug's \\"instant classic\\" on Web usability, but people are still discovering it every day.

These local movements had varying agendas and organizational development, geared to the particular circumstances, resources, and regions in which they operated. Local civil rights activists frequently worked in tandem with the national civil rights movement but often functioned autonomously from and sometimes even at odds with the national movement. Together, the pathbreaking essays in Groundwork teach us that local civil rights activity was a vibrant component of the larger civil rights movement, and contributed greatly to its national successes. Individually, the pieces offer dramatic new insights about the civil rights movement, such as the fact that a militant black youth organization in Milwaukee was led by a white Catholic priest and in Cambridge, Maryland, by a middle-aged black woman; that a group of middle-class, professional black women spearheaded Jackson, Mississippi's movement for racial justice and made possible the continuation of the Freedom Rides, and that, despite protests from national headquarters, the Brooklyn chapter of the Congress of Racial Equality staged a dramatic act of civil disobedience at the 1964 World s Fair in New York. No previous volume has enabled readers to examine several different local movements together, and in so doing, Groundwork forges a far more comprehensive vision of the black freedom movement.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=3Czw8VQnuGwC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Under the Healing Sign","description":"In the sequel to The Magic and the Healing, veterinarian BJ Vaughan once again brings the benefits of modern medicine to the fantasy creatures and copes with the destructive forces that have entered Crossroads.

They must develop a culture capital within their congregations, meaning that they invest themselves deeply in how their church does its work and goes about its ministries.

Cal Garrison is that woman, a professional witch and astrologer, who in her first book, The Old Girls' Book of Spells, invited women of a certain age to use her spells to enliven their love lives, find their car keys, and prevail at work and at home. In this sequel, Garrison invites these same women to take a few minutes a day throughout the year to conjure their own dreams and magic. In the Introduction she teaches women to put their minds on the shelf and get into their hearts, to discover their true desire and write it down. Organized by the signs of the zodiac, beginning with Capricorn and ending with Sagittarius, The Old Girls' Book of Dreams offers tidbits of wisdom, relevant stories from the author's life, and ideas about what kind of magic and energy to look for in each month.

In this intriguing book, Tyler Cowen explores and elucidates the economics of fame. Fame motivates the talented and draws like-minded fans together. But it also may put profitability ahead of quality, visibility above subtlety, and privacy out of reach. The separation of fame and merit is one of the central dilemmas Cowen considers in his account of the modern market economy. He shows how fame is produced, outlines the principles that govern who becomes famous and why, and discusses whether fame-seeking behavior harmonizes individual and social interests or corrupts social discourse and degrades culture. Most pertinently, Cowen considers the implications of modern fame for creativity, privacy, and morality. Where critics from Plato to Allan Bloom have decried the quest for fame, Cowen takes a more pragmatic, optimistic view. He identifies the benefits of a fame-intensive society and makes a persuasive case that however bad fame may turn out to be for the famous, it is generally good for society and culture.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=8-yXfKdMpxgC&dq=What+Price+Fame%3F&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Spoon in the Bathroom Wall","description":"Living in the Bloggins School boiler room isn't glamorous, but that's life for Martha Snapdragon, daughter of the beleaguered janitor.

The Quest for Community. In fact, Conservatism unites virtually all of Nisbet's work. In it, Nisbet deals with the political causes of the manifold forms of alienation that underwrite the human quest for community. The sovereign political state is more than a legal relationship of a superstructure of power, it is inseparable from its successive penetrations of man's economic, religious, kinship and local allegiances, and its revolutionary dislocations of established centers of power. Nisbet holds that although political philosophers are often conceived in terms of their views of the individual and the state, a more useful approach adds the factor of social groups or communities mediating between the individual and the state. Such groups comprise \\"society\\" the protection of which is the \\"sole object\\" of the conservative tradition, according to Nisbet. This conservative ideology arose in the West as a reaction to the French Revolution and its perceived impact upon traditional society. Edmund Burke was the first spokesman of the new ideology. In this book, Nisbet argues that modern conservatism throughout the West can be seen as a widening of Burke's indictment not only of the French Revolution, but of the larger revolution we have come to call modernity. From Edmund Burke and his contemporaries such as Bonald, de Maistre, Haller, and Savigny, down to T.S. Eliot, Christopher Dawson, Michael Oakeshott, Irving Babbit, Paul Elmer More, and Russell Kirk, the essential themes of political conservatism remained the same. They are centered upon history, tradition, property, authority, liberty and religion, and attack equally the political collectivism and radical individualism that have the same irrational outcomes. Nisbet makes the point that, at present, conservatism is also in a crisis, one created in large measure by mixing in the political arena economic liberalism and welfare state socialism - a lethal mix for conservative politics.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=wS0rDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"City of Bits: Space, Place, and the Infobahn","description":"Entertaining, concise, and relentlessly probing, City of Bits is a comprehensive introduction to a new type of city, an increasingly important system of virtual spaces interconnected by the information superhighway.

From Bart Simpson to Monty Burns, the Internet boom to the slow drowning of Tuvalu, Planet Simpson explores how one of the most popular shows in television history has changed the way we look at our bewildering times. Award-winning journalist Chris Turner delves into the most esoteric of Simpsons fansites and on-line subcultures, the show s inside jokes, its sharpest parodies and its ongoing love-hate relationship with celebrity to reveal a rarity of literary accomplishment and pop-cultural import   something never before achieved by a cartoon. Complementing its satirical brilliance, The Simpsons boasts a beloved cast of characters, examined here in playful and scrupulous detail: Homer, selfish, tyrannical and not too bright, but always contentedly beholden to his family; Bart, pre-teen nihilist and punk icon; Lisa, junior feminist crusader; and Marge, archetypical middle-American mother, perpetually dragging her family kicking and screaming to higher moral ground. And while the voice actors behind the regular cast have eschewed celebrity, Turner considers why a stunning host of guests   Hollywood icons and has-beens, politicians, professional athletes, poets and pop stars   have submitted themselves to the parodic whims of the Simpsons  writers. Intelligent and rambunctious, absorbing and comic, Planet Simpson mines this modern cultural institution for its imaginative, hilarious, but always dead-on, reflections on our world. Excerpt from Planet Simpson Three Fun Facts About  D oh!  1. The Oxford English Dictionary defines  d oh  as  Expressing frustration at the realization that things have turned out badly or not as planned, or that one has just said or done something foolish.  2. The origins of  D oh!  A Tracey Ullmanera Simpsons script called for Homer to respond to an unfortunate turn of events thus:  [annoyed grunt].  Dan Castellaneta, the voice-actor who plays Homer, improvised the exclamation,  D oh!  It stuck. 3. The godfather of  D oh!  Dan Castellaneta freely admits that he lifted Homer s famous yelp from James Finlayson, a Scottish actor who played a bald, cross-eyed villain in a number of Laurel & Hardy films in the 1930s. Finlayson s annoyed grunt was a more drawn-out groan   Doooohhh! Castellaneta sped it up to create Homer s trademark.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=dCIoHwX0JpMC&dq=Planet+Simpson:+How+A+Cartoon+Masterpiece+Defined+a+Generation&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mastodonia","description":"In rural Wisconsin, wonder clashes dangerously with corporate greed when an alien visitor opens up a gateway through time into a breathtaking prehistoric lost world On sabbatical from teaching at a small university, paleontologist Asa Steele is content to relax amidst the pastoral splendor of his Wisconsin farm. That is, until his dog starts bringing home unrecognizable artifacts and, strangest of all, fresh dinosaur bones. Since boyhood, Asa has heard the rumors of a UFO crash site nearby, and his encounter with a cat-faced alien life form proves the old story to be shockingly true. A gregarious immortal stranded on Earth for fifty thousand years, Catface has the power to create portals in time, and now he has opened a gateway into a prehistoric world of wonder and beauty, a place Asa calls  Mastodonia.  But keeping this idyllic realm a secret from a prying government and the greedy corporate entities it serves could prove impossible and perilous when there are resources to drain, land to despoil, and gargantuan vanished beasts from a distant age to hunt down and destroy in the name of profit. Clifford D. Simak s glorious vision of a gateway to the past and of the tantalizing commercial potential of all things prehistoric predates Michael Crichton s Jurassic Park by many years, yet it remains as provocative, enthralling, and fun for twenty-first-century science fiction lovers as it was for its original readers.

He was born in a house still standing at the corner of Fore and Hancock streets, Portland, Maine, February 27, 1807. He was trained for college at the Portland Academy, and in 1821 entered Bowdoin College (founded but twenty years before), was graduated in 1825, and immediately received an invitation to teach the modern languages in his Alma Mater, with leave of absence for travel and study in Europe. He sailed for France in may, 1826, where he spent the rest for that year. Early in 1827 he went to Spain for eight months. A year followed in Italy; and after six months in Germany, he returned to America in the summer of 1829. In September of that year he entered upon his duties as Professor of Modern Languages. In September, 1831, he was married to Mary Storer Potter, second daughter of Judge Barrett Potter of Portland. His study and his writing during his residence at Brunswick made him at last feel restricted in opportunity; and he was casting about for some more congenial position, when he received, in December, 1834, an invitation to succeed Mr. George Ticknor as Smith Professor of Modern Languages in Harvard University, and at once accepted the offer with enthusiasm. The invitation gave an intimation that he might, if he chose, spend a year or eighteen months in Europe for the purpose of perfecting himself in German; and in April, 1835, he made a second journey of study and observation. He spent the remainder of the year in England, the Scandinavian countries, and Holland, where he was detained by the illness of his wife, who died at the end of November in Rotterdam. Thence he passed to Germany, where he wintered in Heidelberg, occupying himself closely in study. Near the end of June, he went to the Tyrol, spent the summer in Switzerland, and by slow stages made his way to Havre, whence he sailed for home in October, 1836. In December of this year he established himself in Cambridge, and took up his college duties. In the summer of 1837 he found quarters in the historic house which had been Washington's headquarters during the siege of Boston, where he had for a while as co-tenant Dr. Joseph Worcester, the lexicographer. The house at the time was owned and occupied by Mrs. Andrew Craigie, widow of a commissary officer in the American army, who bore the distinguished title Apothecary-general.

They chart the course of \\"true\\" socialism based on Hegel's dialectic, while criticizing the ideas of Bruno Bauer, Max Stirner, and Ludwig Feuerbach. Marx expanded his criticism of the latter in his now famous Theses on Feuerbach, found after Marx's death and published by Engels in 1888. Introduction to the Critique of Political Economy, also found among the posthumous papers of Marx, is a fragment of an introduction to his main works.

These so-called non-lethal weapons are the subject of this remarkable book on an arms race which the general public has hardly yet heard of. Yet, in the brave new world of post-cold war 'benign interventions' - from Bosnia to Somalia - American, British and other Western armed forces are busy pursuing a variety of new devices which, they hope, will cause fewer civilian, and also fewer military, casualties and so excite less popular oposition. Various police forces are also interested as they confront increasingly alienated communities and urban riots. This book tells us what the new weapons are, how they work, and the burgeoning body of policy and doctrine relating to their deployment. It describes how this military hi-tech is already beginning to be used and the health risks, ethical implications and human rights consequences involved, The authors discuss the new notion of benign intervention as it becomes a central part of 21st century strategy for the maintenance of order in an essentially disorderly world. For expert and lay reader alike, this book provides an essential introduction to a subject of the utmost importance for the future.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=4EgRrrYX8KQC&dq=Non-Lethal+Weapons:+A+Fatal+Attraction%3F:+Military+Strategies+and+Technologies+for+21st+Century+Conflict&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Thoughts for the Free Life: Lao Tsu to the Present","description":"The wisdom of the ages on the natural way, realizing the human potential: Oriental, Greek philosophers, proverbs from many cultures, American Indian, Isaiah, Palestinian poets, Thoreau, e.e. cummings.

Republicans nominated for president a wealthy businessman and former reality show host best known on the campaign trail for his sharp rhetoric against immigration and foreign trade. Democrats nearly selected a self-described socialist who ran on a populist platform against the influence of big money in politics. While it is not surprising that Americans would channel their frustrations into votes for contenders who pledge to end business as usual, the truth is that we don t have to pin our hopes for greater participation on any one candidate. All of us have a say if we learn, master and practice the skills of effective citizenship. One of the biggest roadblocks to participation in democracy is the perception that privileged citizens and special interests command the levers of power and that everyday Americans can t fight City Hall. That perception is undoubtedly why a 2015 Pew Charitable Trusts survey found that 74 percent of those Americans surveyed believed that most elected officials didn't care what people like them thought. Graham and Hand intend to change that conventional wisdom by showing citizens how to flex their citizenship muscles. They describe effective citizenship skills and provide tips from civic experts. Even more importantly, they offer numerous examples of everyday Americans who have used their skills to make democracy respond. The reader will see themselves in these examples of citizens who chose to be victorious participants rather than tranquil spectators in the arena of democracy. By the end of the book, you will have new confidence that citizen participation is the lifeblood of America -- and will be ready to make governments work for you, not the other way around.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=IIOzDAAAQBAJ&dq=Buy+American:+A+How-To+Handbook+:+Who+Owns+What+in+the+USA&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"GREAT BORDEAUX WINES","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"I Can't Believe It's Not Meat!","description":"From Harvest Direct, one of America's leading distributors of TVP, comes a tasty assortment of recipes using textured soy protein, the quick-to-cook meat substitute.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=WPzEAQAACAAJ&dq=I+Can%27t+Believe+It%27s+Not+Meat!&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sociology of the Global System","description":"While not ignoring more traditional state-centered approaches, Sklair (sociology, London School of Economics and Political Science) offers a new conception of the global system, based on transnational practices in three spheres--economic, political, and cultural-ideological.

Paul F. Campos, Pierre Schlag, and Steven D. Smith challenge the conventional representations of the legal system that are articulated and defended by American legal scholars. Unorthodox, irreverent, and provocative,Against the Law demonstrates that for many in the legal community, law has become a kind of substitute religion an essentially idolatrous practice composed of systematic self-misrepresentation and self-deception. Linked by a persistent inquiry into the nature and identity of  the law,  these essays are informed by the conviction that the conventional representations of law, both in law schools and the courts, cannot be taken at face value that the law, as commonly conceived, makes no sense. The authors argue that the relentlessly normative prescriptions of American legal thinkers are frequently futile and, indeed, often pernicious. They also argue that the failure to recognize the role that authorship must play in the production of legal thought plagues both the teaching and the practice of American law. Ranging from the institutional to the psychological and metaphysical deficiencies of the American legal system, the depth of criticism offered byAgainst the Law is unprecedented. In a departure from the nearly universal legitimating and reformist tendencies of American legal thought, this book will be of interest not only to the legal academics under attack in the book, but also to sociologists, historians, and social theorists. More particularly, it will engage all the American lawyers who suspect that there is something very wrong with the nature and direction of their profession, law students who anticipate becoming part of that profession, and those readers concerned with the status of the American legal system.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=JcIT0uovL9UC&dq=Against+the+Law&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Year's Best Science Fiction: Sixth Annual Collection","description":"Collects short stories exploring themes of time and space travel, self-discovery, and science and technology.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=h-Bo0ofAFeQC&dq=The+Year%27s+Best+Science+Fiction:+Sixth+Annual+Collection&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Knitted Toys: 21 Easy-to-Knit Patterns for Irresistible Soft Toys","description":"'Knitted Toys' contains 21 designs for a whole range of toys, including finger puppets, a fairy and a penguin, which will appeal to children of all ages.

Secular political entities such as the nation, the state, race, class, and the party became the focus of myths, rituals, and commandments and gradually became objects of faith, loyalty, and reverence. Gentile examines this \\"sacralization of politics,\\" as he defines it, both historically and theoretically, seeking to identify the different ways in which political regimes as diverse as fascism, communism, and liberal democracy have ultimately depended, like religions, on faith, myths, rites, and symbols. Gentile maintains that the sacralization of politics as a modern phenomenon is distinct from the politicization of religion that has arisen from militant religious fundamentalism. Sacralized politics may be democratic, in the form of a civil religion, or it may be totalitarian, in the form of a political religion. Using this conceptual distinction, and moving from America to Europe, and from Africa to Asia, Gentile presents a unique comparative history of civil and political religions from the American and French Revolutions, through nationalism and socialism, democracy and totalitarianism, fascism and communism, up to the present day. It is also a fascinating book for understanding the sacralization of politics after 9/11.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=d83xDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Morals and Dogma of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite Freemasonry, Vol. 1","description":"This work depicts the 32 degrees of the Scottish Rite of Freemasonry. \\"Morals and Dogma' was traditionally given to the candidate upon his receipt of the 14th degree of the Scottish Rite.

The weather is always mild, the wine flows freely, sex is readily available, and all people enjoy eternal youth. Such is Cockaigne. Portrayed in legend, oral history, and art, this imaginary land became the most pervasive collective dream of medieval times-an earthly paradise that served to counter the suffering and frustration of daily existence and to allay anxieties about an increasingly elusive heavenly paradise. Illustrated with extraordinary artwork from the Middle Ages, Herman Pleij's Dreaming of Cockaigne is a spirited account of this lost paradise and the world that brought it to life. Pleij takes three important texts as his starting points for an inspired of the panorama of ideas, dreams, popular religion, and literary and artistic creation present in the late Middle Ages. What emerges is a well-defined picture of the era, furnished with a wealth of detail from all of Europe, as well as Asia and America. Pleij draws upon his thorough knowledge of medieval European literature, art, history, and folklore to describe the fantasies that fed the tales of Cockaigne and their connections to the central obsessions of medieval life.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=sUalqlzbAbcC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Make Your Own Lotion, Toiletries, and More!

Hirsch s Making the Second Ghetto is the rare book that has only become more piercingly prescient over the years. Hirsch s classic and groundbreaking work of urban history is a revelatory look at Chicago in the decades after the Great Depression, a period when the city dealt with its rapidly growing Black population not by working to abolish its stark segregation but by expanding and solidifying it. Even as the civil rights movement rose to prominence, Chicago exploited a variety of methods of segregation including riots, redevelopment, and a host of new legal frameworks that provided a national playbook for the emergence of a new kind of entrenched inequality. Hirsch s chronicle of the strategies employed by ethnic, political, and business interests in reaction to the Great Migration of Southern Blacks in the mid-twentieth century makes startingly clear how the violent reactions of an emergent white population found common ground with policy makers to segregate first a city and then the nation. This enlarged edition of Making the Second Ghetto features a visionary afterword by historian N. D. B. Connolly, explaining why Hirsch s book still crackles with  blistering relevance  for contemporary readers.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=3cskEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Rulers of Mecca","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=4plZAAAAYAAJ&dq=Rulers+of+Mecca&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Peef and His Best Friend (Peef the Bear)","description":"Peef the bear is left behind when his best friend goes to school, but when the boy tries to become popular by not being himself, Peef understands and comforts him.

What was formerly a politics of accommodation, one whose main objective was the avoidance of strife through \\"arrangements\\" and compromises, has become a winner-take-all, zero-sum game. The conflict is not over who gets what. Rather, it is a conflict over the very character of the polity, a struggle to define Israel's collective character. In Israel and the Politics of Jewish Identity Asher Cohen and Bernard Susser show how this transformation has been caused by structural changes in Israel's public sphere.

Wright went on to write eleven more mysteries. The first few books about his upper-class amateur sleuth, Philo Vance, were so popular that Wright became wealthy for the first time in his life.

Yet the term \\"gnosticism,\\" which often connotes a single rebellious movement against the prevailing religions of late antiquity, gives the false impression of a monolithic religious phenomenon. Here Michael Williams challenges the validity of the widely invoked category of ancient \\"gnosticism\\" and the ways it has been described. Presenting such famous writings and movements as the Apocryphon of John and Valentinian Christianity, Williams uncovers the similarities and differences among some major traditions widely categorized as gnostic. He provides an eloquent, systematic argument for a more accurate way to discuss these interpretive approaches. The modern construct \\"gnosticism\\" is not justified by any ancient self-definition, and many of the most commonly cited religious features that supposedly define gnosticism phenomenologically turn out to be questionable. Exploring the sample sets of \\"gnostic\\" teachings, Williams refutes generalizations concerning asceticism and libertinism, attitudes toward the body and the created world, and alleged features of protest, parasitism, and elitism. He sketches a fresh model for understanding ancient innovations on more \\"mainstream\\" Judaism and Christianity, a model that is informed by modern research on dynamics in new religious movements and is freed from the false stereotypes from which the category \\"gnosticism\\" has been constructed.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=EOdrTzNo2w4C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Simms Taback's Big Book of Words","description":"Illustrations and text present common toys, articles of clothing, foods and animals.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=OesTuAEACAAJ&dq=Simms+Taback%27s+Big+Book+of+Words&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Thru the Bible, Vol. 2: Joshua-Psalms","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=LNIlAQAAIAAJ&dq=Thru+the+Bible,+Vol.+2:+Joshua-Psalms&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Companero: The Life and Death of Che Guevara","description":"By the time he was killed in the jungles of Bolivia, where his body was displayed like a deposed Christ, Ernesto \\"Che\\" Guevara had become a synonym for revolution everywhere from Cuba to the barricades of Paris.

Drawing on archival materials from three continents and on interviews with Guevara's family and associates, Castaneda follows Che from his childhood in the Argentine middle class through the years of pilgrimage that turned him into a committed revolutionary. He examines Guevara's complex relationship with Fidel Castro, and analyzes the flaws of character that compelled him to leave Cuba and expend his energies, and ultimately his life, in quixotic adventures in the Congo and Bolivia.

Becoming a part of the rest of the world and being defined as a natural park have brought new pressures on the people and the land, new expectations about what Sagarmatha National Park ought to look like, whom it is for and by whom it should be managed. Expeditions and trekking groups, with demands for human and animal porterage have affected old animal husbandry practices and, together with other concomitant developments, have vitally affected both the traditional life of the Sherpa people and the fragile high mountain environment of Khumbu. This study, based on extensive fieldwork, looks at animal management in Sagarmatha National Park in the context of Sherpa subsistance, demonstrating the intricacy of the man-land relationship, the adaptability of traditional people and the range of considerations that must be taken into account in any attempt to modify traditional land-use practices. The Khumbu landscape is graphically described and the human role in modifying the natural landscape is explored. Sherpa history and economy are discussed, as are the substantial changes that the traditional life of Khumbu has undergone in the past few decades. Livestock provides a focal point for this wide-ranging investigation and the cattle economy in particular is described in some detail. In sum, this work provides a well-rounded and very readable account of Sherpa society in transition and its interaction with its environment and the external world. Although focusing on the Sherpa, its relevance stretches far beyond its immediatesubject to the study of all traditional societies subject to the pressures of change and the debate on the apparent hiatus between preservation of the environment and the legitimate rights of the people who depend upon it for a livelihood.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=MpmGAAAAIAAJ&dq=Sherpa+of+Khumbu:+People,+Livestock,+and+Landscape+(Studies+in+Social+Ecology+and+Environmental+History)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"101 Ways to Captivate a Business Audience","description":"Captivating a business audience doesn't come naturally to most business speakers.

High school was miserable enough, thanks, and Jasper has no interest in dredging up painful memories of his old secret crush. But Milo's got nowhere else to go. His life is spiraling out of control and he's looking to turn things back around. Step one? Replace the rare Odyssey cards he lost in an idiotic bet. Step two? Tell his ex-best-friend exactly how he feels how he's always felt. Jasper may be reluctant to reopen old wounds, but he never could resist Milo. There's a catch, though: if Milo wants his help, he's going to have to pitch in to make the upcoming children's hospital charity ball the best ever. But as the two don cosplay for the kids and hunt for rare cards, nostalgia for their lost friendship may turn into something even more lasting...","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=LAMGEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Guion Miller Roll Plus","description":"The 1909 Gunion Miller roll plus Dawes Roll information for those that were on both rolls.

[Diffenbaugh] is the best new writer of the year.\\" Elle  I would like to hand Vanessa Diffenbaugh a bouquet of bouvardia (enthusiasm), gladiolus (you pierce my heart) and lisianthus (appreciation).

Many have altered the outcome of games, and some have decided pennants and become legend. But no dinger has had greater impact than Hank Aaron's 715th home run. His historic blast on April 8, 1974, lifted him above Babe Ruth on the all-time list, an achievement that shook not only baseball but our nation itself. Aaron's magnificent feat provoked bigotry and shattered prejudice, inspired a generation, emboldened a flagging civil rights movement, and called forth the demons that haunted Aaron's every step and turned what should have been a joyous pursuit into a hellish nightmare. In this powerful recollection, Tom Stanton penetrates the myth of Aaron's chase and uncovers the compelling story behind the most consequential athletic achievement of the past fifty years. Three decades after Hank Aaron reached the pinnacle of the national pastime, and now as Barry Bonds makes history of his own, Stanton unfolds a tale rich with drama, poignancy, and suspense to bring to life the elusive spirit of an American hero.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=gPd8tAEACAAJ&dq=Hank+Aaron+and+the+Home+Run+That+Changed+America&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The mistletoe and the sword","description":"A story of Roman Britain and the uprising against the Romans led by Queen Boadicea.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=u53iEgwP4B8C&dq=The+mistletoe+and+the+sword&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Lighthouse Stevensons","description":"For centuries the seas around Scotland were notorious for shipwrecks. Mariners' only aids were skill, luck, and single coal-fire light on the east coast, which was usually extinguished by rain. In 1786 the Northern Lighthouse Trust was established, with Robert Stevenson appointed as chief engineer a few years later. In this engrossing book, Bella Bathhurst reveals that the Stevensons not only supervised the construction of the lighthouses under often desperate conditions but also perfected a design of precisely chiseled interlocking granite blocks that would withstand the enormous waves that batter these stone pillars. The same Stevensons also developed the lamps and lenses of the lights themselves, which \\"sent a gleam across the wave\\" and prevented countless ships from being lost at sea. While it is the writing of Robert Louis Stevenson that brought fame to the family name, this mesmerizing account shows how his extraordinary ancestors changed the shape of the Scotland coast against incredible odds and with remarkable technical ingenuity.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=yZeiDA8vBWcC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Beowulf: An Edition","description":"Presents a new translation of the Anglo-Saxon epic chronicling the heroic adventures of Beowulf, the Scandinavian warrior who saves his people from the ravages of the monster Grendel and Grendel's mother.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=m-7crEM3A0AC&dq=Beowulf:+An+Edition&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Out of the Past (A Miss Silver Mystery)","description":"A runaway groom returns and murder ensues in the series starring a governess-turned-sleuth:  Miss Silver is marvelous  (Daily Mail).

In this profound new book, Korten shares the results of his search for a story that reflects the fullness of human knowledge and understanding and provides a guide to action adequate to the needs of our time. Korten calls our current story Sacred Money and Markets. Money, it tells us, is the measure of all worth and the source of all happiness. Earth is simply a source of raw materials. Inequality and environmental destruction are unfortunate but unavoidable. Although many recognize that this story promotes bad ethics, bad science, and bad economics, it will remain our guiding story until replaced by one that aligns with our deepest understanding of the universe and our relationship to it. To guide our path to a viable human future, Korten offers a Sacred Life and Living Earth story grounded in a cosmology that affirms we are living beings born of a living Earth itself born of a living universe. Our health and well-being depend on an economy that works in partnership with the processes by which Earth's community of life maintains the conditions of its own existence and ours. Offering a hopeful vision, Korten lays out the transformative impact adopting this story will have on every aspect of human life and society.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=C07XoQEACAAJ&dq=When+Corporations+Rule+the+World&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Tribulation Force: Left Behind, Volume 2","description":"Four Christians left behind after The Rapture join forces to create the Tribulation Force, fighting the enemies of God left on Earth after three-quarters of the world's population has perished amid disease and natural disaster.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=1OqoDwAAQBAJ&dq=Tribulation+Force:+Left+Behind,+Volume+2&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Modern Airport Terminal: New Approaches to Airport Architecture","description":"This comprehensive guide to the planning and design of airport terminals and their facilities covers all types of airport terminal found around the world and highlights the environmental and technical issues that the designer has to address.

She writes in paradox, with serious wit and intensity, the crafted language of  stitches in hand and birds in time ;  We part/ before we part; indeed,/ we part before we meet   She studies  going matched with coming.  She begins with a series of elegies that bring sexuality and death into brutal juxtaposition. Living and dying are the occasions of these poems, the soul the ultimate concern. This poetry takes to heart the fundamental strangeness of being.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=qjzHBwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Morals and Dogma of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite Freemasonry, Vol. 2","description":"This work depicts the 32 degrees of the Scottish Rite of Freemasonry. \\"Morals and Dogma' was traditionally given to the candidate upon his receipt of the 14th degree of the Scottish Rite.

Breathing is something we all know how to do. And yet, the majority of teenagers and adults let go of their natural ability to breathe fully. We are conditioned from an early age to control our feelings and emotions, and as a result our muscles tighten and our breathing patterns become restricted. The impact on our mental and physical wellbeing is huge. By learning how to consciously connect to our breath and encourage its natural rhythms, we can harmonise the body and mind, live life fully, find emotional freedom and feel empowered. And Breathe teaches readers how to harness the power of conscious breathing, a technique which helps alleviate stress, fatigue and negative emotions such as anger, frustration and depression, leaving readers feel calm yet energised, focused yet relaxed. It is a practical guide to letting go of the unwanted patterns of emotions, blockages and tension which hold us back and includes simple to follow exercises, tips, case studies, interviews and testimonials.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=4gEMkAEACAAJ&dq=Total+breathing&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hsing-I: Chinese Internal Boxing (Chinese Martial Arts Library)","description":"Master Chinese internal boxing or Hsing-I with this illustrated martial arts guide.

The secret behind its power lies in the cultivation and practical application of internal energy ch'i, There are basically three soft-style martial arts: T'ai-chi, already well known worldwide, and Hsing-I and Pa-kua, relative newcomers to the West. Although they are not essentially fighting arts but living arts, they are devastating as systems of self-defense. This martial arts book outlines the history of Hsing-I a style of boxing given form (Hsing) by the mind (i) and gives a thorough account of the philosophy behind the techniques. It also presents to the West for the first time the orthodox style of the late Chinese Hsing-i master Ch'en P'an-ling.

Through an innovative rereading of the Puritan sources, Alfred A. Cave refutes claims that settlers acted defensively to counter a Pequot conspiracy to exterminate Europeans. Drawing on archaeological, linguistic, and anthropological evidences to trace the evolution of the conflict, he sheds new light on the motivations of the Pequots and their Indian allies, the fur trade, and the cultural values and attitudes in New England. He also provides a reappraisal of the interaction of ideology and self- interest as motivating factors in the Puritan attack on the Pequots.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=vxAOAQAAMAAJ&dq=The+Pequot+War+(Native+Americans+of+the+Northeast)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Territory of Men: A Memoir","description":"Born into the turmoil of mid-sixties San Francisco, the daughter of a flower child and a surfer, Joelle Fraser grew up with no bedtime, no boundaries, and no father. But  dads  she had in abundance, as her mother worked her way through boyfriends and husbands, caught between the traditional rules of her upbringing and the new freedoms of the  me generation  and women s lib. Moving every few months, from houseboats and beach shacks to run-down apartments, Joelle came to learn that a woman s life, free or not, is played out on men s territory. Set in northern California, Hawaii, and the small coastal towns of Oregon, Fraser s engrossing memoir captures this centerless childhood in wonderfully vivid, frank writing, then goes on to show how a legacy like this affects a girl as she grows up. Pretty, blond, precociously aware of her own sexuality, Joelle was drawn to men early, eager to unlock their mysteries. Working in bars, prisons, and firing ranges, she liked to hang out where they congregated. To her the only worlds that counted were men s worlds. Men held the power; they made life matter. Fraser s sharp vignettes of her intense relationships, brief, turbulent marriage, and itinerant life are haunting echoes of her early memories. In The Territory of Men, she brilliantly portrays the way a rootless childhood leads to a restless adulthood, and how a mother s aimless life serves as a blueprint for her daughter.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=1dz39OIToxIC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Complete Photographer","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=5_4DzgEACAAJ&dq=The+Complete+Photographer&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Body Snatcher","description":"The story concerns two medical students in Edinburgh who manage dissection for their teacher, a thinly disguised anatomist Dr. Robert Knox, who purchased cadavers from the infamous murderers William Burke and William Hare.

And suppose that when we were done, government would still be smaller than it was when Ronald Reagan was president. If you're like most people, you'd probably think that for two cents on the dollar this sounds like an intriguing deal. But 2 percent of America's GDP is more than 200 billion a year--way beyond what politicians in Washington think is possible. Between our proper intuition that 2 percent is a small amount, and the Washington consensus that a 2 percent shift in priorities is beyond imagining, lies the opportunity to transform American politics. In this agenda-setting book, Matthew Miller challenges our country (and those who would lead it) to change the way we think about our public responsibilities before the baby boomers' retirement siphons all the money out of the system. The Two Percent Solution is a call to arms that no serious candidate, Republican or Democrat, can afford to ignore.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=LwbEtAEACAAJ&dq=The+Two+Percent+Solution:+Fixing+America%27s+Problems+in+Ways+Liberals+and+Conservatives+Can+Love&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Opening the Mind's Eye: How Images and Language Teach Us How To See","description":"Ian Robertson has always been fascinated by how the mind makes images, for that awesome power directly and deeply affects our lives. All of us \\"visualize\\" the world differently, and how we do so dictates the way we feel, remember, and think--and therefore our health, memory, and creativity. In this lively, accessible and fascinating book, Robertson explains that most of us employ language as a basis for visualization. In effect, we think in words more than in images. The result is an imbalance between the logical and the intuitive, between imagery-based thought and language-based thought. Opening the Mind's Eye is both an enlightening and stimulating explanation of how we \\"see,\\" and a compelling argument for extending the mind's powers to improve the quality of our lives.

And the man sitting across the table from her in a crowded English pub, the one offering to buy the library of her inherited estate in a small English village, is a major complication. For starters, there's the broad shoulders. The slightly amused smirk. That smoldering look that makes it impossible to concentrate. And that infuriating, old-fashioned, and well, okay, incredibly appealing sense of chivalry. No doubt about it, the guy is hot and sexy.

In The Coffin Ship, a groundbreaking work of transnational history, Cian T. McMahon offers a vibrant, fresh perspective on an oft-ignored but vital component of the migration experience: the journey itself. Between 1845 and 1855, over two million people fled Ireland to escape the Great Famine and begin new lives abroad. The so-called  coffin ships  they embarked on have since become infamous icons of nineteenth-century migration. The crews were brutal, the captains were heartless, and the weather was ferocious. Yet the personal experiences of the emigrants aboard these vessels offer us a much more complex understanding of this pivotal moment in modern history. Based on archival research on three continents and written in clear, crisp prose, The Coffin Ship analyzes the emigrants  own letters and diaries to unpack the dynamic social networks that the Irish built while voyaging overseas. At every stage of the journey including the treacherous weeks at sea these migrants created new threads in the worldwide web of the Irish diaspora. Colored by the long-lost voices of the emigrants themselves, this is an original portrait of a process that left a lasting mark on Irish life at home and abroad. An indispensable read, The Coffin Ship makes an ambitious argument for placing the sailing ship alongside the tenement and the factory floor as a central, dynamic element of migration history.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=iWwDEAAAQBAJ&dq=The+Coffin+Ship&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Lean Manufacturing: Tools, Techniques, and How to Use Them (Resource Management)","description":"There are some very good books available that explain the Lean Manufacturing theory and touch on implementing its techniques. However, you cannot learn \\"how to be\\" lean from merely reading the theory. And to be successful in the real-work environment you need a clear comprehension of how lean techniques work, rather than just a remote understanding of what they are. You need to know what does and does not work in different situations. And you need the benefit of practical experience in their implementation. Lean Manufacturing: Tools, Techniques, and How to Use Them gives you the benefit of author and practitioner William Feld's 15 years of hands-on experience - and the lessons he's learned. Feld provides insight into the appropriate use of assessment, analysis, design, and, most importantly, deployment of a successful lean manufacturing program. Packed with practical advice and tips but not bogged down in theory, this book covers how, why, when, and what to do while implementing lean manufacturing. It equips you with the tools and techniques you need along with an understanding of how and why they work. Feld explores why an integrated approach is so much more beneficial in securing sustained improvement. He focuses on the interdependency of the Five Primary Elements: organization, metrics, logistics, manufacturing flow, and process control. He describes a proven, applied approach to creating a lean program using these elements. To keep up globally, and even locally, your manufacturing operation must be responsive, flexible, predictable, and consistent. You must continually improve manufacturing operations and cultivate a self directed work force driven by output based, customer performance criteria. By applying what you learn from Lean Manufacturing: Tools, Techniques, and How to Use Them you can build a workforce - and an organization - with the capacity to satisfy world class expectations now and into the future.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=BcYgCAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Bobby Allison: A Racer's Racer","description":"This special limited-edition includes actual signatures from Bobby Allison and author Tim Packman.

They have been fed a steady diet of fictional shows with paranormal themes such as The X-Files, Supernatural, and Medium, shows that may seek to simply entertain, but also serve to disseminate paranormal beliefs. The public hunger for the paranormal seems insatiable. Paranormal America provides the definitive portrait of Americans who believe in or have experienced such phenomena as ghosts, Bigfoot, UFOs, psychic phenomena, astrology, and the power of mediums. However, unlike many books on the paranormal, this volume does not focus on proving or disproving the paranormal, but rather on understanding the people who believe and how those beliefs shape their lives. Drawing on the Baylor Religion Survey a multi-year national random sample of American religious values, practices, and behaviors as well as extensive fieldwork including joining hunts for Bigfoot and spending the night in a haunted house, authors Christopher Bader, F. Carson Mencken, and Joseph Baker shed light on what the various types of paranormal experiences, beliefs, and activities claimed by Americans are; whether holding an unconventional belief, such as believing in Bigfoot, means that one is unconventional in other attitudes and behaviors; who has such experiences and beliefs and how they differ from other Americans; and if we can expect major religions to emerge from the paranormal. Brimming with engaging personal stories and provocative findings, Paranormal America is an entertaining yet authoritative look at a growing segment of American religious culture.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=pSSnLpYK7gQC&dq=Des+Masquerade,+An+Expose+On+Satan+In+The+New+Age+Movement&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"They Made a Monkee Out of Me","description":"THE ONLY AUTHORIZED STORY OF THE MONKEES THE 60'S PHENOMENON THAT BECAME AN 80'S PHENOMALY* \\"There are autobiographies...and there are ought-to-buy...ographies.

Trans-Mississippi West: ser. C])","description":"The Texas Centennial of 1936, commemorated by statewide celebrations of independence from Mexico, proved to be a powerful catalyst for the formation of a distinctly Mexican American identity. Confronted by a media frenzy that vilified \\"Meskins\\" as the antithesis of Texan liberty, Mexican Americans created literary responses that critiqued these racialized representations while forging a new bilingual, bicultural community within the United States. The development of a modern Tejana identity, controversies surrounding bicultural nationalism, and other conflictual aspects of the transformation from mexicano to Mexican American are explored in this study. Capturing this fascinating aesthetic and political rebirth, Border Renaissance presents innovative readings of important novels by Mar a Elena Zamora O'Shea, Am rico Paredes, and Jovita Gonz lez. In addition, the previously overlooked literary texts by members of the League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC) are given their first detailed consideration in this compelling work of intellectual and literary history. Drawing on extensive archival research in the English and Spanish languages, John Mor n Gonz lez revisits the 1930s as a crucial decade for the vibrant Mexican American reclamation of Texas history. Border Renaissance pays tribute to this vital turning point in the Mexican American struggle for civil rights.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=b489oNoCGGcC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Storyteller Journal","description":"What do a crazy person, a chemist, a lottery ticket seller, a tourist, a New Year s date, Cervantes, a couple in crisis, some geeky teenagers and a ruined millionaire have in common?

The author attempts to correct the paucity of information on the functioning of Civil War staffs with this well-presented historical study. Focusing on the personal staffs of Generals McClellan, Lee, Sherman, and Grant, Jones reveals that no one appreciated the amount of staff work required to run a large, complex army efficiently in the field. Armies were just too big for one commander to handle all the administrative, logistical, and operational details himself. Civil War armies required a 'corporate nature of leadership, ' says Jones, with a personal staff complementing the efforts of the commander. He finds that McClellan dithered with his staff as he did with his army, Lee's staff was used for little more than record - and housekeeping, Sherman's approach was traditional, and Grant was the most innovative and demanding of his staff. Jones discusses staff selection, training, use, and relationship to the commander.

In now classic essays, this thought-provoking volume critically examines the terms \\"race\\" and \\"IQ\\" and their applications in scientific discourse. The twenty-four contributors--including such eminent thinkers as Stephen Jay Gould, Richard Lewontin, Urie Bronfenbrenner, W.F. Bodmer, and Jerome Kagan--draw on fields that range from biology and genetics to psychology, anthropology, and education. What emerges in piece after piece is a deep skepticism about the scientific validity of intelligence tests, especially as applied to evaluating innate intelligence, if only because scientists still cannot distinguish between genetic and environmental contributions to the development of the human mind. Five new essays have been included that specifically address the claims made in the recent, highly controversial book, The Bell Curve. Must reading for anyone interested in racism and education in America, Race and IQ is a brilliantly lucid exploration of the boundary line between race and intelligence.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=NWFWm3GW90kC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dialogues and Natural History of Religion (Oxford World's Classics)","description":"David Hume is the greatest and also one of the most provocative philosophers to have written in the English language. No philosopher is more important for his careful, critical, and deeply perceptive examination of the grounds for belief in divine powers and for his sceptical accounts of the causes and consequences of religious belief, expressed most powerfully in the Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion and The Natural History of Religion. The Dialogues ask if belief in God can be inferred from the nature of the universe or whether it is even consistent with what we know about the universe. The Natural History of Religion investigates the origins of belief, and follows its development from harmless polytheism to dogmatic monotheism. Together they constitute the most formidable attack upon the rationality of religious belief ever mounted by a philosopher. This edition also includes Section XI of The Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding and a letter concerning the Dialogues, as well as particularly helpful critical apparatus and abstracts of the main texts, enabling the reader to locate or relocate key topics.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=YnsCOwAACAAJ&dq=Dialogues+and+Natural+History+of+Religion+(Oxford+World%27s+Classics)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Judaism, Christianity, and Islam: Interaction and conflict","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=LpQyAAAAIAAJ&dq=Judaism,+Christianity,+and+Islam:+Interaction+and+conflict&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Amazing Spiderman Nos. 1-10 and Amazing Fantasy No. 15","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=8f1DswEACAAJ&dq=The+Amazing+Spiderman+Nos.+1-10+and+Amazing+Fantasy+No.+15&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Love Lifted Me: In Spite of the Church","description":"Love Lifted Me: In Spite of the Church is an inspirational read of an African-American, openly gay man's triumphant journey through the guilt, shame and condemnation bought on by his Christian upbringing.

In keeping with his reputation for writing about big ideas in an illuminating and graceful way, he shows how sports respond to deep human needs; describes the ways in which baseball, football and basketball became national institutions and how they reached their present forms; and covers the evolution of rules, the rise and fall of the most successful teams, and the historical significance of the most famous and influential figures such as Babe Ruth, Vince Lombardi, and Michael Jordan. Whether he is writing about baseball as the agrarian game, football as similar to warfare, basketball as the embodiment of post-industrial society, or the moral havoc created by baseball's designated hitter rule, Mandelbaum applies the full force of his learning and wit to subjects about which so many Americans care passionately: the games they played in their youth and continue to follow as adults.

The park was an important part of Milton S. Hershey's plans for his new model industrial town, built for the workers of the Hershey Chocolate factory. In 1903, even before the factory was completed, he set aside land to be used as a park for picnics and family outings. While originally established as a community park, it soon developed into an amusement park as thousands of people flocked to Hershey each year to visit the chocolate factory and model town. This book portrays the origin of Hershey Park, its development as a trolley park, and its successful transition to Hersheypark, a themed amusement park, at a time when many traditional parks faltered and failed. Through period photographs and engaging narrative, Hersheypark explores the growth and development of the park; the vision of its founder, Milton S. Hershey; its successes and challenges; and how the park endured and transformed itself to become one of the East Coast's leading entertainment destinations.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ikxPErye1JcC&dq=Hershey+(Images+of+America)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Ghosts of Departure Point","description":"After a car plunges over a dangerous cliff, killing its four teenage occupants, one of the four returns as a ghost, tormented by guilt and wishing somehow to prevent another tragedy.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=hqxhAAAACAAJ&dq=The+Ghosts+of+Departure+Point&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Opening Day at Great American Ball Park: 2003 Inaugural Season","description":"The beginning of a new age of Cincinnati Reds baseball is detailed in full-color splendor through this remarkable new book.

This English translation of the prize-winning Caminos para el azucar traces the story of railroads in Cuba from their introduction in the nineteenth century through the 1959 Revolution. More broadly, the book uses the development of the Cuban rail transport system to provide a fascinating perspective on Cuban history, particularly the story of its predominant agro-industry, sugar. While railroads facilitated the sugar industry's rapid growth after 1837, the authors argue, sugar interests determined where railroads would be built and who would benefit from them. Zanetti and Garcia explore the implications of this symbiotic relationship for the technological development of the railroads, the economic evolution of Cuba, and the lives of the railroad workers. As this work shows, the economic benefits that accompanied the rise of railroads in Europe and the United States were not repeated in Cuba. Sugar and Railroads provides a poignant demonstration of the fact that technological progress alone is far from sufficient for development.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Q504DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Electrical Wiring Residential SC","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=DeJSAAAAMAAJ&dq=Electrical+Wiring+Residential+SC&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Boeing Jetliners","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=XMMe4DIgshkC&dq=Boeing+Jetliners&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Are Souls Real?","description":"In an age dominated by science many traditional concepts are being reevaluated in light of current knowledge about the physical and biological world. Among the many religious notions passed down from generation to generation, belief in the soul may be the most in need of reconsideration. Despite its slightly antiquated nuances and its fuzziness as a coherent idea, people today still refer to the soul quite frequently We often hear such questions as: Can the soul leave the body? Does the soul survive death? And if so, do the souls of the departed occasionally appear to the living? But, given what we now know about the brain, psychology, and body chemistry, the skeptic may well ask, what meaning or relevance can this medieval term possibly have?Physicist Jerome W. Elbert takes up this intriguing issue in this informative yet accessible study. He begins by reviewing the ancient origins of the soul concept, looks at Christian beliefs and pagan parallels, and then considers how the advance of science has changed our fundamental understanding of the brain and consciousness. These new scientific insights, he points out, inevitably affect our traditional ideas about the soul. Moreover, many contemporary dilemmas have much to do with whether or not we posit the existence of a soul-for example, the question of free will and the debate over abortion. Taking into consideration the views of many recognized experts, he moves to the inescapable conclusion that we can account for the nature of life, the mind, and the human decision-making process without any need for the now obsolete idea of a soul.Insightful and absorbing, Are Souls Real? is popular science writing at its best.Jerome W. Elbert, Ph.D. (Tacoma, WA), now a self-employed researcher and writer, worked for many years as a research professor of physics at the University of Utah.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=mUwJKyMyuAIC&dq=Are+Souls+Real%3F&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Madman His Parables and Poems","description":"\\"You ask me how I became a madman.

The book examines the implementation issues that cut deep inside present day collocated engineering organizations and recommends practical and affordable actions to aid organizations seeking increased productivity through distributed operations. The demand for integrated solutions constructed from a combination of existing and newly developed software increases daily. Many organizations find themselves with shortages of the critical skills necessary to compete in many of these newly created markets. Employing virtual collaborative development provides a dramatic increase in a company's opportunities to successfully compete. Virtual collaboration provides a broader skill and product knowledge base coupled with a deeper pool of personnel to potentially employ. It removes two of the major barriers - company affiliation and physical location. Virtual Project Management: Software Solutions for Today and the Future focuses on critical characteristics underlying how work actually gets done in traditional collocated engineering environments. It examines the changes taking place on virtual projects through a series of anecdotes based on real project experiences. The book provides an 8 step practical and affordable plan that can be used as a framework in either setting up and executing a new virtual project, or in instituting improvements to a project that has drifted off course. Others have lived through the pain of learning lessons the hard way. You don't need to follow their path.

Heir to Mallarm  and the symbolists, godfather to the modernists, Paul Val ry was a poet with thousands of readers and few followers, great resonance and little echo. Along with Rilke and Eliot, he stands as a bridge between the tradition of the nineteenth century and the novelty of the twentieth. His reputation as a poet rests on three slim volumes published in a span of only ten years. Yet these poems, it turns out, are inseparable from another, much vaster intellectual and artistic enterprise: the Notebooks. Behind the published works, behind the uneventful life of the almost forgotten and then exceedingly famous poet, there hides another story, a private life of the mind, that has its record in 28,000 pages of notes revealed in their entirety only after his death. Their existence had been hinted at, evoked in rumors and literary asides; but once made public it took years for their significance to be fully appreciated. It turned out that the prose fragments published in Val ry s lifetime were not the after-the-fact musings of an accomplished poet, nor his occasional sketchbook, nor excerpts from his private journal. They were a disfigured glimpse of a vast and fragmentary  exercise of thought,  a restless intellectual quest as unguided and yet as persistent, as rigorous, and as uncontainable as the sea that is so often their subject. The Idea of Perfection shows both sides of Val ry: the craftsman of sublimely refined verse, and the fervent investigator of the limits of human intellect and expression. It intersperses his three essential poetic works Album of Early Verse, The Young Fate, and Charms with incisive selections from the Notebooks and finishes with the prose poem  The Angel.  Masterfully translated by Nathaniel Rudavsky-Brody, with careful attention to form and a natural yet metrical contemporary poetic voice, The Idea of Perfection breathes new life into poems that are among the most beautiful in the French language and the most influential of the twentieth century.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=C-80DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Angel By My Side","description":"It was 1995, and Mike Lingenfelter was ready for his life to be over. Two serious heart attacks and open-heart surgery had taken away most of the good things that he had in his life. However, his doctors still held out hope for him, and they were trying to find ways to motivate him to get out of the house and exercise. Their vision was that an energetic dog on a leash might do that for Mike. And so it was that this golden retriever named Dakota, who had been rescued from death himself, came to help Mike with his rehabilitative therapy. Eventually, Dakota became Mike s protector and his best friend, saving Mike s life several times after somehow learning how to alert Mike of oncoming heart crises. Dakota gave Mike back his dignity, his pride, and his life. Early on, it became evident to Mike that this wonderful 98-pound, red-haired, four-legged angel had a special gift: Dakota was a spirit guide, and it was Mike s duty to share him and the power of the human-animal bond. Ultimately, as part of that journey, one more miracle was needed, as Dakota fought a courageous and dignified battle for his own life.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=XSBnDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sub Duty","description":"The Model Rules of Professional Conduct provides an up-to-date resource for information on legal ethics.

Now she returns in a witty new tale of muckraking, murder, and deeply buried--and very dangerous--secrets. Louise's TV show, Gardening with Nature, has made her a celebrity, sweeping her from lawn-mower commercials all the way to the president's National Environmental Commission. Not that Louise is about to get her hands dirty in the mudslinging campaigns of an election year. As usual, her main concerns are right in her own backyard. Here, in Washington's suburban Sylvan Valley, she is subject to an unwelcome infestation of houseguests that threatens to crowd out her houseplants. Least welcome of all are three bossy busybodies in town for the Perennial Plant Society convention, who fete Louise as official \\"Plant Person of the Year\\" but press her to slash back the sweetgums and swamp oaks that give her beloved garden its pristine air. Her grin-and-bear-it mood is lightened, however, by the arrival of an old flame. Twenty years ago, in the first bloom of youth, Louise fell heavily for Jay McCormick's crooked smile and crusading charm. Now, he's an investigative journalist looking worriedly over his shoulder. Jay confides that he's come on two distinct undercover missions. One is to ensure that his ex-wife, a high-powered political lawyer, doesn't cheat on the rules for custody of their young daughter. Around the other, he raises an impenetrable thicket of secrecy. But Jay's cover is blown when he surfaces, a nibbled corpse, in a neighbor's ornamental fishpond. Who put him there? And what was the mysterious story he was investigating? Only Louise can unearth the trail that leads from a missing computer to a pistol-packing intruder trampling her purple-spotted toad lilies to evidence hidden where only a hardcore gardener could find it. Soon she's digging up enough dirt--social, marital, and political--to uproot some of Washington's top players...if she doesn't get herself nipped in the bud first. Ripening suspense, a thorny plot, and plenty of gardening tips make Death of a Political Plant a perfect bouquet of murder, mystery, and mayhem.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=gO7_i1JdwUMC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Children Of The Dream : Communal Child-Rearing and American Education","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=VMesVTlvmW0C&dq=The+Children+Of+The+Dream+:+Communal+Child-Rearing+and+American+Education&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Way Past Cool","description":"Way Past Cool was the first -- perhaps the only -- novel of urban American black life in the early 1990's: the era of collapsed structures, lost dreams, dashed hopes, agonizing violence, and a level of rage that for white America is simply unfathomable. But, have things gotten any better?Way Past Cool is the story of 13-year-old boys who live alone in abandoned buildings, of 16-year-old single mothers, and of lives that make kids old by the time they graduate from junior high... if they live that long.This novel stars Gordon, who at the age of 13, leads his gang through the deadly streets of West Oakland, California. He carries a gun, has seen more people die than a Vietnam platoon leader, and can out-swear a dozen sailors. Gordon is backed by Lyon, a fragile-looking soft-spoken boy whose forays into mysticism have given him a spirituality that belies that fact that he'll blow your head off if he has to. Gordon's gang, known as The Friends, live in a state of tense coexistence with The Crew. The tenuous peace of their neighborhood is broken by Deek, a drug dealer whose bodyguard, Ty, is trying to protect his own little brother from the street life. Deek is trying to sell guns to each gang in hope of escalating their turf rivalry into real war... for his benefit. On the sidelines sit the police. The ones who aren't actually on the take are happy to let the kids kill each other off.Throughout this story of despair, violence, and hopelessness, runs a thread of human feeling and power that prevails even over the horrific reality of the characters' lives. The connection between the members of the gang is one of mutual survival, and of kids trying to meet each other's emotional needs without \\"proper parental guidance\\" or decent societal role-models. These young boys are violent, vulgar, and perceived by most of mainstream society as a lost cause, yet there is something uniquely human about them... all children are born knowing how to love, but must be taught how to hate. In a way that many \\"kinder and gentler\\" people will never understand, they love each other, and in each other they find hope.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=URn_MAAACAAJ&dq=Way+Past+Cool&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Newcomer's Handbook for Chicago","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=mScTMa0vkhsC&dq=Newcomer%27s+Handbook+for+Chicago&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Micah-Malachi (Word Biblical Commentary, Vol. 32)","description":"The Word Biblical Commentary delivers the best in biblical scholarship, from the leading scholars of our day who share a commitment to Scripture as divine revelation.

Eco-Sonic Media brings an ecological critique to the history of sound media technologies in order to amplify the environmental undertones in sound studies and turn up the audio in discussions of greening the media. By looking at early and neglected forms of sound technology, Jacob Smith seeks to create a revisionist, ecologically aware history of sound media. Delving into the history of pre-electronic media like hand-cranked gramophones, comparatively eco-friendly media artifacts such as the shellac discs that preceded the use of petroleum-based vinyl, early forms of portable technology like divining rods, and even the use of songbirds as domestic music machines, Smith builds a scaffolding of historical case studies to demonstrate how  green media archaeology  can make sound studies vibrate at an ecological frequency while opening the ears of eco-criticism. Throughout this eye-opening and timely book he makes readers more aware of the costs and consequences of their personal media consumption by prompting comparisons with non-digital, non-electronic technologies and by offering different ways in which sound media can become eco-sonic media. In the process, he forges interdisciplinary connections, opens new avenues of research, and poses fresh theoretical questions for scholars and students of media, sound studies, and contemporary environmental history.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=c7QwDwAAQBAJ&dq=The+Treasure+Hunter%27s+Manual:+Von+Mueller+on+Buried+Treasure&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Chinese New Year For Kids","description":"In this picture book celebrating Chinese New Year, animals from the Chinese zodiac help a little girl deliver a gift to her grandmother.

This work examines the origins of this humble weapon and the 'cult of the bayonet' as espoused by the Russian General Alexander Suvorov who asserted that The bullet misses, the bayonet does not. The first bayonets appeared in France in the early 17th century and soon they were being used by every army in Europe. The author examines the spread of this simple weapon and how it led to fundamental changes being made in battlefield tactics. Over 300 years later, in the age of hi-tech warfare and weapons of mass destruction, the bayonet is still in service with armies around the world. British and US forces in Afghanistan regularly have their bayonets fixed. Fix Bayonets illustrates how tactics changed and the design of the weapon, although fundamentally the same, has evolved over the centuries.Much myth and legend surrounds the subject of bayonet charges and the weapon has become an icon of defiance and the determination to do whatever it takes to win. The author examines evidence for the reality of such actions. How did the ordinary soldier feel to be told 'fix bayonets'? John Norris draws on personal accounts of soldiers using bayonets in combat from the Napoleonic and Crimean Wars, various Colonial campaigns, through the World Wars, Falklands War and into the 21st century in Afghanistan. In so doing he explains the seemingly anachronistic survival of this simple weapon on the modern battlefield.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=jK_kCwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Concrete Mathematics A Foundation for Computer Science","description":"This book, updated and improved, introduces the mathematics that support advanced computer programming and the analysis of algorithms.

His record of 17 consecutive .300-plus seasons is a mark that will probably never be broken. He led the National League eight times in hitting, six times in slugging percentage and five times in stolen bases. Known as the Flying Dutchman, he also excelled in the field, defining the shortstop position for a generation. Though one of the original inductees in the Baseball Hall of Fame, he has often been overlooked by baseball fans and historians. A humble man whose biggest passions were hunting and fishing, the Pirate shortstop lacked the flamboyance of a Ty Cobb or Babe Ruth. He rarely smoked or drank, though sometimes he indulged in a sandlot game with the neighborhood kids. Based on contemporary newspaper accounts, family scrapbooks and correspondence, and Wagner s own vestpocket notebooks, this is the story of baseball s first superstar.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=oxCbT7PxWo0C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Howl, and other poems (The Pocket poets series, no. 4)","description":"\\"Howl\\" is a poem written by Allen Ginsberg in 1955, published as part of his 1956 collection of poetry titled \\"Howl and Other Poems.\\" Ginsberg began work on \\"Howl\\" as early as 1954. \\"Howl\\" is considered to be one of the great works of American literature.

On the surface, to listen to the present political cacophony, things have changed, but not in the way people actually think and behave in private life. Though terror and trauma are said to have gained the upper hand, desire continues to provide the propulsive force of the culture. But how do you paint desire? How do you capture its richness, power, and meaning? This monograph addresses those questions in the process of considering more than fifty major oil paintings made by the American realist Terry Rodgers between 1990 and 2005. Because most of these spectacular paintings are in the hands of private collectors, the best way to get to know them is www.terryrodgers.com, where all of the images reproduced here in black and white are available in color. Rodgers, with upcoming shows scheduled in Amsterdam and Atlanta, is in the midst of a prodigiously productive period and is on the verge of attracting the international critical notice he deserves, and will certainly soon command, owing to his irresistible subject matter, his remarkable technical accomplishment, and his brilliant overall vision of painting and culture.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=qmyO3ZAOR2cC&dq=Vectors+of+Desire:+Terry+Rodgers%27+Vision+of+the+American+Millennial+Moment&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Tasting Food, Tasting Freedom: Excursions into Eating, Power, and the Past","description":"A renowned anthropologist explores the history and meaning of eating in America.

This has been in response to the intensely competitive environment that most businesses today operate in. This book provides a framework on how companies can apply Six Sigma methodologies to where it can make the biggest difference, to drive growth. The approach outlined enables companies to focus their Six Sigma initiatives on growth by expanding its scope from continuous improvement to one of continuous innovation.

While 1984 and Animal Farm are amongst the most popular classic novels in the English language, this new series of Orwell s essays seeks to bring a wider selection of his writing on politics and literature to a new readership. In Politics and the English Language, the second in the Orwell s Essays series, Orwell takes aim at the language used in politics, which, he says,  is designed to make lies sound truthful and murder respectable, and to give an appearance of solidity to pure wind . In an age where the language used in politics is constantly under the microscope, Orwell s Politics and the English Language is just as relevant today, and gives the reader a vital understanding of the tactics at play.

The World of Dew and Other Stories, chosen by Michelle Pretorius as the 2020 Blue Light Books Prize winner, invites readers into 18 different universes that have unexpected resonances with our own modern life. While these tales are unabashedly sci-fi and fantasy, Julian Mortimer Smith approaches each at a curious angle. Ghosts are cataloged using a Pok mon Go-like app, a soldier has to get enough upvotes on social media before he is allowed to take a shot, and a golden age of cooperation begins as societies around the world prepare for a looming pandemic of blindness. In addition to featuring stories that have appeared in some of the world's top speculative fiction outlets, The World of Dew and Other Stories also includes five new stories published here for the first time. These tales are sometimes terrifying, sometimes touching, sometimes provocative, and occasionally very silly. They function both as windows through which readers can glimpse vast universes waiting to be explored and as mirrors reflecting our own reality back at us in a strange and unfamiliar light.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Xp0eEAAAQBAJ&dq=The+World+Between+and+Other+Stories&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"River of the Brokenhearted","description":"From David Adams Richards, winner of the Giller Prize and the Governor General s Award, comes a magnificent and haunting novel about the entwinement of remembered love and unforgotten hate. Spanning generations, River of the Brokenhearted tells the life and legacy of Janie McCleary, a strong-willed Irish Catholic girl who dares to marry a man from the Church of England. Their union is quickly deemed scandalous, and when her husband dies young, just before the Great Depression, Janie is left alone to raise a family and run a business the first movie theater in town. Through the strength of her character, she succeeds in a world of men. For that she is ostracized and becomes a victim of double-dealing and overt violence. Based on the author s own grandmother, Janie is a pioneer before the age of feminism, but her salty individualism burdens the lives of her children and grandchildren. Writing with compassion and mastery, Richards muses on the tyranny of memory and history, and peers into the hearts of extraordinary characters. There he finds an alchemy of venality and goodwill, deceit and brotherliness, marked cruelty and true love. Once again, David Adams Richards has brought us a work of astonishing grace, rooted in his special territory on the great river Miramichi of New Brunswick, but firmly universal in scope.

NPR We should have known the end was near. So begins Imbolo Mbue s powerful second novel, How Beautiful We Were. Set in the fictional African village of Kosawa, it tells of a people living in fear amid environmental degradation wrought by an American oil company. Pipeline spills have rendered farmlands infertile. Children are dying from drinking toxic water. Promises of cleanup and financial reparations to the villagers are made and ignored. The country s government, led by a brazen dictator, exists to serve its own interests. Left with few choices, the people of Kosawa decide to fight back. Their struggle will last for decades and come at a steep price. Told from the perspective of a generation of children and the family of a girl named Thula who grows up to become a revolutionary, How Beautiful We Were is a masterful exploration of what happens when the reckless drive for profit, coupled with the ghost of colonialism, comes up against one community s determination to hold on to its ancestral land and a young woman s willingness to sacrifice everything for the sake of her people s freedom.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=uTquDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Oprah Winfrey and the Glamour of Misery; an Essay on Popular Culture.","description":"Oprah Winfrey is the protagonist of the story to be told here, but this book has broader intentions, begins Eva Illouz in this original examination of how and why this talk show host has become a pervasive symbol in American culture. Unlike studies of talk shows that decry debased cultural standards and impoverished political consciousness, Oprah Winfrey and the Glamour of Misery asks us to rethink our perceptions of culture in general and popular culture in particular. At a time when crises of morality, beliefs, value systems, and personal worth dominate both public and private spheres, Oprah's emergence as a cultural form -- the Oprah persona -- becomes clearer, as she successfully reiterates some of our most pressing moral questions. Drawing on nearly one hundred show transcripts; a year and a half of watching the show regularly; and analysis of magazine articles, several biographies, O Magazine, Oprah Book Club novels, self-help manuals promoted on the show, and hundreds of discussions on the Oprah Winfrey Web site, Illouz takes the Oprah industry seriously, revealing it to be a multilayered \\"textual structure\\" that initiates, stages, and performs narratives of suffering and self-improvement that resonate with a wide audience and challenge traditional models of cultural analysis.

An extraordinary tapestry, Ragtime captures the spirit of America in the era between the turn of the century and the First World War. The story opens in 1906 in New Rochelle, New York, at the home of an affluent American family. One lazy Sunday afternoon, the famous escape artist Harry Houdini swerves his car into a telephone pole outside their house. And almost magically, the line between fantasy and historical fact, between real and imaginary characters, disappears. Henry Ford, Emma Goldman, J. P. Morgan, Evelyn Nesbit, Sigmund Freud, and Emiliano Zapata slip in and out of the tale, crossing paths with Doctorow's imagined family and other fictional characters, including an immigrant peddler and a ragtime musician from Harlem whose insistence on a point of justice drives him to revolutionary violence.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=-3bLQxV_tr4C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"In the Beginning...was the Command Line","description":"This is \\"the Word\\" -- one man's word, certainly -- about the art (and artifice) of the state of our computer-centric existence.

Here are some of the remarkable features of Barnes & Noble Classics: New introductions commissioned from today''s top writers and scholars Biographies of the authors Chronologies of contemporary historical, biographical, and cultural events Footnotes and endnotes Selective discussions of imitations, parodies, poems, books, plays, paintings, operas, statuary, and films inspired by the work Comments by other famous authors Study questions to challenge the reader''s viewpoints and expectations Bibliographies for further reading Indices & Glossaries, when appropriate All editions are beautifully designed and are printed to superior specifications; some include illustrations of historical interest. Barnes & Noble Classics pulls together a constellation of influences--biographical, historical, and literary--to enrich each reader''s understanding of these enduring works. George Eliot''s last, most ambitious novel, Daniel Deronda aroused scandal when it first appeared in 1876. What begins as a passionate love story takes a surprising turn into the hidden world of the early Zionist movement in Victorian England. The story opens memorably at a roulette table, where we first meet the young and idealistic Daniel Deronda and the enchanting Gwendolen Harleth--whom many critics consider to be George Eliot''s finest creation. Although the two are immediately drawn to one another, Gwendolen--outwardly alluring and vivacious, inwardly complex and unsettled--is forced by circumstance into an oppressive marriage with the harsh aristocratic Henleigh Grandcourt. Deeply unhappy, she turns for friendship to Daniel, only to discover his involvement with Mirah Lapidoth, a talented young Jewish woman. Torn between his devotion to Gwendolen and his passion for Mirah and the plight of her people, Daniel is forced to look at his own mysterious past and find out who he really is--and who he wants to become.

The entire entry on Fascism spans pages 847-884 of the Enciclopedia Italiana, and includes numerous photographs and graphic images.

A key concept of the Mussolini essay was that fascism was a rejection of previous models: \\"Granted that the 19th century was the century of socialism, liberalism, democracy, this does not mean that the 20th century must also be the century of socialism, liberalism, democracy. Political doctrines pass; nations remain. We are free to believe that this is the century of authority, a century tending to the 'right', a Fascist century.

Now Margaret Truman, daughter of President Harry Truman and an acclaimed novelist and biographer in her own right, explores the fascinating position of First Lady throughout history and up to the present day. With her unique perspective as the daughter of a First Lady, Ms. Truman reveals the truth behind some of the most misunderstood and forgotten First Ladies of our history, as well as the most famous and beloved. In recounting the charm and courage of Dolley Madison, the brazen ambition of Florence Harding, the calm, good sense of Grace Coolidge, the genius of Eleanor Roosevelt, the mysterious femininity of Jackie Kennedy, and the fierce protectiveness of Nancy Reagan, among others, Margaret Truman has assembled an honest yet affectionate portrait of our nation s First Ladies one that freely acknowledges their virtues and their flaws.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ybUjEuH8ArwC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Crystal Heat (Shadowsong)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=_gvhAAAAMAAJ&dq=Crystal+Heat+(Shadowsong)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Place Within: Portraits Of The American Landscape By 20 Contemporary Writers","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=o2TpwlBcEn8C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Laugh & Get Rich: How to Profit from Humor in Any Business","description":"Do men and women laugh at the same things?

It does so with a story that features a surprising and beguiling romance between an adventurous British trader and a young island girl, against a background of increasing and mysterious hostility. Are the native islanders plotting against the couple, or is it the other white traders? The result is a denouement that is astonishing in its violence. Told in the unadorned voice of the trader, it is a story that deftly combines the form of the exotic adventure yarn with the moral and psychological questing of great fiction.

This first volume of the trilogy, Quatre Bras, focuses on the lead-up to Waterloo itself. Two days before the main battle, an initial 8,000 Allied troops faced the 48,000 men of the French Arm e du Nord under Marshal Ney at the strategically vital crossroads of Quatre Bras. Having been tricked by Napolean who was trying to drive a wedge between the Prussians and the Anglo-allied army, Wellington concentrated his troops at Quatre Bras, hoping to link up with the Prussians. There Wellington just managed to hold off Ney's attacks. The battle ended in a tactical stalemate but, because he was unable to join with Bl cher's Prussians, Wellington retreated back along the road to Brussels to new positions at a small Belgian village called Waterloo, and thus set the stage for one of the greatest battles of all time.

While updating and clarifying the 1968 SNA, the 1993 SNA provides the basis for improving compilation of national accounts statistics, promoting integration of economic and related statistics, and enhancing analysis of economic developments. The 1993 SNA deals more clearly with relationships between economic flows (such as production, income, savings, accumulation, and financing) and links between these flows and stocks. At the same time the 1993 SNA reflects the many significant developments that have taken place in financial markets and completes the integration of balance sheets into the system. The 1993 SNA also suggests how satellite accounts (e.g. environmental accounts) and alternative classifications (e.g., through social accounting matrices) an be used to augment the central framework of the system.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ibSuSE2gaTsC&dq=System+of+National+Accounts+1993&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Zen Buddhism","description":"Daisetz Teitaro Suzuki, D.Litt., Professor of Buddhist Philosophy in the Otani University, Kyoto, was probably the greatest living authority on Buddhist philosophy, and certainly the greatest authority on Zen Buddhism.

In this comprehensive study, Michael Gomez establishes tangible links between the African American community and its African origins and traces the process by which African populations exchanged their distinct ethnic identities for one defined primarily by the conception of race. He examines transformations in the politics, social structures, and religions of slave populations through 1830, by which time the contours of a new African American identity had begun to emerge. After discussing specific ethnic groups in Africa, Gomez follows their movement to North America, where they tended to be amassed in recognizable concentrations within individual colonies (and, later, states). For this reason, he argues, it is possible to identify particular ethnic cultural influences and ensuing social formations that heretofore have been considered unrecoverable. Using sources pertaining to the African continent as well as runaway slave advertisements, ex-slave narratives, and folklore, Gomez reveals concrete and specific links between particular African populations and their North American progeny, thereby shedding new light on subsequent African American social formation.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=tfHU4mOPMmMC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"ANNE GEDDES UNTIL NOW PPB","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Mtw-AQAAIAAJ&dq=ANNE+GEDDES+UNTIL+NOW+PPB&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The African-American Guide to Real Estate Investing: $30,000 In 30 Days: The Handbook & Guide Through Your First Real Estate Deal...and Beyond","description":"A real estate investment guide written specifically for African Americans, this handbook walks readers from start to finish through the process of choosing, buying, owning, and selling real estate property for big profits.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=G4N98iL-LZEC&dq=The+African-American+Guide+to+Real+Estate+Investing:+%2430,000+In+30+Days:+The+Handbook&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"You Said A Mouthful: Great Recipes And The Stories They Evoke","description":"A book about great recipes and the stories they evoke in the tradition of Alice B.

Faced with an epidemic of profanity, our country is in need of practical suggestions for breaking a habit that has ordinary citizens contributing to the decline of civility and good manners. It's not always easy to resist the urge to cuss, but foul language creates an unfavorable image, is damaging to relationships, and goes hand-in-hand with a negative attitude. Now, James V. O'Connor-founder of the Cuss Control Academy-offers the first book to explain why we swear and how we can learn to hold our tongues. Cuss Control doesn't call for the total elimination of swearing, just for its confinement to situations where extreme emotion (think hammer, think thumb) demand it. His program for easing us off the gutter-talk highway involves alternative \\"potent phrases\\" for classic curses, including the F-word; ways to communicate clearly rather than use lazy language; and tips on adjusting our attitude and abolishing obscenities. Packed with practical exercises and tips, as well as thoughtful reflection on how we've worked ourselves up into such a state of affairs, Cuss Control is a refreshing celebration of the joys of a civil tongue. \\"O'Connor is not ready to rid the world of dirty words. He just thinks less cursing is the key to a less stressful world, and maintains that even natural-born cursers can learn to control their anger along with their language.\\" -Knight-Ridder Newspapers","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=6QlC4FOtbsMC&dq=Cuss!&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Four Revenge Tragedies: The Spanish Tragedy; The Revenger's Tragedy; The Revenge of Bussy D'Ambois; and The Atheist's Tragedy (Oxford World's Classics)","description":"The Revenge Tragedy flourished in Britain in the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries.

There was a wicked sorcery in Asia, in the economic profligacy of the early nineties, in the way financiers and businessmen took a rapidly wiring and developing continent and looted billions, like a titanic parlor trick converting all that wealth into abandoned office complexes and half-completed shopping malls. . . . I wanted it all the money, the sex, the drugs. And to this day I believe that if I am honest with myself, despite all I have learned the hard way over the past decade, I would still want it all again, the fucking and the getting loaded and the scheming to get enough money to pay for that life.  In the late 1980s, not long out of college, Karl Taro Greenfeld found himself stranded in New York, a failed writer before his career had even begun. His Jewish-American father angrily cut off support; his Japanese mother suggested he go to Japan to teach English. He did, accepting a job with no more promise than he d had before. But he stayed in Asia for the next several years, working his way through a series of journalistic posts, watching a culture erupt before his eyes and facing his own demons. Through a series of vividly imagistic stories that range from the rigidly journalistic to the deeply intimate, Standard Deviations recounts Greenfeld s experiences both professional and personal during Asia s wild ride at the end of the twentieth century. Whether drinking Japanese cough syrup to get high with other Western expatriates, visiting a free-sex ashram in Bombay, or watching a former high school pal self-destruct as an equity analyst in Jakarta, Greenfeld evokes the spirit of a continent in flux at an explosive  bubble  economy s end and a man confronting his own identity and aspirations. Raunchy, insightful, eloquent and moving, Standard Deviations is an uncompromising work of cultural observation and self-exploration.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=A4xTc6kZWpoC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Source for Autism","description":"Clinical Guide to Educational Assessment, Intervention, and Home Programming for individuals with Autism.Covers Definitions, Myths and Realities, Diagnosis, Team Coordination, Sensory and Behavioral Management, Communication and Social Intervention, Classroom Strategies, and Home Intervention.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=w39exgEACAAJ&dq=The+Source+for+Autism&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Graph Theory and Its Applications","description":"Graph Theory and Its Applications, Third Edition is the latest edition of the international, bestselling textbook for undergraduate courses in graph theory, yet it is expansive enough to be used for graduate courses as well.

A prot g  of James Naismith, the game's inventor, McLendon taught his team to play the full-court press and run a fast break that no one could catch. His Eagles would become the highest-scoring college team in America--a basketball juggernaut that shattered its opponents by as many as sixty points per game. Yet his players faced danger whenever they traveled backcountry roads. Across town, at Duke University, the best basketball squad on campus wasn't the Blue Devils, but an all-white military team from the Duke medical school. Composed of former college stars from across the country, the team dismantled everyone they faced, including the Duke varsity. They were prepared to take on anyone--until an audacious invitation arrived, one that was years ahead of anything the South had ever seen before. What happened next wasn't on anyone's schedule. Based on years of research, The Secret Game is a story of courage and determination, and of an incredible, long-buried moment in the nation's sporting past. The riveting, true account of a remarkable season, it is the story of how a group of forgotten college basketball players, aided by a pair of refugees from Nazi Germany and a group of daring student activists, not only blazed a trail for a new kind of America, but helped create one of the most meaningful moments in basketball history.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=qfd9BAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"In Retrospect","description":"This is a history of economic thought from Adam Smith to John Maynard Keynes--but it is a history with a difference.

He examinesthe deterioration of the family, the well-defined sex roles it offered, and howthis change has shifted the focus of our society. Poverty, for instance, stemsfrom the destruction of the family when unmarried parents are abandoned bytheir lovers or older women are divorced because society approves of theirhusbands' younger girlfriends.

He offers a concrete planfor rebuilding the family in America. His solutions challenge readers to returnto these roles and reestablish the family values that were once so crucial instaving off the ills that plague our country.Gilder insists that it is time to reexamine what \\"liberation\\" haswrought and at what cost.

Since Thomas Carlyle first christened him  our last Great Man,  regiments of biographers have marched across the same territory, weighing campaigns and conflicts, military tactics and power politics. Yet in all this time, no definitive portrait of Napoleon has endured, and a mere handful of women have written his biography a fact that surely would have pleased him. With Napoleon, Ruth Scurr, one of our most eloquent and original historians, emphatically rejects the shibboleth of the  Great Man  theory of history, instead following the dramatic trajectory of Napoleon s life through gardens, parks, and forests. As Scurr reveals, gardening was the first and last love of Napoleon, offering him a retreat from the manifold frustrations of war and politics. Gardens were, at the same time, a mirror image to the battlefields on which he fought, discrete settings in which terrain and weather were as important as they were in combat, but for creative rather than destructive purposes. Drawing on a wealth of contemporary and historical scholarship, and taking us from his early days at the military school in Brienne-le-Chateau through his canny seizure of power and eventual exile, Napoleon frames the general s story through the green spaces he cultivated. Amid Corsican olive groves, ornate menageries in Paris, and lone garden plots on the island of Saint Helena, Scurr introduces a diverse cast of scientists, architects, family members, and gardeners, all of whom stood in the shadows of Napoleon s meteoric rise and fall. Building a cumulative panorama, she offers indelible portraits of Augustin Bon Joseph de Robespierre, the younger brother of Maximilien Robespierre, who used his position to advance Napoleon s career; Marianne Peusol, the fourteen-year-old girl manipulated into a Christmas-Eve assassination attempt on Napoleon that resulted in her death; and Emmanuel, comte de Las Cases, the atlas maker to whom Napoleon dictated his memoirs. As Scurr contends, Napoleon s dealings with these people offer unusual and unguarded opportunities to see how he grafted a new empire onto the remnants of the ancien r gime and the French Revolution. Epic in scale and novelistic in its detail, Napoleon, with stunning illustrations, is a work of revelatory range and depth, revealing the contours of the general s personality and power as no conventional biography can.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=gwsDEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Raffles","description":"One of the most revered names in luxury hospitality takes readers on an exhilarating journey throughout its world of timelessly sophisticated hotels.

This book is an in-depth historical survey of the Indians of the United States, including the Eskimos and Aleuts of Alaska, which isolates and analyzes the problems which have beset these people since their first contacts with Europeans. Only in the light of this knowledge, the author points out, can an intelligent Indian policy be formulated. In the book are described the first meetings of Indians with explorers, the dispossession of the Indians by colonial expansion, their involvement in imperial rivalries, their beginning relations with the new American republic, and the ensuing century of war and encroachment. The most recent aspects of government Indian policy are also detailed the good and bad administrative practices and measures to which the Indians have been subjected and their present situation. Miss Debo's style is objective, and throughout the book the distinct social environment of the Indians is emphasized an environment that is foreign to the experience of most white men. Through ignorance of that culture and life style the results of non-Indian policy toward Indians have been centuries of blundering and tragedy. In response to Indian history, an enlightened policy must be formulated: protection of Indian land, vocational and educational training, voluntary relocation, encouragement of tribal organization, recognition of Indians' social groupings, and reliance on Indians' abilities to direct their own lives. The result of this new policy would be a chance for Indians to live now, whether on their own land or as adjusted members of white society. Indian history is usually highly specialized and is never recorded in books of general history. This book unifies the many specialized volumes which have been written about their history and culture. It has been written not only for persons who work with Indians or for students of Indian culture, but for all Americans of good will.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=YWH9e5ieEHEC&dq=History+of+the+Indians+of+the+United+States&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Littles","description":"There is a new Little on the way.

Accordingly, in Milton and the Hermeneutic Journey, Gale H. Carrithers, Jr., and James D. Hardy, Jr., do not seek to provide a last word in the reading of Milton but instead employ a Miltonic method that renounces closure and the pretense of a monopoly on truth. Their aim in this cross-disciplinary work is to suggest a general interpretive matrix that embraces most of Milton's poetic corpus in a coherent rather than exhaustive vision. In the most comprehensive reading of Milton in over a decade, Carrithers and Hardy proceed on three assumptions: that love, in all its various and contradictory forms, is of central importance in Milton's poetry; that much of Milton's poetry is a discourse in theology, primarily Augustinian and biblically based; and that theirs will be a hermeneutic analysis of a hermeneutic text. Both Miltonists and scholars from the humanities in general will find satisfaction in reconsidering Milton from this different perspective. And for those readers who sense a profound disorder in the modern world, Carrithers and Hardy suggest that the greatest critic of the myth of power can offer reflections still enhancing to life, as well as strategies for critically reading any text that would make extreme claims upon us.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=RmuBQgAACAAJ&dq=Milton+and+the+Hermeneutic+Journey&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Old mining towns and old bottles","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=imPuGAAACAAJ&dq=Old+mining+towns+and+old+bottles&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"In the Craftsman Style (In The Style)","description":"Founded by William Morris in 1875 as a reaction against Victorian vulgarity, arts & crafts is still a popular style.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=W2Q8Bm3RpIMC&dq=In+the+Craftsman+Style+(In+The+Style)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"JFK resources: A compilation of the books and videos relating to the life and assassination of President John F.

For decades, Western psychology has promised fulfillment through building and strengthening the ego. We are taught that the ideal is a strong, individuated self, constructed and reinforced over a lifetime. But Buddhist psychiatrist Mark Epstein has found a different way. Going to Pieces Without Falling Apart shows us that happiness doesn't come from any kind of acquisitiveness, be it material or psychological. Happiness comes from letting go. Weaving together the accumulated wisdom of his two worlds--Buddhism and Western psychotherapy Epstein shows how \\"the happiness that we seek depends on our ability to balance the ego's need to do with our inherent capacity to be.\\" He encourages us to relax the ever-vigilant mind in order to experience the freedom that comes only from relinquishing control. Drawing on events in his own life and stories from his patients, Going to Pieces Without Falling Apart teaches us that only by letting go can we start on the path to a more peaceful and spiritually satisfying life.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=wCy7IV-HsXoC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Teach Me Italian (Paperback and Audio CD): A Musical Journey Through the Day","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=oI8RAQAAMAAJ&dq=Teach+Me+Italian+(Paperback+and+Audio+CD):+A+Musical+Journey+Through+the+Day&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Truly Grim Tales","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Cases, Text and Problems on Federal Income Taxation (American Casebook Series)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=-g4qPwAACAAJ&dq=Cases,+Text+and+Problems+on+Federal+Income+Taxation+(American+Casebook+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Gurdjieffian Confessions: A self remembered","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=pkR_AAAACAAJ&dq=Gurdjieffian+Confessions:+A+self+remembered&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sampler supreme: Showcase quilt for the six-inch pieced block","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=npXntwAACAAJ&dq=Sampler+supreme:+Showcase+quilt+for+the+six-inch+pieced+block&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Cuddlers","description":"Adorable illustrations and a poem that begs to be read aloud pair to make the perfect book about cuddles and all the joy they bring.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Oi7SDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Moon of Wisdom: Chapter Six of Chandrakirti's Entering the Middle Way with Commentary from the Eighth Karmapa Mikyo Dorje's Kagyu Siddhas","description":"The Yogini s Eye: Comprehensive Introduction to Buddhist Tantra, Volume I: Systemization and Interpretation introduces a new translation series, Classics of the Early Sakya, which will focus on the extensive literature of the Sakya Lamdre lineage of the Hevajra Tantra cycle of revelation.

The father figure is Leonard, the high-living, recovering coke addict \\"West Coast Director of a large Italian-American finance firm\\" (read: mobster) who helped to keep James Frey clean in A Million Little Pieces. The son is, of course, James, damaged perhaps beyond repair by years of crack and alcohol addiction-and by more than a few cruel tricks of fate. James embarks on his post-rehab existence in Chicago emotionally devastated, broke, and afraid to get close to other people. But then Leonard comes back into his life, and everything changes. Leonard offers his \\"son\\" lucrative if illegal and slightly dangerous employment. He teaches James to enjoy life, sober, for the first time. He instructs him in the art of \\"living boldly,\\" pushes him to pursue his passion for writing, and provides a watchful and supportive veil of protection under which James can get his life together. Both Leonard's and James's careers flourish but then Leonard vanishes. When the reasons behind his mysterious absence are revealed, the book opens up in unexpected emotional ways. My Friend Leonard showcases a brilliant and energetic young writer rising to important new challenges displaying surprising warmth, humor, and maturity without losing his intensity.

Beloved and hated, venerated and reviled, Andrew Jackson was an orphan who fought his way to the pinnacle of power, bending the nation to his will in the cause of democracy. Jackson s election in 1828 ushered in a new and lasting era in which the people, not distant elites, were the guiding force in American politics. Democracy made its stand in the Jackson years, and he gave voice to the hopes and the fears of a restless, changing nation facing challenging times at home and threats abroad. To tell the saga of Jackson s presidency, acclaimed author Jon Meacham goes inside the Jackson White House. Drawing on newly discovered family letters and papers, he details the human dramathe family, the women, and the inner circle of advisers that shaped Jackson s private world through years of storm and victory. One of our most significant yet dimly recalled presidents, Jackson was a battle-hardened warrior, the founder of the Democratic Party, and the architect of the presidency as we know it. His story is one of violence, sex, courage, and tragedy. With his powerful persona, his evident bravery, and his mystical connection to the people, Jackson moved the White House from the periphery of government to the center of national action, articulating a vision of change that challenged entrenched interests to heed the popular will or face his formidable wrath. The greatest of the presidents who have followed Jackson in the White Housefrom Lincoln to Theodore Roosevelt to FDR to Trumanhave found inspiration in his example, and virtue in his vision. Jackson was the most contradictory of men. The architect of the removal of Indians from their native lands, he was warmly sentimental and risked everything to give more power to ordinary citizens. He was, in short, a lot like his country: alternately kind and vicious, brilliant and blind; and a man who fought a lifelong war to keep the republic safeno matter what it took.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Ru6O7-Pc_NMC&dq=Andrew+Jackson+and+the+Search+for+Vindication+(Library+of+American+Biography+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sexual Life In Ancient Egypt","description":"First published in 2004.

He is a man on a mission who believes that taking on the powers that be involves more than just talking about it it also means taking action. From car safety in the 1960s to opposition to the World Trade Organization in the 1990s, Nader s work has increased government responsiveness to citizens, served as a check against the abuse of power by big business, and shaped the political consciousness of a nation. Nader s sense of mission is infused in all of his work, especially his weekly columns. In Pursuit of Justice, a collection of Nader s most recent, trenchant articles written in the years immediately following the publication of The Ralph Nader Reader, Nader addresses a broad array of issues, among them: corporate crime and power, government accountability, media control, consumer rights, healthcare, congressional reform, nuclear power and energy, racial discrimination, poverty, food and drug safety, air and water pollution, fair taxation, product liability protection, union democracy, living family wage, unfair lending practices, community radio, industrial hemp, banking, pension law, telecommunications and the importance of character. Nader has even sponsored consumer initiatives to reform university governance, educational testing, daily newspapers, women's health care, legal services, and professional sports all of which are reflected in these sharp and sometimes humorous essays. As informative as it is pleasurable to read, section after section of In Pursuit of Justice slices through government and corporate propaganda and reveals the corruption, bias and injustice that all too often connect politics with big business, thereby impeding the pursuit of justice. Collecting more than one hundred of his most recent writings, In Pursuit of Justice conveys Nader's inimitable sense of both the global political economy and our nation's democratic promise.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=z4FM7sbI9qAC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"London Bus & Underground Popout Map: Double Map: Special Edition","description":"Today's London Buses, covers the London bus scene of the last ten years, including pictures of bus types used in the capital on its major services.

Its masterfully organized chapters detail, summarize, and evaluate every important strategy and campaign. Cajus Bekker has drawn on official German archives and collections, the combat journals and personal papers of leading officers, and the collated Luftwaffe war diaries, none of which have been published outside Germany, as well as interviews with hundreds of former German airmen.The result is a critical examination of the Luftwaffe's development and command against the vivid background of World War II's greatest air battles. While the author does full justice to the performance of German airmen, he does not embellish it. Thus his chronicle of the deadly struggle of these men is anything but a heroic saga; the exploits of the other side are treated with equal justice. Heroes and villains are not described or eulogized here only men fighting a war that most of them did not want. With over 100 photographs, numerous maps, and a complete index of personalities, The Luftwaffe War Diaries brings into stunning focus for now and all time the ironic triumph and inevitable tragedy of war.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=6sOPswEACAAJ&dq=The+Luftwaffe+War+Diaries&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Journey Of The Mask","description":"In The Phantom Of The Opera, Leroux gave us the tragic story of a lonely, disfigured man who was hopelessly drawn to a woman he could never have.

This volume contains the works of the two earliest surviving orators, Antiphon and Andocides. Antiphon (ca. 480-411) was a leading Athenian intellectual and creator of the profession of logography (\\"speech writing\\"), whose special interest was law and justice. His six surviving works all concern homicide cases. Andocides (ca. 440-390) was involved in two religious scandals the mutilation of the Herms (busts of Hermes) and the revelation of the Eleusinian Mysteries on the eve of the fateful Athenian expedition to Sicily in 415.

He has also appeared in numerous independent films and made his New York Stage debut in the acclaimed MCC production of Small Engine Repair. Keegan was given his first camera at age nine, and began a lifelong study and pursuit of photography. life.love.beauty is a selection of photographs taken since his childhood. It's a photo journey through the life of an intensely creative soul whose expression finds various forms: in acting, in poems and stories, lyrics and music, but above all in photography. This book's content resonates in the commonality we all share on our own journeys while unveiling an inside look into a world that very few experience. Organized into three broad groups life, love, and beauty the book ranges over the public and private side of Keegan Allen and his world. A child of Hollywood, whose father was also an actor and his mother a painter, Keegan roams freely through that realm, photographing his fellow actors on set, behind the scenes; and recording the amazed, gleeful, sometimes weeping fans that flock to his television and career related events. Allen also has an eye for the anonymous and the unexpected: the woman gazing dreamily from the balcony of a run-down hotel; the rifle-toting dog walker who seems to have emerged from the 19th century; the performers and denizens of Venice Beach and also the streets of New York, some of them chasing the dream of fame, others having long-since abandoned it; the little boy amid in the crowd in an enormous airport; portraits of lovers kissing on subways, in parks, and on the streets. Traveling from California to New York to Paris and back, as well as through the American west, he finds beauty in both urban and rural places: from large-scale landscapes to glimpses of light transforming what it touches. Keegan's poems, stories, captions and musings, song lyrics, and journal pages complement the photographs on this journey. He provides an account of growing up just off the Sunset Strip, coming into his own as an actor/artist, dealing with public recognition while maintaining a very private life, falling in and out of love, and acknowledging the influence of his family, friends, fans, and loved ones. life.love.beauty is an unusually intimate and revealing book: a delight for anyone who values photography, and a gift for the many fans who already follow Keegan's career. Keegan's real passion comes through in both his photographs and candid story telling in this unique photo-journal.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=RgQ3BAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Understanding the War in Kosovo","description":"The war in Kosovo has been a defining moment in post-Cold War Europe. Kosovo has great importance beyond the Balkans as the most ambitious attempt of the international community to prevent internal conflicts and rebuild a society destroyed by war and ethnic cleansing. As the danger of ethnic conflict prevails in the region and elsewhere around the world, the experience of Kosovo offers important lessons. This is a comprehensive survey of developments in Kosovo leading up to, during and after the war in 1999, providing additionally the international and regional framework to the conflict. It examines the underlying causes of the war, the attempts by the international community to intervene, and the war itself in spring 1999. It critically examines the international administration in Kosovo since June 1999 and contextualizes it within the relations of Kosovo to its neighbours and as part of the larger European strategy in Southeastern Europe with the stability pact. It does not seek to promote one interpretation of the conflict and its aftermath, but brings together a range of intellectual arguments from some sixteen researchers from the Balkans, the rest of Europe and North America.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=6OiQAgAAQBAJ&dq=Understanding+the+War+in+Kosovo&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Datsun Service Repair Handbook 240z Sports Car - Through 1972","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Uv74GAAACAAJ&dq=Datsun+Service+Repair+Handbook+240z+Sports+Car+-+Through+1972&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Advanced Beadwork","description":"Organizes all major beading techniques into one comprehensive volume, removing the mystery and inspiring creativity.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=8lGF38qlpoEC&dq=Advanced+Beadwork&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Studies in the Religious Tradition of the Old Testament","description":"These important papers by a distinguished British Old Testament theologian, many of them previously inaccessible, focus on the theme of continuity and, within that, on the development of prophecy in the Old Testament period.

Arguing that theories of temporality have significant and underappreciated relevance to the social dimensions of science and the political dimensions of struggle, Grosz engages key theoretical concerns related to the reality of time. She explores the effect of time on the organization of matter and on the emergence and development of biological life. Considering how the relentless forward movement of time might be conceived in political and social terms, she begins to formulate a model of time that incorporates the future and its capacity to supersede and transform the past and present. Grosz develops her argument by juxtaposing the work of three major figures in Western thought: Charles Darwin, Friedrich Nietzsche, and Henri Bergson. She reveals that in theorizing time as an active, positive phenomenon with its own characteristics and specific effects, each of these thinkers had a profound effect on contemporary understandings of the body in relation to time. She shows how their allied concepts of life, evolution, and becoming are manifest in the work of Gilles Deleuze and Luce Irigaray. Throughout The Nick of Time, Grosz emphasizes the political and cultural imperative to fundamentally rethink time: the more clearly we understand our temporal location as beings straddling the past and the future without the security of a stable and abiding present, the more transformation becomes conceivable.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=feR5UWpCA5cC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Rational Unified Process Made Easy A Practitioner's Guide to the Rup","description":"The authors explain the underlying software development principles behind theRUP, and guide readers in its application in their organization.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=7FSf5661dfMC&dq=The+Rational+Unified+Process+Made+Easy+A+Practitioner%27s+Guide+to+the+Rup&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Software Inspection","description":"The Holy Grail is zero-defect software, and the techniques presented here help software developers get nearer that goal.

Lamoureux proposes an approach to origins that moves beyond the evolution-versus-creation debate. Arguing for an intimate relationship between the Book of God's Words and the Book of God's Works, he presents evolutionary creation--a position that asserts that the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit created the universe and life through an ordained and sustained evolutionary process. This view of origins affirms intelligent design and the belief that beauty, complexity, and functionality in nature reflect the mind of God. Lamoureux also challenges the popular Christian assumption that the Holy Spirit revealed scientific and historical facts in the opening chapters of the Bible. He contends that Scripture features an ancient understanding of origins that functions as a vessel to deliver inerrant and infallible messages of faith. Lamoureux shares his personal story and his struggle in coming to terms with evolution and Christianity. Like many, he lost his boyhood faith at university in classes on evolutionary biology. After graduation, he experienced a born-again conversion and then embraced belief in a literal six-day creation.

From the 1910s through the  50s, from Yale pep rallies through the Broadway triumphs of Anything Goes and Kiss Me, Kate, he delighted audiences with a glittering torrent of song:  I Get a Kick Out of You.   Night and Day,   Love for Sale,  and  Just One of Those Things.  The bright surface of these gems their catchy melodies and ingenious lyrics made them instant pop hits. Their more subtle qualities and their musical and emotional depth have made them lasting standards, among the greatest glories of the American songbook. In Cole Porter, William McBrien has thoroughly captured the creator of these songs, whose life was one not only of wealth and privilege but also of tragedy, secrecy, and courage. A prodigal young man, Porter found his aesthetic and emotional anchor in a long, loving, if sexless marriage, while continuing to maintain many discreet affairs with men. In 1937, at the height of his success, he suffered a near-fatal riding accident; his last eighteen years were marked by pain, drugs, and repeated operations on his legs, years of physical agony but unstinting artistic achievement. Here is the book that Porter s fans have long hoped for a life that informs the great music and lyrics though illuminating glimpses of the hidden, complicated, private man.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=c_626l6Hj_4C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Realms of Tolkien: Images of Middle-earth","description":"Twenty new and familiar Tolkien artists are represented in this fabulous volume, breathing an extraordinary variety of life into 58 different scenes, each of which is accompanied by appropriate passage from The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings and The Silmarillion","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=6lNmPwAACAAJ&dq=Realms+of+Tolkien:+Images+of+Middle-earth&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Seeking Miss Scarlet (Flipside)","description":"Seeking Miss Scarlet by Natalie Stenzel released on Apr 12, 2005 is available now for purchase.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=hDOHva4sL3wC&dq=Seeking+Miss+Scarlet+(Flipside)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Searching for the Light: Essays on Thought and Culture","description":"Collected here for the first time are a number of important essays that Birnbaum has written over the last twenty years, ranging from such compelling topics as sociology to post-Marxism to education. Two questions inspire these essays. If thinkers are prisoners of their political contexts, how can thought apprehend historical movement? Can moral imagination alter social constraints? Birnbaum sees sociology as historical and philosophical commentary, shaped by politics. In close and subtle examinations of the Marxist legacy, he makes innovative analytical moves and turns Marxism upon itself. His investigation includes an essay on the Marxist theory of religion proving that it is a major contribution to the debate on society and spirituality. An inquiry into the antithesis of Marxism and psychoanalysis asks if any project of human self-transformation is still plausible. In an essay dated 1984, he anticipates the collapse of the Communist regimes and new conflicts in the West. In a stringent article written after the sixties, but which speaks to the nineties, he considers the technocratic servitude of the liberal university. Finally, he describes the contradictory advice offered to President Mitterand when he convened the world's intellectual vanguard in Paris in 1983. Birnbaum concludes, half in melancholy and half in hope, that intellectual inquiry's critical tasks are unending.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=r9-vWjdNXLQC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A book in every home: Containing three subjects : Ed's Sweet Sixteen, domestic and political views","description":"Edward Leedskalnin (1887-1951) was an eccentric Latvian emigrant to the United States and amateur sculptor who, it is alleged, single-handedly built the monument known as Coral Castle in Florida. He was also known for his unusual theories on magnetism. His first and longest booklet, \\"A Book in Every Home,\\" a treatise on moral education, was printed on only the left-hand pages, and began with the following preface: \\"Reader, if for any reason you do not like the things I say in the little book, I left just as much space as I used, so you can write your own opinion opposite it and see if you can do better.\\" In the first section, Leedskalnin vents his anger at his \\"Sweet Sixteen,\\" arguing that girls should be kept pure, and that boys are primarily a soiling influence upon them. The second section continues along the theme of moral education, with several aphorisms aimed at parents regarding the proper way to raise children. The last, \\"Political\\" section, reveals that the reclusive Leedskalnin had strong political views. He advocates voting for property owners only (and in proportion to their holdings), and argues that \\"Anyone who is too weak to make his own living is not strong enough to vote.\\" Some writers have suggested that Leedskalnin's booklet contains further information on his electromagnetic research and philosophies encoded in its pages, and the blank pages are provided for the reader to fill in their decrypted solutions. It has also been suggested that Leedskalnin's frequent referral to his \\"Sweet Sixteen\\" may in fact refer to the numerological and/or scientific relevance of the number sixteen to his research and theories.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=_gV0LgEACAAJ&dq=A+book+in+every+home:+Containing+three+subjects+:+Ed%27s+Sweet+Sixteen,+domestic+and+political+views&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"How To Deal With Violence Before It Happens, Vol. 4","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=YIozAgwOHIkC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Leyendas","description":"Spain's great 19th-century lyric poet is best known for these two works: Rhymes, a suite of 66 melancholy poems, and the 6 tales of Legends, romantic portrayals of everyday events.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=qcYsAwAAQBAJ&dq=Leyendas&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Time to Heal","description":"A leading authority in the history of medicine provides an insightful look at medical education in America since 1910, warning of the negative impact of managed care on medical schools and the practice of medicine. 10 line illustrations.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=l5k6DwAAQBAJ&dq=Time+to+Heal&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Listen for Rachel","description":"From the bestselling author of @Middle School Blues^ comes an evocative book based on Appalachian mountain legends--the coming-of-age story of a girl who finds her loyalties divided by the Civil War.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=aqi0T6DzowoC&dq=Listen+for+Rachel&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Body Magnetic & Getting Started in Magnetic Healing","description":"Shows how magnetic forces help the body heal itself by stimulating its biochemistry.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=_UcGAAAACAAJ&dq=The+Body+Magnetic&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Pharmacology Primer: Theory, Application and Methods","description":"The Second Edition will continue this tradition of better preparing researchers in the basics of pharmacology.

The peculiar arrangement of the psychoanalyst's office for an analytic session seems inexplicable. The analyst sits in a chair out of sight while the patient lies on a couch facing away. It has been this way since Freud, although, as Nathan Kravis points out in On the Couch, this practice is grounded more in the cultural history of reclining posture than in empirical research. Kravis, himself a practicing psychoanalyst, shows that the tradition of recumbent speech wasn't dreamed up by Freud but can be traced back to ancient Greece, where guests reclined on couches at the symposion (a gathering for upper-class males to discuss philosophy and drink wine), and to the Roman convivium (a banquet at which men and women reclined together). From bed to bench to settee to chaise-longue to sofa: Kravis tells how the couch became an icon of self-knowledge and self-reflection as well as a site for pleasure, privacy, transgression, and healing. Kravis draws on sources that range from ancient funerary monuments to furniture history to early photography, as well as histories of medicine, fashion, and interior decoration, and he deploys an astonishing array of images of paintings, monuments, sculpture, photographs, illustrations, New Yorker cartoons, and advertisements. Kravis deftly shows that, despite the ambivalence of today's psychoanalysts some of whom regard it as  infantilizing  the couch continues to be the emblem of a narrative of self-discovery. Recumbent speech represents the affirmation in the presence of another of having a mind of one's own.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=_6FNEAAAQBAJ&dq=On+the+Couch&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Andrea Doria: Dive to an Era","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=688PAQAAIAAJ&dq=Andrea+Doria:+Dive+to+an+Era&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"SOLID PHASE MICROEXTRACTION","description":"The relatively new technique of solid phase microextraction (SPME) is an important tool to prepare samples both in the lab and on-site.

This intra-left debate was in part doctrinal, in part generational. But further woven into this split were sometimes agonizing questions of identity. Jews were disproportionately well-represented in the Movement, and their personal and communal lives could deeply affect their stances vis- -vis the Middle East. The Movement and the Middle East offers the first assessment of the controversial and ultimately debilitating role of the Arab-Israeli conflict among left-wing activists during a turbulent period of American history. Michael R. Fischbach draws on a deep well of original sources from personal interviews to declassified FBI and CIA documents to present a story of the left-wing responses to the question of Palestine and Israel. He shows how, as the 1970s wore on, the cleavages emerging within the American Left widened, weakening the Movement and leaving a lasting impact that still affects progressive American politics today.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=vkS8DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Little Flowers of St. Francis of Assisi","description":"A new introduction by Madeleine L'Engle highlights this inspirational volume, which combines the story of St. Francis of Assisi and his adoption of a life of poverty and humility, with accounts of miracles attributed to the saint.

Focusing on the porkpacking industry in Iowa, Fink investigates the experience of the rural working class and highlights its significance in shaping the state's economic, political, and social contours. Fink draws both on interviews and on her own firsthand experience working on the production floor of a pork-processing plant. She weaves a fascinating account of the meatpacking industry's history in Iowa--a history, she notes, that has been experienced differently by male and female, immigrant and native-born, white and black workers. Indeed, argues Fink, these differences are a key factor in the ongoing creation of the rural working class. Other writers have denounced the new meatpacking companies for their ruthless destruction of both workers and communities. Fink sustains this criticism, which she augments with a discussion of union action, but also goes beyond it. She looks within rural midwestern culture itself to examine the class, gender, and ethnic contradictions that allowed--indeed welcomed--the meatpacking industry's development.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=BkcMCgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"E-CONOMICS: Strategies for the Digital Marketplace (European Communication Council Report)","description":"E-conomics provides readers with a roadmap to the landscape of the new Internet economy and serves as a reference to the economics of the information age.

Mr. Hoover shows the day-to-day operations of the Communist Party, USA: who the communists are, what they claim, why people become communists and why some break away. He describes life within the Party, communist strategy and tactics, methods of mass agitation and underground infiltration, espionage, sabotage, and its treatment of minorities. The picture of what life in this country would be under communism (toward which thousands of misguided Americans actually are working now!) is vivid and shocking. The forceful, driving message of this book is clarified with many incidents and anecdotes, definitions of communist terms, key dates, and a list of international communist organizations and publications which illustrate the communist Trojan horse in action. And it concretely outlines just what you can do now to combat the evils of the \\"false religion\\" of communism, so that you can stay free. MASTERS OF DECEIT is one of the most important books of our time--a warning of the clear and present danger to our way of life.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=DeJbuwEACAAJ&dq=Masters+of+deceit%3B:+The+story+of+communism+in+America+and+how+to+fight+it&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"As you tithe, so you prosper: A series of four lessons in tithing","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Z8clAQAAMAAJ&dq=As+you+tithe,+so+you+prosper:+A+series+of+four+lessons+in+tithing&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Helping Gay and Lesbian Youth: New Policies, New Programs, New Practice","description":"This pioneering book brings together for the first time the most up-to-date information and thought on gay and lesbian youth in America.

Representing a giant step forward from the conventional colour-themed border, this new approach to gardening gives just as much emphasis to form, texture, light and movement as it does to colour. Individual plants are used as harmonious elements in luxuriant and atmospheric plantings. Written in collaboration with No?l Kingsbury, Designing with Plants is an informative and visually breathtaking study of Piet Oudolf's planting theory and practice, and it provides all the advice necessary to create the same effects in your own garden.Beginning with the building blocks of planting design, a visual sourcebook of Planting Palettes illustrates some of the huge choice available in terms of form, texture and colour. The following chapter explains, with the use of planting plans and diagrams, how to combine these basic elements to create stunning and sculptural planting schemes. Theory is put into practice in Planting Moods in which stunning photography demonstrates how to create a particular feeling or atmosphere, and Year-Round Planting emphasizes the importance of choosing plants to give value throughout the seasons so that they contribute to the garden in death as well as in life. Rounding off with a detailed directory of key plants, Designing with Plants is destined to become an inspiration to all gardeners who wish to create, in Piet's words, 'an impression and an expression of nature'.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=oxpbPwAACAAJ&dq=Fireside+Book+1998+Firm+Sale+(Annuals)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Still Pitying The Fool: Why Scientists Are Frauds-The Truth About Our World","description":"Everything you ever learned about space, time and physics is WRONG.

G. Wells - Love and Mr Lewisham is a 1900 novel set in the 1880s by H. G. Wells. It was among his first fictional writings outside the science fiction genre. Wells took considerable pains over the manuscript and said that the writing was an altogether more serious undertaking than I have ever done before. He later included it in a 1933 anthology, Stories of Men and Women in Love.Events in the novel closely resemble events in Wells's own life. According to Geoffrey H. Wells: \\"referring to the question of autobiography in fiction, H. G. Wells has somewhere made a remark to the effect that it is not so much what one has done that counts, as where one has been, and the truth of that statement is particularly evident in this novel Both Mr Lewisham and Mr Wells were at the age of eighteen, assistant masters at country schools, and that three years later both were commencing their third year at The Normal School of Science, South Kensington, as teachers in training under Thomas Henry Huxley. The account of the school, of the students there and of their social life and interests, may be taken as true descriptions of those things during the period 1883-1886.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=AgBMEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Venus Observed","description":"THE STORY: As told briefly by Watts of the New York Post : The story is about the aging Duke of Altair, lover of astronomy and women, [who] brings three of his ex-mistresses to his home with the intention of marrying one of them, but falls i","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=d1MabGkQ96oC&dq=Venus+Observed&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Official Map of The X-Files","description":"Follow Mulder and Scully to Reagan, Tennessee as they uncover the secret behind a UFO hidden by the government in E.B.E.

Economy and Society in Seventeenth-Century Springfield.","description":"Stephen Innes studies the relationship between work, land, and community in seventeenth-century Springfield, Massachusetts. Using analytical concepts drawn from anthropology--dependence, mediation, and clientage--he shows that the town was a highly commercialized, developmental community contrasting sharply with the communal, quietistic models that currently form our image of early New England.

Who, then, was responsible for producing such an enterprise? Did it aim to inform or did it have darker political motivations? Did the authors, who alone had access to records that were to remain classified for decades to come, seek to lay the facts and lessons of the war truthfully before the public? A number of critics have claimed that, on the contrary, the Official Histories were highly partial accounts written to protect reputations and cover up the true scale of British military incompetence. Andrew Green directly challenges these views, examining the progress by which official history was written, the motives and influences of its paymasters, and the literary integrity of its historians. The book focuses on four offical volumes covering arguably the most contentious battles of the war: Gallipoli, the Somme, Third Ypres (Passchendaele) and March 1918. What emerges from this is both a story of these great campaigns and an insight into the political intrigues and conflicting constraints that influenced the official writing of the Great War.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=xaEYcuaMCdYC&dq=Writing+the+Great+War:+Sir+James+Edmonds+and+the+Official+Histories,+1915-1948+(Military+History+and+Policy)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Self Hypnosis: Easy Ways to Hypnotize Your Problems Away","description":"Self-Hypnosis shows you how to make your own recordings to reprogram your subconscious and attain your goals.

Schweitzer analyze the lies, misperceptions, and myths about Jews and Judaism that anti-semites have propagated throughout the centuries. Beginning with antiquity, and continuing into the present day, the authors explore the irrational fabrications that have led to numerous acts of violence and hatred against Jews. The book examines ancient and medieval myths central to the history of anti-semitism: Jews as 'Christ-killers', instruments of Satan, and ritual murderers of Christian children. It also explores the scapegoating of Jews in the modern world as conspirators bent on world domination; extortionists who manufactured the Holocaust as a hoax designed to gain reparation payments from Germany; and the leaders of the slave trade that put Africa in chains. No other book has focused its attention exclusively on a thematic discussion of historic and contemporary anti-semitic myths, covering such an expansive scope of time, and allowing for such a painstaking level of exemplification. Anti-semitism is an essential book that will serve as a corrective to bigotry, stereotype, and historical distortion.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=VsTtCwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Ebony Tower","description":"The Ebony Tower, comprising a novella, three stories, and a translation of a medieval French tale, echoes themes from John Fowles's internationally celebrated novels as it probes the fitful relations between love and hate, pleasure and pain, fantasy and reality.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=I6gS5BIAZbIC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"French Alps","description":"A new compendium of adventures, from the best-selling and award-winning Wild Guide series now released for Europe's favourite adventure holiday destination - including 800 secret places.

The result, according to the experts, is an ignorant public, helpless targets of a one-way flow of carefully filtered and orchestrated communication. Common Knowledge shatters this pervasive myth. Reporting on a ground-breaking study, the authors reveal that our shared knowledge and evolving political beliefs are determined largely by how we actively reinterpret the images, fragments, and signals we find in the mass media. For their study, the authors analyzed coverage of 150 television and newspaper stories on five prominent issues drugs, AIDS, South African apartheid, the Strategic Defense Initiative, and the stock market crash of October 1987. They tested audience responses of more than 1,600 people, and conducted in-depth interviews with a select sample. What emerges is a surprisingly complex picture of people actively and critically interpreting the news, making sense of even the most abstract issues in terms of their own lives, and finding political meaning in a sophisticated interplay of message, medium, and firsthand experience. At every turn, Common Knowledge refutes conventional wisdom. It shows that television is far more effective at raising the saliency of issues and promoting learning than is generally assumed; it also undermines the assumed causal connection between newspaper reading and higher levels of political knowledge. Finally, this book gives a deeply responsible and thoroughly fascinating account of how the news is conveyed to us, and how we in turn convey it to others, making meaning of at once so much and so little. For anyone who makes the news or tries to make anything of it Common Knowledge promises uncommon wisdom.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=HIx1ZHSjE48C&dq=COMMON+KNOWLEDGE.&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"How Can You Dance","description":"Get ready to bop, bounce, and shake with this board book edition ofthe hit picture book from the acclaimed author of Alfie and Fraidyzoo There are so many ways to dance!

In 2001 he completely revised and reworked this hugely acclaimed book, adding new sections, substantially reworking text, and bringing the story up-to-date with Dylan's explosive career in 2000. Bob Dylan: Behind the Shades Revisited follows the story of Dylan from his humble beginnings in Minnesota to his arrival in New York in 1961, his subsequent rise in the folk pantheon of Greenwich Village in the early '60s, and his cataclysmic folk-rock metamorphosis at the Newport Folk Festival in 1965. In the succeeding eighteen months, Dylan released Highway 61 Revisited and Blonde on Blonde, and embarked on the legendary 1966 World Tour that culminated with an unforgettable concert at the Royal Albert Hall. Heylin details it all, along with the true story of Dylan's motorcycle accident, his remarkable reemergence in the mid-'70s, the only exacting account of his controversial conversion to born-again Christianity, the Neverending Tour, and yet another incredible Dylan resurgence with his 1997 Grammy Album of the Year Award-winning Time Out of Mind.

Basil Deane explores the score: he shows that Mozart's characters are illuminated here not so much in soliloquies but in their reactions to each other. Composer Stephen Oliver discusses how the comedy exists not just in the words but, essentially, in the music. The full Italian text is given, with a note on the order of scenes in Act Three and the alternative passages Mozart wrote for the 1789 revival. The classic translation of E.J. Dent is an excellent way to get to know the twists and turns of the plot and the stylish wit of da Ponte's innuendos.Contents: A Society Marriage, John Wells; A Musical Commentary, Basil Deane; Music and Comedy in 'The Marriage of Figaro, Stephen Oliver; Beaumarchais's Characters; Le nozze di Figaro: Libretto by Lorenzo da Ponte; The Marriage of Figaro: English version by Edward J.

S. Army. Many of them worked in war zones, where their extraordinary courage, resourcefulness, and toughness first astonished and then won the respect of male officers. Their skill and dedication helped to save tens of thousands of lives and made the Army Nurse Corps an essential part of the American military establishment. Until now, there has been no comprehensive work that tells that story. In this book Mary Sarnecky describes the major stages in the development of the U.S. Army Nurse Corps, discusses the political and social context in which this development occurred, identifies the factors that have influenced the Corps' stature and reputation within the nursing community, and explores the impact of the Corps upon the profession of nursing. At the same time, she described the experiences of the nurses themselves--often in their own words. The history is as surprising as it is violent: during World War I, nurses were the first American Army units to fly the United States flag in France from their base hospitals in support of British troops. In World War II, Army nurses served at every front, from Alaska to the Philippines, from England to the beaches of Anzio, where several died in bombings while tending to the wounded. With the advent of helicopters to transport wounded soldiers rapidly to hospitals, MASH units and their nurses became immediate caretakers of severely traumatized patients from front-line action in the Korean War. These units continued their work in the next decade during the Vietnam War. The story of these women and of the organization they created in the midst of one of our most deliberately masculine institutions is important to both the history of the military and the history of women in America.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=maGqQnddNpkC&dq=A+History+of+the+U.S.+Army+Nurse+Corps+(Studies+in+Health,+Illness,+and+Caregiving)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Haitian Creole Basic Course (Creole Edition)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=detZGwAACAAJ&dq=Haitian+Creole+Basic+Course+(Creole+Edition)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Labor's untold story","description":"\\"Fundamentally, labor's story is the story of the American people. To view it narrowly, to concentrate on the history of specific trade unions or on the careers of individuals and their rivalries, would be to miss the point that the great forces which have swept the American people into action have been the very forces that have also molded labor. Trade unionism was born as an effective national movement amid the great convulsion of the Civil War and the fight for black freedom... Labor suffered under depressions which spurred the whole American people into movement in the seventies, in the eighties, and in the nineties. It reached its greatest heights when it joined hands with farmers, small businessmen, and the black people in the epic Populist revolts of the 1890's and later in the triumph that was the New Deal. For labor has never lived in isolation or progressed without allies. Always it has been in the main stream of American life,... Labor's story, by its very nature, is synchronized at every turn with the growth and development of American monopoly. Its great leap forward into industrial unionism was an answering action to the development of trusts and great industrial empires. Labor's grievances, in fact the very conditions of its life, have been imposed by its great antagonist, that combination of industrial and financial power often known as Wall Street. The mind and actions of William H. Sylvis, the iron molder who founded the first effective national labor organization, can scarcely be understood without also an understanding of the genius and cunning of his contemporary, John D. Rockefeller, father of the modern trust. In the long view of history the machinations of J. P. Morgan, merging banking and industrial capital as he threw together ever larger combinations of corporate power controlled by fewer and fewer men, may have governed the course of American labor more than the plans of Samuel Gompers.\\" -- Amazon.com viewed January 11, 2021.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=UV7tAAAAMAAJ&dq=Labor%27s+untold+story&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Kick the drug habit: The basic guide","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=8ADTwAEACAAJ&dq=Kick+the+drug+habit:+The+basic+guide&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Leader: Developing the Skills & Personal Qualities You Need to Lead Effectively","description":"Leaders aren't born; they're made.

After being contacted by his prodigal brother Basil, Gus begins to reflect on his existence and to record his thoughts with poetry in a private journal. The Synthetic Synergy drug Gus inhales before work heightens his ability to observe patterns and lulls him into accepting a world he once opposed. With a sweet girlfriend and gregarious best friend to share in his successes, his philosophical slacker days seem far behind him. But the ideological tradeoff he made for a content existence is not fully realized until a violent attack on a subway platform leaves him immobile and in a state of Synth withdrawal. Frightening waking visions follow Gus and force him to look at the unholy side of the modern world and its state of perpetual war. After he makes an exodus to the desert in search of Basil, Gus becomes compelled to address the mysterious identity of his attacker, the kindness of his savior, and, eventually, the greater question of his own identity.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=EXh4mAEACAAJ&dq=Naked+Among+the+Tombs:+A+novel&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Laws of Heaven: Catholic Activists Today","description":"In this remarkable book about religion and politics today, Commonweal writer Michael Gallagher asks the question, How does one adhere to an essentially simple faith in a complex society that lacks moral leadership not only in its government, but also in its religious institutions? Laws of Heaven answers by exploring the lives of twelve extraordinary men and women whose controversial beliefs have led them to challenge their church and government as well as to frequently place their lives on the line. Here you will meet some of contemporary America s bravest and most unusual citizens: Marietta Jaegar, whose young daughter was brutally murdered by a serial killer, and who has become a dedicated anti-death penalty and peace activist; Charlie Liteky, who, relinquishing the Medal of Honor and the pension that accompanies it, fasted regularly in order to protest U.S. support of the Contras in Nicaragua; Elizabeth McAlister, who, like her husband, Philip Berrigan, repeatedly took part in acts of civil disobedience to protest American reliance on nuclear weapons; William P. Ford, a Wall Street attorney whose life was turned upside down when his sister was killed in El Salvador. Laws of Heaven is a challenging and provocative contribution to our understanding of the world in which we live. The lives of its twelve subjects force us to confront our own values and to ask how far we would be willing to go for what we believe in.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=1HxJDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Manawa Toa/Heart Warrior","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=71w-ngAACAAJ&dq=Manawa+Toa/Heart+Warrior&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Rhetorical Visions: Reading and Writing in a Visual Culture","description":"A thematic, visual reader for courses in composition and cultural studies.

Between 1920 and 1970, cosmology transformed into a branch of physics. With this remarkably rapid change came a theory that would finally lend empirical support to many long-held beliefs about the origins and development of the entire universe: the theory of the big bang. In this book, Helge Kragh presents the development of scientific cosmology for the first time as a historical event, one that embroiled many famous scientists in a controversy over the very notion of an evolving universe with a beginning in time. In rich detail he examines how the big-bang theory drew inspiration from and eventually triumphed over rival views, mainly the steady-state theory and its concept of a stationary universe of infinite age. In the 1920s, Alexander Friedmann and Georges Lema?tre showed that Einstein's general relativity equations possessed solutions for a universe expanding in time. Kragh follows the story from here, showing how the big-bang theory evolved, from Edwin Hubble's observation that most galaxies are receding from us, to the discovery of the cosmic microwave background radiation. Sir Fred Hoyle proposed instead the steady-state theory, a model of dynamic equilibrium involving the continuous creation of matter throughout the universe. Although today it is generally accepted that the universe started some ten billion years ago in a big bang, many readers may not fully realize that this standard view owed much of its formation to the steady-state theory. By exploring the similarities and tensions between the theories, Kragh provides the reader with indispensable background for understanding much of today's commentary about our universe.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=9OcSEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Swim Little Duck.","description":"Follow Little Duck as she learns to swim in this sweet board book!
