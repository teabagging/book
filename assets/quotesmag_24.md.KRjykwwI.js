It struck me then and it strikes me now. It never occured to me that my presentation when speaking to someone could actually influence my ability to communicate.There are two points in particular that I remember. The first is where Carnegie describes a doctor preparing to give a presentation. The doctor was knowledgable about the subject he chose but the practice presentations he gave were not well received. Carnegie advised the doctor to pick a subject he felt passionate about and BOOM, the doctor was getting a standing ovation. Keep in mind this was not a manipulation, the doctor was speaking from his heart and meant what he was saying.The second part thst has stuck with me for 25 years was seeing things from other peoples point of view. As a fifteen year old this was a rather radical idea ! Yet, this simple concept has been one of those things that has supported me in my life in SO many ways.There is another book that I would highly recommend to you as well, &quot;Working on Yourself Doesn't Work&quot;, by Ariel and Shya Kane. The Kanes have an approach that is both profound and simple. There are no rules to follow, no long lists of Do's and Don'ts, and no preaching. The key to their approach is Awareness. The Kanes define Awareness as a non-judgmental seeing of what is. The effects on my personal and professional life have been incredible and lasting. Do yourself a huge favor and get this book."},{"Title":"How to Win Friends & Influence People (Cardinal Editions, C 303)","review":"This book on human relations, first published in 1937, is still the best on this nebulous subject of simply &quot;relating well to others&quot;. By using these principles, you can simply change your world! Steven Covey has criticized this book indirectly because he states that it &quot;truncates the character base&quot;. It is THE book for sociopaths who will smile, call you by your first name, and grab your money. But I did have good results with this marketing system. We had a new manager at a telemarketing company. I felt horrible mainly because it is horrible work (which is why I go out of my way to treat these people decently). Anyway, the new manager came in and walked behind us. I knew later that she was Carnegie Trained. First, she called me by my name. Bill. Secondly, she said I had a good telephone voice. And third, she made my mistakes seem easy to correct. And finally she pointed out my mistakes indirectly. Well, I felt good and relaxed. Then my performance didskyrocket in results! These are four Carnegie techniques. Now what does it matter if she &quot;smudged&quot; a bit. It's a hell of a lot better than being yelled at! The Carnegie system is still the world's best management system according to people whom I have interviewed. And you really only have to buy one book! If you are worried about being a &quot;phoney&quot;, then you can buy Adam Khan's &quot;Self-Help Stuff That Works&quot; which is based om Martin Seligman's &quot;Learned Optimism&quot; and &quot;How to Win Friends and Influence People&quot;. It's a bit tougher than Carnegie's approach, but not as pious nor as rigid as Covey's books. I do disagree with Khan on one point strongly and so would Carnegie I believe. In his chapter &quot;Complaint Compunctions&quot;, Khan takes the position that you should NOT listen to someone bad-mouth a third person. That you should state, &quot;I think it would be better if you took this problem to the person you are angry at.&quot; A bit tough. But I do agree with Khan and I believe Carnegie was amiss with Khan's chapter &quot;Bad Apples&quot;. Khan claims, and rightly so, that there are simply some people you can't deal with. They are covered with mud and no matter what you try in dealing with them, you will have mud over you after trying to deal with them. So deal with them as little as possible even if they are your employees. Advice to the wise. I think that Covey's disguised criticism can be covered with Khan's chapter &quot;Forging Mettle&quot; which displays a &quot;people-oriented&quot; approach to dealing with human beings. Buy this book if you don't want to sink. And buy &quot;Self Help Stuff That Works &quot; if you want to stay aflaot. Good luck."},{"Title":"How to Win Friends & Influence People (Cardinal Editions, C 303)","review":"I just finished facilitating a 4 day workshop on influence skills. Like many of the participants I encounter in my workshops, I secretly hope for a proven, repeatable formula for influencing people. Of course none exists. The good news - Carnegie and others have shown us that influencing others is not rocket science - the bad news - it takes a lot of energy, patience, and selflessness to build effective relationships.Awareness of self and awareness of others are two guiding principles. Forget about utilitarian motives. Influence is not about getting our way. Influence is an art. The heart of Carnegie's work is about getting excited about others. Carnegie encourages us to see others as wonderful tapestries adorned with luxurious threads of experiences. At this point techniques cease to be techniques and begin to become an authentic part of how we interact with each other.One of the reviews below shares some history about Carnegie mentioning a chapter that never made it into the book. I am paraphrasing - but the author of this review makes an important point about this missing chapter. Supposedly, Carnegie in this last chapter acknowledges the people we cannot reach. There will always be some people with whom we cannot build satisfying relationships with or influence. That's okay. No one can bat a 1000 and we have to learn how to accept our limitations and the limitations of others. Carnegie is a great coach and cheerleader. He gives us concrete practices and tools and then encourages us to discover the excitement of building stronger relationships."},{"Title":"How to Win Friends & Influence People (Cardinal Editions, C 303)","review":"I read this book when I was in college and it changed my life. If you want to learn how to get along with people, this book will steer you in the right direction. A must read."},{"Title":"How to Win Friends & Influence People (Cardinal Editions, C 303)","review":"Having chanced through these reviews again, I think I will force myself to re-re-read it again:-) My title says it all.I first bought this book in 1994, when I was 17. I was immediately hooked, and in applying the principles in the book, my relations with friends and acquaintances underwent a serious metamorphosis. To this day, I remember precepts such as \\"when you're tempted to react to something, ignore your initial feeling, and let it go\\". I have often failed at this, but times when I have remembered, a lot of animated anad heated arguments have been scuppered.Also, there is one particular anecdote about Abraham Lincoln having been upset with one of his subordinates whom he had asked--I believe it was his general--to do something during the 1861-65 US Civil War. His general came back with news that he had not done what he had been asked. Lincoln was characteristically subdued, but upset. He wrote a letter, put it in his drawer, and forgot about it.Later, he realised that it was a good idea that he hadn't sent the letter which was a rebuking one. Lincoln was able to resolve the issue, and reflected that had he been the man, he would probably have done the same thing.Anecdotes like that remind us how critical it is to pause and reflect on issues, without adopting a knee-jerk approach. It can literally save a lot of trouble. Just for that, I would recommend this book highly. And yes, it *is* my second bible!"},{"Title":"How to Win Friends & Influence People (Cardinal Editions, C 303)","review":"I first read this book in the late 1960's and it has influenced me ever since. I try to remember people's names, I smile as much as possible, as a salesman I never argued with irate customers, and so forth.I keep my copy of this book handy and recommend it to other people.--George Stancliffe"},{"Title":"How to Win Friends & Influence People (Cardinal Editions, C 303)","review":"No wonder this is the best selling book of all time- after the bible that is! Carnegie started giving lectures about how to give effective public speaking early in the century... then his seminars grew, he found that people were more interested to know about HOW TO DEAL WITH PEOPLE. His lecture notes gradually grew into this book and it was an instant bestseller! Very easy to read, with tons of examples from people - from famous people like Emerson, Lincoln, Franklin, etc to normal people like you and me. You'll see how applying his technique works like magic. Find out what is the one thing that EVERYBODY WANTS and literally CRAVES for. How do you make small talk and why is it so helpful in social situations? I don't understand why there are people who say his technique is old or manipulating etc... I would like to ask them one thing... what do you call 'manipulation' ? If you want to look at things that way, WHY DON'T YOU say putting make-up is manipulating (cos you're enhancing your real looks?), or putting certain good smelling things are manipulating (cos you're puting artificial smell?). Or if you say Carnegie is manipulating, then why not say all form of communication is manipulation? Frankly if you have some friends you can communicate very well with, you are already using some part of his method. It is NOT manipulating people- it's how to enhance your communication skill, to give others sincerely what they want, and receive what you want in return. Carnegie can be funny, his writing skills par excellence. Read this and make yourself extremely popular with your friends and WIN NEW FRIENDS easily!"},{"Title":"How to Win Friends & Influence People (Cardinal Editions, C 303)","review":"If you're looking for a book that will teach you how to manipulate others and bend them to your will, you might gain something from this. But that's not what it's about.What it's about is teaching you which behaviors are constructive and which aren't. By avoiding specific actions, you can avoid irritating co-workers, customers, and people you meet every day. If you change your approach from the confrontational to the constructive, you can be much more pleasant to be around.At its heart, that's what the book is all about: if you're a pleasant person to be around, other people will like you. It's not so much about manipulating others as it is controlling negative impulses in your own personality.There's nothing in here that you couldn't learn by interacting with people on a daily basis, and studying their responses. People who are good at dealing with others -- even in difficult situations, like reprimanding someone who works for them -- have an intuitive understanding of the lessons in this book. If you really pay attention to how others react to the things you do and say, you will soon discover what sets other people off.Rather than spend half your life figuring this stuff out, why not buy the book and see what's there? It's light reading, with lots of analogies to back up the interesting points."},{"Title":"How to Win Friends & Influence People (Cardinal Editions, C 303)","review":"For a number of years I passed on reading Carnegie's work. The primary reason being that having dealt with a few people who did things the 'Carnegie way' I felt very uncomfortable with the kind of people they had become. One could easily argue they would have been those kinds of people with or without a Carnegie course and a paperback, and that's a reasonably sustainable argument. The problem really is though, that this book was clearly written by an American for an American audience (in 1936!); I know that is not the sales line but it is the truth. Henceforth, when the 'techniques' are applied to just about every culture outside of the United States then they have all the uncomfortableness of a brash woman wearing too much make-up, they ring too false and look too ridiculous. Maybe my comments will be seem by some as 'European elitism', but it's not that at all, it's simply a point of appropriation. A good number of what Carnegie talks about would simply laughed off in Europe as utterly banal and superficially repulsive - even if it were said or done with all sincerity. In my experience the over-use of names, the false enquiring of one's health, the formulaic compassion, the absurdity of remembering that your prospect ate chicken for dinner when you last met; and doesn't even remember that himself etc. is just too feigned and fictitious as to become repulsive. Likewise the whole notion that you can ask someone to do something if you simply spin them round, or that you should never berate people is poor psychology indeed. I agree that ONLY beration is unproductive but to motivate and challenge people of substance you need to raise the bar and use BOTH the twin tools of carrot AND the stick. Psychologically the practice of praising errors is utterly ridiculous, all it does is register in the brain that bad results equal rewards and therefore offers no need to adopt correct procedure. When finally the employer/owner feels the necessity to berate (i.e. when behaviour, attitude or errors were not corrected) then must harsher correction is needed to gain lesser effect. This is simple behavioural psychology at work. I recommend Col. Konrad Most's 'Training Dogs' for an excellent explanation of this idea. As a footnote, chapter 11 'Dramatise your ideas' is singularly laughable, I'm surprised that wasn't edited out of the latest edition.That said, I feel that what Carnegie himself began to discover was, that in order to be a better person one must embody the 'techniques' offered in the book, so that they become you. You must fully internalise the ideas, living and breathing them so the radiate forth with utmost clarity and sincerity. I dare say that when Carnegie first set out he wasn't that way inclined. However as he practised his Way longer and harder and underwent his spiritual and personal growth then he became to realise that in order to REALLY 'Win Friends and Influence People' it is the heart and soul of the individual that is of importance. Any fool can (and does) go through the motions, but it is humanity and deepest sincerity that connects human beings together; and if they happen to be seller/buyer then that's just the way things are. What we are effectively presented with here here is one man's personal spiritual journey, the memoirs of one man's route up the Path of life and in that regard this book is a gem.Ultimately this is an admirable piece of work that has stood well against the shifting sands of time and should simple be one of a NUMBER of books the enquiring mind should be reading; simply being one piece of the jigsaw. Once you have read and digested this then I thoroughly recommend the next level, Dr. Covey's '7 Habits of Highly Effective People', though that work (and many others) clearly benefited enormous from the early groundwork done by Carnegie, it is in a different league altogether; highly recommended."},{"Title":"How to Win Friends & Influence People (Cardinal Editions, C 303)","review":"Great book reinforces and reminds us how to treat people and at the same time improves upon our lives. Dale was a visionary. It is a quick read with every chapter having pertinant information. I did not slow down like I do with so many other narcissistic self help books just trying to make a buck without providing any real value."},{"Title":"How to Win Friends & Influence People (Cardinal Editions, C 303)","review":"While this book was first published in 1937 (revised in 1981) it is still very relevant today. The only issue I had with the book was the dated examples. It will be difficult for most readers to relate to the stories told throughout the book.The author also suggests that you read each chapter twice and continue to read the book until you have mastered the principles in each chapter. As someone who reads a ton of book I can say that the points come across very easily and there is no need to read the book a second time. The conversational style is easy to read and the main points are reiterated at the end of each chapter.By reading this book you will realize what people really want to hear. This will however require you to have some interest in the people you are talking to. Most of the principles will come naturally to you if you genuinely love people and have their best interest at heart. A lot of the advice is simply about being polite and acting in a loving manner.This book is filled with practical ideas you can put into practice immediately. It should not be difficult to smile more, say people's names, give someone your rapt attention, listen intently, make a person feel important or avoid arguments.While the first chapter indicates that you should not criticize, condemn or complain there is a chapter on how to criticize without being hated for it. Managers will especially enjoy the fourth section of the book that talks about how to change people without being offensive.While reading this classic book I did think of one of my friendships in which I do mostly everything right. When you love a person you will naturally do many of the things in this book. I have also been careless with friendships in the past and didn't follow some of the ideas in this book. You can easily lose a friendship by criticizing or even stating some small complaint. So by looking at your own life you can prove the ideas to be correct or incorrect in a matter of minutes.I'd recommend this book to anyone who wants to get ahead in business or wants to improve their relationships with people they deal with on a continual basis. The advice in this book will save you a lot of trouble and will make your life more enjoyable. After hearing about this book for years I'm glad I finally read it.~The Rebecca Review"},{"Title":"How to Win Friends & Influence People (Cardinal Editions, C 303)","review":"Without a doubt, How To Win Friends and Influence People has stood the test of time. I have to chuckle when I read a review by someone who says that this book is outdated. Why am I chuckling? Because obviously the person who wrote that has no idea how to relate to people and is in fact no doubt very poor at people skills.The information works just as well today as it did when it was written some 70 years ago. Remember, people are people. What motivated people 70 years ago still motivates them today. What worked on making friends and influencing people 70 years ago still works today. Unless you are a hermit living alone with no outside contacts, you can and will benefit from using this book.I was not a very good people person at first. In fact, I was lousy at people skills. Then I met a businessman who was the most remarkable people person I have ever met. He was likeable and he liked you. He had so much charisma. Everyone flocked around this guy and I can tell you it wasn't because of his looks. This guy was very ordinary looking but had extraordinary people skills. And it showed. HE LIKED PEOPLE. He showed a strong interest in everyone he met. He immediately remembered your name and next time you saw him he would call you by name and ask how you_____ whatever was doing. He remembered your interests, because he was interested enough to do so.We tested him one time by putting him in a new assignment with 600 new people. He memorized all 600 people, knew their spouses names, what dept they worked in and what their primary interest was! Remarkable! How did he do it? Because he was interested in people. He always called people by their first and last names. It wasn't &quot;Hey you from section 9.&quot; It was &quot;Hi Bob, Jerry, Kerri, Tom or whatever.&quot;Later I discovered that this guyw as a Dale Carnegie student. He had read numerous times How To Win Friends and Influence People. But more than having read it, he mastered it. He put as much effort into learning the techniques in this book as he did in getting his various degrees from college.I have to admit that I had read How To Win Friends and Influence People in high school and tossed it aside. I forgot most of what I had read even though I thought I knew it all. After meeting with the above master people person, I decided to go out and actually buy a copy of this book and started to apply everything. Immediately, I noticed a change in how people treated me (I felt like they were treating me okay before). People were friendlier towards me and my ability to influence them increased substantially. What was the difference? Did my personality suddenly change? No. What changed was the way I treated people and because I had become conscious on how to treat people it sent out waves that actually attracted people to me, made me more likeable, and gave me the skills to become a better people person.I have since bought other Carnegie books and enrolled in the Dale Carnegie course in my area. Carnegie's methods made all the difference in my life and will do the same for you too.Try it. You'll like it."},{"Title":"How to Win Friends & Influence People (Cardinal Editions, C 303)","review":"This is the standard 'how to succeed in life' book in the secular genre (cp. &quot;With Joseph in the University of Adversity&quot; in the Christian genre), and there is little I can add to other reviewers except to say: 'this author is peerless'. Carnegie states succinctly and effectively, what one needs to practice in life to become successful. I would only suggest a bit more updating in certain chapters, and a thorough indexing of persons, events, etc. might also be helpful. In short--this is a must-read for every new graduate, and a re-read for those of us who think we already know it all."},{"Title":"How to Win Friends & Influence People (Cardinal Editions, C 303)","review":"This is a great companion to the book. It is great for planes and long car rides, when it's nice to sit back and passively listen. This is the oldest &quot;self-help&quot; book I know of, and still one of the finest, and I believe it is the best for the information it covers. However, it isn't one you can read one time and then forget. You have to read it over and over, really internalizing the information. It is well worth the effort, believe me! And the price is nothing compared to some more modern self help courses, but the results with these age-old techniques for dealing with people are nothing short of fantastic.If you do even some of the things this book suggests, you will have a more successful marriage, a more successful career, and your neighbors will like you a lot more. It is just as simple as that. This stuff is very basic, and it really works, and most people don't do it.If you find people don't like you sometimes and can't figure out why, this book will probably come in handy. If you have personality &quot;differences&quot; at work, a few select techniques can turn an enemy into a staunch supporter.If you are in sales, consulting, or any other profession that has you working with customers, you need this. If you want to get along better with your mate, this will help you. If you live in a makeshift shack in Montana and don't see people all that much, and your nickname is &quot;Crazy Ted,&quot; you probably don't need this book unless you are considering a lifestyle change.My advice - get the book and the CDs. Read the book. Reread it. Use the CDs over time to listen to various chapters when you have some free time. It is amazing how following such simple advice can almost effortlessly change your life, almost overnight."},{"Title":"How to Win Friends & Influence People (Cardinal Editions, C 303)","review":"This book has been around for a long time, but it still ranks at the top of the list.

With a counselling background both in psychology and business, I cannot count the times I have recommended this book and heard nothing but praises and positive feedback from those who have read the book.Part of the reason why people do not get what they want in life, master what they set out to accomplish, or reach their goals is a matter of not knowing the right approach which will help you achieve your full potential. Very few people ever achieve their full potential in a lifetime. You can be the best there is at your profession, trade or specialized skill, but if you do not have strong interpersonal relationship skills (better known as people skills,) you will not maximize your full potential. Who do you communicate with on a daily basis? Business managers, employees, suppliers, bankers, co-workers, friends, family, neighbours, delivery people, store clerks, teachers, waiters/waitresses - that adds up to a LOT of people. Those who know how to win friends and influence people, follow what is often known as the, &quot;Bambi approach,&quot; if you do not have anything good to say - say nothing!&quot; How many people actually live up to that philosophy in all aspects of everyday life? Yet, if we are going to communicate, we certainly must say something of value in an intelligent, respecful and positive way. Dale Carnegie had an amazing, natural ability to understand people and successfully communicate with them. &quot;How to Win Friends and Influence People&quot; has sold over 15 million copies around the world, and once you read it, you will fully understand why.

Say to yourself over and over: \\"My popularity, my happiness and sense of worth depend to no small extend upon my skill in dealing with people.\\" The rules he has set down in the book are not mere theories or guesswork.

In fact, he makes it clear at least two or three times that people who try to use his techniques and suggestions to manipulate people will find that they aren't successful. Alot of what Carnegie is suggesting is basic common sense: be empathetic, be a good listener, don't stuck in a position and instead focus on finding common interests, and give constructive criticism. These are all very useful tips. I appreciated the way Carnegie summed up each chapter with a one sentence bullet. I also liked how each part had a listing of the key point of each chapter from that section. It made skimming through the book much easier.Many of the chapters are repetitive - he talks about criticism in at least three chapters, and he's essentially just expanding on the same point. I would've preferred few chapters providing a more in-depth examination of the key topics, rather than reading alot of chapters that were essentially repetitive. His examples were archaic, which didn't help. Overall, the writing style was frutrating to me as a modern reader. In general, other authors, such as Stephen Covey (Seven Habits For Highly Effective People) and Roger Fisher (Getting to Yes, Difficult Conversations) have addressed the points Carnegie is making in a deeper, more interesting manner."},{"Title":"How to Win Friends & Influence People (Cardinal Editions, C 303)","review":"I wouldn't recommend this book if someone is trying to do the right thing and wants to truly make a difference in other people's lives. If you are looking to make it to the top and don't really care who you manipulate to get there, this is the book to read. Don't expect to make friends by using this book. To make friends, you don't always have to agree with someone, or be perky all the time, just be you.Carnegie's heart may be in the right place as far as some of the principles go. He has a point, if we are good to other people, they will be good to us in return. At least that is how it should work. The thing he never addresses, is that this isn't always true. Sometimes no matter how hard we try, things don't get better, and some really great people never make it to the top. I think he should at least make it known that this isn't fool-proof, and that sometimes people don't appreciate others no matter what is said or done.The most important thing about this book is that Carnegie makes us think. It does make a person stop and think about how they are acting towards others.I came up with my own principle after reading this book. It has really nothing to do with the book itself, but rather what I think he left out... To be a true influence on others, be real, be kind, and be respectful. If you do those things you will touch lives every day. To make friends and be a true influence, do just one thing, be genuine."},{"Title":"How to Win Friends & Influence People (Cardinal Editions, C 303)","review":"Content is great - the print is horrible!Small print, dark pages that woul not completely open.

I would order from the company again!"},{"Title":"How to Win Friends & Influence People (Cardinal Editions, C 303)","review":"That this book sold over 15 million copies must give us pause. That kind of sales record might indicate that it is filling a basic need. What need is that? The need to feel good about yourself and to think that you are doing the right thing. And so we get a simple and simplistic set of lists and formulae that tells us how to behave so that we can win friends and influence people. Would that life were that simple! The author claims these rules are scientifically based because he has done some real research by reading the opinions of famous people on this subject and by hiring a researcher to read things when he didn't have the time. The general rules are therefore supposedly derived from authoritative sources. But for the most part they are illustrated by sets of anecdotes that have come from the author's students who enrolled in his courses because they felt they needed to improve. Therefore the premise is shaky and the data base faulty. Those of us who know logic would say that there has been a partial selection of evidence such that what is presented here doesn't reflect the true universe of possibilities. Therefore no scientific conclusions can be drawn about whether the ideas proffered work or not. Other logical errors present therein include begging the question, false analogy, and over generalization. The major problem, however, is that that book asks people to be fake. We have plenty of fake things around these days, too many in fact. We don't need fake people. Diogenes found when requested by Alexander the Great no difference between the bones of his father and those of his father's slaves. Surely the philosopher must have known that that was the wrong answer. But he gave it anyway and lost his post. I say it is better to lose one's position and keep one's integrity. For, at last, are leveled, king and slave, without distinction, in the silent grave."},{"Title":"How to Win Friends & Influence People (Cardinal Editions, C 303)","review":"Utter dreck! Anyone who thinks this book offers important wise advice on friendship is an idiot.Dale Carnegie was nothing but a huckstering sophist, and a very repulsive one at that. For those of you who may not know, Carnegie's How to Win Friends and Influence People is a handbook on how to exploit friendship for the sake of financial and political gain. Now fans of this book (why such people are allowed to read, much less vote, I do not know) will say this book helped them overcome their shyness and make real friendships. But Dale Carnegie is not interested in real friendship. His only concern is to exploit friendship for financial and political gain. One need not be Einstein to know this. One need only read all the garish claims on the back of the book (I have an earlier edition than the one usually found in bookstores today) such as, say, \\"Increase your earning power\\" \\"(Carnegie's book will) [m:]ake you a better salesman, a better executive.\\" If the book were really about true friendship, as its many lobotomized fans insists, then one would expect the blurbs to claim that the book will make the reader a better friend, not a better salesman. A true friend cares about his friends, but a salesman cares about his profit, and if friendship come between him and his profit, then so much for friendship. Dale Carnegie's groupies are utterly oblivious to his promotion of such shameless exploitation, which is as obvious as a communal bedpan.And they are also utterly oblivious to historical facts. Had they some historical knowledge, then these sycophants-in-training surely would have read Dale Carnegie's pilpul with slightly less pollyannish gullibility. For instance, if they knew anything about the Age of the Robber Barons, they might have found Dale Carnegie's depiction of Andrew Carnegie as a man truly concerned for the lot of his fellow man a bit hard to stomach.Sure, Andrew Carnegie smiled a lot and presented a friendly appearance to the press and public, and that was enough for Dale. Dale--like all other sophists, politicians, and prostitutes--cared only for appearances, but underneath the accommodating demeanor of Andrew Carnegie was a heart as hard as the steel his factories forged. Andrew Carnegie would publicly declare his support for rights of the worker and yet let his Manager Frick hire Pinkerton Guards to massacre the union workers. Andrew Carnegie would snatch good PR with his various philanthropies but also poured much of his money into the American Eugenics Movement which managed to get laws passed all over this country that mandated the sterilization of cripples like me. American Eugenics also had a profound influence upon German Eugenics, an influence which one can see documented in the minutes of The Nuremberg Trials. I hope even Carnegie groupies are not that ignorant not to know that influence, however nice, pleasant, and smiling it may be, is bad when it leads to genocide.Yet, I suspect those who swear by this book will continue to have nothing but admiration for Dale Carnegie, whose sycophantic adulation for the ruthless rich who killed off unionized workers and funded the genocide of the weak should offend, repel, and disgust anyone with even a modicum of human thought and decency. Carnegie fans are idiots."},{"Title":"How to Win Friends & Influence People (Cardinal Editions, C 303)","review":"I picked this classic up based on a friend's recommendation.

Sure it's got some truthful points, but it's all told from a perspective that treats all exterior forces as being in the wrong. This writer has no humility, and I'm afraid that anyone who reads this book will believe that the world is at fault, that self is always right, and that you have to be sly and manipulative in order to overcome the obstacles of all the dumb people out there. The truth is that everyone has a story, and at the root of that story is a non-malicious person. We all make decisions along the way that take us farther from our initial innocence, the book prescribes a \\"glass half empty\\" mentality when it comes to treating our fellow human.

I had not expected the actual fun of reading it. Besides being a foundational book for anyone who communicates with people (yes, that pretty much includes everyone!), it is also offers a glimpse into American History as Dale Carnegie utilizes politicians, businessmen and historical figures most relevant to his era to illustrate stories of effective and in some cases ineffective communications and their outcomes.

Treat them how you would like to be treated. Be interested in them, do not condemn them.I suggest reading this book with a highlighter and some flag post its. In the beginning they say you should read each chapter twice, but this book is way to boring to do so. It is a good book, but Dale uses way to many examples. BORING ONES! Which is why I rate this a 4 star not a 5.This book can be written in about 150 or less pages if was not for those tedious examples. He uses about 3-5 examples each chapter making scream to your self SHUT UP I GET IT! So that is why I say use a high lighter. As you read threw all these examples a hint or two comes up on how to influence people and why. To bad he did not mention not to bore people.Over all it is a good book, just to many examples. Luckily I did use a highlighter and flags to go back to the book when I need it.And yes my relationship with people did grow.

After reading and applying this book on leadership, you too will have a way with people. If you have a desire to understand how to become the best boss you can be and have everyone want to work with you, these are the principles that will get you to that point. \\"How to Win Friends and Influence People,\\" is the best book that I have read that helps you understand and influence people that you come across in every aspect of your life.This book could be used as a textbook in school if you were studying human behavior and how to deal with day to day confrontations that you face in life. Reading through the book, you will be best suited to read through a chapter, and throughout the next week, you go through and apply that chapter in your life. To get, fully, everything that you can learn from the principles of the book, you absolutely need to apply the things that are taught in the book. One of the things that is taught is to listen to people. The principle that is taught is to listen \\"genuinely.\\" You can go through and read this book and get what you are suppose to do, but everything is genuinely done and not just going through the motions.Carnegie also goes through stories, personal experiences, and how other readers have implemented the principles into their lives and businesses. By having these stories to compare to your life and circumstances, you are better prepared and enabled to implement the principles taught into your life. Most of the examples are off highly successful people in the world, thus it provides the book to be more value and credible. The mixture of stories, principles, and how to apply what is being taught is very balanced and shows no weaknesses to me.If you are looking for a textbook, that reads like a novel, that will help you in your people skills, leadership, and day to day contact with people; look no further than, \\"How to Win Friends and Influence People.\\" Because this book is a short read and easy to read, it is the perfect book for those of us with little attention span, but have a desire to become better than we are.

How to Win Friends and Influence People, gives excellent insight into what makes other people tick, and more importantly it reminds us why we tick. The advice is not complicated, but it does require practice and review. The best thing about the book is that it is full of advice that we already know, but just don't practice. A good portion of the book centers on putting yourself in someone else's shoes and seeing it from their perspective. It talks about how must people consider themselves to be honest hard working people no matter how bad or negatively society views them.It speaks about how important it is to allow people to save face in confrontations, what it means to have good manners, and a no nonsense approach to what motivates people.The information in the book is timeless and tested. It is useful not only for business, but even in your personal relationships, because it focuses on improving the communication channels between people.Arguments: Of all of the aspects of the book, the section on arguments and confrontation holds the most value. Essential the books says that you never really when an argument, because even if you are right, the other party is going to be injured, always allow the other party to save face says the book. One of the most important single paragraphs in the book is when confronted with an argument or confrontation say, \\"I maybe be wrong because I frequently am, let's exam the facts.\\" I cannot count the times this has cooled a heated discussion, chiefly because it removes any hostile edge the other party may have about you.You can't go wrong with this book.Update:I originally read this book 10 years ago and the lessons still hold true today as much as they did back then. There is no better book out there that I've read on how to deal with people, even people you don't like.

Can you teach manners, compassion or kindness to adults? After numerous recommendations I gave in and decided to read the book and am very happy to have overcome my initial bias. This book does not merely teach readers how to make friends and influence them. More importantly it is an examination of human nature and the virtues of doing good. There is an anecdote in the book where the author complements a bored postal worker on his hair. Someone asks him what the author hoped to gain from the postal worker. The answer was nothing concrete but to make the worker feel good about himself. What was implied is that the author gained also by knowing that he was making the worker happy. A win-win situation. Carnegie, through many anecdotes makes a convincing case for good behavior.Many of the author's advice are incredibly simple such as \\"listen\\", \\"don't criticize\\", and \\"smile\\". One does not need obvious training to understand these advice but yet as one reflects on what goes on in the real world these deceptively simple tasks are not so easy. This book will help you perform these strategies better by first convincing you of their benefits and second by teaching you how. As the author recommends, readers will maximize the benefit from this book by intermittently reviewing it.

Through conscious endeavor, day by day, try to internalize the lessons contained in this book and your life will be enriched. I have heard it said that many of the techniques in this book are merely superficial, manipulative, or phony, means of, well, winning friends and influencing people. It must be realized, however, that, in life, sometimes you've gotta &quot;fake it 'till you make it.&quot; When you truly make the attempt to put these principles into practice, what you will be doing will benefit both yourself and those you come into contact with.

C&oacute;mo es esto posible? Pues muy f&aacute;cil, las excelentes ideas all&iacute; expuestas, no han sido adoptadas por muchos, a pesar de haber vendido millones de copias. El hombre com&uacute;n y corriente es f&aacute;cilmente impresionable cuando se le presentan conceptos que prometen un cambio radical en su vida, sin embargo luego del entusiasmo inicial, todas estas ideas son olvidadas, tales son los casos famosos de libros de autores como Og Mandino o Wayne Dryer. En su libro, el se&ntilde;or Carnegie insiste en la re-lectura una y otra vez, y en la aplicaci&oacute;n constante de los conceptos all&iacute; expuestos, ya que sabe que de otra manera sus palabras no dejar&aacute;n huella. Las ideas que el se&ntilde;or Carnegie presenta en su texto son demasiado obvias, tan obvias que nadie las nota en su propia vida; s&oacute;lo cuando el autor las muestra de tal manera que no se pueden negar, es en ese momento cuando el lector se enfrenta con la realidad. Todos nos sorprendemos ya que el se&ntilde;or Carnegie, apoyado en testimonios e historias de personajes famosos, logra mostrarnos tantos y tan distintos errores que cometemos a diario. Pero sobre todo, nos sorprendemos con la soluci&oacute;n que nos presenta para superar esos errores. De manera magistral el autor apela al mismo ego&iacute;smo de cada uno para trabajar de manera inversa, es decir, hacerle creer a los dem&aacute;s que siempre hacemos lo que ellos quieren. Y al parecer esta soluci&oacute;n funciona, y funciona tan bien que, a fuerza de fingir este comportamiento y de re-leer el texto, el individuo termina apropiando la idea de hacer que la otra gente se sienta importante.Tal vez el mayor m&eacute;rito lo logra el autor en el aspecto de la influencia sobre las personas, para ello propone unas reglas b&aacute;sicas de comportamiento, que de ser practicadas, conducen a un &eacute;xito en las relaciones interpersonales y de paso a conseguir cualquier cosa que uno se proponga. De todo esto, lo que causa mayor admiraci&oacute;n al lector es darse cuenta que todas las personas sin distinci&oacute;n de raza, color, sexo, religi&oacute;n o condici&oacute;n social, tienen las mismas necesidades b&aacute;sicas, las mismas expectativas y por sobre todo, el inter&eacute;s de colocar el YO, el m&iacute; mismo por sobre todas las cosas y de c&oacute;mo al lograr manipular este inter&eacute;s se puede \\"dominar\\" a los dem&aacute;s. Es interesante la lectura de este libro por todas las oportunidades que ofrece para el mejoramiento del trato con los dem&aacute;s, pero por sobre todo, porque el se&ntilde;or Carnegie en ning&uacute;n momento intenta imponer sus ideas, simplemente sugiere, jugando de alguna manera con el mismo lector, a qui&eacute;n le aplica el mismo tratamiento de hacerlo sentir importante."},{"Title":"How to Win Friends & Influence People (Cardinal Editions, C 303)","review":"Would you believe that most people have not read this book or taken the Carnegie Course ?

I'd also recommend the book Rich Dad, Poor Dad which, like this book, gives you an interesting view and good advice overall on how to be successful in life.

People i know have commented that they have seen a visable change in me recently, i used to be rude to people out of insecurity however this has all changed now.The book has introduced me to a new kind of life, i can also recomend his book how to stop worrying and start living. By reading this book u will learn to be less critical,more understanding and basicly a better people person. I dont feel that the book makes u superficial, anybody can just go around telling people how great they are to try to get approval but what he is actually saying is that its better to give sincere praise from the heart, this will have a much greater impact on people than flattery because they will know its true and u mean it.

Carnegie's writing style is comfortable and entertaining, using real-life examples and illustrations. His distilled wisdom is painfully simple, to-the-point and hard hitting. This book can positively impact anyone from any walk of life. It has a permanent place in my library on the reread shelf.My grandmother went to a girl's school where Carnegie came and taught them how to be successful and 'proper' ladies in society, she saw me reading this book and told me that Dale Carnegie changed everyone's life that he came in contact with, but that the book is sure to be outdated by now.

Just like saying his name, being kind, being interested in him, not criticizing neither arguing and many other good manners.The bad point is that you start to do some of this stuff as a robot, I mean, you start to be selfish and use this &quot;art&quot; more to be sucessful instead of being good, but Dale warns you about it everytime he can!My father was a priest long time ago and he is a very good guy, as far as I see, the church (catholic) made him follow some rules of this book, but he does this naturally, specially when he stops ANYTHING he is doing to listen you...Buy it."},{"Title":"How to Win Friends & Influence People (Cardinal Editions, C 303)","review":"The old adage is &quot;you can only teach someone something that they want to learn&quot;. So many people are unconsciously incompetent about their ability to effectively and usefully communicate with others. It is these people who will not deliberately read this book. They must be tricked into it.The beauty of Carnegie's classic is that every page continually reminds the reader why they should keep reading the book. On the first read, every chapter has the potential to make you feel terribly uncomfortable about your behaviour in the past. You might put it down in disgust, but Carnegie continually reminds you _why_ each point in his book is so important.It is filled with stories, stories, and more stories. One thought per chapter, dozens of stories per thought.If you are having trouble convincing someone to read this book understand one thing: it's not your fault; they just do not know why they need to read it. The paradox is that by reading it they will learn why they need to read it. Trick them into starting to read it, and Carnegie will entice them to keep reading. Wait until they mention a problem with friends at work, for example, and off-handedly suggest that Chapter X from this little book might be helpful. Use the old reverse pyschology on them; tell them not to read any other chapters.

Using his homespun writing style Carnegie broke down complex human interactions into bite-size chapters to educate the masses on the keys to success with people.Analyzing great leaders (both in books and interviews), borrowing from scientific fields and using the adults in his courses as test cases, the author asserts that success is achievable by those who follow his prescriptions. \\"It grew and developed out of that laboratory, out of the experiences of thousands of adults.\\"Using chapter titles like \\"If You Want to Gather Honey, Don't Kick Over The Beehive\\" and quoting everyone from Lincoln, Franklin and Confucius, Carnegie tells quick, memorable stories in each chapter and finishes each with a \\"Principle\\"; in the case of the above chapter it is \\"Don't Criticize, condemn or complain.\\"Not only do the historical references offer support for Carnegie's claims, but they give them the veneer of incontrovertible truths, which adds to the impact of his work. Carnegie is also effective at providing examples of everyday people who applied his methods and found success.The book consists of sections focusing on handling people, getting people to like you, how to influence people and how to get people to change. I think the appeal of Carnegie's book lies in the fact that we have all faced situations where we have faced difficult people, wanted people to like us and tried to influence and change others - all without success.While academics may roll their eyes at Carnegie's attempt to bottle influence and persuasion, what he is really selling isn't secrets of influences and persuasion, but hope. Hope that the sticky, ugly, sometimes frustrating interactions we all have with others can be shaped and shifted by 30 tips in less than 300 pages.While not the most cutting edge book on the market anymore, 15 million copies later there is no denying the power of Carnegie's message or the need for it. There is a reason so many people have read this book.

This work that has stood the test of time well. Mr. Carnegie believed in becoming a better person, or perhaps businessman, and felt in order to do so one should follow the lessons he learned and presents in this book. Regardless of what you read in this book I feel that in the long run it is always the people with integrity and are principled that will have the best long term interpersonal experiences.Basically the book is written with a few principles about handling people by avoiding the negative and unpleasant, appreciating the other person, and making the other person eager to accomplish some goal of their own. Mr. Carnegie felt that if you provide positive feedback to the person that person will respond positively to you. His manipulative component is to then help the other person to link what you want to share with them with something they want. Because of this manipulative aspect you can see this is in fact a book on management and sales.

There comes a time when \\"what you know\\" becomes less important and \\"who you know\\" becomes most essential.

Dale Carnegie literally wrote the book on the subject and 70 years later, we all can see how this popular methodology has permanently changed how we interact...in management, in marketing, in sales, in any social situation.While not the complete discussion, the book is very well-written and easily read. It also is well organized in presenting the material and the theory is easily applied in real-world applications.

How do you get the best of an argument? Avoid them at all costs, they are not worth the price. Always show respect for others opinions. Never, ever, say \\"You are wrong.\\" This gains you nothing. If you are wrong, admit it quickly and emphatically. This is biblical from the mouth of Jesus, no less. Begin all encounters with people in a friendly way. Always get the other person saying yes, by finding common ground. Let the other person do a great deal of the talking, this is perceived as having great listening skills. Let the other person feel that the idea that you are presenting is his or hers. This is a skill. It is crucial to honestly see things from the other person's point of view. Be sympathetic with the other person's ideas and desires. Appeal to the nobler motives. Dramatize your ideas to make them unforgettable and convincing. Throw down a challenge, something for the other person to live up to. This appeals to the ego and desire to be important.A leader's job includes changing people's attitudes and behavior. Here is how to be a leader in a nutshell. Always begin with praise and honest appreciation. Call attention to people's mistakes indirectly and very discreetly. Talk about your own mistakes before criticizing the other person. Ask questions instead of giving direct orders. Let the other person save face, give them a way out. Praise the slightest improvement and praise every improvement. Be hearty in your approbation and lavish in your praise. Give the other person a fine reputation to live up to. Use encouragement to get results. Make any fault seem easy to correct. Make the other person happy about doing the thing you suggest.This is an excellent book within the realm of learning, developing, and using people skills. So many of us lack this level of tact and finesse, most of us would do well to read this book and put its principles into action. I believe all readers will get the money spent on this book back a thousand times over in the value it adds to your life if you put these principles in action and refer back to it before important conversations take place in your life.

So why am I reviewing this book? Once you delve into its pages, you will see that these old-time lessons (primarily meant for the business world), are applicable to every single one of us.When I first read Dale Carnegie's words, I felt humbled. The principles presented are all so simple, so full of common sense, and so positive, yet are things that we have either forgotten, or never fully learnt. It was refreshing to hear about how old American Presidents, business people, and leaders from around the world worked with people and got to where they did. It is all too easy to get so caught up in present day material, that we fail to utilize resources and lessons learnt in the past.There is a growing trend for people in one industry (such as we in sport and fitness), to broaden our horizons and look to the business world for ideas. They have to deal with bosses, colleagues, and customers. I have to deal with managers, physiotherapists & coaches, and work with players. The parallels with the business world become more and more apparent the more you think about it. If you are looking to learn from business books or resources, then you should without a doubt start with this one. It has been influencing people for over 70 years, and will serve as a great base from which to build.I will be looking to review more books of this kind as they can be of great use to anyone and everyone, and they also make for a nice change of pace from scientific literature.

But, I love the book because it certainly allows me to extract the lessons I've previously learned about genuinely caring and looking at others' desires, and that genuineness coming back to you (but, to not expect it to come back!).

However, there is a right way and a wrong way to do things and the wrong way won't really get you very far. This book outlines what should be obvious to intelligent people but for the most part is not. Mainly this is how to modify your behavior in such a way as to breed \\"good will\\" from others - whether in the short term to get them to see your point of view and agree with you, or the long term and make friends and allies out of them. The advice is simple and makes sense. Although written in a bit of an outdated style, the author fills the text with examples of how the strategies could work. I did find it a bit too rosy and simplistic sometimes, but the basic lessons ring true. I have already instituted some of the advise and of course it works.

Human behavior is pretty much the same as it ever was and put to proper use, the information in this book can truly help you win friends and influence people. At the very least, use these \\"people\\" skills to come out on the positive end of almost any kind of dispute, disagreement, or misunderstanding. Dealing with people in an adversarial situation is a strong point of Carnegie's teachings. Even if your adversary doesn't agree with you, they will probably like you or at least respect you and your opinion. I recently replaced my first copy, a 1960s era version, which I found at a garage sale. Missing (sadly) from the new edition is \\"outdated\\" information that is socially irrelevant today, but gives a glimpse of life not seen since the \\"Leave it to Beaver,\\" or \\"Father Knows Best\\" days. This book is an easy read, and should be re-read know and again to keep its lesson's fresh in your mind.

What we're actually talking about is that the United States, nearly 100 years after the book was written, is now firmly in a state of decline. In a society in decline the people are going to be hopeless, dissatisfied and isolated. No amount of insight into communicating with people is going to help you. You are dealing with an external problem; you can't change these people and you can't change nature and the fall of a society. It is a natural part of the life cycle, it happens.

As I read I kept thinking about where Carnegie's ideas led--to a culture of \\"making nice\\" at all costs and never confronting failure. The \\"make nice\\" culture which is prevalent today sinks companies, universities and cultures. When Carnegie lauds Lincoln for not confronting his general's failure to decisively end the war after Gettysburg, he effectively says it is better to lose thousands of innocent lives than to tell a general he has messed up! Carnegie says everyone needs to feel positive about themselves. This is true. But there are 2 choices for a leader and mentor--spurious praise vs. helping someone achieve. The emphasis on being interested in others in order to get them to do what you want also made me feel a bit queasy. There is no social conscience to the book. It will probably help you to get ahead in life, though."},{"Title":"How to Win Friends & Influence People (Cardinal Editions, C 303)","review":"Like most basic psychology, most of what this book preaches is common sense.

I STRONGLY RECOMMEND GOOGLING THE SUBJECT MATTER OVER BUYING A BOUND COPY. Here's what I already knew before reading the book, and pretty much what I gathered from it: (1) AVOID CULTURAL FAUX PAS: When in Rome, do as the Romans do. Learn your host environment before you go. (2) THE GOLDEN RULE (3) AVOID CRITICISM or CRITICIZING WHILE BEING NICE: As Stewie Griffin coined it, the \\"compliment sandwich.\\" (And the housekeeping \\"what if\\" scenario? Seriously? I'd ignore that one, BTW. Talk about your passive aggressiveness. If you are consistent in acknowledging a person's strong points, the occasional constructive criticism should not ruin a relationship.) (4) BODY LANGUAGE: Understanding body language varies across generations and geography. It is important, but there are more contemporary books that you can read for that. (5) FOCUS ON THE POSITIVES AND MOVING FORWARD: don't dwell on what's wrong and comparing a person's less desirable qualities to another person's qualities and don't dwell on the negatives of the past unless you're using them to learn and move improve. (6) THINK BEFORE YOU SPEAK. (7) KNOW YOUR AUDIENCE: and try to understand how they might interpret what you say/do.

It's a great book that stresses the important truth that people are emotional and not always logical. It shows that disagreements really can be resolved for the better by looking at things from another's perspective. Further, I loved how the author takes you right into the world of '20 and 30s and the unique characteristics of the time period like referring to experiences, in the first person, right after the 'Great War' and getting a friendly greeting from President Teddy Roosevelt. These intriguing tid-bits do not push away the relevance of the material but amazingly re-enforce it with the notion that you will begin to reveal to yourself how similarly people act, think, emotionally connect in that time period and ours. Then, you will begin to see why these teachings work naturally with our everyday social experiences."},{"Title":"How to Win Friends & Influence People (Cardinal Editions, C 303)","review":"Well, this is the grand dady of all social skills how to books from business to love and romance. I have the old fashioned politically incorrect version and have to re-read it to pick up the important points.Some people understandably don't like this sort of book. It could make one so superficial to do things by rote all because you want something - but Carnegie himself points this out and scorns selfish motives.It is ultimately about survival in a tough, competitive world and being genuinely nice to people - which naturally works. Especially good if you want to deal with Americans as Americans already know the lessons of this book and have studied it compared to continentals.No book can necessarily help you get a top job or win the love of your life, no matter how much they promise to - especially if you mechanically try and follow instructions supplied in them. But for general principles this book is so important.After all etiquette is something taught by Confucius, the Buddha and many historical personages - and this book has looked at all the greatest individuals before it came up with its strategies and rules of thumb.The original book was based on so much research (and I don't really want the update) - that it would repay study."},{"Title":"How to Win Friends & Influence People (Cardinal Editions, C 303)","review":"I read this book 15 years ago and the messages have stuck. This is the best book I have read on dealing with people."},{"Title":"How to Win Friends & Influence People (Cardinal Editions, C 303)","review":"Now, this book is not what I thought it would be. I thought this book was for people who just cannot communicate with people on a social level as in school or just out in the open. About making friends in general. Most of this book was about the workplace. Don't get me wrong, this book is pretty fantastic for the workplace. If you want a job, want a better job, want to be a good manager/leader, increase your connections, etc., this will help tremendously.I started to get the hint when Carnegie most of the time brought up examples of tycoons and presidents, that this wasn't going to be a \\"How to make friends book\\". It starts off with the basic, say hello, say their names, pat them on the pat, eye contacting, and it goes on and on. Though I did find it amusing this one part where he suggested make time for people (which is very true when it comes to making friends), that he would just listen to a woman talk, and said he would pretend to be interested in what the woman was saying. I'm sure this falls into the workplace category and making an impression, as opposed to actually making a friend. If someone wanted to make a friend, why on earth would you pretend to be interested in what they are saying? Unless you are a guy trying to get into some woman's pants (or vice versa). Then he mentions how he took the time to talk to a boss for about an hour about his dog, and just listened. Then the boss gave him a free dog, or an offer to get a free dog. Then he says, \\"See look! I got something free just for listening to this rich guy for 1-2 hours!\\". He was showing that making time for others can be beneficial. Yeah well, I don't want peoples assets, I would like their FRIENDSHIP. Things like this, I just did not like in the book. I don't want to be fake.The book however is well written. It's a bit repetitive though. Carnegie has a LOT of examples that are well written out from start to finish. But it can be a bit boring when you already understand what he's saying, and then you find out you still have some pages to go about something he's has already explained enough about.This book is also NOT for the introverted or shy. I know this is the last thing the author may have thought about, but just to put this book in a different light, this is not for the ones who don't want to put themselves out there. First you have to evaluate your own self and be comfortable with yourself, as well as be confident. If you are not, read books about self-esteem, confidence, shyness, etc first before diving into this book IF you want to have a successful BUSINESS and be a good boss or leader.Honestly to sum up this book : Be good to people, make time for them, ask questions and suggest things that would benefit another person rather than criticizing, do not insult others, smile, remember names, pretend to be interested in people (unless you really like them I guess).When I get a job in the corporate world, I would definitely try to read this book again. Though his bold words at the end of each chapter, pretty much sum up what he says. He just has a lot of examples to show how effective his advice is.This book is more for Workplace friends... the people you go to when you need a favor, then you don't talk to them until you need another favor!"},{"Title":"How to Win Friends & Influence People (Cardinal Editions, C 303)","review":"Overall, very good points as well as a good read.

The principles to make a good impression are to give a simple smile, to recall others&iexcl; name and to be a good listener.

Short interesting stories of an anonymous individual performing some virtuous act. The stories climax when we realize that the anonymous person is someone famous like Abraham Lincoln, Charles Schwab or Theodore Roosevelt. There's not much need to highlight this text as Carnegie summarizes his main \\"principle\\" at the end of each chapter, then again at the end of each unit.I enjoyed this book because Carnegie can take profound ethical ideas and turn them into digestible nuggets of practical advice. For example he quotes William James as saying \\"the deepest principle in human nature is the craving to be appreciated, \\"as reason why to use his first principle in handling people -- Don't criticize, condemn or complain. Lao-tse said, \\"The reason why rivers and seas receive the homage of a hundred mountain streams is that they keep below them-so too should the sage. Dale Carnegie says, \\"Use Principle 7: Let the other person feel that the idea is his or hers.Like many principles of human behavior Carnegie's seem like common sense: Show respect for others opinions: Never say \\"You're wrong.\\" Others seem so obvious: a person's name is the most important thing to them.

He explained the real value in looking at things from the customer's point-of-view vs mine. He basically said that praise raises and uplifts while criticism kills and gums up the machinery. He said that most men and women are motivated by a set of motives which are not generally taught in the public educational system or from the preacher's pulpit as being the real motives behind what lots of people do. He explained human nature to me and allowed me to get along with all sorts of people a little better. I thank God for Dale Carnegie's honesty and his insights into the gift of empathy.

I found that book way to technical and theorectical. In direct contrast, Dale Carnegie writes in a simple language without any sort of technical jargon and illustrated his points with real-life examples. I've yet to find a better book on EQ."},{"Title":"How to Win Friends & Influence People (Cardinal Editions, C 303)","review":"Dale Carnegie wrote a fantastic book. He writes about success principles that he and others have used to become leaders and build cooperative relationships. I can tell a differece in how people respond to me since trying to use these principles. People smile back and are much friendlier. One reason I think this book is so successful is because the concepts are very simple. For the most part, all of his principles can be found under, \\"Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.\\" If one tries to understand how their actions are going to make others feel before they act, they have gone a long way to winning friends and influencing people. Another thing that I like about Carnegie's book is that it is all based on sincerity. All of the advice he gives provide win/win situations. Nobody loses; he does not try to manipulate or deceive people. I believe Carnegie had an honest interest in people and wanted everyone to acheive to their highest ability. The principles in this book helps one help others as well as help oneself. Truly a fantastic book."},{"Title":"How to Win Friends & Influence People (Cardinal Editions, C 303)","review":"Get this book.

This edition was edited by family members to update some of the more dated examples, but I found it refreshingly relevent to the ins and outs of interpersonal relationships, especially as it pertains to the business and working world.Absolutely a must-read if you want to hone your interpersonal skills--and you'll wind up being a more productive person, and even more important to the rest of us, more enjoyable to be around."},{"Title":"How to Win Friends & Influence People (Cardinal Editions, C 303)","review":"Dale Carnegie wrote this incredible book almost seventy years ago. What he said still rings true today.The secret of success is to enlist the willing help of others. You can't do it alone.Dale Carnegie knew that. And he shows you how to attract and motivate others, with short truisms such as:\\"give honest and sincere appreciation\\"\\"show respect for the other person's opinion\\"\\"talk in terms of the other person's interest\\"\\"when you are wrong, admit it quickly and emphatically\\"Simple? Yes. Corny? perhaps.But true and effective. The world changes, but the way people act and react to each other does not. Human nature is still the same. The plays of Shakespeare speak to us over the ages because they talk about human nature - a nature that is true and unchanging.So too does Dale Carnegie's book.If you want to have a happy, successful life, you need to read this book - and put what he says into practice.Peter Simmons Author - The Next Crash"},{"Title":"How to Win Friends & Influence People (Cardinal Editions, C 303)","review":"Granted a lot of the lessons in this book fall under the category of &quot;common sense,&quot; but the genius of this book is how it simplifies these lessons, provides real-life examples and then teaches us the reasons for their true effectiveness.Although this book is several decades old, the take-aways are timeless. There can be no dismissing the fact that this book can enable you to become a better leader and a better communicator - even a better person.It is well worth buying a copy of this book, and reading it every few years."},{"Title":"How to Win Friends & Influence People (Cardinal Editions, C 303)","review":"If you are looking for a book on how to win friends and influence people through intimidation or manipulation this is not the book for you.On the contrary...The crux of this book is-to listen to other people when they talk to you. To pay closed attention to their problems. To have genuine interest in their lives. That's what this book is all about.Although I am overly simplifying this book, I do feel that this is a GREAT book. Why? Because it's message is so important to heed in our times of high tech, high pressure, high stress, etc. We seem to have no time to listen to each other any more. There are so many distractions. Applying the principles in this book is the answer. We need to give our friends more time. More attention. Then you will have devoted friends and great relationships.Zev Saftlas, Author of Motivation That Works: How to Get Motivated and Stay Motivated"},{"Title":"How to Win Friends & Influence People (Cardinal Editions, C 303)","review":"It's one of the best books I've ever read. He pointed out nearly every way to &quot;win friends and influence people&quot;. Althought he made good points and use appropriate examples to illustrate, some of these too specific examples are not up-to-date. If we imitate the way those characters in his example acted, it may be awkward. Fortunately, he did give 9 suggestions to get most out of this book, which always encourage you to apply these principles by your own way.Therefore what we need to do is: (1) follow the principles (2)read the examples to understand the principles (3) forget the example and learn by heart only the principles (4) apply the principles by your own way."},{"Title":"How to Win Friends & Influence People (Cardinal Editions, C 303)","review":"This is the greatest book I have ever read.

I only finished it last week, but I already know that these skills will be priceless for me, and will make me more money than any other skill. Each book is more than worth it's weight in gold.

This book talks about ethics, humility, and communcation skills that are all necessary to build an effective team whether in the last century or in this one. This is a five-star book all the way."},{"Title":"How to Win Friends & Influence People (Cardinal Editions, C 303)","review":"The only reason I didn't give this book five stars is because it tells one too many stories and doesn't suggest more ways to becoming this wonderful person. Basically it says to be nice. But I loved all the ideas."},{"Title":"How to Win Friends & Influence People (Cardinal Editions, C 303)","review":"I'm halfway through this book and am already inclined to give it 5 stars. I tend to do that with products that offer me valuable insight and information that enables me to run my small business better. The concepts in the book are very simple and straightforward and at times you may slap your forward and say; \\"well duh!\\" But it's often the most simplistic things that we as human beings overlook and stubbornly take for granted, such as remembering other people's names and trivial information about them.If the people who leave poor reviews for this book actually got nothing out of reading it, then why did they pick it up in the first place, did the title not give it away? I would have to say that although I found some of the advice in the book to be basic, if you apply it consistently, then you will have success working with other people. Like everything else, practice makes perfect. It also makes you feel good to make other people feel good- at work, the grocery store and even at home.We live in a self-centered society where it's all about ME-ME-ME, and the old fashioned viewpoint explained in the book has become obsolete in today's society. I'm not sure it's fair to give this book less than 3 STARS unless your book had pages ripped out, or you just wanted to be sarcastic and negative for no apparent reason.

AWESOME BOOK A MUST READ FOR PEOPLE WHO THINK THEY KNOW IT ALL. :)"},{"Title":"How to Win Friends & Influence People (Cardinal Editions, C 303)","review":"Dale Carnegie's \\"How to Win Friends &amp; Influence People\\" is said to have been the first book to have ever influenced a generation and subsequent generations to the vast extent of collecting successes and making successes of its readers with every copy sold. If so, it is still the best book of its kind. Now, you might ask why. Well, here's why: The book reads like your own personal guide for achieving successes on all three most important fronts in your life: social, personal, and professional.Divided into four parts, the text comprises of four titled sections by the names of \\"Fundamental Techniques of Handling People,\\" \\"Six Ways to Make People Like You,\\" \\"How to Win People to Your Way of Thinking,\\" and \\"Be a Leader: How to Change People Without Giving Offense or Arousing Resentment.\\" Be forewarned, however, that the author is not just talking about applying these techniques to appropriate occasions but is asking of its readers to center their lifestyle on application of these techniques. To be sure, a good, avid, and interested reader will be able to finish reading this book within a space of a day or two. But only a reader willing to make a lifetime habit of utilizing these studied techniques will be able to achieve maximum results and is sure to continue rereading this many times for aforesaid purpose.Penned in a simple way, the concepts offered in this book are extremely easy to understand. Amazing though the ideas are, it seems to me that the novelty lies not in the ideas itself but in its presentation and its easy translation from abstraction into action by any persons. Whenever a concept is introduced, it is reiterated by historical and modern-day examples of leaders and working men and women who have applied these methods to sure-fire successes. Of course, some of these concepts will have you thinking \\"Oh, I know this,\\" but you are sure to be amazed at how much the difference is between knowing something and understanding it for purpose of its utilization.Come to think of it, you can say that this book in some ways acts as a substitute guru from whom you are to relearn U. Thant's observation, \\"Every human being, of whatever origin, of whatever station, deserves respect. We must each respect others even as we respect ourselves.\\" It sounds simple, doesn't it? Of course, many of us do not remember this when we see a co-worker make a blunder, a child not complete his or her list of chores, a life partner nagging at us to take out the garbage, or a boss criticizing our supposedly slipshod work, or a friend disagreeing with us a subject, now do we? But the lesson to remember is that we must respect them irrespective of whatever their feelings, opinions, or actions are in contradiction to our own. Why? Well, because, with the presence of respect between any two individuals, coming to an understanding will not be as difficult and Carnegie's techniques will help us reach a positive conclusion with positive methods.Furthermore, this book will also help you to be a better person in life and to be better liked for it. Let's face it: we all, to some degree if not more, covet approval and popularity. Now, we can get it with mastery of concepts as simple as a smile or withholding our tongue to avoid an argument. Though this is a great book for any occupation, people in customer service and sales will especially appreciate the value of concepts stressed here. For those of you who have to work in groups, you will love the constructive methods listed here to better help you with tricky situations that might arise.For those of you who are refraining from buying this book due to the suggestive title of the book, you will be surprised to find that techniques written here do not involve manipulation but genuine interest in improving relations with people in general. In fact, Carnegie is asking us to practice and adopt sincerity in our methods to find successes; for example, he describes the dangers of flattery and proposes its substitution with genuine appreciation. He asks us not to underestimate the estimation of other people where insincerity is concerned; no body is a fool and will see you coming a mile away if you reek of artificiality.Moreover, the tone of the author is that of a mentor and friend having an intimate chat with you for all the problems in your life characteristic of those seeking improvement in themselves for betterment of their relations with other humans. For a book that has all the qualities I look for in a great book, I was stupefied by the fact that it not only surpassed by expectations but gave me a new perspective on life and relations. I have given the book a five-star rating because I think any less would not have adequately expressed the high esteem in which I hold this book and the author which wrote it with such human insight.

I guess my answer would be because the book deserves it. Although I don't say it lightly, I think 'How to Win Friends and Influence People' is essential reading that should be on every bookshelf. In fact, I would rank this book in the top ten books I've ever read in terms of it's practical impact in my life. In it Carnegie discusses a set of social skills that will bring positivity into not only the lives of everyone around you but yours as well. The real value of the book comes from Carnegie's ability to provide examples - through storytelling - of how these social skills look in real life. In other words, he doesn't just give trite platitudes, but actually demonstrates what it means to respect people, because that's really what the whole book (and all genuinely positive people skills) comes down to: Respect.Granted, the book was written in the 1930s, and some of Carnegie's language and examples reflect a different time period, which comes across a bit \\"hokey\\" by modern standards. BUT, the principles he discusses are universal and easily adaptable to any modern context, plus it's a very quick and easy read (most junior high kids would have no trouble finishing it in a couple of hours). Each time I read the book (I've read it many times), I'm struck with how rarely people (including me I'm ashamed to admit) actually use these principles, which should be a given since in some ways they're so incredibly obvious.This book teaches much about human nature. It's uplifting, wholesome, positive, and addresses a very deep and meaningful subject, but yet it's totally accessible and practical. If everyone behaved according to this book, the world would be a much better place."},{"Title":"How to Win Friends & Influence People (Cardinal Editions, C 303)","review":"The book is great.

He wrote this book based on stories and experiences gained from night classes he taught on Public Speaking (not at a college) and reading on the subjects.All of the advice is still useful. He uses specific examples (stories) to show and prove his points. It is unbelievable how well the advice in the book stands the test of time. A great read for people ending High School or freshman sophomore year of college in my mind, but useful to anyone at anytime. For personal or business use."},{"Title":"How to Win Friends & Influence People (Cardinal Editions, C 303)","review":"This is an excellent treatise on interpersonal relationships, and one that has stood the test of time. A simple, unpretentious book filled to the brim with social wisdom and packed with anecdotes. You could say that much of what is written herein is common sense, but if it is then we take it for granted because far too many people are lacking in good manner. If everyone made an effort to apply these principles in their daily lives then I have no doubt that the world would become an infinitely more pleasant place. Now, some people accuse Dale Carnegie of being shallow and manipulative, but I didn't get that vibe at all. In fact, he repeatedly makes a point of stating that you should not be reading his book if your intention is to take advantage of people. The core message is that to make a friend, you must first *be* a friend. Most of the book is spent discussing how to look at the good in every situation and become a friendlier and more polite individual, how to be a good listener, how to sympathize with the viewpoints of others, how to avoid causing unnecessary offense, conflict, etc.Still, there are two key things to remember when reading this book: One is that all interaction must be sincere and come from the heart, shallow flattery will only backfire on you (and the author says as much in the book); if you truly have nothing nice to say to a person, either be open about it or don't say anything at all. Be honest, not manipulative. The other thing to remember is that some people (a small minority) are just impossible to deal with regardless of how diplomatic you are and these principles only apply in full when interacting with someone of sound and sober mind; alcoholics, drug-addicts, paranoid schizophrenics etc. may have trouble appreciating and reciprocating your efforts at geniality (this little caveat is not mentioned in the book). That aside, I'm of the opinion that this is one of those rare gems that should be taught in public schools, and it's worth keeping a copy around the house."},{"Title":"How to Win Friends & Influence People (Cardinal Editions, C 303)","review":"What a fantastic read -- strategies to apply not only in business but at home with your kids !!I would recommend it to everyone!"},{"Title":"How to Win Friends & Influence People (Cardinal Editions, C 303)","review":"This book's title caught my eye some months ago during one of the trips to the bookshop. Is it really possible to win friends and influence people? I have a keen interest in psychology and motivating others and needed some quick, practical suggestions on doing things.

The book was just 267 pages and I was sure of going through it in a few weeks, reading at a leisurely pace.This is an incredible book!

This book provides content about handling people, influencing people by making them like you and win them to your way of thinking and ultimately lead them. What I like about this book particularly are, first, it is very direct. The concepts are laid out in a very concise, precise and simple manner. Second they are supported by an onslaught of examples both from history and the author's personal experience. Finally what takes this book to another level are the unlimited applications of the principles presented: in one's personal life, professional career etc. This book will definitely be one of my staples go to books on people skills for the years to come and my top recommended reading.

This is a must read for anyone who wishes to get ahead in business as well as their personal life. It should not just be read once and put away. In order to benefit from this book the most, you must study it and take notes. There is nothing in this book that any leader of high standing would disagree with. Also, if you observe people closely you will see that the most successful people have the same qualities discussed in this book. There are people who do manage to somehow get ahead without having many of the qualities discussed, but they are anomolies. The more you know and implement which is contained in this book, the easier it will be for you to get along with others and be appreciated. There is a reason why so many corporations spend millions teaching their employees what is in this book... it actually works."},{"Title":"How to Win Friends & Influence People (Cardinal Editions, C 303)","review":"I've made this book required reading for all my supervisory staff.Don't let the title fool you - this isn't a book about how to manipulate people into liking you and doing what you want. It's a manual for how to deal effectively with people, and it's probably one of the most important books you'll ever read.Basic principles of human relations do exist, and yet who ever teaches them to you? In my judgement the principles outlined in Carnegie's book are so critical that they ought to be taught in all schools and universities and be required reading for anyone in any profession that has to work with people. That's why I make it required reading for any of my staff who are in supervisory positions.The book is written in a loose, easy style that is a pleasure to read in either long sittings or quick bites. It short on lecturing and long on stories and examples of how great people such as Abraham Lincoln, Andrew Carnegie, Theodore Roosevelt, and everyday people like you and I, have used these principles to succeed.I would rate this book as one of the top 5 most influential and important books I've ever read. I've personally read it three times in the last 4 years, and I am always amazed at how dramatic the effects are when I'm reminded of the principles and apply them in my day to day dealings with people.If you don't like to read I highly recommend the book on CD - it is really well done, pleasant to listen too (remember, long on interesting and inspiring stories and examples of the principles at work), and best of all tremendously convenient.

The book goes down to the basics to teach you why most of our approaches to making friends or influencing people are flawed. Mr. Carnegie makes us think about our approach to daily problems and teaches us what simple adjustments go a long way in making the other person perceive us as friendly and approachable, and make them actually want to be our friends and help us!This book was written decades ago, and it is just as applicable in today's daily life. The techniques used by Abraham Lincoln decades ago to approach problems with other people during his life are just as powerful today, and Carnegie presents some of them in this magnificent book. I would recommend this book to anyone. Unless you feel that you have mastered how to deal with people on a daily basis, I am confident there are some valuable lessons for you to learn from this book."},{"Title":"How to Win Friends & Influence People (Cardinal Editions, C 303)","review":"There is something spiritual about using the tongue to win friends and influence people. Although the original work was written at a time of economic distress, it speaks volumes about the way we must communicate with others in a spirit of love and understanding. It tells us in its deepest context to \\"consider the interest of others, as we consider our own interest.\\" (Phil 2:4)"},{"Title":"How to Win Friends & Influence People (Cardinal Editions, C 303)","review":"I originally picked this book up on a lark, because I thought from the title that it would be full of the most terrible manipulative thinking and would be great fun to pick apart. Well, six years after getting the book, I'm still reading it at least twice a year. It's that good.There are a lot of criticisms of the book that I sort of shake my head at. I can't really comment on this version of the book, seeing as how I have a pre-1981 edition; in 1981, two whole sections of this book were cut out and other edits may have been made. But I would like to address two criticisms in particular--or rather give some food for thought.1. People say this book advocates you being a doormat.I can see how people would have gotten this impression, to a certain extent, especially if they dropped the book halfway through (which is their right, if they feel the book is not worthwhile). If your entire set of interactions with people involves simply agreeing with everything they say, then I say you have good reason to feel like you are being treated like a doormat. However, Carnegie devoted a whole section--the last section, in the 1981 edition--to techniques for criticizing people without causing offense. It is possible and in fact entirely healthy to find ways to make your views known (even if they're not flattering views) without giving offense. The book teaches you how in the section \\"How to Change People Without Giving Offense or Arousing Resentment.\\" My advice is that if you start getting frustrated because the book is making you feel like you have to be a doormat, please skip to that section and give it a read. If you still feel as if you're required to be something you would rather not be, then by all means drop the book. I will tell you that I faithfully follow the precepts in this book and still manage to make my opinion heard in such a way that I feel like I am able to make corrections and state the truth--but I can do it without giving offense thanks to the techniques in this book.2. This book advocates you not being honest.I can tell you from reading the book that there are one or two anecdotes that talk about people who have lied to get their way. I don't approve of lying. However--the main thrust of the book is not about lying or manipulating, and Carnegie made it clear that if you don't practice these techniques with a sincere heart that you will meet with failure (which is correct and good, because nobody likes a flatterer). There are two anecdotes where people lie that I can think of in the book, so I'd like to address these two.The first is that at a dinner party, someone says \\"Don't correct the people; they don't like that.\\" In that context, I actually agree with this advice--but only in that context, and here's why. Carnegie (in the story) originally baldly came out and said \\"sir, you are wrong. This is how it is.\\" And you should never ever ever EVER do that. INSTEAD, you should say \\"I thought it that this was the case, not that.\\" So, for example, if someone quotes something as being in the Bible and you know it's from Shakespeare, you never say \\"You're wrong; that's from Shakespeare.\\" You say, \\"I thought that was from Shakespeare; but perhaps I'm wrong.\\"The best part is that this is entirely right, and true. You do think it's from Shakespeare, and you could perhaps be wrong (you're not automatically right you know!). This opens the door for friendly debate instead of causing you to fruitlessly butt heads with someone! Carnegie advocates this technique in the very next chapter.The second story involves a man who lies and says that he will say his singer has a bad cold before the singer goes onstage. Now, there are two things that I want to point out here. The first is that this is for business, not interpersonal relations. You cannot always be 100% honest in the workplace; instead of being able to tell a customer exactly what you think, you must be diplomatic and follow your company's policy. This doesn't really apply to the above because the man is high up enough that he can afford to be honest. But, it bears mentioning. The second is that if you don't like the advice given, then you don't have to follow it. Think about what you're taking in and don't follow it off a cliff! There are plenty of ways that you can be honest in most business dealings. You don't have to sacrifice your integrity.3. This book would have you fake interest in people's hobbies and interests in order to make them like you.I would like to quote from the book, if that's okay. Carnegie is talking here about speaking with a botanist at a party, and at his surprise at being called an excellent conversationalist when all he did was listen. He accounts for it like so:\\"I had done this: I had listened intently. I had listened because I was genuinely interested. [ . . . ] I went even further than giving him rapt attention. I was 'hearty in my approbation and lavish in my praise.'I told him I had been immensely entertained and instructed--and I had. I told him I wished that I had his knowledge--and I do. I told him I should love to wander the fields with him--and I should. I told him I must see him again--and I must.And so I had him thinking of me as a good conversationalist when, in reality, I had been merely a good listener and encouraged him to talk.\\"Now, if you were expected to listen to every person with the same rapt attention, I can see how you would feel like Carnegie's advice was insincere. But--here's the thing--you aren't required to do that. You can choose your friends, and you can choose which people you listen to. If you don't want to be friends with someone, you don't have to win him as a friend. So take the advice, but don't run off a cliff with it! Don't feel like you have to be this way to everyone, because you don't!4. Some people will still take advantage of you even if you are nice and use these techniques.Again, don't run off the cliff with Mr. Carnegie's advice. If you have determined that someone isn't worth talking to, then by all means don't talk to him or her. There are some customers and people that aren't worth the trouble.If you keep these things in mind while reading the book, I think you'll enjoy it very much and get a lot of help out of it. I do recommend getting the pre-1981 edition if you can (Amazon sells hardback copies of it, actually). But then, I always recommend reading books unabridged, so take this with a grain of salt."},{"Title":"How to Win Friends & Influence People (Cardinal Editions, C 303)","review":"After I graduated college, my father gave me this book to read so I wouldn't be so reticent. Wow, I read it one time and started implementing Dale Carnegie's ideas at work and became very friendly with everyone. I wish I had read this when I was much younger.

A must have for anyone who deals with people and values their relationships with others. Dale Carnegie writes in a way so that you remember what he says and start to apply it right away. He's committed to his reader's success and it's evident in the way he writes."},{"Title":"How to Win Friends & Influence People (Cardinal Editions, C 303)","review":"This book can, and will change your life if you will only take the time to read it, absorb the material and put it into practice and the great thing is it's so easy! It was only once I read this book that I realized where I was going wrong both in my social and professional interactions with others, come to think of it, I'm amazed anyone liked me at all! The content of this book, even though it was written years and years ago, is just as valid now as it was then because people don't change. Everyone, no matter who they are wants to be respected, to be appreciated, to be listened to, to be accepted, to feel like they matter; these things will never change whether the year is 1936 or 2050 because human nature is what it is.What is astounding is that so many people just have no clue when it comes to social interaction and conversing with others yet they could easily correct all this with one reading of \\"How To Win Friends And Influence People\\". I personally know a girl who is 32 years old and is stunningly beautiful yet she doesn't have a friend in the world, still lives at home with her parents and cannot find a partner no matter how hard she tries because the only person she thinks about is herself, she has no interest in anything else. Her personality, to put it bluntly, is quite frankly repulsive. It is so frustrating for me because I know her life could improve so dramatically if she would only read this book and put the principles into practice but I know that if I suggested she read it, she would be insulted. So many people say that what Carnegie has to say is \\"obvious\\". Well if that is the case, why do so few practice these simple principles?There is a good reason that this book has been around for years and is one of the best selling books of all time- it's because it's true and it works. So many self help books have since tried to rip off Carnegie's principles and regurgitate the material to try and make a fast buck but his book is still the original and by far the best. Buy it, read it, and your life will change for the better- that's a promise."},{"Title":"How to Win Friends & Influence People (Cardinal Editions, C 303)","review":"This book is chock full of practical, common sense advice. Want people to like you? Show you like THEM, smile, be honestly happy to see them, remember their names, be interested in them, listen to them, etc. Want to influence them? Don't argue or tell them they are wrong (even if they are), but honestly emphasize where they are right, compliment them, and start with your areas of agreement. Want to be a leader? Ecourage people, praise them, listen to them, ask them questions. Of course, the examples in this book require us to apply honesty and common sense, and if so, this book is quite helpful. Sadly, too many of us fail to heed the advice in these pages. We can all do better, and this book can help us do so."},{"Title":"How to Win Friends & Influence People (Cardinal Editions, C 303)","review":"I think anyone who decides to read Dale Carnegie's book, \\"How to Win Friends and Influence People\\" will not regret it and it will be very beneficial to them. My first thought was this was going to be a dry self-help book that would take forever to finish. I was seriously wrong - I guess I judged the book by its cover. The book was very easy to read and flowed nicely. It's a great book to learn from and improve your social skills. He talked about how to deal with people, how to get people to think your way, and how to get people to like you. He talks about so many principles and techniques that are common sense, but you would not realize them until you are told them. For example, he talked about not criticizing others because by doing that will not get people to like you or to get them to do something for you. It will only make them despise you and not be cooperative - makes sense! Also, he talked about simple gestures to make people like you. Simple as smiling at a person, showing that you are interested in them and what they have to say, and just making a person feel important. He explains that people want to feel important and feel appreciated - that people crave that feeling more than anything. I liked that Carnegie talked about his own mistakes and experiences. He even talked about his friends / acquaintances, and even famous, powerful people and how they learned to change their ways when dealing with others and on how to understand and communicate more efficiently with others. One other thing that I really liked was that the book was written in the 30's and all the principles and techniques Carnegie described can still be applied over 70 years later. This is a good book to check out!"},{"Title":"How to Win Friends & Influence People (Cardinal Editions, C 303)","review":"Mark Twain once said that a classic is a book everyone agrees is great but that nobody reads. You've probably heard of this book at least once in your life (usually in a satirical context) and never thought to read it. By all means, pick up a copy and read it cover to cover. For, despite the manipulative nature of its title, \\"How to Win Friends\\" is really a much-needed primer on how to be a pleasant person. All too often we speak but do not listen, and unless we hone our listening skills we stand little chance of either being agreeable company or persuade others. The entire book reminds us to listen more, and speak less.This is a lesson that most of us need to relearn. I've worked in academia, the public sector, and the private sector. Many of us have been encouraged to believe that insulting people like Simon Cowell does or making snarky comments ala \\"Queer Eye for the Straight Guy\\" is both witty and endearing. It isn't, and it could cost you valuable allies in the workplace. We've confused rudeness with assertiveness.Anyone who has achieved any real success in the world knows the value of good communication and basic integrity, and this is what the book aims to teach. This is not a recipe for overnight success, but it does contain tools that become more valuable in time. In anything, given the selfish combative nature of much of contemporary society, this book deserves a wider readership. There are no tricks here to make people instantly like you, and this is not a compendium on how to lie and cheat your way to the top.My version of the book is the 7Oth anniversary edition, and features some updated material. I've no idea what the original book's text read like in its entirety but even in its revised state, the language and examples are clearly from an earlier era. Those readers who are used to snappier contemporary writing may find this difficult. For me, Carnegie's leisurely and folksy retellings of anecdotes is very charming. My main caveat with this book is that its central premise only works if you, too, are dealing with an essentially honest and decent person who is not a raving egomaniac. Such a person will likely not be receptive to your best attempts to be nice and cooperative. Furthermore, there are many, many people for whom gratitude is fleeting; I doubt any of those people would remember you kindly because you showed them the courtesy of listening to them.I strongly recommend this book as a college graduation present, and for yearly re-reading. I'm glad I bought my copy and wish I had started reading it 15 years ago. It's a worthwhile reading experience."},{"Title":"How to Win Friends & Influence People (Cardinal Editions, C 303)","review":"Dale Carnegie wrote a timeless book. I am so amazed that this book was first published in 1936 and its words of wisdom still ring true in 2007. \\"How to Win Friends & Influence People\\" has such gems of insight as taking interest in other people. How do you do this? You take your attention off yourself, and truly listen to what others have to say from their point of view. As I've been practicing this suggestion I find that my communication with friends and co-workers flourishes. I had a great day at work today. As people would come to my cubicle and ask questions, I really listened. And magically they were no longer interruptions throughout my day, but fun moments of relationship. And I got more work done because I didn't waste time complaining, comparing or judging in my thoughts while they were speaking with me.As Dale Carnegie was a pioneer and expert in human relations in his day, Ariel and Shya Kane are Masters in today's world. In their books, Being Here: Modern Day Tales of Enlightenment, How To Create a Magical Relationship and Working on Yourself Doesn't Work: A Book About Instantaneous Transformation, I have found that my relationships have blossomed. The Kanes teach the art of listening. As I integrate the principles mentioned in their award winning books, I am more effective, productive and satisfied in all aspects of my life. Life is all about relating. I am grateful that there are authors such as Carnegie and the Kanes who share the secrets to experiencing magical relationships."},{"Title":"How to Win Friends & Influence People (Cardinal Editions, C 303)","review":"Is there anyone who is not a self-help expert? With thousands upon thousands of self-help books in an endless parade of banality, how is it Dale Carnegie's signature book remains? Simply put, people do not change with time. The basic needs to be apprecaited, to feel important, to be listened to and be loved have remained constants throughout human history. It is the ability to tap into these timeless principles that makes this book equally timeless. I won't say that there are not dated references (gangsters in New York, George Eastman, etc.), however, if you overlook these minor points, Dale Carnegie's classic remains as relevant as the day it was published."},{"Title":"How to Win Friends & Influence People (Cardinal Editions, C 303)","review":"Wow, I can't say enough about this book. This is definitely one of the best books I have ever read. I would say it is just as good as \\"The Power of Your Subconscious Mind\\", but the anecdotes are not as interesting in this book. Still, you probably can not find better writing or more focused writing from any other non-fiction book than from this one.Each chapter talks about an important rule. And the rule is boxed-in at the end of each chapter. These chapters/rules are then further categorized according to their uses. The first 3 rules are fundamental ones for getting along with people. The next 6 rules are for making people like you. The next 12 pertain to how you can make other people do stuff for you. And the last 9 are for effective leadership skills.I just know that everything in this book is true because while reading each chapter, I can recall a time or times in my life that actually followed the rule. The thing is, back then I had no idea what was happening. After reading this book, I can actually learn from my past! Talk about effectiveness!There is a preface or introduction in the book that tells you how to use this book. This may probably be the most important chapter in the whole book. But in case you forget to read it, it basically tells you to re-read this book and highlight important points so you can go back to it on a regular basis. I think most of us probably won't read this book more than once. I know I won't; so I copy down just the rules on a separate piece of paper so I can go over them each month. Maybe you would want to do this at the very LEAST! The truth is, I think they are that important to warrant for such memorization. You don't believe me? I work in sales and for over half a year I couldn't sell this guy my product and after reading this book and using the rules, I finally sold it to him!If you are reading this review and have gone this far, make sure you force yourself to read this book. If not, you have just wasted thirty seconds for nothing, NOTHING! Most of all, it would be a real pity, not because you wasted a few seconds reading my review, but because you have come so close to becoming a master communicator. Read it and memorize the rules."},{"Title":"How to Win Friends & Influence People (Cardinal Editions, C 303)","review":"This book isn't for those who want something to happen over night. Dale Carnegie is one of the authors that make you feel that he is actually talking to you when you read his books. I kept this book on my night stand for about two years because trying to win friends and influence is a learning process. I kept it as a instant reminder just in case if I forgot certain things that were in the book. This book was recommeneded because I was a trying to get a job as a salesman.

The author's breezy style seems odd these days but adds warmth and charm. I attended training 5 years ago based largely on this book and Dale's other books, listened to the audio version and read the book. My manager at the time did not recommend it, even though his boss required all of his reports to take this training. I am glad I took it -- for me it was just what I needed. Much will seem like common sense (or will become so for the reader), however I found a couple of insights quite revealing (that people like to be treated as people rather than roles, that everybody likes to feel important and loves the sound of their own name) and very useful. Even the more obviously points act as good reminders. This book is *NOT* about tricking, hypnotizing or otherwise manipulating people unethically -- on the contrary, it is about understanding and getting along with people. I prefer to work with people who have taken this training because they are easier to work with.

Carnegie developed these principles by drawing from examples of persuasive people in history, like Abraham Lincoln, and from his own experiences. Since Carnegie wrote his book in 1935, many of his examples will of course seem dated, but his basic principles are timeless, eminently useable and presented in an easy-to-read and personal style. We [...] recommend this classic to everyone, since even in the 66 years since Carnegie published this book, no one has said it better."},{"Title":"How to Win Friends & Influence People (Cardinal Editions, C 303)","review":"One might well characterize this famous author as the Ben Franklin of our era; a kindly philosopher dispensing wit and wisdom. Wherever you are in life, his tried, proved observations on how to get along with your fellow man (without manipulation) will help you get more of what you want. The overwhelming proof lies in the fact that over 15 million copies have been sold, and it has been translated into every known written language.Why this is an American classic is best summed up in a quote from the jacket: \\"The sole purpose of this book is to help you solve the biggest problem you face: The problem of getting along with and influencing people in your everyday business and social contacts.\\"Carnegie referred to his book as \\"A working handbook on human relations\\" and so it is. He sets down nine principles that change attitude and behavior along with true stories. The story examples may seem a bit dated, but don't let it bother you that you don't know the people mentioned in the book. It's easy to fit contemporary personalities into them and the end result is the same. Bedrock principles of human behavior are revealed and illustrated.A few Carnegie gems: \\"It's easier to criticize and condemn than it is to try to understand where the other person is coming from. \\"Keep in mind that people are not creatures of logic, but rather of emotion, pride, vanity and prejudice. \\"The deepest urge in people is the desire to be important. \\"Exude courage, frankness and good cheer. \\"If you are wrong, admit it quickly and emphatically. \\"Welcome disagreement, distrust your first impressions, control your temper, thank opp9onents for their interest, postpone action until you think it through. \\"People usually have at least two reasons for doing something: one that sounds good and the real reason. \\"Nothing works in every situation. \\"Dramatize what you have to present. \\"Make it vivid and interesting. \\"Praise lavishly and show honest appreciation.\\"Once you thoroughly understand what Author Carnegie is saying about how to get along with people and get what you both want, it's easy to practice the principles. But we forget, so it's a good idea to have your personal copy and re-read it at least once a year. Pick up a copy just to have it around."},{"Title":"How to Win Friends & Influence People (Cardinal Editions, C 303)","review":"I believe that this book's goal is to convince the reader that humans have a desire to feel appreciated and important. In fact, who doesn't like to feel important? Do you like to be criticized by your loved ones or your superior? Certainly, I don't. I just feel miserable when my boss make fun of me or find faults with me. I hate to say it, but I think there are a lot of supervisors and employers out there who just don't know how to handle with people and their employees. That is just my opinion.Reading this book has given me new insights on how to influence people. Before, I have zero people skills. But now, I find an excuse to talk to the cashier at my cafeteria. I thank people more (like my postman and my custodian). I say hi to people that I vaguely know. And guess what? I have more friends and I have more people willing to help me. I think it is always a good idea to refresh on tactics that will improve your relationship with poeple. It doesn't hurt, right?Personally, I enjoy personal growth. I am always striving to be a better person, and I want to be a \\"gentleman\\" (if that word exists anymore). I know that it requires effort and time to praise people and hold your will to criticize. But at the end, life is short and precious.

If the book was titled &quot;How to Stop Thinking of Yourself for a Change&quot;, no one would buy it. But that is just what this book does. These concepts make you a better person, which in turn causes people to like you, which causes people to want to do things for you, which causes you to want to do more for people and the cycle continues, Duhh. Dale Carnegie is not telling you to act sincere or act interested, he is telling you to BE sincere and BE interested. How you do that is up to you. You can't fake it. These concepts are like a Chinese finger trap, the more you struggle to find fault, the more difficult it will be to understand why this works. I do think these concepts would work best if both parties are practicing them, and that would be the perfect marriage."},{"Title":"How to Win Friends & Influence People (Cardinal Editions, C 303)","review":"Winners know that they aren't perfect.

At the time I enjoyed the book more for its interesting stories than for its relationship principles. Recently I listened to the audio book version and was extremely impressed by these proven methods of dealing with people. It made me regret not applying more of what I read the first time around.Overall I find the book to provide a very good basis for dealing with people. Since listening to the audio book, I have found myself in relational situations where I recall and apply one of Carnegie's principles. Often they work with amazing results. Here is list of some of Carnegie's simple but effective maxims.1. Don't criticize, condemn or complain.2. Give honest and sincere appreciation.3. Arouse in the other person an eager want.4. Become genuinely interested in other people.5. Smile.6. Remember that a person's name is to that person the sweetest and most important sound in any language.7. Be a good listener. Encourage others to talk about themselves.8. Talk in terms of the other person's interests.9. Make the other person feel important - and do it sincerely.Having read other books on human relations, I still believe \\"How to Win Friends and Influence People\\" (first published while Herbert Hoover was in the Whitehouse) is the best. The audio book version has received some updating. In the midst of stories from a different era, an example from the life of Stevie Wonder is thrown into the mix. Regardless of what time the stories come from, the principles of How to Win Friends and Influence People are still as valuable and applicable today as they were the day the book was originally released."},{"Title":"How to Win Friends & Influence People (Cardinal Editions, C 303)","review":"This book is a treasure chest of advice on how to win friends, retain long term relationships and influence people. There are many examples of strategies/approaches thathave been proven to work in a multiplicity of situations atwork, at home and in societal contexts. The work emphasizesimportant aspects of human nature that are not taught in texts.In many ways, the volume is a precursor to the personal relations art taught by Tony Robbins and others in the field.Carnegie stresses that every person cherishes the desire to begreat amongst a motley mixture of wishes. We all want health,food, sleep, money, a peaceful afterlife, sexual gratification,the well-being of family and a feeling of importance. Above else,the desire to feel important is the distinguishing characteristicbetween people and wildlife. In addition, the author describesthe importance of listening to another's viewpoint beforeformulating an alternative argument. This is critical fora salesperson. Too many salespeople try to sell based uponwhat they think people need .The art of selling is to listen to the customer's explanation of what he/she needs and wants before making a pitch. An important personal trait is to listen to other people rather than initially trying to make them like you. In addition, people like to be called by their first name. The more you find out about a person-the more you can relate to them on a personal level and gain their trust and interest.Another important rule is to always make the other person feel important in any type of relationship. \\"In a nutshell, there are six ways to make people like you:RULE 1: Become genuinely interested in othersRULE 2: SmileRULE 3: Remember that a man's (person's) name is to him thesweetest and most important soundRULE 4: Be a good listenerRULE 5: Talk in terms of the other man's interestRULE 6: Make the other person feel important-and do it sincerely\\"Another important aspect of dealing with people involvescalling attention to people's shortcomings and errors indirectly.The author provides a detailed analysis of how Roosevelt madeappointments in consultation with the local political bosses.He asked for input. He rejected as many candidates as necessaryuntil the bosses submitted a qualified candidate. Then he wouldthank the political bosses for their input. In this way, hepushed through many types of reforms which otherwise would havebeen impossible.Lastly, Carnegie lists 9 important ways to get people to do things without offending them:RULE 1: Begin with praise and honest appreciation.RULE 2: Call attention to people's mistakes indirectly.RULE 3: Talk about your own mistakes before criticizing the otherperson.RULE 4: Ask questions instead of giving direct orders.RULE 5: Let the other person save face.RULE 6: Praise the slightest improvement and praise everyimprovement.RULE 7: Give the other person a fine reputation to live up to.RULE 8: Use encouragement.Rule 9: Make the other person happy about doing the thing yousuggest.For wives, Carnegie advises to:1. Give your husband complete freedom in business or careermatters.2. Make the home attractive.3. Vary the menu4. Have an intelligent grasp of the spouse's business to discussit intelligently5. Meet financial problems maturely6. Make a special effort to get along with relatives7. Dress with an eye to your spouse's favorite colors8.

It was How to Win Friends and Influence People by Dale Carnegie. It genius in every aspect. If everyone on the planet reads this book and puts it into practice, we might just have world peace. Carnegie's words of wisdom are priceless, it was first published in 1934 and has been in print ever since!The book is broken into four section and each section has between 3 to 12 lessons. I wish I could just publish the whole book in this blog, but I don't have enough room... instead I will choose a few lessons in each section and explain how they can be applied to your daily life.Section 1 Techniques in Handling People\\"Don't Criticize, Condemn, or Complain\\"- From time to time everyone get frustrated because of what someone else does... It might be at work, at home, or even driving (I sometimes get a bad case of road-rage). Carnegie has several stories about President Lincoln's life and one I particularly liked related to this lesson is about General Meade during the the Battle of Gettysburg. Lincoln gave orders to Meade to take immediate action against Lee's beaten and trapped army when they reached the Potomac. Meade did the exact opposite of Lincoln's orders and called council during war which gave enough time for Lee's army to escape. Lincoln was furious! If Meade had obeyed his order's the war would have been over right then and the course of history would have been changed forever! Lincoln was a conservative man in all aspects of his life. He wrote Meade a letter condemning his actions... He laid out all his distresses. However, Meade never got this letter, it wasn't found until after Lincoln was assassinated. Lincoln probably just put himself in Meade's shoes.. If he had just been through weeks of war, surrounded by blood and bullets of fallen comrades he wouldn't be rushing into another battle so abruptly. Sometimes you just have to consider the other person's perspective and it may give you world's of incite into why they acted the way they did and in Lincoln's case, maybe encourage you to reserve your complaint.\\"Give Honest and Sincere Appreciation\\"- Give everyone the appreciation they deserve. Self-esteem is a great way to win someone's approval and friendship. Now, the mistake that is commonly made is giving flattery. Flattery is counterfeit, it's fake. If someone isn't something worth praising then don't say it. It will cause more harm then good. When you are a woman or man of your word you must make sure everything that comes out of your mouth is honest. If you stray from the truth then you will have a difficult time getting trust back from those around you.Section 2 Making People Like You\\"Remember Names\\"- Carnegie writes that \\"a person's name is to that person the sweetest and most important sound in any language\\" and it's very true. When I see someone I haven't seen in a long time and they come out and say \\"Hi Trevor, How are you?\\" they have almost won me right from the start. Just saying someone's name to them makes them happy. I try and make it a habit to remember people's name, especially people that provide a service: the guy I buy my suits from or all the people at the front desk of my apartment. I instantly see a difference in the service I get when I call them by name. You build a connection with people and it makes them happy. And if nothing else you should be trying to make other people happy- so give it a shot call people by name, and if you are introduced to someone try your best to remember their name... this is one huge key to building a great network.\\"Smile\\"- It is a tough thing to do, but smiling will make you feel better and happier and it will make those around you happy too. Now don't do a crazy smile all day and scare people. Make an effort to produce a sincere smile and wear it proudly. It is a fantastic way to get through the day. When you meet people and you show some teeth, you will build and instant connection with that person because subconsciously you have made that person happier and when you make someone happy they want to be around you more. I actually have my latest fortune from my last Chinese meal taped above my desk, it reads: \\"Smile often, and see what happens.\\"Section 3 Win People to Your Way of Thinking\\"Avoid Arguments\\"- This is absolutely number one. Carnegie makes a great point when he writes that \\"No one can ever win from an arguement.\\" Even if you are the one that comes up with the most facts and crushes your opponent into seeing \\"your side.\\" You have ultimately pushed that person farther away from you because you tore down their self-esteem. And as I said previously boosting self-esteem is a great way to win someone's approval and friendship, but tearing it down has the exact opposite affect 10-fold. Do everything in your power to avoid the argument. Use the following words as a template \\"I understand your point of view, I didn't look at it from that perspective. I got my facts from ________ and you got yours from ________. Please help me understand your side so we can resolve this.\\" It is hard to think that clearly when you are in the heat of a debate, but just try and think. If you concede and hear the other person's side, you will ultimately bring that person closer and build a better relationship.\\"Get them Saying Yes, Yes\\"- I am sure all of us have had our run in with a door to door salesperson or any salesperson for that matter. One concept they understand is this lesson and you probably don't even recognize they are doing it either. The idea of this lesson is getting someone to be in affirmative mood. If you ask somewhat obvious questions from the start, that have the answers \\"yes,\\" that person is subconsciously more likely to say yes to what is coming next. So when you talk to the salesperson at the car dealership and they say \\"You have had a drink in your car, right?\\" and you say \\"yes,\\" and then they say \\"You like to have your drinks cold when you drink them, right?\\" and you say \\"yes\\" again. You are much more likely to say \\"yes\\" when that salesperson says \\"Well you should probably get the Cooling/Heating Cupholders shouldn't you?\\"Section 4 Be A Leader\\"Let the Other Person Always Save Face\\"- This is very important for leaders. It is easy to try and \\"set an example\\" when you are in a leadership role by reprimanding someone in front of everybody. The result will be pushing this person farther away from you and you'll lose trust and they will be less likely to work hard for you in the future. So always let a person save face. When someone does something \\"wrong\\" just make sure you take them aside to discuss the situation. No body likes to be \\"called out\\" in front of their peers. It hurts their self-esteem and we all know how important that is! Now I should note that Carnegie doesn't use this approach just toward an employee/employer situation, this can be applied to all relationships. Parents can grow closer and build better relationships with their children, friends with other friends, on so on and so forth, all by using the methods laid out in this book.\\"Give Reputations to Live up to\\"- If someone is told they are good at something in front of their peers, they will do even better at it. So if you tell one of your friends in front of everybody that \\"so and so\\" is the best goalie you have ever seen. That will encourage that person to do even better. You have set up a good reputation to live up to and that person will most likely put in the effort, work extra hard, and really become the best goalie they possibly can become. This is a situation where it is okay to single someone out in front of their peers. It acts as a boost and that person will even grow to like you more for singling them out in a positive way.That is all I am going to write about this book. I wish I could do more, but it's getting to be pretty long already. However, I want to reiterate that the lessons in this book are priceless and timeless. I will encourage each and every one of you to go buy this book. Carnegie is a great writer and I think you will find the book very fascinating. (I did!) And just to show you how important I feel the lessons of this book are I added a picture of my whiteboard. I wrote up every lesson from the book and I review them before I leave my apartment every morning. If you have any questions on the book don't hesitate to ask. I would be more than happy to help anyone that wants it.[...]"},{"Title":"How to Win Friends & Influence People (Cardinal Editions, C 303)","review":"Man is a social being - unless one chooses the way of the recluse or hermit, he will inevitably have to interact with people.

True, many people (maybe a majority) will respond positively when you practice Dale Carnegie's plan, but there is a sizeable minority who will walk all over you regardless.And a person who has self-image problems? I hate to say it, but Dale Carnegie's book can set them up to be mowed over.I have balanced Dale Carnegie with Manuel J. Smith's book WHEN I SAY NO I FEEL GUILTY. I found it more effective when I built a good, healthy respect for myself first. Then guess what!

How easy it is to forget that a small thing as simple as a smile or a \\"how are you?\\" can make someone's day. It is easy to criticize someone when you are upset, but when you can look at a situation from the other person's perspective, how much richer your life becomes. You can have compassion for not only the other person, but for yourself.Another book I really enjoyed is \\"Working on Yourself Doesn't Work\\" by Ariel & Shya Kane.

Instead of criticism, compassionately respond to what your interlocutor has experienced.2. To get someone to do something, give them something that they want; something that is within your principles; something that you do for them, based upon their needs and wants, not yours.3. Talk about what they want, and encourage them to get it, based upon their own abilities.4. Before you try to make someone do stomething, ask yourself, &quot;How can I influence him/her, in a way that is mutually respecting, to want to do it?&quot;5. Show people that you are sincerely interested in their ability to express what they most value?6. Become a good conversationalist, by listening well, and by responding to the underlying meaning of what your interlocutor is telling you.7. If you believe that you have something to prove to someone, do so in a subtle, adroit way, without telling anyone that you are doing it - be sure that you are doing it, as part of who you are?8. When you are wrong, admit, unequivocably, then gracefully change subjects.9. Begin adverse situations and otherwise, with a friendly demeanor, and focus upon peaceful resolve.10. During conflicts, let your interlocutor talk more than you. Recognize that those who talk the most have the most to lose.11. Show that you consider your interlocutor's ideas and feelings to be just as important as yours are, while you keep counsel with your agreements with yourself.12. Appeal to nobler motives.13. When you state a truth, follow this with vivid, interesting, dramatic, yet succinct supportive information.14. Realize that the majority of people are motivated most by self-expression - challenge them to embrace this.15. Be sincere, respectful and compassionate16. When making a request, put it in a form that conveys the idea that your interlocutor will benefit by doing what you are requesting, and that the benefits are ones which you see are ones that s/he appreciates.There's a reason why this book has been around since 1936, and that next to the bible, it is the # 1 book.Read this book to guide yourself to get more out of life, through taking responsibility for your part in your experiences with each person who you interact with - no matter what the perceived external power."},{"Title":"How to Win Friends & Influence People (Cardinal Editions, C 303)","review":"I have read this book many times and each time I get more out of it.

Whether you're trying to make friends, improve your sales closing ratio or persuade others to your way of thinking, this is the preeminent book for learning how to do so. Many books that have followed used this as their template.To win friends and influence people:1. Never criticize, condemn or complain.2. Always show your sincere appreciation.3. Talk in terms of what others want and how they can achieve their goals.4. Show genuine interest (not false flattery) in what others have to say.5. Smile.6. Remember people's names.7. Listen closely to what others have to say and encourage them to tell you more.8. Make others feel important and acknowledge what they have to offer. Avoid the urge to \\"one-up\\" the other guy.9. The only way to win an argument is to avoid it.10. Never directly tell someone they're wrong. It will raise their defenses and inhibit their objectivity.11. Welcome disagreements as opportunities to understand one another.12. Try to look at things from the other's point of view.There are approximately thirty chapters/rules for winning friends and influencing people.

Everything that this book sets forth as effective communicative skills is a basic knowledge that each one of us, for the most part, already posesses. But how necessary it is for someone to bring that knowledge to the forefront of our attention! My main stumbling block while reading this book was immediately thinking of those around me that are poor in one skill or the another.

It uses some old references of people I didn't know, but that didn't stop the point from coming through. The ideas are basic and obvious, but that's the point! It's easy to forget these things! I definitely took a lot out of this book and found it's helped my service and communication skills immediately. It's fun to try these ideas out and see just how people react. That being said, the book drags on with each topic. Carnegie states a fact and then gives 4 or 5 examples that are rather droll after a while. I wound up just skimming through the last 1/2 of the book and I still feel like I got what I could out of it.

what kind of INFLUENCE do you want to have on people?i just want people to know that, especially in these days, there are ways to interact that are honest and satisfying to all parties. at the very least, you dont have to settle for this- be creative. culture is dynamic and it evolves! this book needs to pass away like the age in which it was written."},{"Title":"How to Win Friends & Influence People (Cardinal Editions, C 303)","review":"This is so great.

I found this book to be extremely annoying. The book is essentially a string of anecdotes that the author uses to illustrate his points - techniques for managing people, getting people to like you, influencing people, and being a leader. There really aren't any facts behind the material. You either take to it or you don't.In this field of study, I personally enjoyed Cialdini's Influence: Science and Practice much more.

Anyone can benefit from reading and applying the time tested principles in this classic by Carnegie."},{"Title":"How to Win Friends & Influence People (Cardinal Editions, C 303)","review":"This book should be read by everyone. It is full of important information that everyone can benefit from. Carnegie's concepts are so simple, yet can be overlooked by everyone who doesn't stop and pay attention. The main theme of the book is to treat others as you would like to be treated. He teaches and guides you to become a better person. These concepts are great to master for any type of occupation, and for life in general. This is especially useful for careers that involve sales, and for any job that requires customer service. This book teaches you how to get people to instantly like you and feel comfortable around you. This will in turn help you get your sale. He stresses the importance of something so simple as a smile. He cannot express enough what it can do. Carnegie provides so many true life stories as examples of people using his methods, and what success they got from it. It is also amazing that he wrote this over 70 years ago, and his theories are still very true today. The book has been revised however to make it easier to read, and improve out of date information. This book helps you to learn how to offer constructive criticism, without offending the other person. It also teaches you how to adopt your ways of thinking without coming on too strong and turning them away. This book is highly useful for people who have to work in groups. Many arguments can occur when a group of people have to come to an unanimous agreement. Carnegie's tips will help you to get through group work successfully, with everyone feeling good about their contributions and decisions. I think another important part of this book is the lesson on not being selfish. You must learn to offer compliments without expecting something in return. This book makes you feel as though you can better yourself, and you will want to start trying his ideas as soon as you put it down!"},{"Title":"How to Win Friends & Influence People (Cardinal Editions, C 303)","review":"I love the messages in this book. The rules are simple and clear. The stories are so easy to read and understandable. It is easy to see why this book has stood the test of time. Though it was written years ago, Dale Carnegie's message is true today and very important. The essential message was that in order to be successful it is important to look outward. Pay attention and take care of others. This simple idea will enable anyone to be more influential in one's life. It is also important to have integrity and respect for yourself; but also to be respectful of others in your life. There are several chapters about dealing with negative situations and how by caring about the other person, the situation will turn out more positively.This book is really helpful for business. I am responsible for sales and there are ideas that Mr. Carnegie shares that I have found very helpful. Mr. Carnegie shares stories about how some salespeople can have incredible success by following simple ideas. One idea is to be truthful and to show passion for what you sell. Someone that is passionate about the insurance policy they are selling is going to be more effective than someone who is indifferent. I loved this book so much, that I am buying this book for my staff and will share it immediately.I have also found real success after reading the book, \\"How to Create a Magical Relationship\\" by Ariel and Shya Kane. This book was also incredibly profound and I have found that after reading it, my life is richer and more rewarding. The Kane's' book resonates with the principles of Dale Carnegie. One of the main precepts having magical relationships is about taking 100% responsibility for the relationship. Honesty, integrity and passion are also traits that are common between the Kanes and Carnegie. Wonderful relationships are allowed to flower when we take the focus off ourselves and take care of others. It is tremendously rewarding and powerful. The concept of \\"true\\" listening is also important to both authors. I've come to believe that most of us think that we are listening, but what true listening entails is that you listen to what the other person is saying from their point of view. I have really enjoyed both of these books tremendously and heartily recommend both of them."},{"Title":"How to Win Friends & Influence People (Cardinal Editions, C 303)","review":"One of my all-time favorite books. I've read it about 10 times. It's fun to read because it is full of stories and illustrations, sometimes of famous people. And each chapter ends with a principle. The principle is short enough to remember and is always action-oriented. And the application of the principles DO make a difference in my dealings with others.Sometimes this book is criticized as simplistic or manipulative. It is simple, and it could be used to manipulate people, but it is a highly practical book, and the principles can also be used to help you treat people the way you would like to be treated. When you do that, people go out of their way to be nice to you. That's basic, good human relations. This book has been around so long because nothing else has ever come along that does the job so well.Another really good book is Adam Khan's &quot;Self-Help Stuff That Works.&quot; (Youme Works; ISBN: 0962465674). That book has great references and he uses the same chapter ending principle style as Carnegie!

It continues to speak volumes into my daily interactions with people even though I listened to it nearly four years ago.I have found that following its advice does not make me phony or narcissistic - rather just the opposite (I suppose you can choose to try to pretend to care about people, but people are wiser than that). The book promotes understanding others' behavior and could have the very positive effect of reducing day-to-day conflict. Your blood pressure could lower and relationships flourish. It certainly has had this effect in my life.And the(at times)dated language? Classic!I recommend it highly!"},{"Title":"How to Win Friends & Influence People (Cardinal Editions, C 303)","review":"This is a Great Book with Timeless Ideas! I expected this to be a book with techniques that were superficial. Instead, I find this to be a book filled with Wisdom and Truth. The ideas are simple but they are deep. Alot of self-help book are filled with techniques that are manipulative, but this book by Dale Carnegie is not manipulative because what he is saying is really to care and to listen to other people. His first principle of how to make people like you is: &quot;Become genuinely interested in other people.&quot; Notice he does not say &quot;Act as though you are interested&quot;, but to GENUINELY become interested. This is simple but very wise.The book is filled with many more ideas that are both simple and almost common sense, yet are very profound, especially in the fast paced society of today, where few people take the time to become interested in other people or even to slow down enough to listen to other people. (Principle 4: Be a good listener. Encourage others to talk about themselves.) The author illustrates all his principles with a wealth of stories and practical example. This is a classic!Another book that you will probably like if you like &quot;How to Win Friends&quot; is a book by Ariel and Shya Kane called &quot;WORKING ON YOURSELF DOESN'T WORK.&quot; This book also talks about what true listening is, and how to be more present in your communications, in your interactions with other people, as well as how to be more centered with yourself.

Theodore Roosevelt said, \\"The most important single ingredient in the formula of success is knowing how to get along with people.\\"I believe that. Because I believe that, I want to do everything I can to become better at connecting with people. I believe that anyone can learn to be charismatic. I believe anyone can learn to win friends and influence people. I also believe we all need to develop our people skills as often and as much as we can.For anyone who is looking to become better with connecting with people, this is hands down a must read!Some Highlights:* 15 percent of one's financial success is due to one's technical knowledge and about 85 percent is due to skill in human engineering--to personality and the ability to lead people.* Dr. Johnson said: \\"God himself, sir, does not propose to judge man until the end of his days.\\" Why should you and I?* Sigmund Freud said that everything you and I do springs from two motives: the sex urge and the desire to be great.* If you tell me how you get your feeling of importance, I'll tell you what you are. That determines your character. That is the most significant thing about you.I shall pass this way but once; any good, therefore, that I can do or any kindness that I can show to any human being, let me do it now. Let me not defer nor neglect it, for I shall not pass this way again.* Emerson said: \\"Every man I meet is my superior in some way. In that, I learn of him.\\"* \\"If there is any one secret of success,\\" said Henry Ford, \\"it lies in the ability to get the other person's point of view and see things from that person's angle as well as from your own.\\"* You can make more friends in two months by becoming interested in other people than you can in two years by trying to get other people interested in you.* Jim Farley discovered early in life that the average person is more interested in his or her own name than in all the other names on earth put together.* Whenever Roosevelt expected a visitor, he sat up late the night before, reading up on the subject in which he knew his guest was particularly interested.* William James said: \\"The deepest principle in human nature is the craving to be appreciated.\\"There is an old saying: \\"Give a dog a bad name and you may as well hang him.\\" But give him a good name--and see what happens!"},{"Title":"How to Win Friends & Influence People (Cardinal Editions, C 303)","review":"This book came in great condition and offered a lot of great information.

When it comes to these areas, Carnegie is very strong and offers some invaluable advice anyone from a secretary to a corporate manager will find incredibly useful. He also gives some tips on how to avoid pitfalls, which essentially boil down to the so called golden rule - treat others as you wish to be treated yourself.While not a deeply insightful work when it comes to either psychology or understanding the human mind, Carnegie's book is must reading for anyone involved in a business role where you need to communicate with or manage people."},{"Title":"How to Win Friends & Influence People (Cardinal Editions, C 303)","review":"This is hands down the best book, and best audio program I have ever encountered in understanding how to work with others, create friends and allies, and accomplishing as much as can be done when working with others when egos and status are on the line."},{"Title":"How to Win Friends & Influence People (Cardinal Editions, C 303)","review":"This is probably one of the best self help books (if you want to categorize) ever written.

By applying the techniques in this book, I saw my relationship with my wife and children improve greatly. The biggest lesson for me was not to use force but use warmth to get what I want. I went from demanding that they do this and do that to an approach of listening to their concerns first, letting them know that I am truely interested in them as people. Once they know that they are very important to me, I then express my wants. This has proven to be a very powerful approach for me. It wasn't until I took the Dale Carnegie - Human Relations class though, that I learned to really apply these techniques. The class isn't cheap but I highly recommend it for those of you who want to take your personal relationships and professional relationships to the next level. What do you have to lose? I know...your time, the money for the book, or the money for the course if you choose to take it. But what do you have to gain? A deeper connection of love, respect, and co-operation from your family, accolades, better work atmosphere, maybe even a promotion (which would probably pay for the course incidentally, lol) in your work environment.

Fisher, which gives you the outline -- everything you need to know to find friends. Because it may be difficult to search for, I am repeating his review here:----- AMAZON BOOK REVIEW BY GEORGE R. FISHER:His advice is so obvious and so easy, so how come it's so difficult to do yourself and so rarely found in others? Is it cynicism or manipulation? No, it's human nature: Do Unto Others ...THE FUNDAMENTALS? \\"Speak ill of no man and speak all the good you know of everyone.\\"People react very badly to criticism; don't do it, not to their face nor behind their back ... especially not behind their back.? Say \\"Thank You\\".Express appreciation. People yearn, yearn to be appreciated.? Talk about what people want and help them get it.\\"Arouse in others an eager want.\\"Corollary: let others take credit for your ideas; they'll like your ideas a lot more if they believe them to be their own.WAYS TO MAKE PEOPLE LIKE YOU? Be happy to see people.Greet everyone you meet and show an interest in them. Remember the things that are important to them.? Smile!? Remembers peoples' names!!Remember it, use it when talking to them. A person's name sounds beautiful to them.? Draw people out.Encourage them to talk about themselves and their interests.? Actively research the other person's interests.? Every person you meet feels themselves superior to you in some way.Strain to find out what that is and recognize their importance. Talk to people about themselves and they will listen to you for hours.WIN PEOPLE TO YOUR WAY OF THINKING? Don't argue!Give in! Agree that the other person is right; often they are and if they aren't, you'll never convince them of it by arguing.? Don't ever tell a person they're wrong.They may be but telling them so is always counterproductive. It is difficult for a person to admit to themselves that they are wrong; harder still to admit it to others.? If you know you're wrong, admit it.Openly and freely admit whenever you're wrong. And always leave open the possibility that you're wrong even of you think you aren't.? Friendliness begets friendliness.Always begin that way. Don't accuse.? Never neglect a kindness.Look for ways to do or say something nice.? Start out by emphasizing areas of agreement.When a person has said \\"no\\" it's hard to get them to change even if they know they're wrong.? Let the other person do most of the talking.Listen patiently and don't interrupt. Let your friends be better than you.? Let people come to your conclusions.First, tell me what you expect of me; then tell me what I can expect of you. People will generally live up to the commitments they make to you as long as they came up with them on their own.? Think always in terms of the other person's point of view.Where they stand depends on where they sit; figure out where they're sitting.? ? of the people you will ever meet are dying for sympathy.Give it to them and they will love you.? A soft answer turneth away wrath: but grievous words stir up anger.? Dramatize your ideas.\\"Don't use logic; tell stories.\\" Make your ideas visible, concrete. Bear in mind that people don't know until you show them what you mean.? Stimulate in others their innate desire to excel (perhaps through a friendly challenge or through competition).BE A LEADER? Don't go sailing into difficult interpersonal situations with guns blazing. You'll always get a negative reaction.? Change \\"but\\" into \\"and\\".Be indirect in your criticism. Praise before you condemn.? Ask questions rather than giving orders.? Be very careful to help others preserve their dignity.? People crave recognition: praise the smallest improvement and praise every improvement.? Treat people as though they had the virtues you wished they possessed.Give them a reputation to live up to and they will work like crazy to live up to it.? Praise the good; minimize the bad: encourage.Make achievement seem possible. Take and encourage little baby steps. Seek out even the most insignificant of successes.?

This book is fantastic, I love how it is written in a formal, Thirties prose but that just further acccentuates how timeless the advice is. For instance, the sentence \\"Someone's toothache is more important to them an earthquake in China\\" has the elegant, proper poetic flair of Hemingway but delivers dead on its advice (being that expressing genuine interest in someone will get the other person interested in you).The author gives amazing, compelling, and grand accounts to illustrate his principles; many involve historical and business figures (Abraham Lincoln, Benjamin Franklin, Buddha, Socrates, Andrew Carnegie, Charles Schwab, etc.) . That aspect of the book I like, and that further motivates the reader to use each of the principes at the end of the chapter. Not only that, but Dale Carnegie reflects each principle with his own accounts and experiences, and explains and challenges you to do the same.I reccomend this book to anyone who needs to brush up on their social skills. I even reccomend it to people who have Asperger's Syndrome, since some of the advice presented here is written in a way that would appeal to an \\"Aspie\\". Many would say this book is dated, common sense, obvious, or too focused on the business world. But I think the intent of Mr. Dale Carnegie was for the reader to change herself and become a more successful person, be it in the world of work/business, or at life and socializing.

I bought the book because I misplaced the cassettes. I enjoyed the tape - the narrator was outstanding.But the shocking thing was the time it was really written. He mentions things about himself and his family (in NYC) and home (having live-in help) and surroundings (medical epidemics) that tell you how 'old' it is and he would be now. The wisdom is timeless in parts, but ...The advice is not 'old', but the times are really different. He talks about writing letters and formal dinner parties, not because he is a fuddy duddy, but because that was normal when the book was written. The book on 'worry' tells the same kind of first-person stories. The people were different, the times were different, and frankly, the advice is good - but dated.There are 1000s of reviews and info articles about the book. I will not repeat their text. But I will say the book is good, the advice is good, but it is not great. At least, that is what I think.

It actually says the techniques 'work like magic,' which I believe is just marketing. I stopped reading the book because it said do not criticize, it is futile. While too much is bad, it is not entirely futile. Depending on your personality type, the first three chapters could potentially make you lose yourself in trying to please and not offend others.Later, I tried re-reading the book and realized that near the end of the book, the author offers ways to constructively criticize.Each chapter ends with principles (ie 1. Don't criticize, condemn or complain.) You will get the most out of this book if you find the principle for each chapter BEFORE you read the chapter. Then you will get the general idea of where the chapter is headed.Also because people have a remarkable ability to adapt, some of the principles should be used with discretion. For instance when correcting someone, it says to 'begin with praise' and call attention to mistakes indirectly. If you always start with praise it loses its effect and people begin to expect reprimanding after praise. Sometimes its better to end with praise instead.In short, this is a good book but only follow the principles as a guideline instead of literally.

Many of the lessons in these pages seem obvious and common sense but there lies the beauty: Carnegie challenges us to act on the obvious insights and implement the realizations in our daily lives. Strategies are spelled out in a straight-forward manner and numerous examples are shown.It's unlike any other book and will be around for ages, contains tips on how to conduct ourselves and influence people. It is not so much about how to make people do things that we want them to do, but how to make them want to do it themselves. If you were to read this book alone and nothing else in your lifetime, you would still become outrageously successful person just by following the principles outlined in it. Dale Carnegie's magnificent creation is something I recommend to anyone who's looking for success in life, business and relationships.And yes, Horatio Alger may indeed have the best Rags to Riches stories in his many classic novels, and here are a few more:Phil the Fiddler: A Classic Rags to Riches Story!Randy of the River: The Adventures of a Young DeckhandSlow and Sure: The Story of Paul Hoffman the Young Street-MerchantThe Young Bank Messenger: A Classic Rags to Riches Story!Young Captain Jack: The Son of a SoldierBallads: Wonderful poems from the master of success fiction."},{"Title":"How to Win Friends & Influence People (Cardinal Editions, C 303)","review":"Don't let the title fool you - this isn't a book about how to manipulate people into liking you and doing what you want.

I listen to it in the car 30 mins/day and I get through the whole book in two weeks without having to carve out any time in my day.The book is written in a loose, easy style that is a pleasure to read in either long sittings or quick bites. It short on lecturing and long on stories and examples of how great people such as Abraham Lincoln, Andrew Carnegie, Theodore Roosevelt, and everyday people like you and I, have used these principles to succeed.By the way, I'm also big fan of Horatio Alger and all his Rags to Riches novels. The application of influence and proper communication is the essence in most his stories. I'm sure you'll have a richening experience with these other books.

Carnegie's writing style is engaging and he really challenges the reader to put the material to the test. I hadn't even finished the book before deciding to employ some of things Carnegie recommends and found that I was better received by strangers and felt I was connecting more quickly to people simply by listening more carefully and showing that I found the person important. Though many of the illustrations are dated, the ideas still come through and I found it interesting that despite almost 80 years since it was first published, the simple truths still work."},{"Title":"How to Win Friends & Influence People (Cardinal Editions, C 303)","review":"One of the best books I've read, if you want some additional motivation with some great life examples - this is THE book to read.

The advice is really good and I especially like the real world examples he gives based on his own experiences and the experiences of those in his classes. The examples really make you think about how you interact with people. In reading this book several experiences from my past have come to mind and I now know how I could have better handled the situation. In one case, a member of my team was not following the rules set by the team. He was a lone ranger, doing whatever he wanted. So I got really fed up with it (he was hindering the progress of the team) and went to see him. I asked him if he was following the process and he said yes but it was obvious he wasn't and was lying. So I called him on his lie and told him not only was he not following the rules but he was lying as well! I really let him have it. The result? He still didn't follow it and was even worse!!! Now I know lots of ways I could have improved the situation and motivated him.Another thing I liked about the book is how he told stories of famous people like FDR, Charles Schwabb, etc. Those stories were the best. The stories from history like with Lincoln were very interesting as well.At the same time, you can tell that society has really evolved from \\"back then\\" to present day. I do think that constantly being nice and treating people well means you will get taken advantage of from time to time but I think overall we're still going to come out ahead with these techniques. If only everyone would use them!"},{"Title":"How to Win Friends & Influence People (Cardinal Editions, C 303)","review":"How to Win Friends and Influence People is a classic book on dealing with people. The book teaches some very basic but key concepts to building solid relationship with people. This book has been a bestseller for years and will continue to be a reference for successful people for many years to come. You should not only read but study this book.Linsey MillsAuthor of Simply Outrageouswww.simplyoutrageous.org"},{"Title":"How to Win Friends & Influence People (Cardinal Editions, C 303)","review":"There is a reason this book has been in print for over 70 years. In about 250 pages, Mr. Carnegie gives great common sense advice to his readers on how they can improve their lives and make far more friends and business contacts than they have ever done before. And when I say common sense, I mean readers may find themselves smacking their foreheads and saying to themselves \\"Of course! I can't believe I didn't see it before.\\" It may also find them regretting a few choices they've made in their life, but Mr. Carnegie seems to have anticipated this and often includes stories about people who tried things one way with no results, then took his class or tried some principle from his book and was immediately rewarded with success. Readers may find themselves reading things more than once, if not the entire book. That being said, I will say that this book is in need of some serious updating. Not in its principles, but in its stories. Some of them have been left in their since its first publishing in 1936 and others refer to historical figures in business or politics that average readers probably will not know anything about. And while the publisher is at it, would it be too much to ask for some kind of workbook style layout for future editions? They leave readers blank pages in the back for them to write about their experiences in applying the book's lessons, but I think it would be better if the end of each chapter had some questions with blank lines for the reader to write answers about the chapter they just read so that readers can reflect upon them and even write about their attempts at applying those principles to their lives. Other than that, this is a classic work that everybody should read in order to improve their lives."},{"Title":"How to Win Friends & Influence People (Cardinal Editions, C 303)","review":"Some of it is foolishness and you can't buy into everything it says, but I have to say there are a lot of very simple tips in here that can have an absolutely staggering effect when employed effectively.

References to WWI, steel producing companies and the Civil War era might have some interesting ideas to get across, but I think in order to win friends and influence people in the modern age depends on ideas that have finally overtaken things found in this book.I'll be trying to get through it, but so far, I'm immediately just not excited about it."},{"Title":"How to Win Friends & Influence People (Cardinal Editions, C 303)","review":"It is not enough justice to say this is outstanding book by Dale Carnegie.

Was this book picked up from the junk and then sold? Sellers must have a conscience; it's not always about the money, even though it was really cheap. I guess, I got what I paid for."},{"Title":"How to Win Friends & Influence People (Cardinal Editions, C 303)","review":"This book was enjoyable to read. I liked the way it was written (I actually liked the old time writing) and I enjoyed the history. I have to admit that the stories about the famous people of the past (like Lincoln) were fascinating. I also have to applaud the writer for reinforcing his teachings in simple, succinct, in-a-nutshell statements at the end of each chapter.If you are naturally a good listener, naturally interested in people, and naturally sensitive to other people's feelings, I would recommend you try this book. You will come across sincere since this is how your tendancies are, and will probably attract people. Sincerity is KEY here. Carnegie was right in warning about being phony; it is as uncool in 2012 as it was it 1937. Being genuine and comfortable with yourself is crucial to winning friends and influencing people. If you think you have these tendencies, purchase this book and I think it will help you.However, I now turn my attention to the people I observe who routinely do the exact opposite of Carnegie's teachings. The rude, mean, gossipy, selfish, overly forceful people who only talk about themselves. I run into people like this (as we all do). And guess what? They have more friends than they know what to do with, and outshine everyone in the workplace. They are being their true selves, being sincerely who they are (as I cited about nice people in the previous paragraph). And guess what? People love them! They are *FAR* from the friendless wretches you may conclude they would be after reading this book. I do not recommend this book to these indviduals at all. Not only do they not need it at all, but they will come across as phony if they try it and it won't work of course.After considering my own life experiences, and reviewing some of the principles in Psychocybernetics by Maxwell Maltz, the Big Key to life in my opinion is just being comfortable with you as you are (mean or nice). Naturally honey? The bees will come. Naturally vinegar? They will come. People like GENUINE; no one likes being walked down the primrose path. So the big task now is to find out which way you are, love you for you, and go forth. If you are unsure of this and not confident in yourself, I recommend reading Maltz's book. He explains in detail how a positive self image helps you relax and let your true self come out. He explains how to do this with detailed exercises if you are unsure how. Only after your true self comes out and you are happy and secure with it, will all things (including human relations) fall into place. Good luck!!"},{"Title":"How to Win Friends & Influence People (Cardinal Editions, C 303)","review":"This was, by far, the best book I've ever read. It's life changing.

However, it did take me from being a gruff, self centered, judgmental Hillbilly to a more compassionate, understanding, and accepting Man of the World. It gave me insight into other peoples basic needs, and a set developable skills to encourage others to look in my direction with fondness.

Plenty of other people have done so. It is essentially a list of techniques to use in dealing with people to help lubricate the process of getting along with them, whether in a passing, personal or professional setting. What I would like to address is the level of criticism the book has received.Most criticisms of this book stem from an improper approach to its premise. To be fair, Carnegie was treading in uncharted territory with this book and likely wasn't quite sure how much explanation he needed to give. This is not a true self-help book as the term has come to be defined. This book is about interacting with people. As such, it is an all-outward approach to moving through life. Carnegie mentions in passing that its effectiveness will depend upon your strength of character, but I think that is actually a fundamental point.For example, if you have a \\"nice guy\\" character, being a pushover or people-pleaser, then this book will set you up to be a doormat. If you have a shallow character, full of bitterness or contempt, this book will show you how to manipulate others to get your way. But if you have a solid, ethical character, with sincere appreciation for the views of others yet unwilling to compromise yourself or your values, then this book can fill in the gaps you may have in your interpersonal skills and move you toward expanding your business and personal relationships.Stephen Covey, in 7 Habits of Highly Effective People, directly disparages this book (he lambasts the idea of \\"faking interest in other people's hobbies\\"), which is ironic since I believe they are companion pieces. In fact, I strongly recommend reading 7 Habits first; then you will see the advice in Carnegie's book from a deeper and more fulfilling perspective. Together, they can completely change your life."},{"Title":"How to Win Friends & Influence People (Cardinal Editions, C 303)","review":"A Classic in Self-Improvement Field!\\"How to Win Friends and Influence People\\" by Dale Carnegie is heralded by many as one of the most celebrated and widely read books every written, especially within the self-improvement genre.

It was the most significant book, other than the Bible, that I have ever read. It transformed my life and shaped my thinking as no other book has. I remember reading it and marking it and highlighting it until it was so tattered and dog-eared, that I had to buy a replacement.Carnegie's down-to-earth, conversational tone is so inviting that you almost feel as if he were in the room with you. It was then that I discovered the magic of internalizing Carnegie's timeless principles. People started treating me special, like I was important, girls started paying attention to me,( I wasn't very attractive), and people much older than me began pouring their hearts out to me, even asking for advice. Children thought I was some sort of pied piper. I was astounded by all of this attention because I had always been an introverted boy with various inferiority complexes.It was new and strange and wonderful to be able to make friends, speak up, be heard, and influence people.Carnegie's book is broken up into four parts, basic techniques for handling people, six ways to make people like you,(chapter six is my favorite.),how to win people to your way of thinking, and being a leader. Each part contains a list of all the principles that comprise each chapter. These lists, called, In a Nutshell, are at the end of each part.Before you begin reading How to Win Friends, you will want to read the nine suggestions for getting the most out of it. It really does help to do everything Mr. Carnegie suggests.

I suppose &quot;Love&quot; by Leo Buscaglia could also go in this catagory."},{"Title":"How to Win Friends & Influence People (Cardinal Editions, C 303)","review":"Today, I finish reading the book, How to win Friends and Influence People. My boss, my colleague and my friend as well, who perused it when she was a Ph.D.student, suggested me to read it.That is an old book, first published in 1936. Anyway, almost all truth can be found in one or another old book.Then, what is the truth in the book? That is simple. Everyone has a desire to be important, and all people are more interested in themselves than in others. That may be the weakness in human nature. Based on the facts, the book advocated a new way of life. In order to make friends and to affect others, one must make them feel important by showing honest and sincere respect, appreciation and recognition, and make them interested by focusing on their problems.Does this approach work? I think so. However, it is easy to understand but difficult to practice. After all, those readers of the book belong to Hume being with the same weakness as others. To overcome the weakness to certain degree, one must have personal integrity. One must be insightful so that he can know what others think. One must be patient so that he can deal with others&iexcl; issue first. One must be clever so that he can detect others' real but indistinct merit.One point should be made definite. So called \\"friends\\" in the book are friends in need, such as bossed, employees, colleagues, teachers, students, classmates, customers, clients, etc. For friends indeed beyond utility, are the principles of the book suitable? I doubt. In fact, I think at least some of them are certainly not. At any rate, honesty, respect and appreciation are crucial in all kinds of relations."},{"Title":"How to Win Friends & Influence People (Cardinal Editions, C 303)","review":"Many years ago one of my early mentors recommended reading How To Win Friends once a month for a year and once a year there after. I can't say I've kept to that scheduled but I have worn through more than one copy.The principles and recommendations are simple, subtle and yet profound. These are things we all know but forget to use from time to time. My favorite still remains, \\"Principle 1. Don't Criticize, Condemn or Complain.\\" Although I still violate the principal on occasion, I find myself gently reminded each time I pick up this classic book again.The stories may be outdated and the characters almost all forgotten but I always enjoy reading about Franklin D. Roosevelt, Andrew Carnegie, John D. Rockefeller, Jr. and many others. Dale Carnegie is especially amusing as he narrates his own tales of \\"learning\\" the principles.I highly recommend this book to anyone looking to improve their communications with others.

I'm always in some state of reading it. The principles in this book are truly life-changing.

I started reading this when I was a young salesman right out of college, and I was shocked when I discovered how bad I was at dealing with people. It was then and there that I decided to try to implement the principles in my life one by one, and that began a journey that impacted my life in a significant way. I feel very fulfilled in my current position -- which involves dealing with people all day, every day -- but the most satisfying part of this whole journey is that it's made me a better person.

Dale Carnegie's \\"How to Win Friends and Influence People\\" does offer some good points on how to interact and deal with people in the business world but the techniques, if you will, are very self-serving and superficial.Although I found HTWFAIP interesting reading, I also thought it was a shallow and dated piece of work. Carnegie gives a lot of anecdotes to reinforce his points but I found some of them impractical and absurd. For example, in one case he talks about striking up a conversation with a haggard postal worker and how he \\"made his day\\" by complementing him on the thickness of his hair. To me, that was a rather gratuitous remark as it sounded a bit insincere.Carnegie wrote this book back in the 1930s. A time when America was in the midst of the Great Depression and the expression of the day was \\"brother, can you spare a dime?\\" The '30s and '40s were a period of great hardship for this country and if wanted to survive, we had to come together and get this country back on its feet. So, naturally, people were more inclined to be helpful and considerate.Back then, business interactions were more personal and to a degree, even ethical. But nowadays, it's every man for himself and the way to interact with people is by impersonal means: faxes, email, teleconferences, etc. Consequently, getting to know people is more challenging than ever. Carnegie's techniques may have worked well for early and mid-twentieth century America but in our impersonal, techno-driven, global business world, a lot of these techniques fall short.Our society has become more cynical and selfish. We live in a society that preaches self-fulfillment at the expense of having meaningful relationships with our families, friends and coworkers. Advertising and marketing feed into our sense of vanity and they are the vehicles that drive our self-centered, hedonistic culture. Consequently, it is more difficult than ever to connect and interact with people on a personal level. These and other larger issues concerning human interaction are not addressed in Carnegie's book and as such, HTWFAIP should not be relied upon as a \\"primer\\" for dealing with people.If you really want to learn to how to successfully interact with your fellow man, read your Bible. There's a lot in there and if you study it carefully, you will learn more about interacting and being at peace with your fellow man than you will in reading Carnegie's book. Not only that, but it's stood the test of time far longer than Carnegie's book has."},{"Title":"How to Win Friends & Influence People (Cardinal Editions, C 303)","review":"My husband loved this book and I found myself easily engrossed in portions of it as well, my only complaint was that I was expecting the book to be larger.

What he said still rings true today.The secret of success is to enlist the willing help of others. You can't do it alone.Dale Carnegie knew that. And he shows you how to attract and motivate others, with short truisms such as:\\"give honest and sincere appreciation\\"\\"show respect for the other person's opinion\\"\\"talk in terms of the other person's interest\\"\\"when you are wrong, admit it quickly and emphatically\\"Simple? Yes. Corny? perhaps.This seems familiar as if it had already been written, oh well I guess plagiarism is the sincerest form of flattery, this is one heck of a good book and you should read it, then you might not be reading second rate book reviews, you would be out living large with the beautiful people.You see Dale had a way with words, he could remember your name, which I insist at family gatherings my family wears name badges just to save the embarrassment of forgetting ones immediate relatives names, which reminds me of what I was thinking just the other day. Ok here goes all numbers have spellings, example 1 is spelled one, 2 is spelled two and so on but letters have no spelling which always leaves me feeling empty if I want to mention a certain letter to a friend in correspondence, for example:Dear Friend, I was thinking of the L the other day...Ok L? what does that mean? and should it not have a spelling, what has become of our beloved English language? How many letters can you spell? I thought so.Are we lazy English speakers? Why don't we all write someone and complain about needing a proper spelling for every letter of the alphabet other wise we are going to slowly slip into a degree of illiteracy that is just dang stupid. Perhaps one of you people who read this book at my urging come up with a diplomatic way to approach all people who use letters combined into words to come up with some sort of rational way to spell them, I am at a loss. Great book, read it but you will not find the proper spelling for one letter in it nor any book that I know of, get on the stick people before its to late!Well, I was talking to my collaborator Roscoe and he has prodded me with his help to come up with a compressive guide to the proper spelling of the english alphabet.Stay tuned.

The author Dale Carnegie, spent the greater proportion of his life refining and bettering his courses on Interpersonal Relations, this book was the first book ever written on the subject, and it sprung from many years of research and practical tests of principles which successful men and women use and had used in interpersonal relations through history to their advantage.The book is organized in four parts, namely:Fundamental Techniques in Handling People:- Don't criticize, condemn or complain.- Give honest and sincere appreciation.- Arouse in the other person an eager want.Six Ways to Make People Like You:- Become genuinely interested in other people.- Smile.- Remember that a persons name is to that person the sweetest and most important sound in any language.- Be a good listener. Encourage others to talk about themselves.- Talk in terms of the other person's interests.- Make the other person feel important, and do it sincerely.How to Win People to Your Way of Thinking:- The only way to get the best of an argument is to avoid it.- Show respect for the other person's opinions. Never say, \\"You are Wrong.\\"- If you are wrong, admit it quickly and emphatically.- Begin in a friendly way.- Get the other person saying \\"yes, yes\\" immediately.- Let the other person do a great deal of the talking.- Let the other person feel that the idea is his or hers.- Try honestly to see things from the other person's point of view.- Be sympathetic with the other person's ideas and desires.- Appeal to the nobler motives.- Dramatize your ideas.- Throw down a challenge.Be a leader: How to Change People Without Giving Offense or Arousing Resentment- Begin with praise and honest appreciation- Call attention to people's mistakes indirectly- Talk about your own mistakes before criticizing the other person- Ask questions instead of giving direct orders- Let the other person save face- Praise the slightest improvement and praise every improvement. Be \\"Hearty in your approbation and lavish in your praise.\\"- Give the other person a fine reputation to live up to.- Use encouragement. Make the fault seem easy to correct.- Make the other person happy about doing the thing you suggest.Every principle is backed up by stories and examples of famous people, great leaders and the author himself showing how the principle in question was used to their advantage, and also showing the negative consequences of situations where the principles were neglected. The author writes in probably the same manner as he spoke, in an intensively exuberant, colloquial, conversational manner.I regard this book to be on of the most important I have ever read regarding Interpersonal Relations, and as the author states in the beginning chapter \\"15 percent of one's financial success is due to one's technical knowledge and about 85 percent is due to skill in human engineering, to personality and the ability to lead people.\\". Personally I think the figures are much higher than that, but in either case this book can change ones life immensely to the better if used and applied. I encourage everybody regardless of their current situation to read this book, if they have not already, and if they have to read it again.It is truly a classic worth reading!"},{"Title":"How to Win Friends & Influence People (Cardinal Editions, C 303)","review":"Love this book. I wish everyone would read it. When I first heard about it from a friend I was bothered by the title as it sounded rather self serving and manipulative. I don't care for those types of motives in anything, but once I browsed through it, I realized it was an excellent book and in reality has principles that benefit everyone."},{"Title":"How to Win Friends & Influence People (Cardinal Editions, C 303)","review":"As a management consultant, I am always asking our clients and potential clients what their major issues are. It almost always boils down to persuading someone else to change. In many situations, the person describes the situation as getting worse rather than better.As I ask more questions, I soon learn that the person I am talking to is totally thinking about the issue from her or his perspective, not the perspective of the person they want to influence. Carnegie describes a situation where he and his son couldn't get a calf into the barn. They pushed and pulled, and nothing worked. A maid came out, stuck her finger into the calf's mouth to simulate feeding and the calf followed her right into the barn.As you can tell from that example, Carnegie is a student of the stimulus-response school of human behavior. The book is divided into four sections: Handling People; Getting People to Like You; Getting People to Agree with You; and Being a Leader. Each section is comprised of a few principles, which are each exemplified in a short chapter with a number of examples. Handling people has to do with avoiding the negative and unpleasant, appreciating the other person, and making the other person eager to accomplish some goal of their own.Each section follows the same format. Basically, it's the same way that you train any living being. You provide positive feedback to the person which makes them feel better, the person responds positively to you making you feel better, you then help the other person to link what you want to share with them with something they want.Many people will be offended by this idea. I have long studied that reaction and find that it relates to one of two basic assumptions: (1) the decision to act should be based on the objective merits (if I deal with emotions, I am being manipulative) or (2) I want you to acknowledge that I am right, that you are wrong, and that I am superior to you because I am right. Both of those perspectives get in the way of establishing warm human relationships. If you would rather do things without emotion, your life will be very dull. If you would always like to be right, you will be very lonely (even if you really are right).Let's look at a more fundamental question. Can these techniques be used for questionable purpoes? Probably, is my answer. However, at some point, the person's manipulative game will be found out. See Robert Cialdini's book, Influence, on what happens to smugglers of influence over time.The best results will come from those who have integrity and are principled. They and everyone else can see that they are pursuing something with another person that is in the best interests of that person, and that there are no hidden agendas. Here is where I think Carnegie is a little weak. You get the impression from the book that hidden agendas are okay. My experience is that all agendas should be totally upfront. Don't pretend you are trying to help someone, when all you are trying to do is sell them something they don't need. Do encourage them to get the information they need to make a good decision for themselves about your idea, product, or service. Leave the whole circumstance with a stronger, more trustworthy relationship than you started with. That's how I interpret the Dale Carnegie principles.If you really would like to get better results in your human relationships, this book is essential reading. To skip this book would be like skipping reading and arithmetic in grade school. It contains essential tools that everyone needs to understand. Since these things are seldom taught in schools, this is a good place to start.Modern gurus of human relationships and effectiveness like Stephen Covey and Tony Robbins have a substantial debt to Dale Carnegie. If you read all of them, you will tend to reinforce your new habits. I like the Covey and Robbins approaches as a complement to Carnegie, because both authors focus on having principles at the center of what you do. That will help reduce the risk of turning Carnegie into techniques that lead to suboptimal results, instead of a mutually reinforcing virtuous cycle for everyone.Researchers consistently show that success in many fields (such as business, politics, and teaching) is very closely related to one's social skills. Many people will work very hard to be more successful, but skimp on the relationship aspects. That's a mistake. Work on the relationships first.Enjoy having easier interactions with others, having more friends, being more influential on important subjects, being more open to being influenced by others, and leading where it needs doing!"},{"Title":"How to Win Friends & Influence People (Cardinal Editions, C 303)","review":"Dale Carnegie's great book, How To Win Friends and Influence People, is practically unrecognizable in this revised version.

I had always been off put by the title, &quot;How to Win Friends and Influence People.&quot; To me it always slightly scented of manipulation, the effortful practiced skill of acting in such a way to &quot;win&quot; over friends as if they didn't come naturally and the people-pawned language of the word, &quot;influence.&quot; A more apropos title might be, &quot;The Art of Living.&quot;Many of the ideas are echoed years later in Steven Covey's, &quot;7 Habits of Highly Successful People,&quot; for good reason...they are timeless. The concept of valuing humanity never turns with the times. Carnegie engagingly reminds us of the power of a name and the importance to work on knowing and using another's name. He speaks of listening, showing genuine interest in what another has to say, argument avoidance, showing sincere appreciation, and does so in easy to remember and practiceable dictums.It's a book to be read, a book to be practiced, a book to be given. It's a book that keeps on giving, a book that makes you more human and in such a way you'll find yourself as an afterthought gaining friends and keeping company with people wonderful people."},{"Title":"How to Win Friends & Influence People (Cardinal Editions, C 303)","review":"'ve read the 'revised' edition and didn't get much.

Later I was able to find a copy at the local library and checked it out several times over the next year.Within a year I went from being a painfully shy, socially isolated, straight A student, to being the founder of a county wide youth organization, successful fundraiser/event planner for the Muscular Dystrophy Association, and still a straight A student. Today, a few decades later, I am a successful meditation teacher and a truly happy person.It is within this complex idea of \\"success\\" that I have to take one star off this book. While the book definitely helped me with human relations skills I was sorely lacking, success in terms of what we can get from other people is just one facet of true success. The point of life isn't to have more, but to be more - particulary to be more happy. Being happy can be affected by how popular one is, but it goes far beyond that. This book is perfect for teens because it has something of the teen mentality that says being popular is the secret to life. But as we mature we learn that other things have more of an effect on dying in peace than just being able to have a powerful public persona.The book won't teach you the things that really open your heart to others, creating deep relationships of genuine love and trust. It is more a \\"fake it 'til you make it\\" approach than one about real inner change. This does not mean the book isn't useful. And it is certainly powerfully effective in doing what it sets out to do, teaching methods for worldly success. I simply want to emphasize that you must go beyond this book and if you are recommending it to young people give it to them with that caveat. There is more to success than simply having power over others. Let this be the first step along a path that will lead further up the mountain and you will get its blessings without being deceived and finding only a dead end."},{"Title":"How to Win Friends & Influence People (Cardinal Editions, C 303)","review":"This book is timeless! I always thought the title of this book was corny, funny and &quot;you've got to be kidding&quot;. But a friend suggested that I would like it so I read it and yes, I did like it! Dale Carnegie wrote this book in 1936 and it is amazing how many of the ideas and principles he speaks of applies to our world today.They did revise the book in 1981 so today's reader could recognize and relate to the people spoken about in the book. There are many things I liked about this book but what I found most valuable were the Principles discussed such as the one on page 62: &quot;Be genuinely interested in other people&quot;, and the one on page 88: &quot;Be a good listener, Encourage others to talk about themselves.&quot; The book tells you how to be a better person, how to be the best you can be, and especially relate well to others so you can have a more fulfilling satisfying life. This to me is very important.This book is fun and very interesting. It is filled with stories to compliment the different Principles discussed. I found it very enjoyable and I highly recommend it to anyone interested in learning how to communicate and relate better.Another book I recently read, enjoyed and recommend is called &quot;Working on Yourself Doesn't Work&quot; by Ariel and Shya Kane. This book also talks about specific Principles that are applicable and practical in today's world. The Kane's also have some great audio tapes that I purchased called: &quot;Magical Relationships&quot; and &quot;Roots of Satisfaction&quot;."},{"Title":"How to Win Friends & Influence People (Cardinal Editions, C 303)","review":"I read this book several times.

It's recommended for everyone."},{"Title":"How to Win Friends & Influence People (Cardinal Editions, C 303)","review":"Paul Graham (Hackers and Painters) has mentioned that an important read for preparing to start your own business is How To Win Friends and Influence People. I'm happy to report that this gem from 1936 is timeless and truly life-changing. I believe Paul's reasons for the recommendation include: the importance of charisma, general rounding out one's personality, and finding ways to get responsiveness from people by making them feel good.My real intent in making this review is to get you to pick up a copy of this book and absorb every nugget, so your relationships will increase and improve.One complaint I have is that the table of contents does not very well summarize the maxims. They are, however, listed in a table at the end of each of the sections. I'll combine them here by their major sections.Fundamentals for handling people: Don't be critical. Be sincerely appreciative, not flattering. Arouse in the other person an eager want, by focusing on their needs instead of yours.Making people like you: Get others to do most of the talking. Listen well, and make them feel important. Then they'll feel so good about being listened to that they'll do anything for you.Win people to your way of thinking: Always start in a friendly way, and be dramatic! See things from the other person's point of view, and be sympathetic with that view.Leadership: Give lots of genuine praise, and be encouraging. Talk about your own mistakes first, and make his faults seem easy to correct. Ask questions instead of giving orders. Give the other person person a fine reputation to live up to, and let him save face.Some of the lessons in the book are especially challenging to apply; e.g., making other people feel like your ideas are their own. A fundamental part of an entrepreneur's livelihood is idea generation. But ideas supposedly are not terribly valuable on their own (it's the execution that counts), so maybe this maxim is still valid. This seems to underscore the importance of having a lot of trust in your business partner(s).I've noticed that a lot of people don't call me by my name; maybe just because it's slightly uncommon. I do make an effort to remember someone's name and use it with some frequency. It was encouraging to hear Carnegie underscore this. He's right -- it does feel good when someone addresses me properly.I'm going to change my approach to making requests of people. I have a habit of getting right to the point and immediately stating what I want and why. That's probably why so many of my requests go unanswered! A general theme in the book is that getting what you want involves some indirection. I.e., think of things from the other person's perspective and present things from an angle of how they are the beneficiary.Overall, lots of Carnegie's ideas are common sense, but it still was useful to hear him voice them. Some of the principles are not so obvious and I probably wouldn't have ever discovered them on my own. I toted this book around with me for a couple weeks and found that having the ideas fresh in my head greatly improved my interactions with people. For this reason, I think this book (or its summary) would be highly valuable to skim over before every important meeting."},{"Title":"How to Win Friends & Influence People (Cardinal Editions, C 303)","review":"I have not finished the book yet, but I think I have read enough to know what rating it deserves.First of all, I looked at some of the reviews, bad and good. I'd say 95% were excellent. So I ordered the book, 4 dollars, whatever.Then it came in the mail a few days later (faster than any of my others, so I got down to reading it)I open it up and read the intro and thought, \\"The 1930's?! How can this possibly help me? The revised edition, which I boought, was changed in the 80's... wonderful.\\"But, since I had nothing else to read, I read on anyway. The first chapter was more examples than advice, and usually I can't stand that many stories and example in a non-fiction book. These stories were not only helpful, but entertaining. The next chapter got into people's habits and thinking. I found this just as interesting, if not more, than the last section. Yet I found myself using this logic and thinking about the examples in day-to-day life.I'm only 13, but it has still helped. People are people, all ages.This book has been addicting and I look forward to keep reading it.In short: Amazing book for all! Even Dale Carnegie from the 30's can tell you about people today.

This book isn't the kabbala or cryptic writings understood only by mystics or specialists. (I'm in no way disparaging codified language or writings that give way to multiple, and often contradictory, interpretations--that type of writing has its time and place. This book, however, does not use that mode for its inspiration.) This book is enlightment for the masses. \\"How to Win Friends...\\" is straightforward, written clearly in easy-to-understand language.I'm preaching to the choir when I say that I certainly have violated many of this book's principles time and time again b/f I knew any better. For example, I blush to think of the times I have preferred to talk endlessly about my own concerns, problems, and interests without reciprocating the skill of attentive listening to my friends and acquaintances. And who among us couldn't stand to cultivate better conflict-resolution skills or experience some personal growth? I like that Dale shared with his readers times when he got it all wrong and how he learned from his mistakes. This admission makes it easier for the rest of us to acknowledge when we got it all wrong. Dale's book suggests ways to subtly and diplomatically inspire cooperation and a change of attitude without (unwittingly) stirring up resentment and putting the other person on the defensive. Dale warned about the dangers of our need to be in the right and to prove to others that they are in the wrong. Mother Teresa likewise counselled, \\"Don't worry about being right. Just be kind.\\" (Dale regretted that once upon a time he considered writing a book about argumentation--he later believed avoiding conflict and refraining from criticism are better options, and when conflict and criticism can't be avoided, there are guidelines and courtesies to follow that will help the other person feel less threatened and more receptive to your point of view.)This book exhorts us to treat others kindly while acknowledging their importance. I think that Dale couldn't have been more on the money when he stated that all of us have an intense need to feel important, and it's how we go about feeling important that makes all the difference.One of my favorite moments in the book is when Dale quoted a French writer. I'll paraphrase: what a person believes about him or herself is what counts. Do not try to hurt/negatively influence a person's self-perception, as your opinion of that person doesn't really matter.This book has certainly enlightened me about the fine art of interpersonal intelligence. I aspire to consistently put these theories and principles into practice."},{"Title":"How to Win Friends & Influence People (Cardinal Editions, C 303)","review":"This book helps me deal with people and life; I have read it and re-read it many times.

The book was written in the 1930's and the characters and stories relate people and places in that time, which are timeless stories with practical results in dealing with other people with much wisdom. And some of these characters, as in Theodore Roosevelt, are worth remembering, significant people not to forget. While this is an easy to read this book, it's another thing to both apply and remember to apply in daily situations with other people.How many people really listen to one another, try to remember their names, let them save face, try to let them take credit for ideas, show them importance, smile, relax, empathize, apply Socratic inquiry over correcting, asking questions instead of giving orders, call attention to others mistakes in an indirect manner, admit one's own mistakes, lay down a positive reputation before proof, make light of other's faults seeming easy to correct and so forth.

This book is true to its name with its 3 sections on how to improve your social skills. Its not a book that tells you to go out there and talk to people. Its a book based on abit of human psychology and traits to show you what people like and dislike. Basically, it tells what people in general like to hear, see. Book contains many very simple rules that we just do not understand or master. I have very difficult time conversing with people not because im shy but because i did not understand what to say or what people want to hear.

In my opinion it is the most important book that anyone can ever read. I am now more confident in dealing with others and have a unique skill of making friends with anyone. I love it and find that others often wonder how I am so good at it and want to know my secret. I tell them to read the book and rest will take care of itself. I always talk in terms of what the other person wants and try to let them do most of the talking.Dale covers these topics in great detail in HOW TO WIN FRIENDS AND INFLUENCE PEOPLE.

I thoroughly enjoyed it and realized why I was floundering in some of my relationships. The biggest lesson I got from the book was quit thinking about yourself and think about the other person. Self absorption is an epidemic.Now to address the negative reviewers. Anything can be used negatively. If you want to manipulate and hurt others you don't need to use this book. I guess I kept hearing Carnegie stressing over and over again the need for sincerity and if you weren't sincere it would all eventually backfire on you.We live in a society that has abandoned common courtesy and social skills for &quot;keepin it real&quot;, which is just another way of saying I'll do whatever I want and screw you if you don't like it.I'm in the schools everyday and teachers are verbally attacked and abused constantly. Learning, education and just plain life cannot take place without the skills to facilitate our relationships one with another.

This is the book that dragged an economically depressed USA into a bunch of shiny smiling door to door salesmen. It is all about that and then some more. Psychologically however you won't be blamed for seeing the dark side to it no matter how many times the word honest is splashed across the page. The truth is, imagine telling somebody \\"Look, I can not change your mind for you. If I want you to think like I do then I should be trying to get you to believe that the idea I like is your idea.\\" These kind of psychological practices are borderline mind control but applicable all the same and Dale Carnegie uses every rule in his little personality juice book to ascend a person into the realm of instant authority bridled and charged for checking by whoever they are trying to get something from. There is something almost dishonest about the amount of power one can have over any social situation with even some of the basic stuff advocated in this book. It is so good that it could be deemed very dangerous in the wrong hands. The orientation in most its darker matters are winning human beings over to yourself and then manipulating them for some purpose, to your own end. It also has the clout to back it up but it requires that a person adopt the kind of Ted Bundy smile with absolute discipline of good character at all times, meaning curbing anything remotely less than lavishing praise, while the mastermind is at work judging the situation, manipulating it, seeking power through restrained interaction but with strings attached to sway the other person to give you the upper hand then always the weight to maintain it as long the person doesn't get how you are actually dealing with them... playing on their desire for appreciation even if it means paying something in some way for it. That is the general principle behind this book although it is expressed in much hearty better ways where one could in theory not gain anything but help the other person go somewhere that would help them. Still this is hardly why this book sold so many copies. This isn't a guide about how to drink tea the right way with the Queen or how to walk properly; it is about becoming somebody who may not be your true self in order to gain... and it works."},{"Title":"How to Win Friends & Influence People (Cardinal Editions, C 303)","review":"Road to success: develop a genuine interest in other people.

It's not about you, it's about 'them' - you can make more friends in two months by becoming interested in other people than you can in two years by trying to get other people interested in you.

Two of my favourites are \\"Nothing is more permanent than change\\" and the serious businessman's compliment \\"There is room for improvement\\". Intoning this latter saying in its various ways may open the mind vastly. Thus,Late in life, but not too late, I recently met the 1981 revision of \\"How to Win Friends & Influence People\\" by Dale Carnegie. I was suspicious of it for its title, which was too brash and brisk for me. I would have called it \\"Why be friendly?\\", which may lack appeal to those most obviously -- at least to outsiders -- in need.As the book proves, we all 'lead with deed' despite words. Words may set good examples, only if we bother to live up to them.

I have greatly changed my view toward myself, my family, friends, colleages, and other people. It is a book worth for reading 1000 times."},{"Title":"How to Win Friends & Influence People (Cardinal Editions, C 303)","review":"Carnegie's book has been around forever because he does a very good job of speaking to regular people. His advice is time-tested. It's explained in a way that is easy to understand and easy to remember. The rules he lays out are easy to apply in daily life, too. Carnegie's goal is to help people understand how their own behavior affects the way the way others percieve them and their ideas. He creates a series of rules for different types of encounters: arguments, selling an idea or product, generating enthusiasm, helping people to see how you can help them serve their own interests, etc.Carnegie wasn't writing for an academic audience and so this is not a deeply scholarly work. Carnegie doesn't really get into why his rules work or create a grand system that can be applied universally. What you get is more like a series of tips that will help in the sort of situations people face daily. It's great general advice on how to deal with people and it is a very quick read.If you are looking for something more specialized or advanced, I suggest Cialdini's \\"Influence\\" for good persuasive tactics, Ury's \\"Getting Past No\\" for a strong intro to negotiations and dealing with unreasonable people, or Lucas' \\"The Art of Public speaking\\" (although Carnegie wrote a public speaking book, too).Edit 10/09/08: My review has apparently been unhelpful to some folks, so perhaps this add-on will improve it. First, I don't put this book in the same class as the other titles that I mentioned in the review. This is a mass-market self-help book. It contains very basic advice that I think is useful to many, many people. Basically, Carnegie's message is about how to treat people respectfully and civilly so that they will treat you the same way. Very useful stuff.Second, despite the title, Carnegie was not an advocate of unprincipled manipulation but of conscious civility. Compared to other mass market books, this one is outstanding, in part because Carnegie discusses the difference between sincerity and flattery and explicitly advocates for sincerity. Too many self-help books are value-neutral or so self-centered in their focus that I think they encourage destructive and unethical behavior. Carnegie does not.Third, this book is effective. I have seen it used with conventional textbooks in a university Persuasion class. The students learned from Carnegie and were more pleasant to deal with by the end of the course. Solid communications theory underlies what Carnegie taught in a common-sense manner and so his advice is effective, as the many reviews here attest. I do not consider Carnegie's work to be scholarly work, but it's a lot more accessible and enjoyable to read. For books of this type (mass market self-help books), I think this is the best. It is inexpensive, time-tested, and quick to read. It deserves five stars because it is excellent.Fourth, Carnegie isn't teaching how to deal with really intransigent folks or how to engage in high-level negotiations or how to persuade an audience. All he does here is cover some good interpersonal communications techniques. That's the strength of this book and it's weakness. If you want to do any of those other things, you need something else. But, If all you want is to get along with people better on a personal level, then this is a great book and I highly recommend it.

Sometimes it can be quite simple to effect self-improvement and change given a personal desire to do so. This very simple read has literally done that for millions of us over generations. The basic premise of the book is simple; one must demonstrate a sincere interest and common ideals with other people in order to have the greatest influence on them. Its a sort of \\"how-to\\" or textbook of the art of projecting effective focused sincerity for personal gain without appearing to have a hidden agenda. The book reads so easily and quickly that I truly regretted coming to the last page. Fortunately, I found that a sequel exists, \\"How To Stop Worrying and Start Living\\". Clearly, there is some reiteration from the original but I found the sequel interesting and like the original quite a page turner. In the end, \\"How To Win Friends And Influence People\\" is so simple to grasp that one may not even realize how powerful and sustainable the message of the book really is and on many levels. I read this book and the sequel three times, all in 1968 and the message has stayed with me to my benefit ever since. Some readers wanted to be better salesmen, or sought political office, while other readers were just plain curious about what the big fuss was about. Regardless of the readers motive, we all got something from the book and probably more than we expected.

I know it sounds cheesy to say it was life-changing, but it really was!I think most people assume they know how to socialize, they think \\"it's easy, why would anyone need to read a how-to book about it?\\". Once you put Carnegie's ideas into practice, however, you start getting what you want, and you're a whole lot happier because of it.

The book is also one of the most popular books of all time, selling over 15 million copies. Written in 1936, How to Win Friends and Influence People promises to help solve \\"the problem of getting along with and influencing people in one's every day, business and social contacts.\\" The book is broken down into six sections, each one containing multiple chapters dedicated to showing how it is possible for one to change the behavior of others by changing one's own reaction to them.How to Win Friends and Influence People is an enjoyable book to read and I would recommend it to everyone from college students to farmers to retired professionals. The points in the book are common sense approaches to dealing with people. It is important for people to read this book because, many times, as individuals we act emotionally and not in a common sense way. This book serves as a knock on the head, a reminder to act how we know we ought to. In the book, Carnegie also uses a lot of psychological reasoning to prove how his approaches work. Additionally, the anecdotes in the book illustrate how these teachings are applicable to an array of life situations. If I could change one thing about the book, it would be that it needs to be updated. All of the examples in the book, while appropriate, are severely dated and are from the 1800s and early 1900s. I feel that while the teachings of Carnegie are still applicable to the 2000s, the book could be made more relevant to today's audience if its anecdotes and language were updated to reflect today's culture, society, and technological growth."},{"Title":"How to Win Friends & Influence People (Cardinal Editions, C 303)","review":"This book is a must read and must for audio.

The two big ideas that I have learned from this book are that a) for people to like you, you must behave in a way that satisfies their desires, and b) people like to feel important. Putting these two ideas together, to make people like you, you ought to compliment them in a way that makes them feel important. To feel important doesn't mean to be a Winston Churchill, it just means that however you get your sense of fulfillment and however you feed your ego, to feel that you are successful at this and that you are admired for your success. And being admired doesn't mean being put on a pedestal, rather just to have someone whose opinion you respect tell you that you are doing a good job.The book is full of useful rules to memorize to make one better at dealing with people. Carnegie recommends reading each chapter twice before moving on to the next chapter and periodically reviewing the book. This is good advice whenever you are trying to really internalize something, not just remember the outline of what was said but so that it's at your fingertips and becomes part of your unconscious behavior. I think that repetition is the most important tool for really learning things, and I like Carnegie's technique of repeating important statements.There is much room for continued education throughout life. It's silly that people spend years of their lives where their primary responsibility is learning and then have a complete switch into work with little further formal education. Also, I think students would be helped a lot if they were formally taught the skills that Carnegie teaches in his book, the same way students are formally taught mathematics, English, history and physics.\\"The unvarnished truth is that almost all the people you meet feel themselves superior to you in some way, and a sure way to their hearts is to let them realize in some subtle way that you recognize their importance, and recognize it sincerely.\\" (p. 104)"},{"Title":"How to Win Friends & Influence People (Cardinal Editions, C 303)","review":"Anyone who is a leader or desires to lead should read this book once a year as a reminder of the difference between true influence and manipulation.

The book is split into four parts. One about handling people, one about making people like you, one about making people view a situation to your way of thinking, and one about how to change people without giving offense or arousing resentment. The book starts off with a preface that gives a sort of formula to allow the reader to get the best out of the book. The book goes over chapters or what Carnegie refers to as principles. A principle in the book is a specific piece of advice that will help in a situation that will benefit both the user and the receiver. The principles all work together to create a way to successfully complete the objective of that specific part. I thought that that was a very intellectual way to start off a book full of advice and applicable information. The book not only gives advice about how to handle certain situations, but also gives many real life examples of how they are put to use and how they have worked. Throughout the book famous men are quoted to the likes of Abraham Lincoln, John D. Rockefeller Junior, and other famous psychologists and scientists; the kicker is and what makes it relate so much to the average Joe or Jane is that many of the people quoted are others like them. People all across the United States and even all over the world are quoted and stories are read that relate to a certain principle. All this accumulates to a better understanding of how the principle relates to a regular person in the business or personal world.The book keeps moving along very quickly as each principle is reinforced with real life examples of how they have worked. Then as you feel boredom approaching your psyche the book quickly sums up the chapter with a footer that always gives a brief synopsis in what the chapter is trying to teach. The book was written in the 1930's but the preface mentions that modernized examples have been added that do not affect Carnegie's writing style. The preface was written by Dorothy Carnegie, Dale's wife. The only result of the modernization is to allow a modern audience to better understand the text in a way to better get results from the book. I felt this tactic worked well in giving advice to a modern audience. This is imperative to the success of the reader in a society that has vastly changed since the 1930's. What the preface also illustrates is the way that psychology since the 30's has not changed in that all of the \\"principles\\" mentioned in the book are still relevant to a modern society. After all chapters, or what Carnegie calls principles, are explained you are given an \\"In a Nutshell\\" guide that goes over each principle to give a visual guide of connecting them. This allows people to see both text and a visual aid to help out in the learning process and Carnegie obviously understands this. Carnegie also understands the human mind and the affect that being kind and courteous to others does. This is why all of the principles have a lot to do with these two characteristics. With these two attributes added with the ability to stop one's self and think about what you are going to say before you say it allows for the main objective of the book to be successful.One thing you might want to consider to better understand some of the jargon that Carnegie talks about is a brief understanding of the Industrial Age (late 1800's, early 1900's) and the key players involved in it. The book quite frequently refers to events that happen in this era. You do not need to know, per say, but I found that my understanding of what Carnegie mentioned helped my enjoyment of the book. As we, human beings, are more social than ever this book is more relevant than ever. This would only equate to more sales to a book that has already sold more than fifteen million copies world-wide."},{"Title":"How to Win Friends & Influence People (Cardinal Editions, C 303)","review":"This is a book to be read and practiced.

As a refresher on basic people skills which candidly should have been learned as a child this book is outstanding.However, one must remain cognizant that how one dealt with people 70 years ago is vastly different from today. People are a product of their environment which has changed tremendously over the years, hence people change and how you deal with them should as well.Nevertheless, most basic people skills still apply, however, they are only equally as affective if all parties involved are playing by the same set of rules laid out in this book.For example, if you spend the majority of your time seeing things from the other person's point of view and in return they do not take the time to see it from yours, how is that helping you? I see how it helps them, but not so much you.That is the overall, problem with this book. All parties have to follow this brilliant plan in people skills for it to be \\"equally\\" affective which unfortunately, wont happen in most cases.In conclusion, this book advocates being nice (letting the other person talk, seeing things from their point of view, never telling someone their wrong, etc.) However, to end my review with another cliche:\\"nice guys finish last\\""},{"Title":"How to Win Friends & Influence People (Cardinal Editions, C 303)","review":"I didn't read any new information, pretty much common sense.

About putting up a friendly face even if it's fake. Unfortunately to get ahead in business it's what you have to do, it seems."},{"Title":"How to Win Friends & Influence People (Cardinal Editions, C 303)","review":"Having not read the entire book, I do not possess the privilige to make any final verdicts or claims. Yet from what I have read so far, everything is not only presented in plain English, but the materials are also surprsingly informative.However I will have to say that most of the suggestions and principles are probably not unheard of though, and they are not anything fundamentally revolutionary. But it does serve a purpose, it is good to be reminded sometimes. I'm pretty sure that not all of us incoporate all these principles or even bear them in mind when we submerge ourself into this crowded society. Constantly reviewing the topics covered by the book can keep ourselves alarmed on how to behave when dealing with others. While not trying to be disrespectful, I would like to politely ask those handful of individuals who crticized the book with harsh terms for \\"Wasting their time, and not teaching them anything\\" to once again... peruse this outstanding piece of literature with great care, and see what it has to say about...."},{"Title":"How to Win Friends & Influence People (Cardinal Editions, C 303)","review":"and one of the few I have found useful. This book can really give you a new perspective on your problems and life in general. Sometimes Dale Carnegie's advice is much more practical and at the same time also so much more inspiring than the modern self-help gurus. For example, one of my favorite bits of advice from Dale Carnegie goes something like this: a man who was aging and wanted to get his medical degree and become a doctor, he told Dale about this saying, \\"Dale, I want to become a doctor, it's always been a dream of mine, but I'm 40 years old now, I'm afraid I'm just too old to become a doctor, by the time I got my medical degree 8 years from now, I would be 48 years old!\\", to which Dale replied. \\"Yes, but if you don't do it, you'll be 48 years old anyway!\\" I thought that was just great! Some of the best advice I've ever heard, I have the same problem, thinking I'm too old to do what I want to do and persue my dreams, but that little story made me realize its NOT true! This book definately deserves 5 stars!"},{"Title":"How to Win Friends & Influence People (Cardinal Editions, C 303)","review":"There is good reason that this book has been in circulation for so many decades: Carnegie's methods, as well as his numerous anecdotes, make for an interesting and informative read. Unlike most contempory guides on business and life that are filled with overused buzzwords, Carnegie's straightforward manner offers effective advice for dealing with people that won't go out of style. I would say this quintessential work is just as effective for small businessmen as it is for corporate employees or college students, teachers, or anyone else looking to improve their place in life."},{"Title":"How to Win Friends & Influence People (Cardinal Editions, C 303)","review":"After reading this book, I find myself using alot of the techniques in situations I find myself in while trying to raise my two children, ages 10 and 6"},{"Title":"How to Win Friends & Influence People (Cardinal Editions, C 303)","review":"How to Win Friends and Influence people is the most usefulbook I have read in quite a while.

But I felt a need to voice serious and strong objection to many of the stories used in this book, particularly in the Leadership section of the book. Many examples are rife with passive aggressive behavior in which the author suggests readers should prefix what essentially is a command or expectation with flowery praise somewhat related to the coming edict. The result is a passive aggressive slap in the face.As a manager or friend or family member or employee or what ever, you don't need to build someone up to ask them or tell them what you need. And you don't need to bury a request within a flowery suggestive praise in a passive aggressive manor. If someone used some of these tactics on me, I would react very badly and state \\"if I am not performing as required, just come out and tell me what to do better or differently, thank you.\\"While the author says to never use a \\"but\\" in the sense of building someone up with praise before tearing them down, it is still a \\"yea, but\\" but any other name or wording. This is really terrible advice even if you stress not to use the \\"but\\". You will not earn friends nor influence people including coworkers and directs by using this \\"yea, but\\" type methodology and the afore mentioned passive aggressive approach.There are even a few occurrences in the book which suggest that telling a lie is acceptable. That you can tell a little white lie and win friends and influence people! The text does not out right say you should lie nor does it state that you should do so. But it is an obvious implication if you read the stories in a certain way. Essentially, read this book with a critical eye. The author provides sage advice but often follows that sage advice with examples of poor delivery which occasionally include deception!The author's best points are made early in the opening pages of the book. Urging readers to consider that every person always believes they are in the right, even if the entire world thinks that they are an evil person. The author also makes good points in that knowing and using names is important. The conversational tone of the book utilizes stories from people and the sums up the stories with a conclusion. The stories are likely rare hits and a world full of misses. Good points mostly but too drawn out and full of stories that don't hit home and seem unrealistic. Maybe they worked in a different time but many come across as phony 75 years later."},{"Title":"How to Win Friends & Influence People (Cardinal Editions, C 303)","review":"This will really open your eyes to how people think and how to work with people!

Getting people to listen to others - now there is a message that needs even more attention in today's world.His book may seem to be some sort of \\"pop psychology\\" but it much more than that and it has proven over time to be an instrument of self-awareness for those who follow his advice. I enjoyed this book back in 1961 when I first read it. Then I liked it even more in 1971 and 1984 and 1990 and 2001 when I read it again and again. It seems that each time I read it I get a renewed appreciation for what he was saying. I also pick up on something new from the book, which is hard to believe - I think maybe it has something to do with growing older and seeing life from a different level of life experiences.This is a classic book that should be read by all high school and college students to add some value to their life journey. Gift this book to those people in your life whom you love - and more importantly to those who do not love you! This book will change you and it a small way it has already changed the world."},{"Title":"How to Win Friends & Influence People (Cardinal Editions, C 303)","review":"This is an very easy to ready book, and it has helped me in so many ways.It is a necessity for any boy or girl wanting to make their mark in the world.Highly recommend!!!!!"},{"Title":"How to Win Friends & Influence People (Cardinal Editions, C 303)","review":"I just reread this book years after I initially read it and the advice still holds up. It's sage advice for the ages. THen, as now, there are certain parts of the book I disagree with, but overall, the book is timeless.Carnegie deserves his reputation. While the book is not perfect it's a tremendous primer for today's young and instills rock solid values so frequently absent in the schools and at home.For those solely interested in the financial aspects check out \\"The Millionaire Mind\\" by Stanley.The Millionaire Mind"},{"Title":"How to Win Friends & Influence People (Cardinal Editions, C 303)","review":"I have to say that I came onto this book with a very skeptical frame of mind. I was trigger-quick judgmental on Dale Carnegie. My initial thoughts were \\"useless quick-fixes\\", without even reading the book. But in reviewing our mutual lists of favorite self improvement books, a very dear friend of mine who I trust in this area, Marcia Makepeace, suggested that i give the book a chance. So I read it with a view to seeking useful tools for an orderly state of life -- that is, where success is a focus of one's existance.Indeed, Carnegie has many interesting concepts which are highly useful in ordering one's life. This can surely support a successfuk lifestyle. Not only is it easy to pick and choose from Carnegie's suggested actions, those things that are done could lead to a simpler and less impulsive life style. The book points us to many minor miracles we can achieve in our life, if we are simply inclined to do so. It also keeps a healthy dose of love in the equation."},{"Title":"How to Win Friends & Influence People (Cardinal Editions, C 303)","review":"I found this book to be an excellent and inspiring read.

Count Dale Carnagie among the few. How to Win Friends and Influence People is a brilliant book. Let that unequivocal statement be said right off the bat. It possesses an uncanny blend of poigant writing and innovative social views that compels without commanding. Recent critics have written of Carnegie's influence in part to its dated examples and the undeniable emergence of contemparary motivational speakers such as Tony Robbins. But Robbins himself stands as maybe Carnegie's must relevant example to date. Filled with negotiation techniques and reader exercises, How to Win is the perfect first step to self-advancemnt. Throughout the book, Carnegie showcases his trademark style, offering slices of manipulative knowledge and snippets of hidden agendas. Even in revised form, Carnegie veiws are not tampered with, just updated, thankfully. While the assertion that making a million is easier than going to jail or something of that nature is a little bit of a stretch, you can take almost every single idea from this book and apply to your professional and social life."},{"Title":"How to Win Friends & Influence People (Cardinal Editions, C 303)","review":"Through his pristine organization, Dale Carnegie uses his experience and numerous examples to teach the reader to employ methods which seem so obvious but somehow often get overlooked. THere are numerous examples which make the reader strive to implement Carnegie's advice into your life, but he is not repetitive. THere is the ideal amount of repetition and enforcement throughout the book, which is supported by summarozed lists to keep track of the basic principles upon which each chapter is based. Whether is business or social relationships, this book can have a profound effect.

By using these principles, you can simply change your world! Steven Covey has criticized this book indirectly because he states that it &quot;truncates the character base&quot;. It is THE book for sociopaths who will smile, call you by your first name, and grab your money. But I did have good results with this marketing system. We had a new manager at a telemarketing company. I felt horrible mainly because it is horrible work (which is why I go out of my way to treat these people decently). Anyway, the new manager came in and walked behind us. I knew later that she was Carnegie Trained. First, she called me by my name. Bill. Secondly, she said I had a good telephone voice. And third, she made my mistakes seem easy to correct. And finally she pointed out my mistakes indirectly. Well, I felt good and relaxed. Then my performance didskyrocket in results! These are four Carnegie techniques. Now what does it matter if she &quot;smudged&quot; a bit. It's a hell of a lot better than being yelled at! The Carnegie system is still the world's best management system according to people whom I have interviewed. And you really only have to buy one book! If you are worried about being a &quot;phoney&quot;, then you can buy Adam Khan's &quot;Self-Help Stuff That Works&quot; which is based om Martin Seligman's &quot;Learned Optimism&quot; and &quot;How to Win Friends and Influence People&quot;. It's a bit tougher than Carnegie's approach, but not as pious nor as rigid as Covey's books. I do disagree with Khan on one point strongly and so would Carnegie I believe. In his chapter &quot;Complaint Compunctions&quot;, Khan takes the position that you should NOT listen to someone bad-mouth a third person. That you should state, &quot;I think it would be better if you took this problem to the person you are angry at.&quot; A bit tough. But I do agree with Khan and I believe Carnegie was amiss with Khan's chapter &quot;Bad Apples&quot;. Khan claims, and rightly so, that there are simply some people you can't deal with. They are covered with mud and no matter what you try in dealing with them, you will have mud over you after trying to deal with them. So deal with them as little as possible even if they are your employees. Advice to the wise. I think that Covey's disguised criticism can be covered with Khan's chapter &quot;Forging Mettle&quot; which displays a &quot;people-oriented&quot; approach to dealing with human beings. Buy this book if you don't want to sink. And buy &quot;Self Help Stuff That Works &quot; if you want to stay aflaot. Good luck."},{"Title":"How to Win Friends & Influence People (Cardinal Editions, C 303)","review":"I have read the book several times and enjoy it very much.

I personally don't have a problem making friends, but I think we all (whether popular or not) should (from time-to-time) brush up on our people skills, it doesn't hurt, it's a process of growing. He uses a lot of historical characters to make his points clear, so those who like a little history can also benefit from this book.

No book in the self-help category matters more than this one.Learning to relate to people in the ways Carnegie instructs will help you personally as well as professionally.This book is a classic because Carnegie says timeless truths in timeles ways. What is key is not subservient genuflecting, but mutual respect, honor and attention to the peerson as much as the task. The task is never unimportant, but to get the task done, people are involved.I fully recommend \\"How to Win Friends and Influence People\\" by Dale Carnegie.Anthony Trendlhttp://anthonytrendl.com"},{"Title":"How to Win Friends & Influence People (Cardinal Editions, C 303)","review":"I first read Tim Sanders, \\"Love is the Killer App\\", and from that book I heard about this one. I picked it up and finished it the same day, but still go back and look at it. The book spells out how to interact with people beautifully. Many of the techniques he mentions I have already been doing (with good success), but adds so much more and clearly explains what to do, how to do it, and with vivid examples. I find his examples of how to handle a situation fascinating and it gets you sucked in. He explains how to handle working with co-workers, or interacting with management, or how to handle customers, and even how to interact with new people. My only pessimistic comment about the book, and someone mentioned this in another review, is, is he spelling out sincerity or how to make things go your way no matter what? What I mean is a lot of what he says seems very manipulative. It doesn't seem like honesty or ethics matter at all. He doesn't stress compassion for how you act with people, but rather just says do this, it works. However, I don't think he meant that at all. It is important to understand that however you act with people or handle a situation needs to be with compassion and sincerity (unless are you haggling for a $200 million dollar contract and you... on the line). I would recommend reading this, but also Tim Sanders, \\"Love is the Killer App\\". Sanders books complements this book beautifully. Nontheless, this is a must read.

Dale Carnegie must have been a genius in the 30's. The life lessons taught in \\"How to Win Friends..\\" are so rock solid as to change a person's life for good. It has already started to change the course of my life.From the very first chapter, I started to feel the veil being removed from my eyes. I had been doing so much wrong in relating to people that the common sense - but often over-looked - advice by Carnegie was a huge wake up call.Just one of the pieces of advice that really woke me up was this: Every single person wants to feel important - and you can provide this by speaking in terms of their interests - not yours. By doing this you feed them their importance and they relay their kindly demeanor and possibly friendship towards you. Simple? Perhaps. But mind-blowingly effective if you hadn't really picked up on it before.The \\"yes,yes\\" approach was clever and effective. Get people to say yes a few times before you ask them a question, to sort of get their systems in an agreeable mood. But if they say \\"no\\" to something first, then their systems are in a state of withdrawal and will more likely get them telling you no to your question.This is merely a tad of the great advice this book gives. If there were ever a definitive \\"people skills\\" book. This is it! I have no regrets buying and reading this book, and will in fact read this book again right away, even though I just finished it. It's worth it to really digest the information I would say.If you or someone you know is shy or unsure of himself or herself around other people, then get this book! There will be no regrets, at least I can't see how their could be. And if you want to further enhance your life, I would recommend picking up \\"The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People\\" by Stephen Covey. These books prove that their is power in reading, as long as you chart the right course of literature."},{"Title":"How to Win Friends & Influence People (Cardinal Editions, C 303)","review":"Why are the simple things so hard to do?

There is only one book that I can justifiably give this claim to, and this is it. Some of the more critical lessons learned in this book, while simple in concept, can easily have very profound results.I will admit readily that much of the book is what one would consider obvious, yet it is puzzling that it is often human nature to be aware of obvious principles yet never use them to one's benefit. Much of this book falls into that category and thus merely rehashing what should be obvious is of ample value, yet there is greater value to be obtained from the book.One need only read through the section on persuasive letter writing to acquire a taste for the rich content of this book. It should be recognized that building a rationale based on another's point of view is not merely an instinctive skill. This approach requires practice followed by diligent effort to master. Carnegie clearly establishes himself as a true artist among his many samples displaying his persuasive skills. This chapter alone has permitted me to bring down the guard of many executives in the business world thus permitting my point of view consideration that otherwise would go unheard.Carnegie spends considerable time speaking on the virtues of genuinely examining the mindset of those around you; to readily commit to understanding how others have come to their own conclusions. How profound is it to consider that no matter how much you disagree with another, that had you reasoned based on the full accumulation of the life experiences of another, it is quite logical to expect that you would have an entirely different point of view? I confess that I do not feel I possess the skills to adequately articulate this point; however, I want to emphasize that comprehension of this principal has changed my life over the last 15 years in momentous ways; a harmonious marriage, a very open and understanding mind, and even the skill set to continually gain access to minds of the most insular people.To reiterate, I do no feel even at my best I can give this book proper justice. If you do read this book, be certain to look for this message, as I am not aware of a more influential concept available regarding human interaction."},{"Title":"How to Win Friends & Influence People (Cardinal Editions, C 303)","review":"I was able to listen to this classic book while driving on a trip.

Indeed, in England there is a statute so providing. Oberman and Meyer explore the tradition and its probable policy basis and whether it should be retained."},{"Title":"Mothers Who Kill Their Children: Understanding the Acts of Moms from Susan Smith to the \\"Prom Mom\\"","review":"I ordered this book based on the cover - assuming that this would be a case by case synopsis of various murdering moms. However, I was wrong. This book is like reading 1000 articles from a medical journal. It is definitely not for casual crime readers such as myself. The vignettes are a paragraph long at best then dissolve into various author opinions on what is wrong with the state of our social service departments, society in general, fathers today, poverty, and on and on. I was really surprised by the Susan Smith case review as the author seemed to completely miss or purposely disregard the fact that the real motive for killing her children was prompted by her dream of a new life with a rich man at work. I do no think her vague unnamed personality disorder was the main factor there. Not recommended."},{"Title":"Mothers Who Kill Their Children: Understanding the Acts of Moms from Susan Smith to the \\"Prom Mom\\"","review":"Mothers are the majority of child killers and are one of the greatest hazards to children. On the rare occasions when this subject comes up it is inevitably accompanied by a remark that this is \\"the hardest crime to understand.\\" That's because common wisdom views women as incapable of evil. When stories of female teachers who molest male children surface, they are always followed by disclaimers that female pedophilia is \\"rare,\\" even though these stories number in the hundreds and are likely underreported. It was inevitable that most treatments of child-killing and battery by mothers would treat the perpetrators as \\"troubled\\" or \\"victims of abuse.\\" But aren't male killers equally troubled? Do they come from happy, well adjusted homes? The discussions of Susan Smith and the \\"Prom Mom\\" ignore the very obvious motivations for their crimes.This type of double standard does a disservice to the innocent children being killed. It is a thin and frivolous justification for a heinous crime."},{"Title":"Mothers Who Kill Their Children: Understanding the Acts of Moms from Susan Smith to the \\"Prom Mom\\"","review":"I work in the field of abused children. I felt this book did not hold the women accountable for their actions. The author's basically gave them a \\"free pass\\" in life by making excuses. It does not matter if you are rich, poor, abused....you took a life ( a very innocent life that could not protect him or herself ).In addition, they did not go into enough detail with the stories they presented. Basically, they gave a few lines regarding a case, and that was it. I think it would have been better to have spent more time on a few cases including all of the history."},{"Title":"Mothers Who Kill Their Children: Understanding the Acts of Moms from Susan Smith to the \\"Prom Mom\\"","review":"Took 3 weeks for product to be shipped due to seller was in the process of moving.

As a woman, a mother, an antiviolence activist/advocate; I found this book lacking. This book lacked empathy and compassion for the most powerless victims-the children.This book lacked objectivity. The cases summaries, if you can call them that, are actually far leaning slants towards devaluing the lives of children. The authors made the case that these women were so depressed and defeated during the moments that they were murdering children, yet not too depressed and defeated to try to cover up the evil acts in an attempt to escape the punishment.This book lacked hope. We are presented with \\"case summaries\\" of women who had run into very trying and difficult obstacles and yet we are to consider accepting that they had no other choice but to kill their children. Is dying any better at the hands of your mother than if it were a stranger? Are you any less dead because it was your mother who killed you?Listen, if you are writing a truly objective research paper or something like that then this book will serve you well in coming up with a counter argument to common sense."},{"Title":"Quiet Place Maybard","review":"This is very much an &quot;English&quot; SF novel. Set in a future, post apocalypse, Europe, it follows the fortunes of a group of astronauts who have left Earth expecting to return a few years later but, due to a miscalculation in time dilation, they arrive many years later than they expected. They discover that the world has changed greatly and not for the better. Due to some cataclysmic event, civilisation, the whole world over appears to have gone back to an era thousands of years more primative than the world that they left behind.The travellers attempt to bring some semblance of order and civilisation to a world that is a mixture of primitive savagery and old artifacts. Returning to England, through a derelict channel tunnel, they attempt to form and civilise a community. Can they succeed and turn their new found followers into a reborn civilisation of will they just be a glitch on a downward spiral?This book takes a bleak and deeply pessimistic view of the human spirit. It is not a comfortable read but it is well written and it makes an interesting tale. Parts are rather weak and too &quot;off pat&quot; to be convincing and this diminishes the ultimate impact of what would otherwise be one of the most upsetting future histories that I have read.The author's rather flacid logic for the fall of civilisation is the worst part of the book. It would have been a better story if he had not felt the need to address this issue which is not central to the main story line.I give this a recommendation as a good, if not great book."},{"Title":"Utterly Me, Clarice Bean","review":"As a creative writing teacher and mother of three utterly adventurous and book loving children, ages 6 through 10, I thoroughly, UTTERLY loved reading this book aloud to my children. I was concerned that my son, age 6 and complete Star Wars/Superhero addict, would not enjoy a story about a plain, ordinary girl, but he surprised me and became completely engrossed in the story. We enjoyed every moment of the book from beginning to end, and decided we must get all the books in the series. Most enjoyable for me was the fact that the narrative, cleverly and appropriately written from the perspective of Clarice, was so accurate and delightful - totally funny, outrageous and completely reminiscent of young girlhood angst. My children were so delighted and fell completely in love with Clarice. I HIGHLY recommend Clarice Bean to any book lover. It's a much wittier version of Ramona Quimby.

We believed we were ordinary; we didn't appreciate our families or our lives in general. And we had a fantasy life that would make great theatre. What I really appreciated about Utterly Me, Clarice Bean is that Clarice always gives life her best.Clarice and her best friend Betty Moody love the mystery series with heroine Ruby Redfort, so it seems natural that they would use the Redfort books for a school project.Now that seems simple enough, but then Betty goes missing - and Clarice and the school's problem child are paired together for the book project. Clarice doesn't initially like the pairing, but as she and Karl work together, she realizes that he's got great ideas and is really pretty nice.The problems begin when Betty returns and becomes jealous of the relationship that has developed between Clarice and Karl. When the project trophy disappears, Karl is accused of stealing it. Clarice is determined to solve the mystery and clear Karl's name. Is she successful in solving the mystery? And what about the friendship between Clarice and Betty?I enjoyed the characters, the life-like feelings of a child about her life. The illustrations are entertaining. On some pages the writing streams and swirls around the page. This is a grand book for children between the ages of 7-10.

It will be a wonderful time spent together."},{"Title":"Utterly Me, Clarice Bean","review":"Utterly Me Clarice BeanUtterly me Clarice Bean is by Lauren Child.

I Think Lauren Child is trying to say that sometimes you have to look hard for something that's right in front of you. The main characters in the book are Clarice, Betty and her teacher {I don't remember her name}.My favorite part in the book is when they write a letter to Patricia F Maplin Stacey the auther of Ruby Redford.

I had to keep reminding myself of the intended grade level as I wanted the character to be more complex and have a deeper storyline. For an adult, reading a children's chapter book, the story was short of being so good that I got lost in the characters.

But Betty is so jealous of Clarice's new friendship with Karl that the girls quarrel. Karl is disqualified for stealing the prize. Clarice knows that proving his innocence would also prove that she has learned to solve mysteries like Ruby Redfort. That would show that she has learned something important from the books.

It goes into much detail about the men in the regiment, including a list of all their names and where they lived in Maine, even their occupation before the war. It brings you so close to the war that you feel you are actually there and experiencing the horrors of war from being frozen to the ground with no shelter to witnessing their comrades heads blown off by cannon balls. It also has many pictures of the men in uniform with their names identifying them and an excellent summary of statistics including how the men died or where they were wounded. About 800 men were in the regiment at any one time and about 3000 men served in it during the war. The 1st Maine was in mostof the main battles in the war from Gettysberg to the Wilderness and finally Appamatox where Custer accepted a white flag from the confederates.This book will give the reader the best detail of Calvary operations from saber fights at Brandy Station to using 16 shot repeating rifles at Petersberg and Appamatox. The reader will also find that the Cavalry often fought dismounted like infantry units and were among the units that suffered large numbers of dead and wounded but played so many roles from directly charging the enemy infantry and calvary units to scouting for enemy movements and guarding supply lines. I also like this book because some of my direct relatives were in the 1st Maine even though they were captured and imprisoned as I found out in the book.If you buy the book I would recommend paying for the 50 dollar version even though it is hard to find. I first found it at Shiloh but did not buy it and finally found it many years later at one of Amazons sellers bookstores."},{"Title":"Three Comedies","review":"As a great fan of George S. Kaufman (especially of his works co-written with Moss Hart), I was very much looking forward to reacquainting myself with his earlier comedies co-written with Edna Ferber. Unfortunately, this book has to be the most poorly proofread and mis-edited mass market text I've ever seen. My guess is that the text was scanned in using OCR software. A tremendous number of words make no sense in their context or are not even real words at all. Frequently, words will have capital letters, symbols, or numbers randomly inserted into the middle of them. Punctuation is erratic, with numerous periods in the midst of words or within sentences. The result is that the text is a chore to read, and the typesetting almost ruins these otherwise interesting plays. My advice is that, if you have access to the three plays in another volume, read them there; you'll enjoy the experience more. This is really an amateurish product that does disservice to the creativity of two fine pros."},{"Title":"Three Comedies","review":"I am a fan of both authors, Edna Ferber and George S. Kaufman.

This book is a reprint of Chief Joseph's account of the Nez Perce's dealings with their white brothers, the Nez Perce War of l877 which he tried so hard to avoid, and his people's imprisonment on reservations following his surrender. The final portion of the book consists of Joseph's plea that all people treat each other with respect and human decency and as equals. Hin-Mah-Too-Yah-Lahket expresses himself in nothing short of pure poetry. He is generally considered in the Northwestern United States (where he is a hero with a town, schools and numerous memorials named after him) to be one of the greatest Native American orators. This book is a must-read for 1) students of American history and 2) proponents of civil liberties. This edition does contain some strange spellings (e.g., Rutherford B. Hayes is here spelled \\"Rutherford Hays\\" and Hin-Mah-Too-Yah-Lahket is spelled \\"In-Mut-Too-Yah-Lat-Lat\\"). However, since Nimiputan was an unwritten language, the spelling of Nimiputan words and names is anybody's guess.

ALL ancient wisdom confirms: 1) Violence comes full circle to anyone, or any nation, that pursues it as a solution no matter what \`rightous' banner is used to vindicate it. 2) All governments decay into lying, cheating, and stealing from the governed because unrestrained power steals the soul, the humanity, out of a human being. 3) Only love and foregiveness create lasting change in the world. 4) Nature buries her undertakers--do not abuse her. One definition of insanity is \`doing the same thing expecting different results.'

The Nez Perce, whose traditional grounds were in the western Montana-Idaho-astern Oregon region, had seen their land steadily whittled away by governmental decree and white settlement until, by 1863, they were allowed less than 1,000 square miles. This led to a splintering of the tribe into compliant and noncompliant bands. Joseph, following his father's insistence that the land belonged to no one and couldn't be apportioned by governmental treaty, led the noncompliant band.Officially ignored for a few years, Joseph's Nez Perce fell under government scrutiny again when an in-rush of goldseekers in the mid-1870s led to increased tension between whites and Indians. The tension erupted into outright violence when a group of young and angry Nez Perce killed four white settlers, and the war which Joseph had tried so long and hard to avoid was thrust upon him.Although the war was short in duration, it was intense in fighting. No fewer than four U.S. armies went after Joseph. Nez Perce women and children were butchered by U.S. troops and volunteers. Joseph finally surrendered because he was promised that his people could return to their own lands. But they were sent first to Leavenworth, where many of them died from malaria, and then Baxter, Kansas.Throughout the interview, Joseph continuously expresses bewilderment at the greed of the white men who insist on owning all the land; at the fact that Indians are treated so unjustly, even though all men and women are kindred; at the willingness of the white community to dishonor itself by breaking treaties (\\"It makes my heart sick when I remember all the good words and all the broken promises,\\" p. 41); and at the arrogance of whites, who just naturally presume that they have the right to subjugate Indians (\\"I have asked some of the great white chiefs where they get their authority to say to the Indian that he shall stay in one place, while he sees white men going where they please. They cannot tell me,\\" p. 42).An eloquent and heartbreaking document, one that makes the reader proud of Chief Joseph and ashamed of the U.S. government's treatment of the Nez Perce--a tribe, by the way, that saved the Lewis and Clark expedition at a crisis moment."},{"Title":"That All People May Be One People, Send Rain to Wash the Face of the Earth","review":"This is the kind of book they should have requried us to read in school, a book of truth, a true heart speaks and tells its story.

Only when she is older and ready to embark on relationships with men does she realize to what extent her father Alistair's aloofness and secrecy have weighed on her own capacity to find the right partner and to define herself clearly as an individual.The lives of father and daughter run parallel in this tale, only truly intersecting when Hilary is at last able to piece together the mystery of Alistair's wartime past and his more recent extramarital adventure.The strife and dissent of the family echo the painful moments of a past in which Brenda Hall guides the reader through the trauma of committing unavoidable murder during the Resistance, the ignominious round-up of Parisian Jews in the V&eacute;lodrome d'Hiver in 1942, and the tragic loss of Alistair's first love, Lena (deported to a concentration camp).Brenda Hall's themes are multiple; her story tells how past and present are irrevocably linked and how long-ago events can shape not only us but our children as well. She evokes the consequences of unsuccessful marriage and the refusal to face the evidence of failure for any number of reasons: pride, conformity, apathy, despair, self-delusion. She is outraged by passivity in the face of inadequate family ties, as she is by our capacity to forget the lessons of the past: \\"Did the young learn about these events in school? Did those who remembered feel remorse, guilt, and sorrow?\\"Throughout the story, past and present, war and peacetime reverberate, while her characters, victims, all, of events beyond their control, struggle to make sense of their lives. Neither heroic nor wicked, like the villagers during the war (\\"But it wasn't clear-cut. People weren't simply heroes or villains.\\"), Brenda Hall endows them with the very human desire to pursue happiness that enthralls us all.Her subject is an ambitious one, her cast of characters numerous. Indeed, the author has bitten off quite a meaty morsel. To some, the narration may appear overloaded. She does, however, steer its complexity to a satisfying conclusion in which the past is laid to rest, if only for awhile. Both author and reader well know that if \\"the war to end all wars\\" is long past, other wars haunt us today, in other places, leaving their cruel, indelible marks on other lives, their poison in the veins of new generations (\\"nothing changes...people don't learn the lessons of history: each generation renews its hatreds with blood.\\")."},{"Title":"Kindred spirits: Family legends & childhood memories","review":"Nicole has a way of putting words together.

Then to their horror they see their best swimmer hanging by the neck from the high dive, apparently a suicide. This is followed by another apparent suicide, a weightlifter dies in the arms of his mistress.Why are Olympic athletes killing themselves? This is the question that Li Yan, back in China with his now pregnant American mistress, pathologist Margaret Campbell must answer. Though their relationship is frowned upon by the Chinese authorities, they need Margaret's skills, they need Li as well. But even as they need them, the authorities cannot understand why one of their own would want to marry a foreigner and this aspect of Chinese culture is as much a part of this wonderful story as is the investigation into doping, Triads and corruption that grab the reader by her eyeballs and keep her fingers blistering through the pages as this book races to a pulse-stopping ending that you'll never forget."},{"Title":"Runner","review":"Once again, Peter May puts together a strong mystery while illuminating key cultural differences between China and the USA. He also paints a fascinating picture of how China has \\"opened\\" up to a capitalist economy while maintaining its authoritarian communist political structure. The relationship between quixotic Chinese cop Li Yan and cranky but brilliant forensic pathologist Margaret Campbell continues to provide interest, although their utter lack of communication at times needs to be better explained. I also liked the touch of having each of them dealing with a difficult parent in the book as they prepare for the wedding.If there is a flaw in these books it is the author's need to tie up all the loose ends by killing off all the bad guys at the end. There is a killing in just the last few pages that seems tacked on and confusing in light of the dead man's character. I've read four of these thrillers, and there's always a wild, overly violent series of killings at the end, with little explanation of what happened to our main characters. I suppose this is designed to keep us reading the next one, but it leaves you feeling unsettled at the very end, and seems overly sensationalized.I also think the science involved is very far out, futuristic, but I suppose it's possible.Overall, the two main characters are very strong, but we could use more scenes with them together to develop their relationship for the reader, and the ending is a little confusing. But the cultural differences are fascinating and the picture of 21st century Beijing (with the necessary historical background to help us follow it) are worth these other flaws."},{"Title":"Runner","review":"There are two mysteries running though this excellent novel.

At the same time, will their planned marriage in two weeks take place? Tune in and find out.Overall, it is a provocative story, keeping the reader on the edge of his/her seat on both themes.

One Should be more carefull before he offends the youth of a nation, particullary if still some part (probably the better part) of himself still has something in common. The Greek youth is glad you are in the States... stay over there..."},{"Title":"The Colossus of Maroussi","review":"This must be counted among the most peculiar books ever wrtitten about Greece by an Anglophone writer, but it is also among the most truthful and , at least in part, beautiful. Henry Miller states that he approaches Greece with little book learning (p. 89) and considers himself a savage. He is really no savage but we can perhaps call him a barbarian, in the sense that Walt Whitman and Robert Browning are barbarians. This is an important point that distinguishes him from his friend and fellow philhellene writer Lawrence Durrell, who also wrote a good deal about Greece but with another kind of imaginative but more refined sensitivity. The title of this book refers to someone called Katzimbalis, a magnificent raconteur who seems never to have published anything himself but did a lot to promote the work of some important modern Greek poets. (See Edmund Keeley's books for details of the great English-Greek-American literary friendships of the thirties and forties.) But the book is not really about its purported subject. It is about the changes taking place in Greece during the thirties and changes that took place in Miller as a result of his long stay in that country. He presents the experience as mind-altering. The structural pivots of the book are visits to Knossos, Phaestos, Mycenae and Epidaurus. Each of these visits becomes an occasion for meditations on the meaning of life and death, all delivered in the author's peculiarly masculine and barbarian style. But the best writing is found when he deals with the low-lifes of Syntagma Square in Athens, who offer him whores and beautiful young boys. How innocent life was in the thirties. Listing is an important part of Miller's style. He piles up great numbers of nouns or present participles or finite verbs. Sometimes the reader feels a bit overwhelmed by them. Miller lived in France for quite a while and brings to his work the post-adolescent dislike of American culture and society that used to infect every intelligent American a few generations ago. Everything American is bad...everything Greek is good. Miller is passionate about nearly everything and dosn't try to hide it. He doesn't write to give the reader pretty words but to give a vision of truth as he sees it. I think he sees it well, even though his vision is different from mine."},{"Title":"The Colossus of Maroussi","review":"As a Greek-American reading about Greece in Miller's account written in the 1930's, I found it to be very moving. It isn't simply a travel book about Greece, it's about Greece healing someone's soul!I absolutely love Miller's, &quot;Tropic of Cancer,&quot; and was expecting the same style for Maroussi. However, I was mistaken. Miller doesn't include any of his notorious womanizing stories here. Instead, Miller writes about finding peace in contemplating Greece, modern and ancient. Again, his written prose is like reading poetry. There are some passages from this book that I had to &quot;cut out&quot; and keep for inspiration.I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in Henry Miller or Greece. I must also recommend Edmund Keeley's, &quot;Inventing Paradise,&quot; which is something of a companion to Maroussi. In it, Keeley discusses Miller's Greek journey, which he took along with George Seferis, Lawrence Durrell, and other 20th century Greek poets, writers, and painters."},{"Title":"The Colossus of Maroussi","review":"Reading this book (along with a couple by Lawrence Durrell) in my early 20s was the impetus for my husband and me to quit our jobs, put our belongings in storage, sell our 2 cars, and take off with a couple of backpacks for Greece. Miller's ability to render the landscape and the people in the incomparable clarity of Greece's pure air is a rare talent. The Colossus of Maroussi is destined to be read for a long time, for it has a timeless power to transport the reader not only into the mind of the author but also into mind, heart, and soul of the Greek people. They could not have had a more loving and compassionate chronicler than Henry Miller."},{"Title":"The Colossus of Maroussi","review":"Henry Miller's reputation as a writer needs little verification from the likes of me. Nevertheless, it is a pleasure to be able to confirm the abilities of a truly great author. This example of his work is in some ways a peculiar one since it was written during a turning point in modern history, namely the Second World War, and was inevitably a turning point in Miller's own life as well.Henry Miller has not always had kind things to say about his native U. S. A. Here, in \\"The Colossus of Maroussi,\\" he uses the American state as a kind of false backdrop for his discoveries in Greece. For Greece is the central geographical landscape on which he builds. Far from being a travelogue, however, it is a story of that ancient land and some of its people; Miller uses the fabric of Greek life to weave a story of mankind.His writing is distinctly dated today, but delightfully so. It is full of a poetic imagery that is almost entirely absent from the main stream of post-modern literature. As such, it is very complex writing which occasionally seems to be almost self-serving, as if the author was writing for no one but himself. In the main, it is a very accessible book that tries to reach out in pure, non-political terms to touch the essential core of what is man. At the present time, we could do well to review our own situation in life, and one way of doing so is by simply reviewing the literature on the subject. I recommend \\"The Colossus of Maroussi\\" as a place to start. Besides being the work of a truly formidable writer, it will take you to places you probably never dreamed existed."},{"Title":"The Colossus of Maroussi","review":"This is a small book with a big heart, an eloquent and enlightening memoir of Greece, where Henry Miller stayed briefly prior to leaving Europe for America at the begining of World War II. It is perhaps his best literary effort. For those who know Miller only through Tropic of Cancer or any of his other controversial books, pick this up today. If your local vendor doesn't have it, order it. Your eyes will be opened not only to the sun-drenched beauty of a country, but to the kind and loving genius of a man. You will see how truly visionary, human, and humane Miller was as he recounts his experiences and the people he befriended. His reflections are poetry here, his recollections sheer magic. You will be left with the knowledge of having experienced someone undergoing a spiritual transformation, and of being freed yourself. That is the book's gift to any reader. A country was never given a greater love letter. It is olives, bread and wine for the soul."},{"Title":"The Colossus of Maroussi","review":"When he was not tackling sex and philosophy, Henry Miller traveled. The Colossus of Maroussi is a book of those later times, when he, an \\"American Savage\\", entered the world of peace, beauty, and most of all, simplicity he was longing for while living in America. Nothing could prepare him for what he encountered in Greece, not the streets of New York, nor the streets of Paris. Although enamored with France, Miller's passion for Europe goes way further in this book, which at times reads more like L. D. novel than Miller's own. Yet, at the same time he manages to wrap himself in the beauty he encounters, dive in it without holding a breath and resourface a new, more complete being, spellbound by his experience. If only there were more writers like him -- ahh, wishful thinking. Most of all, this book shows Miller in a different light, not limited by his fame for writing about sex (actually, most of his books are not) he explores a new land, unknown to him until then. His ability to take the reader's hand and walk throughout the countryside, observe the people, customs and scenery, is combined with philosophy and his personal views (What else would you expect from Miller?). I have shared this book with many people who did not like Miller and their minds were changed forever. What more can be said? Nothing -- read the book and find out for yourself."},{"Title":"The Colossus of Maroussi","review":"I highly recommend this book to everyone. The book was written and finished on the eve of WWII. And the \\"Colossus of Maroussi\\" is by far the most enjoyable book I have ever read by Henry Miller. It is not too often that one can pick up a book and read over and over again as I have done with \\"Colossus Of Maroussi.\\" Miller wrote this most beautiful of all books after having left France, and having finished his more notable \\"Tropic,\\" books. My wife, who was my girlfriend at the time, introduced me to the book. Up to this time I was very well read. Having read all the classics, fiction, and non-fiction alike. Dostoevsky was my favorite, and I have read many books that have stayed with me all my life: Balzac, Gogal, Rabelais, Montaigne, Dante, Chaucer, Milton, Cervantes, Joyce, etc. Everyone that is but Henry Miller.Thankfully my future wife was a Henry Miller fan, because this book moved me like few books have ever moved me before or since. Miller's vision of what he encounters in Greece will captivate you---the reader. I am writing this review because when I encounter people who are well-read, most have never heard of this wonderful gem of a novel. I really dislike the word \\"travel-novel\\" that is attached to this book, because it is more than that. It is an introspective book that captures Henry Miller at his best. I am pleased that I did not read Henry Miller's other book's before I read this novel: I may not have appreciated Miller's writing as much as I do today. Having read many of Henry Miller's books since first turning the pages of this greatly overlooked \\"Masterpiece,\\" [Yes, to me the book is a masterpiece of writing] I highly recommend the book.I find this book one of the better ones of Henry Miller that I have read: Especially considering it was written by an American on Greece. [American Savage: As Miller refers to himself]. It's kind of funny to think about this now, however, after I first read this book, I actually wanted to go to Greece and experience the same sort of journey that Henry Miller experienced. Even going so far as to retracing his footsteps in his journey. Well, I was much younger then. However, I do believe that you will enjoy this novel, as Miller does not write in any way, shape, or form like his Tropic novels. Miller's writing has a way of almost making you experience life in Greece. Therefore, I recommend the book highly, for you will not be disappointed. [Stars: 5+]"},{"Title":"The Colossus of Maroussi","review":"This book is not perfect. I don't even agree with some of Miller's overly romantic view of the ancient past. But, some of the sections are so beautiful that they'll make you weep with joy. This book is like any other transforming experiences in life. They're not faultless. They have peaks and valleys. But the emotions they impart are real, profound, and timeless."},{"Title":"The Colossus of Maroussi","review":"This is a beautifully written book. A real poem in prose. I do not agree with his psychological antipathy with his fellow Americans. However, everything he writes about Greece and Greeks makes me very proud of my heritage and sooths my soul. I find that even today life in the islands and the non touristic inland is as simple, beautiful and moving as Miller describes it. Nothing changed in the friendlines and hospitality, the legendery &quot;philoxenia&quot;, of Greeks. I still feel the same peace and wonder that Miller describes over a sunset by a shore, and the same life altering experience by resting at ancient ruins. It is a book of love about Greece. A book that could not be written by a Greek, as it would be considered too presumptuous.I am grateful he wrote it. It is a pleasure to read. This is a gift that I choose to offer to my friends."},{"Title":"The Colossus of Maroussi","review":"Henry Miller is the &quot;forgotten&quot; genius of American literature, probably because of his political views and his attacks on the &quot;perfect&quot; protestant society. I admire him deeply so as a Greek (Hellenas) I was flattered to read such an inspired account on the idea and nation that is Greece. During his trip to my homeland, amongst the olive trees and the Mediterranean (sheer magic in her own right!), and with the company of a truly gigantic character he unravels the magic that is Greece and in essence enlightens us to the fact that the magic is still there and will be forever. A beautifully written book by a great American writer.I think it was Goethe that said that &quot;..from all the different cultures Greeks dreamed the dream of life the best&quot;"},{"Title":"The Colossus of Maroussi","review":"henry miller's beautifully written account of his long vacation to greece just before the breakout of world war II. to call it a traveloge is to really miss the point. this trip is a metamorphosis for mr miller. after leaving new york and living for an extended period of time in paris, he sees and experiences things in greece that he has never done before. the poverty and history of the greek people turn him further away from his american heritage and make him reject modern europe.having read both of the \\"tropic\\" books, this one was startling in its overt contempt for america. at the same time miller's description of wall street and baseball at the polo grounds as told to his greek friends is inspiring. the vacation ends with his visa being pulled because of the pending war forcing him to return to america.although the war is not often mentioned, and once literally forgotten, it seems to be a significant influence. it is miller's second war to end all wars. miller's feelings about the future of mankind are bleak. the influence of modern civilization has resulted in two world wars and potential distruction of man. greek history, however, has influenced the world positively. it is what we should be today.although i enjoyed this book, it is not as good as \\"capricorn\\" but better than \\"cancer\\". Miller's eloquent discription of the sights and feelings of greece will wet your appetite. it is also fun to visit the locations on the web as miller visits them in person.miller is always worth the read and \\"colossus\\" is no exception."},{"Title":"The Colossus of Maroussi","review":"Henry Miller paints a wonderfully enticing portrait of Greece in this well-written account of his travels there in the 1930's and 40's. I liked this book so much that it inspired a trip to Greece, to visit some of the ancient historical sites. While visiting such places as Mycenae and Delphi, it was enjoyable to re-read his own impressions of them.The book is full of colorful observations, and is written in a far more traditional and accessible style than Miller's &quot;Tropic&quot; books. I only have a couple of quibbles about this very fine book. First, the title character of the book, a Greek friend of Miller's, is never developed in a way that justifies the appellation &quot;Colossus.&quot; Second, I think Miller sometimes strains a bit to lend a literary effect to rather commonplace things or experiences."},{"Title":"The Colossus of Maroussi","review":"it was short. it talked about greece from a personal viewpoint. henry miller talked about the rainy weather way too much. not bad but did not draw me in."},{"Title":"The Colossus of Maroussi","review":"Henry Miller takes us to quite an unusual experience and perception of Greece with the power of his words in this comparatively unknown book. This is no trivial travelogue, but it was a great pleasure to delve into his experience as if it was his reader's own!"},{"Title":"The Colossus of Maroussi","review":"If you are a Henry Miller fan \\"Colussus\\" is worth reading ... However, I wouldn't consider it one of his best works. At times it seems artificial and strained in its attempt.Henry went to Greece just before WWII broke out after spending almost ten years in Paris. He visits some of the great sites of ancient Greek civilization but generally does not seem to give an evocative picture of what these sites represent. One feels that some stronger connection to the great achievements of this civilisation is lacking and Henry admits that he never read a line of Homer and his knowledge of Greek history is almost null. Thus, his discriptions of the grecian landscape and the archeological sites seem merely to be flashy literary effects and imaginative exaggerations. What makes the book worthwhile are his descriptions of the friendly and ready to please Greek peasants, the boring and annoying American and English tourists, and the simple and proud Greek-Americans (who annoyed the hell out of him). Big-city Henry shunned the materialistic world and worshipped that which the tourists and Greek-Americans from Chicago deplored. He prefers dirt, dust, chaos, donkeys and honest poverty to the sick, fat, spoiled excesses of Paris and New York. His additude echos Socrates' remark upon viewing goods spread out in the market that such a display only makes clear to him what little he needs. Henry was always rather poor and proud of it. His avoidance of the boring American tourist, the so-called \\"ugly American,\\" is something fellow expatriots can relate to...he felt closest to the honest Greek peasant, which probably was in part a reaction to his years living in busy Paris. As an American in Greece he was treated almost as a demi-god. At that time America was a different country, still more or less pure in its foreign policy and true to its founding principles. America at that time was a hero to these Europeans, even with its greatest heroic role yet to come in the liberation of Europe.This book is classified as a travel book. The only \\"travel book\\" thing about it is that Henry travels in it. If I were planning a trip to Greece I'd rather read \\"Lonely Planet\\" or \\"Let's Go,\\" along with a great book on Greek cultural history such as the \\"Oxford History of Greece and the Hellenistic World,\\" \\"The Histories\\" by Herodotus, or Egon Friedell's fantastic \\"Kulturgeschichte Griechenlands.\\""},{"Title":"The Colossus of Maroussi","review":"This is a classic, no doubt. But it is beginning to sound dated... I know Greece well, and share Miller's enthusiasm for the place. Yet I have a hard time relating to his particular brand of enthusiasm. The writing is brilliant, of course. Happy to have read it (finally!), but I guess I'm confused..."},{"Title":"The Colossus of Maroussi","review":"I first read this bookin the mid-seventies when I was in my early twenties. I recently re-discovered it as a niece was going to Greece to study and wanted some backround about the culture and character of the Greek people. Reading a book some twenty years later and particularly and author like Henry Miller can tell you something about the author and the reader and how perceptions change in twenty years. Miller's crystal clear renderings of the ambience and character of the Greek landscape and the Greek character are timeless treasures to be soaked up as in the brilliance of the Greek light by anyone that loves art. Although I would not define the book as a classic work of literature (there are too many first person accounts that wax and wane depending on the mood of the author, I would say that it has some characteristics of classic art in it's timeless appeal as well as it's changing meaning to a changing reader. We can look at at great work of art, say at age 21 and it means one thing. then we can look at the same work 25 years later and it will mean something totally different, yet have more depth in some areas and less meaning in others. This is what I found in reading The Colossus of Maroussi. If you want to be transported to the timelessnes of the power and potency of the Greek mind and heart, read thhis book."},{"Title":"The Colossus of Maroussi","review":"In my youth, Henry Miller was IT. He's a writer's writer, and his prose is surpassed only by Graham Greene, in the English language. That's something no one can take away. However, as I matured, I found that Henry Miller did not. He is in some sense the quintessential New York writer - a complainer. Quite harsh on people. At this point I consider him something of a tragic figure, who wasted enormous talent. If you look about, he is ignored in the literary world today, which is a sad legacy."},{"Title":"The Colossus of Maroussi","review":"I read \\"The Colossus\\" in trains, gazing at the beautiful scenary northeast of Paris. Miller's visual descriptions are excellent, and if you're into actionless descriptions then I recommend reading the book solely based on that account. Otherwise, I can't recommend it. I find the imagery and emotional experiences completely overblown, and I can't relate to them. I should state at the outset that I can't stand Transcendentalism. It seems Miller looks at Greece and sees exactly what he wants to see. The book consists principally of expounding his ideology, using Greece as a backdrop. Looking at and reveling in nature and one's self doesn't always lead to the same path of enlightenment he describes -- I'm sure it could lead a lot of people down the opposite path (think Lord of Flies...or the people in Dogville (a film by Trier)).For all his preaching of how ignorant working people who enjoy nature are great, he strikes me as a complete hypocrite because this book is all about him not doing anything (and getting free money from friends...like thoreau) and being just as intellectual as the intellectuals when it comes to talking about literary works or what have you. He preaches about how bad technology and the news are and insults everyone when they do nothing about the massacre in Smyrna -- but he doesn't read the news, in fact tries to avoid it, and thus not only does he not know when massacres occur, but he is therefore completely incapable of doing anything about them -- not as if he deigns to tell us what everyone else should do, just that they're all wrong to not do anything. His idealism is completely untempered by reality and the facts of his life and what he does with it. He strikes me as uncompromisingly arrogant and judgemental, but without any obvious warrant of being able to make these statements from a superior moral point of view. His point of view seems to me to shut out all other ways of arriving at the truth -- a truth he knows and is sure of, which he knows because of his emotions, and no arguing with your emotions. He disses religion but I can't put my faith in someone who's too critical of everything else (and doesn't adequately explain his criticisms) and believes that he's found the correct path. As for the massive racial and cultural generalizations...I've never been to Greece, at any point in time. But I can't buy them. They're way too overarching."},{"Title":"The Colossus of Maroussi","review":"I forced myself to read through 75 pages of Henry Miller's insufferable ramblings before giving up on this book. Where do I start? How about with structure: the norm, not the exception, is stream-of-consciousness paragraphs that go on for pages. Also, he evidently thinks it is better to use 5 words when only 2 would do. In addition, he writes with the misguided notion that he can impress his readers with his usage of fancy terms, the more syllables the better. (terms such as \\"peripatetic\\" and \\"pullulating\\" are the norm) The content is not much better. Miller obviously fancies himself one of the smartest people alive, and gives free rein to his impulse to share all of his genius philosophical observations and witty aphorisms. They just wither on the page, unable to withstand his smug preening self-satisfaction and hyperbolic prose. He romanticizes Greece to an unbelievable extent. The writing is incredibly overblown and flowery; it actually made me cringe. One example is enough to illustrate all the above: \\"All Greece is diademed with such antinomian spots; it is perhaps the explanation for the fact that Greece has emancipated itself as a country, a nation, a people, in order to continue as the luminous carrefour of a changing humanity.\\" UGH!!!"},{"Title":"The Colossus of Maroussi","review":"Henry Miller's books fall into many categories, the lover of humanity, the lover of nature and art, the hater of the treadmill of twentieth-century society and business, and the sexual fiend. This book touches mainly on the first two, some on the third, and none on the fourth. To me, that is Miller at his best, the lyrical wordsmith.Instead of talking of France (as in several books), or California (as in Big Sur), or the various parts of the US (as in Air-Conditioned Nightmare), here Miller tells of his trip to Greece immediately before World War II spread there. He loved Greece and the Greeks he met. His desriptions are full of color and life."},{"Title":"The Colossus of Maroussi","review":"This may be the greatest travel book ever written about Greece because it is so unpretentious and has none of the romantic tripe that one gets with a lot Philhellenism. It is also wonderful as a narrative of peace before the gathering storm of WWII that would consume most of Europe, including Greece. More than anything, however, it is perhaps the finest writing that Henry Miller ever did because it is simply him traveling around Greece, feeling damn glad to be there, enjoying the frienship of Durrell and Katzimbalis, and taking pleasure in the wine, the sea, and the warmth of the Greek people. If you like this book, try Patrick Leigh Fermor's &quot;Mani&quot; and &quot;Roumeli.&quot; He's a bit more scholarly than Miller, but he too taps in to the same essence as Miller and refuses to get sappy about &quot;the glory that was Greece.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Colossus of Maroussi","review":"This book is quite simply one of the best travelogues ever written. Never has a writer described a place so vividly and in a so unapologetically personal manner. His impressions are filled with wonder and light, much in the way the mountains and seas of Greece are.Miller's love inspired me to go to Greece and to write about it myself. My own stories are a poor shadow of Miller's greatness, of course. His barbarous prose spills off the page, oozing passion and joy. Although Miller's Tropic of Cancer may be the better 'novel' - The Colossus of Maroussi will find a more special place in your heart."},{"Title":"The Colossus of Maroussi","review":"I want to encourage any fan of Miller that this is a worthy read. I have read at least half a dozen other Miller novels and would rank this one with the best of them. Infinitely better than Air-Conditioned Nightmare and Big Sur, rich in ideas and beautifully truthful insights, penned with the expertise of the seasoned and worldly Miller. Well worth your time."},{"Title":"The Colossus of Maroussi","review":"Some critics call \\"The Colossus of Maroussi\\"--Henry Miller\`s account of his trip to Greece on the eve of World War II--the greatest travel book ever. But, like all great travel books, it's much more than mere depiction of beautiful landscapes, missed connections, bad weather, and surly waiters--though Miller recounts those as well. Rather, the book stands as a compelling paean to the Greek spirit, to liberty, and to life--as well as a barbaric yawp prefiguring the coming cataclysm.The Canadian critic Northrop Frye once said that the \\"story of the loss and regaining of identity...is the framework of all literature.\\" That certainly applies well to travel literature, where the journey often occurs within the narrator as well as over the Earth, and in particular to The Colossus of Maroussi. At its core lies Miller's spiritual transformation through welcomed encounters with warm-hearted, generous, high-spirited Greeks, particularly the \\"colossus\\" Katsimbalis.\\"I love these men, each and every one,\\" writes Miller, \\"for having revealed to me the true proportions of the human being...the goodness, the integrity, the charity which they emanated. They brought me face to face with myself, they cleansed me of hatred and jealousy and envy.\\"Like most of Miller's writing, from the joyous novel \\"Tropic of Cancer\\" to his trenchant essays, this book succeeds thanks to his freewheeling iconoclasm, his divine madness, and his inimitable language:\\"...Out of the corner of my eye I caught the full devastating beauty of the great plain of Thebes which we were approaching and, unable to control myself, I burst into tears. Why had no one prepared me for this? I cried out...We were amidst the low mounds and hummocks which had been stunned motionless by the swift messengers of light. We were in the dead center of that soft silence which absorbs even the breathing of gods...Through the thick pores of the earth the dreams of men long dead still bubbled and burst, their diaphanous filament carried skyward by flocks of startled birds.\\"Here, as always, we see Miller as primitive shaman, awed and humbled by nature and humanity, disdainful of modernity and materialism: \\"Mechanical devices have nothing to do with man's real nature--they are merely traps which Death has baited for him.\\"He underscores this view of us, as animals caught in a steel maze of our own making, by his frequent metaphoric mixing of nature's fecundity and manmade tawdriness, as when he describes the approach to Delphi:\\"This is an invisible corridor of time, a vast, breathless parenthesis which swells like the uterus and having bowelled forth its anguish relapses like a run-down clock.\\"No, this is not your grandmother's travel writing, with its propriety, politeness, and \\"realistic\\" depictions, but word-pictures of an emotional landscape. That's the essence Miller strives to show: his subjective, experiential, inner reality. The subject here is Henry Miller, and what matters most is how these objects--the world--affect him.As a result, this 1941 literary bombshell, ostensibly about Greece, documents Miller's memories of New York inspired by a view of Athens, provides a lengthy disquisition on jazz when he's confronted by a French woman who disdains the chaos of Greece, and paints a disquieting, mad, and ominous picture of Saturn when he climbs to an observatory and views it through a telescope. He tells us his dreams and daydreams and what he wished he would have said. Everything is fair game; the seeming digressions frequent and fabulous.This is still nonfiction, but Miller's imaginative life at the time of his travels is real, and thus an important part of his narrative. In the end it all hangs together like a sumptuous tapestry woven by an inspired madman--which perhaps it is. We come away understanding more about the taste of Greek water, the quality of Greek light, and the magnificence of the Greek spirit than from reading all the objective reporting on Greece in the Library of Congress. He captures it all as it arrests him.Traveling at times with Katsimbalis, the poet Seferiades, and/or Lawrence Durrell, Miller moves from Athens and Corfu to Knossus and Delphi as if in search of dead Greek gods--and finds them reincarnate.We are lucky enough to travel with him, enduring treacherous seas, precipitous mountain passes, and heroic debauches, as well as feasting on the simple food, viewing the sublime beauty, and feeling the brotherhood and humanity that come to Miller like beneficent Peloponnesian sun wherever he turns. It is a trip I will make over and over again."},{"Title":"The Colossus of Maroussi","review":"What a writer Miller is in this book. It is an autobiographical account of a trip he took to Greece in the late thirties. He had been living in Paris for a couple of years, and makes a lot of denigrating remarks about the rational, limited French in comparison to the adventurous open- minded Greeks. Miller is opinionated, often wrong- headed, narrowly and stupidly anti- American, mistaken completely in his analysis of the poltiical conditions of the world in his time, egoistically lost in his own way of seeing things. But he is also linguistically brilliant, visionary, inspiring and tremendously alive. His accounts of the characters he meets including the Durrells, Seferis and above all the major figure the storyteller, Katzambis are electifying . His love of and appreciation of the Greek landscape and civilization are strong and convincing. At times the feelings he presents seem to be close to being religious visions.So despite all the carping and the ranting, the slights and mistaken judgments the book thrills by its beauty of language and its celebration of life."},{"Title":"The Colossus of Maroussi","review":"I have read many of Miller's books and though I understand that people do have different tastes, I like him so much that it's almost impossible to believe that someone may actually not like him.Having said this my impression on this book may be suspicious but it's my favorite Miller book. If usually the occasional sex scenes and hard language distract you form evaluating Miller's writing qualities, you have here a great opportunity.Excellent descriptions (of inner moods and outer landscapes), passionate tone and people oriented. Also a good option for someone who likes travel diaries and an excellent chance to meet Miller's essence: a wanderer.On this one there's only two options either you find it a drag (and don't even finish it) or you love it. This means that whether you like it or not, it's a good book!"},{"Title":"The Colossus of Maroussi","review":"I enjoyed much of his book for it's incredible descriptions of the landscape and atmosphere that Miller revels in on his trip to Greece just before the War. He is a master of describing exotic settings and the feelings they arouse in him. I also had a bit of a struggle at times when he digresses on his personal philosophy and seems to conclude that traveling free and experiencing a new and foreign culture is far superior than the lifestyle of western developed countries. A bit hypocritical since he attacks the systems that probably made his diversionary trip to Greece possible in the first place. In my opinion he goes down this track a few too many times and it really had me wishing he would drop the polemic and get back to the story on several occasions. That's why I can only give this 3 stars.There is one section while he is in Crete in particular where he goes down some bizarre train of thought linking Agemenon with Louis Armstrong and Duke Ellington that had me scratching my head. Poetic license - maybe but it failed to move me."},{"Title":"The Colossus of Maroussi","review":"I don't think anyone, but Miller, could have painted the splendor of the poverty, beauty and surrealness during 1930's Greece; Miller's Greece and his alone. He saw things like no other person saw them; {\\"A Greek is alive to the finger-tips; he oozes vitality, he's effervescent, he's ubiquitous in spirit\\"} to us it's a blade of grass or a branch or a rock, to him it was a testimonial to the times of the people of Greece, and I have never wanted to go anywhere in the world than to Miller's Greece, after reading this journey of cleansing, healing and metaphysical bliss. This is indeed an Epic adventure. An epic indeed: an endless surprise of wonderous expeditions, dangers, wine and friends in a style that is all Miller.I was 14 when I found this book in my 94 year old grandmothers bookcase in the back den. The intriguing cover pulled me in, and I opened it to a random page, and to this day, nearly 15 years later or so, I come back to it again and again, for guidance, for awakening, for a smile. It is the one book I bring with me on long flights, and the one book I have shared with friends more than any other. It is not so much a view of the places and people of Greece, but more a testimonial to an era, and Miller sure shows he is more Greek than American. This book isn't just about Greece and its magnificent towns, it's about seeing things like no other sees them, and then throwing it up again for us to read and indulge in. The passage:['No man can really say what joy is until he has experienced peace. And without joy there is no life, even if you have a dozen cars, six butlers, a castle, a private chapel, and a bomb-proof vault. Our diseases are our attachments, be they habits, ideologies, ideals, principles, possessions, phobias, gods, cults, relegions, what you please. Good wages can be a disease just as much as bad wages. Leisure can be just as great a disease as work...surrenderis absolute: if you cling to even the tiniest crumb you nourish the germ which will devour you. As for clinging to God, God long ago abandoned us in order that me might realize the joy of attaining godhood through our own efforts.']Delecious eh? I remember not being able to sleep that night; being so young, but wanting to understand so much.The Great Starfish is someone in whom I would have loved to have romped with on the island of Poros. For if I ever go to Greece, if I ever attain this nirvana in which the Buddhist speak of, that in which Miller speaks of when entering Poros for the first time-{\\"...when suddenly I realized that we were sailing through the streets. If there is one dream which I like above all others it is that of sailing on land. Coming into Poros gives the illusion of the deep dream.\\"} I hope it is, even nearly 80 years later, somewhat the same. I want to smell the lemon groves. I want to sail on the streets coming into Poros. I want to feel like that gentle idiot swaying on the mast, like he says, as if I am 'en route for a shave'. I want to see the bearded men, and ladies hanging their wash out right above my head. I want to sit and have Turkish Coffee with the natives on Hydra and be led around as If I was a spectacle from a native world.Lawrence Durrell, George Seferiades and Katsimbalis and Miller all indulging in abundant foods, endless wine, and conversation in which I would have loved to have partaken in, must have been intoxicating, rewarding, and full of gusto and history, that I envy. At college I had an advanced fiction class with Stratis Havarias, the founding editor of the Harvard Review, who's father was killed in the concentration camps, and who teaches writing in Greece in the winter, when not doing his only course in summers at the college. He told me he knew George well and had been friends with relatives of Ghika the painter. When he asked the class what their favorite book was, and I told him Colossus, he just beemed, \\"OHHHHHhhhhh.\\" He said, \\"Miller's Greece can be yours Ken, if you want it to be. If one thing hasn't changed for your image of Greece once you get there, it's the light. Piercing, unfathomable.\\"On the last page of my grandmothers copy, which is now part of my collection of novels, because this is most certainly a non-fiction epic, she says, \\"It's so mystical here, the light, oh my, oh...oh...the light, it's like nothing I have seen anywhrere in my travels. The light is pouring in everywhere, on everything on every surface, and making it all come alive.\\"{\\"Light acquires a transcendental quality: it is not the light of the Mediterranean alone, it is something more, something unfathomable, something holy.\\"} *cool, eh*Miller's light, my grandmothers light, that epic beauty that has made the Colossus my favorite book of all time. I would have liked to have been Miller's friend, yes, I would have liked that very much.I implore you, lover of books, to read this and take some of the passages and prose with you for eternity, it is that type of writing that sets Miller apart from all the rest.Thank you.ken"},{"Title":"The Colossus of Maroussi","review":"I just finished reading Colossus of Maroussi and it was nothing short of brilliant. Words like imaginative, inspiring, pellucid imagery of the heart and soul of the writer himself and the people of Greece, might not do this book justice. This one will no doubt warm and assure those with sound spirit, and to other's say the British tourists or America loving New Yorkers, might not appreciate Miller's views on the English he encounterd while in Greece and the New York he left behind and renounced much earlier. This book, I feel has a place for anyone with the experience and intellegence to know the difference between consumer contention and capitalist foolish pride, and the spirit of man humble and in no way distracted by superficial desires for status. Stripping himself to the bone and exposing himself for the benefit of all mankind. What really impressed me about this book was Miller's interperatation of nature, that is of mankind and the world in which it co-exists, and how he had achieved to embrace and fulfill it. He had no doubt arrived at the other shore and found himself, his true unfettered self, in Greece. Bringing together vision and action, Miller deserve's recognition and praise. I will continue to read more of Miller's books and would definately encourage you all to read this one."},{"Title":"The Colossus of Maroussi","review":"On the recommendation of his friend and fellow author Lawrence Durrell, Henry Miller set out for Greece in 1939. After a decade of frenzied writing in which both \\"Tropic of Cancer \\"and \\"Tropic of Capricorn\\" were composed, Miller's intention was really nothing more than to relax in preparation for a journey to Tibet in which he planned to, in a popular phrase Miller himself would have despised, \\"find himself.\\"\\"Colossus of Maroussi\\" is pure prosopography, which isn't of course to say that he does not give flashing insight into the individual lives of others. In fact, the colossus of the title - a Greek poet by the name of George Katsimbalis - has a personality which sometimes threatens to marginalize Miller's. We also meet as a minor character the poet George Seferis long before he became the first Greek to win the Nobel Prize for Literature.At one point, while Durrell and Miller are staring up into space, Durrell calls him a Rosicrucian. This is no lie. Not only does Miller have a preternatural affinity for the mystical and transcendent, but the various meditative bits of philosophy and courageously inventive speculative prose that dot the book are beautifully conceived, written in a kind of ecstatic encounter with the holy. Speaking of Rosicrucians...\\"Saturn is the symbol of all omens and superstitions, the phony proof of divine entropy, phony because if it were true that the universe is running down Saturn would have melted away long ago. Saturn is as eternal as fear and irresolution, growing more milky, more cloudy, with each compromise, each capitulation. Timid souls cry for Saturn just as children are reputed to cry for Castoria. Saturn gives us only what we ask for, never an ounce extra. Saturn is the white hope of the white race which prattles endlessly about the wonders of nature and spends its time killing off the greatest wonder of all - MAN.\\"To call this a travelogue is to tremendously devalue it. While its subject of the putative love of Greece and the Greek people, Miller's approach is more reminiscent of Julian of Norwich's \\"Revelations of Divine Love\\" or Thomas Merton's \\"Seven Storey Mountain.\\" For him, Greece was a religious experience, and all the more precious because it was purely accidental. Miller was a mortal Antaeus whose powers seem like they would have been irrevocably sapped when he was finally compelled to bring himself back to the United States, something he only did because he saw the writing that Hitler was scrawling on the European political wall."},{"Title":"The Colossus of Maroussi","review":"This very well can be described as Miller's ode to the earth and mankind... the men and women who have occupied the island of Greece and the surrounding Greek islands since creation. It is a metaphorically beautiful work which stokes passion in the mind and heart of the reader and can be quite exhillarating in its degree of adventure. Writing an essay or critique about the phenomenal nature of this work could not even possibly do it justice. Read for yourself and allow its magic to mesmerize you and build upon your insight to your relationship to fellow man and the joy of being alive!"},{"Title":"The Colossus of Maroussi","review":"Having just returned from Greece this summer, I made it a point to finally order this and give it a read, as dated as it might have been. I can honestly say I was not disappointed, and 'Colossus' stands as one of Miller's best literary works.For the most part, the truth of the writing belies its age--the Greeks still know 'how to wear their rags' with a pride and a spirit that even the most jaded cynic could not ignore.Unfortunately, the Greece Miller experienced and writes about here does not exist. The external trappings and narcissism of Americans of the time has since transferred over to the youth of Greece with a passion. If you look hard, you can still find traces of 'Colossus' in the old country, but it's getting progressively harder each year.If you read this before you take the journey, you'll see what I mean."},{"Title":"The Colossus of Maroussi","review":"I did not enjoy this book (New Directions Paperback 2010 Ed.) I stopped reading after part two of three, at page 154 and hence did not read 155-210; but I did read both the Introduction and the Afterword. They suggested that the omitted pages consisted of more of the same. It was a cost-benefit analysis; too much effort for too little insight.One big problem is Miller's serious nonchalance about the imminent WWII and about which side will win it. He seriously underestimated Hitler's evil and destructive potential, calling him a \\"puny monster\\", at 73. He got no points with that attitude from me.He is very grossly overly opinionated with hatred of the French (unlike the Greeks the French lack passion, in his opinion, at 7), the English (he hopes they read the negative things he writes about them and hate him much as he hates them!), and even his fellow Americans (materialism, unemployment and tourism at 7-12). But he too is an American tourist so don't wait for consistency or logic in this book. He LOVES the Greeks, most of the time. He reaches his over-generalizations based on anecdotal evidence without apparently being self-conscious while doing so. E.g., the first Greek he met on the ocean passage was friendly so he knew all Greeks were. But he was worried by his prejudice that he would be cheated by his Greek taxi driver/guide.Miller was age 48, according to the Library of Congress information printed in my edition, in the summer of 1939. Thus he was not a foolish recent grad doing his thing; villagers referred to him as The Old Man at 38. At his age, he should have known better.He had some good ideas: That peace is more than the absence of war, but rather is inner peace 68, and that surrender is necessary for such peace 67-70. This is a key element in the first step of all the twelve step programs; but it gets lost in the hyperbolic invective.Social scientists, when they design surveys, usually include five possible answers to survey questions such as: strongly agree, agree, do not have a view, disagree, and strongly disagree. When they tabulate the results, they add groups one and two and compare that total with the sum of the fours and fives. They do this because they have come to realize that some folks will like or dislike, while others only love or hate. Miller is definitely a one and five man, with mega use of both positive and negative superlatives, and I find common use of superlatives distasteful. (Notice: I did not say I hate them.) So I do not go for Miller's style. Let's just say he's not my type. Also, with so much negativity, he sounds like he is angry at most everything, except his friends and some Greeks. Apparently he had previously written several of the books that later made him famous, but their publication had been blocked, at least in the US, by their then racy content; maybe that is what made him so angry.He drops names profusely; predominantly various writers and artists who were popular in his day such as the winner of the 1920 Nobel for literature, Knut Hamsun, and painters such as Hans Reichel, who have been forgotten, except by Wikipedia. In fact all the people I checked, a lot of them: Betty (Rye) (American artist) who inspired his trip, Ghika (painter), Seferiades (poet), George Katsimbalis and Durrell. They can all be looked up and are real, though why anyone but an obsessive-compulsive would want to bother to look them up is another question. One of them, Laureate St. John Perse, mentioned twice, (pseudonym of Alexis Leger who won the Nobel for literature in 1960) was familiar to me; not through his writings but because I visited a museum dedicated to him in Pointe-a-Pitre, Guadeloupe, Perse's birthplace. Miller's reference to him did not evoke any desire to learn more about or read his work. Likewise, the 1939 Hollywood film about Napoleon III's emperor of Mexico with Betty Davis, the Turkish atrocity at Smyrna, which is also called Ismir (which I learned after the reading this book involved the Turks killing Christian Greeks, not in Greece, but a port city at the eastern end of the Gulf of Smyrna in Asia Minor and), Krishnamurti, etc. All are real.He wrote: \\"My first Greek word was nero, water.\\" Really? Not \\"please\\", \\"thank you\\", \\"excuse me\\", \\"hello\\" or \\"goodbye\\"? Why not? Can this possibly be a truthful statement? If so, he must have been considered quite rude. He is also way too full of himself and recognizes this. I laughed while reading, at 27, Miller describing Katsimbalis:\\"He talked about himself because he himself was the most interesting person he knew. I liked that quality very much - I have a little of it myself.\\" (A little??). Piraeus is SW of Athens and Amarousian is NW of it. It is while listening to one of Katsimbalis' \\"monologues\\" at Amarousian that Miller describes the speaker as a colossus. The region is now that suburb where the main stadium of the recent Greek Olympics is now located. And later Miller describes Katsimbalis' monologues as not beginning at a logical point, and with digressions and no sense of time 70. In one of the two essays that suround the book it says that in describing Katsimbalis, Miller was speaking about himself - the great monologist - in his own opinion. I prefer writers who perfect the art of storytelling, rather than those who prove their alleged brilliance by making their readers work so hard. Indeed, I found the Introduction and Afterword essential to what little understanding of the book I was able to glean. I read many passages of the book several times without any idea about what Miller was trying to say, other than that he had a very strong positive or negative reaction to the subject, whatever it was.Miller arrived at Athens by the road from that city's port: Piraeus, after arriving by sea. I departed Greece by ship via Pireaus and can't imagine why he did not describe the majestic view from his boat of the Parthenon, golden in the sunlight, towering over the valleys and lesser hills of Athens. It is so prominently visible from the sea. It is my most memorable image of Greece.He writes: \\"Thus Homer lives on. Though I've never read a line of Homer, I believe the Greek of today is essentially unchanged.\\" 14 Why had Miller refused to read Homer? And why admit and indeed brag of it? And later he describes the ancient Greeks as \\"murderers\\" 20, but today's Greeks, who he loves, as quite different. And his most overused nouns are variations on death, murder, dying, killing, butchery ,massacre and dead; and for variety: mad, insane, crazy, deranged etc. And this all in his beloved Greece.Long paragraphs, very long, full of long words. Emotionally pyrotechnic, but what are they saying? Example the paragraph at 20-21: He was climbing from the beach to an altitude: The place he was at was a \\"carrefour\\" (at both beginning and end of paragraph) being a crossroads or plaza. But he called it a \\"deathtrap,\\" weaves in meditations by Pythagoras (on what?), uses \\"antinomian\\" meaning freed from religious and legal restraints, refers to \\"swastika maneuvering\\" to \\"debouch.\\" And what does it all mean? I have seven years of formal education after High school and can't figure it out. And why engage in such paroxysms of verbal display with so much effort required by his readers, with dictionary at hand, to attempt, and fail, to derive his intended meaning. Reading this was not a pleasant experience for me.All of the foregoing caused me to also conclude that Miller is not a reliable story teller; that I can't believe in the truth or accuracy what I think he is trying to say. So this is not a travelogue or at least not an accurate one. Even so, a map would have helped, or photos.He has these big riffs:-on the sea at sunset 61 (I admit, as a sailor, that I liked the sea passage episodes);-on the Rue du Fauberg, Montmartre -- leading to trench warfare in WWI (was he a veteran or correspondent?) 62;-on being on the border between Epidaurus, a place of healing, and Mycenae, a place of war 73-77;-on viewing Saturn through a telescope 90-93 with a crazy sentence at 92 and \\"Rosicrucian\\";-on Greek curiosity about the great black jazz men 94-95; and much later on buying a postcard from a Francophile woman in which he interjects a long bit about American Black jazz greats as sons of Agamemnon, with asides complaining about the idea of nostalgia specifically and civilization in general with a lot of over-my-head allusions;-on the beauty of Greek women in general and one specific water carrying girl (closest approach to eroticism) 94-98;-on pretending to be a stock market tycoon and then a major league baseball player 128-32.Everyone who Miller met was larger than life. They were all, as he drew them, superlatively interesting. This strikes me as false. Lengthy strings of words separated by commas is perhaps the most prominent feature of his writing style."},{"Title":"The Colossus of Maroussi","review":"Henry Miller's words about Greece are descriptive and often poetic.

I didn't expect too much as I don't care for Miller's fiction, but here he writes elegantly and perceptively about Greece. He captures the spirit of the Greek people wonderfully, a bit like Zorba the Greek does in fiction. Although it's been around for ages, it hasn't dated that much and I'd put it alongside Lawrence Durrell's books as among the best descriptions of Greece you'll find."},{"Title":"The Colossus of Maroussi","review":"Henry Miller has long been considered one of the important early voices in the Beat movement, and among free thinkers who evolved into the 1960s reappraisal of social values worldwide. But this interesting tour of Greece in 1941, at the beginning of WWII, has rarely been read as a take on the landscape of 20th-century politics and Miller's own reaction to violence and a deterioration of human values as the world moved toward its encounter with fascism. The islands are marvelous; his friendships unique and open; and his sense of the world, his anti-Christian critiques, and his call for a new kind of spiritualism among humans, are refreshing reminders of what the world was about to discover for itself. But the War plays a role here too, and his almost desperate desire for a new freedom in the face of possible total destruction rings with authenticity and passion. You don't have to be traveling the islands or touring the Mediterranean to appreciate this book, although it remains true in its scope today if you are there experiencing the changes of the last sixty years."},{"Title":"The Colossus of Maroussi","review":"Henry Miller's classic is timeless and a wonderful read for anyone.

But pleasantly so. It opens in London's Trafalgar Square, which lives in my memory as the place to go on Christmas Eve. There would be a huge Christmas tree, sent over from Norway, I believe, all decorated and lit up, and hundreds of people singing Christmas carols. There's no Christmas tree in Trafalgar Square in the opening of this book. There is a body instead. It is discovered by Oliver Swithin, who has hay-colored hair that is straight and floppy. teeth that are too prominent, docile blue eyes behind wire-framed spectacles. He is wearing a tuxedo that has seen better days. Not a macho hero, one deduces almost immediately. Sir Hargreaves (Harry) Random was &quot;floating face-down in a Trafalgar Square Fountain....with a look of mild irritation on his face, mortified in all senses of the word.&quot; Listen to this. Far above ... the rising sun was gilding the pigeon guano on Nelson's hat.&quot; (For the unknowing, Nelson's column is one of the primary features of Trafalgar Square.) There are a lot of wonderfully visual and fresh images like that throughout this well-wrought novel. Here's a description of a police officer, Sergeant Welkin: &quot;He was an overweight man in his thirties, with a black moustache and a harsh boxer's face, who invariably reminded people of someone else they knew. He bred Burmese cats.&quot; Oliver writes a series of books about a &quot;Foul-mouthed, chain-smoking, ex-public-schoolboy ferret named Finsbury.... giving the beast all the vices he had never possessed.&quot; The series of course becomes a critical and financial success, though not for Oliver, who isn't getting any of the money. &quot;Hoist by your own pet,&quot; Oliver's uncle murmurs. The Finsbury books expose the infants of England to the evils of alcohol, drugs, pornography, promiscuity, soccer hooliganism, smoking, and country and western music.&quot; (Ahem! Excuse me?) Mr. Beechey very cleverly, after introducing Finsbury, obeys the dictum that if you show a ferret early in the plot, the ferret should bite someone before the end. If left to myself here, I'd quote the whole book and you wouldn't have to buy it and that would never do. Oliver as sleuth is assisted by, or sometimes desisted by, his Uncle , Inspector Tim Mallard of the Yard. He sleuths by Zodiac signs, following the trail of a serial murderer. He also yearns for Sergeant Effie Strongitharm and fantasizes her response to him with replies that range from a snorted &quot;With *you*?&quot; to a breathless, &quot;At last--take me now, my shy young hero among men.&quot; He's not too successful with Effie, which is hardly surprising. There are many surprises in this book so I'm not going to tell anything about the plot progression. One big surprise almost lifted me out of bed, where I was reading. For a few pages, I was really......no that would be a spoiler. There are a lot of puns in this book, and as you've seen--much humor. Not of the slapstick kind, but my favorite kind of understated English humor that depends mostly on a very satisfying use of words. I'm looking forward to reading the next installment. I loved this book And I've decided I have to visit London next year. For sure."},{"Title":"An Embarrassment of Corpses","review":"I wish I could give this book 10 stars.

Aspiring screenwriter Elle Gee and infamous celebrity Ryder Baye end up living together in Full House, an ultra-modern estate, and the plot twists and turns like a pretzel with every page.Phony engagements, broken bones, annoying hangers-on are all part of the fun, making this nicely written and well-drawn romantic comedy a charming read. This really seems like a regular soap opera in picture book form.The fickleness of the characters seems to control the story more than the author. And once a character from Elle's past appears, the story gets even juicier. Both Elle and Ryder's utter overreacting sarcasm makes them real people, allowing the reader to relate to these characters. With Full House, neither character is right about the other, leaving the reader to keep guessing what horribly comedic calamity is going to happen next. You'll just have to wait until the next Full House."},{"Title":"First Cases: First Appearances of Classic Private Eyes","review":"&quot;First Cases&quot; is a collection of the first short stories by classic private eye writers featuring their heros (or heroines). That should be the book's caveat, as many of the protagonists had already appeared in full length novel form before these stories were published. The lineup includes such luminaries as Loren Estlemen's Amos Walker, Lawrence Block's Matthew Scudder, Bill Pronzini's &quot;Nameless&quot; and Editor Robert J. Randisi's own Miles Jacoby. All of the series characters featured are currently ongoing (or at least were as of 1996, when the book was published). Editor Randisi knows his stuff, having been the founder of the Private Eye Writers of America.All that said, the quality of the stories varies. Some of the writers had yet to really find their voice and some (especially the older) stories are somewhat by-the-numbers. Nevertheless, the book is an inetersting historical artifactfor those who want insight on how their heros developed. My personal favorites are Block's and Estlemen's. They show again why they are, for my money, the two best and most consistent private eye writers currently working in the genre."},{"Title":"Mine Enemy Grows Older","review":"I read this book in the late '60's and it was a used copy even then. But absolutely no one can give you the feel of New York's Greenwich Village scene in the real bohemian days like Alex King. I had occasion to interview Al Hirschfeld, the caricaturist who was Kings best friend. He considered him the smartest man he had ever met. And only King could describe a doctor's cloyingly soothing voice as being &quot;like marshmallow syrup strained through an old brassiere.&quot; All of King's four (!) autobiograhies are fun. This one is the best."},{"Title":"Mine Enemy Grows Older","review":"I don't know whether I would have liked King if I had known him, or whether he would have liked me. (In egotists mutual liking is usually based on misunderstandings.) There was much in his life to cause anger, and there was much waste. King was a mercurial spoilt brat with enormous talent, great compassion, great selfishness, idiosyncratic tolerance and intolerance, impressive culture, totally variegated experience, a marvellous capacity for talking about it, and enormous charm. He raises serious doubts about some of what he says, but says it all with such natural conviction that I accept most of it as stated, and most of that without doubt and little reservation.His is not the charm of the evil, but irresistable rake, nor is it the cutesy &quot;I may be a spoilt brat, but am I not sooo lovable?&quot; It is a talent for dealing with people in certain contexts, and many walks of life, combined with tremendous articulateness, a fine command of English (and, apparently several other languages) an eye for the intriguing, the ridiculous, the deep and the shallow. And a capacity for attracting the people and the disasters that he wrote about so inimitably.King was artless about his talent. No bragging, no false modesty. The subject comes up repeatedly, but always in context and always naturally and inoffensively. (He was an artist and writer! What do you expect?) He had great wit and he had great humour. In all four of his autobiographies there are many passages that are dangerous to read with a full bladder and there is hardly a page without a light irony that never breaks surface as a grin. I shall not retail them here. I am not King. Read them yourself. And do not expect to read just another book of gags by a reminiscing humorist. King is beyond that. There is a great deal more of life in his telling, than I for one would have liked to live. The expressions he used, such as those quoted by other reviewers in this column, are plentiful, frequently creative, and apposite. But those are frosting on a very substantial cake.I cannot understand why his books are out of print. Such a combination of entertainment, talent and charm, not terribly dateable in the sense of being tediously topical; I should have thought it to be an instant classic of indefinite appeal. His writing is rewarding at several levels, ranging from gags to art and sociological comment. If you read it without profit, then I am afraid I have nothing to say to you, for we are mutual aliens.But for anyone who has read this far through this review, I recommend King's books urgently and without reserve. I meant every word of the title. I have thousands of books, but I frequently re-read King's four, usually beginning by dipping in, then growling about no time to spare, and re-starting from the beginning."},{"Title":"Mine Enemy Grows Older","review":"Alexander King appeared on the tonight Show with Jack Paar.

He developed a fantastic vocabulary in a short time. He met all the big &quot;shot&quot; publishers, including Mrs. Luce.

An artist and writer, a first- rate illustrator of books he also had a variety of other jobs in his life, including being faithful husband, or so he claimed , to three different wives, and father and grandfather. In this book his first he tells much about his nine- year morphine addiction, and his conquest of this and return to something like , what he never really had, normal life. He was a great storyteller and apparently this book was created by his telling stories into a tape- recorder and editing them later on. He was a Village bohemian and in the fifties his appearance on National Television signalled the coming of a new 'let it all out ' era. He can be crude and very superficial and one of the problems of this book is that the laughter becomes after a time empty. But how many writers are there who can truly make readers laugh? He also appears here as prejudiced in various ways and it is doubtful that his book would today be published by a major publisher. Perhaps above all King was an excellent entertainer and the book with its endless gossip and comments on all kinds of people is enjoyable, if again superficial and empty it.This is the kind of book readers once might have read and enjoyed and then thrown away because they were ashamed to be seen reading it."},{"Title":"Mine Enemy Grows Older","review":"Watched this man on Jack Parr and read the book while in the hospital having my first baby.

It is beautiful with lots of pictures and easy to follow recipes, but the ingredients she uses and ages to introduce certain foods make me feel nervous about everything she says. For instance, at 4 months she says to introduce rice cereal and lots of fruits and veggies (including carrots which aren't safe to make at home at this age) but no oatmeal cereal until 6 months. But at 5 months she says to introduce meats, strawberries and COCOA! Who needs to give chocolate to a 5 month old?! Her recipes for this age include usually 4 ingredients plus formula which, with the minimum recommendation of waiting 2 days between new foods and starting solids no earlier than 4 months, seemed a lot to me. At 6 months she says to introduce peanut butter which if introduced too early can set a child up for lifelong, lifethreatening allergic reactions. My one other difficulty with the book is that the author is English and I was unfamiliar with the names of some of the ingredients--what's a swede?"},{"Title":"Ultimate Guide to Mental Toughness: How to Raise Your Motivation, Focus and Confidence Like Pushing a Button","review":"Teitelbaum offers you a success-achieving how-to instruction manual.The business and personal goal exercises on pages 50-60 are worth 100 times the price of the book in motivational energy, because you visualize your goals as if they were happening right now."},{"Title":"Ultimate Guide to Mental Toughness: How to Raise Your Motivation, Focus and Confidence Like Pushing a Button","review":"Every now and then, a writer comes along who knows his subject well enough to actually present it in such a way that it's easy to understand (but not simple), fun (yet to the point) and can be demonstrated and dulicated.The author got to me by using examples that literaly got me emotionally involved in experiencing these techniques. Yes, other authors have gotten me excited and motivated. However, at one point while reading I was so charged up that I almost jumped up from my chair and physically took action.Is there something you desire? Is there you wish were real? If you find you run short of achieving your goals, this book is a must have.The author has found a way to educate without being boring. This is not just a book that you read and think about, while hoping your dreams come true. You learn, use and live these powerful techniques.Stay tuned.

Like the other reviewers, I got far more out of reading this book than many other self-help books. This book is a fluid, easy read, packed with useful information. If you like this book, another must-read is &quot;Success Is Not An Accident&quot; by Tommy Newbury. The information in these two books seems to go together very well because they both discuss similar issues, each from a unique perspective. Tommy Newbury's book addresses the importance of goal setting and taking personal responsibility, while &quot;The Ultimate Guide To Mental Toughness&quot; contributes its own unique method of achieving goals. My last step in self-improvement has been to explore breath-control and using breathing to rev up my metabolism and boost my energy levels. &quot;The Ultimate Guide to Mental Toughness&quot; does address energy levels, but in it's own unique, interesting way. Actually, the boost in my own energy levels that I expereienced from following the guidelines in this book motivated me to explore the whole topic. Nice book."},{"Title":"Ultimate Guide to Mental Toughness: How to Raise Your Motivation, Focus and Confidence Like Pushing a Button","review":"The book \\"The Ultimate Guide To Mental Toughness\\" by Daniel Teitelbaum was not what I expected. Being a former military sniper, I think of mental toughness as the grit and determination to succeed at your mission, no matter what. I think of mental toughness more as discipline and focus to get things done. However, if you read the subtitle, you get a better indication of what this book is about. It states, \\"How to raise your motivation, focus, and confidence like pushing a button.\\" This is a book on increasing your motivation to achieve goals by using triggers.If you have read books by Tony Robbins such as \\"Awaken the Giant Within,\\" or have listened to any of the multiple audio programs Tony Robbins has put out, you may know about triggers already. Tony uses them, and they are a common part of NLP which Tony studied and uses in his teachings. (I personally really like Tony Robbins and have learned much from him, including some on triggering.)\\"The Ultimate Guide To Mental Toughness\\" goes much further into the area of triggers. Teitelbaum's book may be the most complete and user friendly book on triggering techniques out there. He explains why they work in a simple manner, and does not get too bogged down with the why. I felt he gave enough information on why they work, and then spent the rest of the book teaching the triggers and encouraging the reader to actually go through the exercises and develop personal triggers that the reader can use to motivate themselves and keep their energy level high while pursuing and achieving goals. The author uses different ways to emphasize points and motivate the reader to actually perform the exercises and develop personal triggers. It is through actually doing the visualizations and other exercises that you will find out how powerful these techniques can be. The more emotion you put into them, the more realistic and precise your visualizations, and the more intense focus you use, the more these triggers will change your state to positive emotions and \\"trick\\" your body into being more energetic and productive.Many people will not actually use these triggers. In fact, some will say it is a bunch of nonsense. That's okay. Others will find that these triggers help them stay in a positive state, which enables them to do more and thus achieve more. Some of the triggers will work for some people better than others. One good thing about this book is there are many different triggers to chose from. After experimenting with them, a person can choose to use the ones that work the best for their situation and personality.I still don't know if I'd call this book \\"mental toughness.\\" That term still means something different to me. However, if you want to learn triggering and visualization techniques to keep your motivation and focus high in order to pursue dreams and goals more effectively, this book is a great resource to learn those skills.Reviewed by Alain Burrese, author of Hard-Won Wisdom From the School of Hard Knocks."},{"Title":"Ultimate Guide to Mental Toughness: How to Raise Your Motivation, Focus and Confidence Like Pushing a Button","review":"I'M BAFFLED BY THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS OF THIS BOOK BASED ON THE COVER.

Maybe Martha Stewart heard him speak. If companies really do hire him, it's no wonder American business is losing its competitive edge. What he professes seems in line with the moral and ethical decline of &quot;Corporate America.&quot; Heck, he probably writes his own reviews on Amazon.

At that time, I was in debt and seeking motivation to do what was necessary to achieve financial prosperity.Now, I've far surpassed my personal net worth goal of $25 million.

If you carefully read the other reviews you will notice that they are susiciously similar to other authors pawning the same guru mentality. I would suggest that instead of buying this book you keep your money in your purse or wallet and I can then assure you that you have successfully completed the first stage of true &quot;mental toughness&quot; although if you are having trouble sleeping I do recommend pages 1-2 of this book."},{"Title":"Ultimate Guide to Mental Toughness: How to Raise Your Motivation, Focus and Confidence Like Pushing a Button","review":"The cover of this book is very, very obnoxious to me. Maybe it is meant to be funny? But for me it's silly, petty, and a complete joke..Not to be taken seriously..Instead, for mental toughness, I went ahead and bought a couple of Self Discipline/Mental Toughness books from Ex-NAVY Seal members. At least I know they have had some tough experiences.This kindergarten school master image on the cover of this book, must change if I am to buy any Daniel Teitelbaum books."},{"Title":"Ultimate Guide to Mental Toughness: How to Raise Your Motivation, Focus and Confidence Like Pushing a Button","review":"First of all, there are a few books you will find on Amazon.Com that have similar titles to this one. Most of them are written by ex Navy SEALS, or martial arts masters. Daniel Teitelbaum's approach towards mental toughness has nothing in common with them.Rather than shoveling a bunch of macho BS at you, and convincing you that you can use mental discipline in order to achieve some sort of Zen-type existence, Teitelbaum teaches a variety of training techniques that helps the reader to achieve future goals and improve their everyday lives.The information is very scientifically sound, and the book itself is easy to read. It reads more like a training manual than anything else. Don't expect to read through this in one sitting, as the author will have you doing exercises every couple of pages. This is definitely not a book that you can rush through.Teitelbaum not only does a thorough job of teaching each technique, but also teaches you WHY each technique works. Because these techniques rely a lot on \\"personal faith\\", knowing why they work is probably just as important as the techniques themselves.Both the book and Teitelbaum's speaking engagements tend to lean towards teaching these techniques to businesspeople, in order to help them in their careers. However, the techniques work just as well (if not better) for personal goals as well.The book is well-written, full of useful information, and the price is a bargain. I'd definitely recommend it over any of the other \\"mental toughness\\" books you will find."},{"Title":"Ultimate Guide to Mental Toughness: How to Raise Your Motivation, Focus and Confidence Like Pushing a Button","review":"When I first read this book, I was VERY skeptical about it. But after reading this book, it helped me a LOT. This book was incredibly easy to understand, and I'm only a High School student(Sophomore). So if I can understand this, I don't get how some of those other reviewers can't... One of the very first things this book has taught me was how to get over my negative voice, which would always discourage me from doing anything, saying things like \\"you can't do this\\" or \\"come on, this doesn't sound reasonable. There's no way this could work.\\" And so on.(the book gave this a name \\"Stanley\\"). Stanley can be avoided in ANY case. I'm sure everyone knows top athletes who are constantly told a million times every day that they \\"can't do it\\" or \\"they're bad at this,\\" etc. There's no way that they can escape the press or criticism throwing stuff at them, but they can still cope with it, dismiss it, and move on. Stanley was one of the major factors that slowed me down in my studies. This book not only taught me about \\"Stanley,\\" but also how to get extremely motivated into doing whatever I had to do. With the help of this book, my grades went straight up from high C's to high A's.But to get the most out of this book, you CANNOT be lazy and expect it to work. That will never work out in life. So for those reviews who said trash about this book, they were either:a.) not getting the concept-b.) too lazy to get up and actually DO the things that the book taught them-or:c.) \\"Stanley\\" is apparently the voice that's commanding them."},{"Title":"Ultimate Guide to Mental Toughness: How to Raise Your Motivation, Focus and Confidence Like Pushing a Button","review":"I was amazed that someone would give a negative review to a book because they didn't like the cover. Yet, they would read books by Navy Seals. Well, I hope negative reviewer actually read the book by the Navy Seals. They may actually find out the lessons are the same, only the examples are different. It's like a child who says &quot;I don't like that&quot; when they have never actually tried it before. Certainly not a review I would take seriously.Now, on to Daniel's book.Daniel has a gift. He approaches the reader by using little exercises to open us up to his concepts. Step by step, the reader will find excitement growing. What may have been declared as wishes (goals without action) are now gathering intense meaning and support. The goals are becoming more exciting, more desireable. Napoleon Hill speaks of a &quot;white hot, intense desire&quot;. Well, Daniel teaches us, by leading us, how we can take that goal or desire and turn it white hot.If you have had trouble reaching your goals and achieveing the life you really wantthen this book is certainly worth reading.It contains practicle advice and examples. A great book to add to your success library. Just open it and read it, and do the exercises. It's working for me."},{"Title":"Ultimate Guide to Mental Toughness: How to Raise Your Motivation, Focus and Confidence Like Pushing a Button","review":"For many years I have been unable to discipline myself to take consistant, positive action in the direction of my goals. I read dozens of books with little result. In &quot;The Ultimate Guide to Mental Toughness&quot; Daniel Teitelbaum gives step by step instructions on how to present your dreams to your mind so that you automatically become motivated on a daily basis. It's nothing short of incredible. I have already come a long way to achieving my life's ambitions. I couldn't recommend the book highly enough."},{"Title":"Ultimate Guide to Mental Toughness: How to Raise Your Motivation, Focus and Confidence Like Pushing a Button","review":"Although I do agree this book has un-catchy cover; the contents are far beyond expectations. The cover should read more like &quot;How to Super-Charge your Goals&quot;, because that is exactly what this book shows you to do. Teitelbaum shows you exactly how to &quot;Burn-in&quot; your major goals to have them effectively reach your subconscious mind and create belief in your own abilities to achieve them.Many self-help books indicate that you need to have a burning desire to achieve your goals; but don't really explain step by step how this is achieved. Teitelbaum's book reveals the secrets of mental training that world-class athletes have used for years to Laserfocus their brains on the outcome. The book is easy to read and packed with dozens of different techniques to keep you busy for weeks practicing them.This book I believe is the missing link (The catalyst) to implement any other success program. It can be used from any goal that motivates you. Even if the goal does not motivate you, the techniques in this book show you step by step how to make the end result so sweet to your brain, that it is inevitable that you will reach your outcome.This book is the cornerstone for anyone who is truly serious about achieving the end result."},{"Title":"Ultimate Guide to Mental Toughness: How to Raise Your Motivation, Focus and Confidence Like Pushing a Button","review":"Mental toughness, to me, suggests day-to-day resiliancy in the face of adversity, NOT maintenance of your goal of being an Olympic diver through adversity. I quickly grew bored after the first chapter of this book since the author seems to be chattering away about motivation and especially visualization. This book seems like it should be called, How to Become Self Actualized and Stay Goal-Focused.If you do not have trouble focusing on goals, (and this book assumes you can articulate what your goals ARE) but are really fighting more battles on the front of creeping negativity, and direct negative input from the sidelines; only in a left-handed way does it seem to address how your own thought patterns are defeating you. I can't see why this book would prove an invaluable guide to you if you just want to get through your day.I carefully read the first 3 chapters that seem to cover well-worn topics by any motivational writer. I paged through until I could find ANYTHING directly related to the subject of mental toughness. Page 99 has the concept that if you focus on tomorrow's goals NOW, you will become STRONGER, and conversely if you focus on yesterday's failures, you become weaker.This is literally, the first thing I have seen on remaining mentally tough and quieting your inner critic.His advice on quieting external critics seems to be, don't be around them. This is great advice if you don't happen to work with such a person, or be related to them through blood or marriage.This book MAY be helpful to you if you are totally unschooled in sales training or motivational basics. I was looking more for \\"becoming unflappable\\" training, or \\"figuring out what to do with useless criticism once it has been offered to you.\\" This book will teach you how to vizualize driving in your new sports car going off to a 3-day weekend, or winning an Olympic Gold medal."},{"Title":"Ultimate Guide to Mental Toughness: How to Raise Your Motivation, Focus and Confidence Like Pushing a Button","review":"You have to admit that it takes a very confident person to write a book called \\"the ultimate guide to mental toughness.\\"I think the book is aptly titled. This is one of the many books that I have no qualms about saying, \\"It was so good, it changed my life\\".That's not something I would every say lightly. This book is very, very good.We've all seen them: the people who seem to be ready and confident for any situation. Setbacks don't seem to hurt them the way they hurt the rest of us. And when the time calls for somebody who will walk in and confidently win the game, they're always at the forefront.I'm not naturally an optimistic person. I doubt it was anything to do with my circumstances. I've had my share of setbacks like everyone has. BUT, I know of a lot of folks who have had worse situations and yet they manage to be happier and more confident than me.What do they know that I don't know? Maybe nothing. Maybe it's just their natural wiring. Maybe it's just natural for them to feel that way. But for one reason or another, they seem to have more mental toughness than most folks. They certainly have more than I.But I also know that if you can't feel it, if you can fake it long enough, you can usually make it real.That's what this book teaches you to do: to teach yourself to be confident and mentally tough.I wonder if Teitelbaum is trained in hypnosis, since the book is basically a self-hypnosis book. It will actually let you get inside your head and re-program things to a better you.It isn't often I offer this type of praise, but in this case, it is worth it. This book is especially going to be valuable for managers and salespeople, as well as others who feel that a tougher, more confident mental outlook would help in their lives.Well worth the money. I only wish there were more books like this on the market."},{"Title":"Ultimate Guide to Mental Toughness: How to Raise Your Motivation, Focus and Confidence Like Pushing a Button","review":"If you want a better understanding of how your own brain works and how you can use that understanding to harness your human spirit, then this book is for you.

It is so easy to be distracted by the phone, fellow employees, customers, email, text messaging, instant messaging, lunch, flat tire ect... throughout the day. Using Mr. Teitelbaums tequniques you can keep your self on track, keep your mind focused, and acheive your goals. I'm not a millionaire, but I do support my family and live in a nice house.

It is a motherlode. It is more than a book. It is having a coach right beside me. This book is 100 % useful.. Most self-help books are minutely useful. They just take up space in order to be able to say they are 100 pages or more. The truth is most books are an inefficient use of time. But this book is very different. It is an experience you must treat yourself to. I found this book's style very unique and outstanding. It's pace is very exhilarating. As I read it and did the exercises I immediately felt the incredible motivation that I had never felt before in my life. This books is better than being in a hands on seminar. It's methods are something else! I will use them the rest of my life. . This book is like having a mentor that is always there and always for me. I have never felt so confident of my future success. I feel motivation that I have never felt before. Things that use to be hard for me to do are now easy. I would rate this book at the pinnacle of all self help books. This book gives more for your dollar than 100 books put together. From the very start this book was a page turner. I take it with me everywhere. I am on my second time through it. I plan to read it 100s of times. I am buying it for my friends. The truth be known, most self-help books are boring ,dry, with nothing new to say. This book doesn't try to be all things to all people. Rather it sticks to the point. Itdelivers the most awesome motivational tools I have ever laid my hands on. This book is a blast! I like getting back to it every chance I can. I even liked this book much more than self-help classics such as U.S. Andersen's SUCCESS CYBERNETICS or Shad Helmstetter's WHAT TO SAY WHEN YOU TALK TO YOURSELF. This book will no doubt sell millions of copies. It is a sleeper hit. It is already, in my mind, a classic. It is required reading for all self-help authors. This is what I have always wanted from a book. Step by step delivery of powerful results. The book contains methods use by world top athletes never before revealed. I have been searching for years for a book like this and now have finely found it. This book has everything you need to become successful in your business or personal life.. This is the first time I have ever written a book review. I do it because I love this book and you will too. I guarantee it! Did you ever read the book ACRES OFDIAMONDS?

In the first chapter, Professors Morgan and Signorielli provide the overview to this method.The second chapter talks about how divergent psychological processes exist in the construction of social reality from mass communication sources. Professors Hawkins and Pingree explain that &quot;the messages that lead to cultivation are aggregate patterns of action and characterization across many programs or even seasons of entertainment television.&quot;Other chapters view media influence as other factors enter the mix.

NASA doesn't select a space suit; it selects a conractor. It involves a whole range of considerations such as cost, integration of the PLSS and suit, who were the contractor's key personnel, design and test philosophy of the contractor, certfication method, prior experience, who the subcontractors were, scheduling and delivery, and how compatible the suit system is with the spacecraft. In addition, blatant national political factors more than likely affected contractor selection; how much money was NASA already spending in the respective states of the suit competitors, who were the states' representatives and did NASA owe the representative any potical favors?This volume is Bible of the space suits, covered in over 500 pages in fine print. It addresses almost all issues relating to the EVA suit in one volume. It is perhaps the only source book of space suits. It is rare occassion that an entire volume of the AAS History Series is devoted to a single topiuc, which indeed is an honor to the author. In Indian context, may be the ISRO has no plans to design a space suit, since there are no plans of any manned space mission as of today, but eventually it will have. This book will serve as a reference in design specification and technical details of the various types of EVA suits and their suitability for a particular mission.Bound in blue hard cover as usual, the book has a illustration of the Litton RX-5A hard suit being demonstrated on a simulated lunar surface."},{"Title":"The Origins and Technology of the Advanced Extra-Vehicular Space Suit, History of Rocketry and Astronautics (AAS History Series, Volume 24)","review":"Incredible book, absolutely incredible.

I couldn't reccomend this book more!"},{"Title":"Gianna","review":"This book is kind of boring. There are no evidence that she was really aborted. Her story seems like has been passing on to her by whoever the person that raised her.Until her biological mother would show up and tell her real own story that abortion really takes place in that time, probably I would believe it.Was this things had been documented? Who was the name of the doctor? Because I want to find out although I wasn't born in those year yet, but I am sure there are place that would give enough evidence for me.But if it just one way conversation, without biological mother side of stories. This story has no appeal to me all.I am almost 13 years old. This story is like a fantasy to me. The person who wrote it, doesn't have enough evidence. Sorry for you people that like the story. I agree it is a good story. I only give it one star because it entertained me."},{"Title":"Gianna","review":"Hi! I'm Jessica Shaver and I wanted to respond to a couple of readers' comments.Yes, Gianna was really aborted. The abortionist was Dr. Edward Allred, who lives in Southern California. After thirty years of doing abortions in many locations--150,000-160,000 a year, he told me--he recently sold his business. He and I have talked about Gianna's abortion in 1977 and he says back then doctors did not have the technology to be sure how far a long a pregnancy was. So he \\"guess-timated\\" and did not use enough of the saline solution to kill her. Abortion is still legal in this country till birth.Gianna will be 30 this year (2007) and is still happy to be alive. She is based in Knoxville, TN and sings and speaks around the world.I hope you will be interested in my new book about abortion--a novel called Compelling Interests. I'd be glad to know what you think about it. (I also have a novella out, New Every Morning, under my new name, Jessica Shaver Renshaw.)Thank you for your comments!Jessica Shaver"},{"Title":"Gianna","review":"I could not put this book down,I read the whole thing in 3 hours.

Such as Speaking before a hostile crowd in L.A. to braving a rescue with members of 'operation rescue' at an abortion clinic! Gianna's testimony is powerful and should be heard! Who better to stand up and defend the unborn child than one who has survived an attempt on her life when she was, herself one of the unborn! It's time that Gianna be heard!

I read the entire book in about 4 hours, because I COULD NOT believe what I was reading!Being a lifelong Stooge fan &amp; having read my share of books on the Stooges, I became increasingly skeptical of the &quot;story&quot; as I read further into the book. With very few dates cited, it was difficult to &quot;swallow&quot; alot of what was written. It was an interesting version of what might or might NOT have happened. Fact or fiction? I'm still not sure....The only reason I can't completely say &quot;It's a bogus misrepresentation of my fave Stooge&quot;, is I'm stunned that none of the Stooge heirs have taken any legal action against the author and/or publisher. Why have they not come forward to deny this story? The Stooge heirs are not shy about being litigious and guarding anything that has to do with the Stooges - the book is written rather sketchy, only ever mentioning &quot;he was a Stooge&quot;, barely citing any dates etc...so perhaps it was written cleverly enough to avoid any legal problems.(?) But I am still amazed that this book has been out for almost 3 years and I have not heard, nor can I find any rebut from family members &amp; their Stooge corporate entities. Although Mario Puzo has passed on, has anyone come forward to deny the claim that Curly actually wrote &quot;The Godfather&quot;?

I just had to write this review (and I NEVER WRITE REVIEWS) bc I saw no one else gave it a fair or positive one~for the reasons listed previously, and I might another reason for those hateful reviews: sheer ignorance.

I aimed to read it for a long time, and I only wish I had sooner. If you aren't moved to read this, I ask you to reconsider, just give it the time of day.

From the talk Ms. Garland gave, I believe Jackie can and will prove who she is. However, being an attorney myself, I would say it is more the burden of proof for someone to prove she isn't who she says. Forget what you have read in the past, the dates never match, and information is ify, at best.I am sure Jackie has an attorney, and I hope he/she is a good one and will do justice to this lady.

I have read many books about them and their careers, as well as their families, etc. Before the 1980's dates, and names the Stooges used were written one way, then after 1980 another. There has never been anything written about Curly's annulled marriage except that it happened, until now! The dates are conflicting in every book. Just recently, within the last year, more has been said, but nothing that convinced me, a true fan, that anyone really knew what it was all about. Curly was often absent from the set of the Stooges and the others knew nothing about his whereabouts. This book answered that also. If you read the webs about the Stooges you will find many mistakes. One has him being born in 1896, one in 1903. These are supposedly written by his family. in earlier books Curly had a son that died in a car crash, his name was Johnny. You don't read about him now! In earlier books,1970's and before, the books say Curly was actually Larry Fine. This book also explains the billing of this group. I think there are alot of people collecting on his estate that need to go into hiding like his real daughter has had to do all her life! I think this book blows the lid off the coverup, and I am frankly looking forward to the fireworks! This book is too unsetteling and graphic to be a lie!

There are no photographs. There are no documents. There are no dates. There is nothing adduced here to connect this twisted flight of fantasy with anything that resembles reality. The wild and irresponsible claims made in these pages have no documented validity whatsoever.Had the author done some homework (historical research about the Stooges, or contacting members of the Howard family) she would have immediately realized that she had been taken in by an unscrupulous charlatan or, giving the interviewee a modicum of latitude, a seriously mislead individual.It is impossible to address all of the ridiculous claims made in this tome, so here are the highlights;1. Curly's real name was Jerome Lester Horowitz until he officially changed his last name to Howard. His nickname was \\"Babe\\", and he was known professionally as \\"Curly\\".2. Curly was NEVER known as \\"Larry Fine\\". Actor Larry Fine was the only person in the act ever billed as Larry Fine.3. Curly was NOT Catholic he was JEWISH.4. Curly was the youngest brother of Irving, Jack, Moe and Shemp Howard -- birth records, income tax and social security documents bear this out. It is FACT. Despite claims to the contrary Moe Howard, in nearly every interview, mentioned that Curly was his youngest brother. Furthermore, Curly had NO sisters.5. The Howard family lived in NY, NOT Georgia.6. Curly was no longer a member of the Stooges when they were fired from Columbia. He was dead. Joe Besser was the actor working with the Stooges at that time.7. The Howard family was NOT Italian, they were Lithuanian.8. Neither Curly nor the Horowitz/Howard family were ever part of the Mafia, Italian or otherwise.9. Curly Howard had no knowledge of the JFK assassination -- as he died on January 18,1952 from cerebral arterio sclerosis. Medical records and coroner reports prove this fact.10. Curly Howard never met Mario Puzo, and he did not write the story that eventually became \\"The Godfather\\" novel. He couldn't write anything -- because he was DEAD.The list, unfortunately, goes on and on.This book does a disservice to film historians everywhere, and will undoubtedly cause no small amount of grief for the TRUE RELATIVES of Curly Howard -- his two LIVING daughters.I suggest that readers, interested in the REAL history of the Stooges, look into books published by Jeff Forrester. They are based on firsthand accounts and documented FACT, not innuendo and supposition.Unless you're in the mood for a total work of fiction --Avoid this book like the plague, Reader."},{"Title":"Beyond the Laughter...: A Daughter's Story of Curly's Post Three Stooges Years","review":"This book is absolutely fiction in every sense. You want truth....here is some truth, my Great Uncle was in Vaudville and new Curly very well. He has always been up front and not exaggerated, always saying we weren't best of friends but did remain friendly for many many years. He still has actual photos of he and curly together also with Moe and Shemp spanning several years in the thirties and forties and even a couple from 1951 shortly before Curly passed on. You can see the progression in his photos as Curly had stroke after stroke, it's painfully obvious. I made Uncle read the book and it literally took me three weeks to convince him it wasn't something I printed as an April Fools joke. Everything he told me about Curly when I was a child has later been supported by books that have been published....Curly loved dogs, loved to drink and party,had a very loving and tender relationship with both Moe and Shemp, loved his daughters, and his true love was his last wife Valerie. I mean my God he told me Curly's youngest daughter's name was Janie back in the seventies before any of this stuff was written. He has always said of all the stars he mingled with back in the day Curly Howard was his favorite and when he finally realized I wasn't putting him on and this book was \\"real\\" the poor old guy nearly passed on himself. Even in his nineties he wants to strangle the author for defacing his friend.

How many children for the last almost century has Curly Howard made smile and feel good????? it's countless people.

There's too much evidence about Curly Howard's life to believe any of this book. As a Three Stooges fan, and especially a Curly Howard fan, I'm outraged. After Curly had his major stroke on the set at Columbia Studios, he continued to have several series of them. He was also married at the time, with a new baby, and became paralyzed on the right side of his body. There's no way that he could've fathered anymore childern, let alone run from the mob; he could barely walk. Just the fact that everyone knows that Curly died in 1952, and that this book says he died in 1975,is a joke. There are even pictures of Mr. Howard's ACTUAL gravesite. Are we to disregard what history has presented to us because someone says, &quot;I don't have any proof, but I'm honest. Please believe me&quot;?Also, Curly, as well as the rest of the Howard family were not Catholic Italian. They were Lithuainian and Jewish. Curly was even Bar Mitzvah'ed, and it says so in his CERTIFIED biography, by his niece, Joan Howard Maurer. I am good friends with Ms. Maurer, and it is safe to say that she too, is outraged by the fabrication. The mere thought of Curly having mob ties is laughable, because anybody that knows about Curly's personal life can tell you that he was immature and a bit childish (sorry Curly. We still love ya though!).Although, I'll give the author credit for spinning a good yarn. As far as fiction goes, it's a good story, but to pass this piece of literature off as biographical information, I think, is an insult to Curly's real daughters.

She tries to make us believe that Curly was involved with everything except the Lindbergh kidnapping. It is obvious that this wannabe writer never even tried to confirm any of the supposed facts of this book. Grace Garland took every word as gospel from a \\"Carny\\" , and we all know how they can be trusted. (I really wish there was such a thing as sarcastic font.)Here's some examples all according to Ms. Garland: Curly was not Jewish, he was Italian-Catholic and heavily involved with \\"the mob\\". It also turns out that Curly didn't die in 1952, he lived into the 70's. Pardon the pun bet he was a supposed stooge for J. Edgar Hoover, who apparently let Curly know who would hold the presidential office twenty to thirty years in advance. We are also supposed to believe that JFK was looking for Curly at his ex-wife's home the day before he died. Because of his supposed mob ties, Curly knew who killed JFK. All of this is suppose to have been documented by Curly's daughter who's mom was married to Curly at one time but his family had their marriage annulled because she wasn't Catholic? Really! Curly was Jewish!Here is a fun trivia fact (Sarcastic font needed again.) Curly was the actual writer of The Godfather not Mario Puzo and was based on Curly's life.What more can I say. The only redeeming quality of this book is it's ability to be used as kindling to get the fireplace going. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS BOOK. It's nothing but badly written fiction."},{"Title":"Beyond the Laughter...: A Daughter's Story of Curly's Post Three Stooges Years","review":"After reading a couple of chapters, I was mystified. Fictionalized biographies can be interesting, but anyone who knows anything about the Stooges would realize this book was totally nuts. Curly's from a wealthy Italian Catholic family from Georgia? He doesn't have any brothers, just sisters? So I came to read the reviews, and they are hilarious! That's why I give 2 stars, not for the book (-3 stars, poorly written & edited. Marriage vows are \\"scared\\"?), but the reviews (5 stars).Many of the reviews do an excellent job pointing out the nonsense, but it also amusing to see that some people actually think Curly's real name was Larry Fine. (So who was Larry? Shemp?) Or that Curly wrote the Godfather, or knew about the JFK and RFK assassinations.The page [...] says that the book is actually a fictionalized account of Frank Sinatra, and that they changed to a story about Curly to avoid getting sued. (Apparently, it's better to get the Stooge people mad at you than the Sinatra people.)"},{"Title":"Beyond the Laughter...: A Daughter's Story of Curly's Post Three Stooges Years","review":"This book is represented as a tell all book by Curly's daughter. It is not accurate in any way. For starters the book suggests Curly was involved with the Italian mafia and was somehow connected to J. Edgar Hoover and John Kennedy. Curly Howard died in 1952! Based on what I have since read, every part of this book is a fabrication. It's not funny or clever. The book is poorly written and a real disappointment. Amazon should consider pulling this book or rewriting the description so it is not represented as a non fiction book. According to the book, Curly was involved with Jack Ruby and the Kennedy assassination 11 years after his death. Maybe Elvis was his accomplice?"},{"Title":"Beyond the Laughter...: A Daughter's Story of Curly's Post Three Stooges Years","review":"If you are a Three Stooges fan, you won't like this book. If you are into fiction, maybe you will. It tells a story of a woman's relationship with Curly. They never tell you her name or give any verification that this information is true. What a farce. I actually ordered it a long time ago and only got through a portion of the book, never finished it and forgot most of the story...thank goodness!"},{"Title":"Beyond the Laughter...: A Daughter's Story of Curly's Post Three Stooges Years","review":"This book intrigued me at the beginning, because I was a Three Stooges fan and had read just about anything I could get my hands on that was about them, in life, as well as on screen. I kept seeing family names mentioned in this book, and didn't seem to understand how that could refer to the Howards, or the Howitz family. To the end of the book, I couldn't figure it out, now could I understand how people who were noted as being of Jewish decent, in this book appeared to be Catholic.However, those inconsistencies (and others) aside, the story itself was very well done. I think it could have been better (and certainly unique) if the author hadn't tried to weave in real families (like the Howards) or with the author of the Godfather.I was disappointed that the story couldn't have been true, since it obviously wasn't, but if it hadn't been about one of the Three Stooges, and if Mario Puzo's name hadn't been mentioned, I think it would have been a much better book."},{"Title":"Beyond the Laughter...: A Daughter's Story of Curly's Post Three Stooges Years","review":"I just laughed at most of this book because it was way too far fetched to be true.

Where there's smoke, there's fire! I feel the daughter had a great deal of facts to remember. Her father tried to take into account her anger, but the girl didn't realize the importance of what she was being told. She was more interested in why her father had abandoned her,which was normal. I don't think she is capable of making all of this up, especially in view of the fact that she is uneducated. As for the writing of the book, spelling errors are the fault of the publisher, not the author. Many times grammatical errors occur when dialogue is present or ethnic speech is being used. I thought the book was well scripted. I have yet to read a book that did not have some errors. This book is worth the read. It could and should be made into a movie. I believe it would be a hit."},{"Title":"Beyond the Laughter...: A Daughter's Story of Curly's Post Three Stooges Years","review":"Last weekend the History Channel ran &quot;The Men Who Killed Kennedy&quot;. I was interested in watching after having read this book. I must admit I was skeptical about the validity of this book until I watched this documentary. Nearly all the facts stated in the book was covered in this show! Now I don't see how anybody could doubt this woman's story. Some other readers have made the comment that there were no dates or pictures in the book to back up what was written. If you watched this show you have recognized the dates, people, and places. Also, if this woman isn't who she says, why would she have chosen Curly to &quot;adopt&quot; as her father? I mean get serious... if you wanted to invent a fictional father/daughter relationship wouldn't you have chosen someone other than Curly of the Three Stooges?This book is right on target and I wish the History Channel folks would give it a read."},{"Title":"Beyond the Laughter...: A Daughter's Story of Curly's Post Three Stooges Years","review":"This is one of the most spellbindind and captivating book I have ever read!

Then, I started hearing recently uncovered practices of J.Edgar Hoover that was parallel to what was said in this book, and well, I started to see how this could be true.

But Curly did die in the early fifties as there is proof!This book does not even talk about Curly's famous brothers, Moe and Shemp, his strokes, nor his real wifes!I think this book is only a \\"work\\" to make money off of the famous Curly name."},{"Title":"Beyond the Laughter...: A Daughter's Story of Curly's Post Three Stooges Years","review":"This book has to be a total fabrication. First of all, note the lack of saying it is Curly Howard she is talking about. There is no mention of that. It is all about \\"he was a stooge\\". Sorry but that reeks of somebody not wanting a lawsuit.Secondly, it is common knowledge that Curly was sickly, and left the short movie business being replaced by Shemp and died shortly after that.I am mad I bought the book thinking I would find out what Curly did after he couldn't to the shorts anymore, only to find out somebody wrote some book that alledges all this stuff.For those of you that wonder why this is not on TV, you should figure like I did that this is the best book of fiction written about a person you could ever read.It is a good yarn, but remember the facts. None of this could have happened."},{"Title":"Beyond the Laughter...: A Daughter's Story of Curly's Post Three Stooges Years","review":"If you're expecting a warm memoir from Curly Howard's oldest daughter, about a period of struggle in the great comedian, when family and friends helped to sustain him, this \\"book\\" is so far off the beam not even to qualify as an historical curiosity.We've all been \\"burned\\" by misleading advertisements, or mis-labeling on products, i.e. records with a familiar name on the label and it turns out to be another singer, but the titling here is simply irresponsible. It's been written that the Publisher believes the work is basically fictional - okay - where's the prefacing statement to that effect? And that's not accounting for the absence of any show business/period references, scholarly research, which the editors apparently thought couldn't help the \\"story\\".If this \\"Author\\" chose to write a book (or essay) exploring how such a story can even be imagined, it may have some use. Without that stretch, we are left with something very disrespectful to the publishing world and to fans. Is it possible that this writer's enthusiasm for this project clouded her professional instincts?Curly Howard brought plenty of joy to this world; continues to do so. This book brings disappointment and depression to the eager readers.Of course, the readers should be reminded of, or referred to, the excellent book, easily accessed through Amazon, actually written by Joan Howard Maurer of Jerome Horwitz, which covers alot of ground in that somewhat \\"mysterious\\" time in the life of one our most beloved actors."},{"Title":"Beyond the Laughter...: A Daughter's Story of Curly's Post Three Stooges Years","review":"Entertaining reading? Sure. The truth? No way."},{"Title":"Beyond the Laughter...: A Daughter's Story of Curly's Post Three Stooges Years","review":"This book had so many factual errors in it, I can't figure out how anybody can believe it. First, the author say's that \\"Curly\\" said he was once billed as Larry Fine? There was only one Larry and only one Curly and they weren't the same person. The author doesn't use a lot of dates, in my opinion to make it harder to dispute what is written. However, in part of the book she talks about the daughter being an underage stripper in 1967, and the later writes that the daughter met Walt Disney at a party. How could the daughter meet Disney in 1967 or later, when old Uncle Walt died in 1966? Are we to believe that Walt faked his death also? And why would the leader of the free world (John Kennedy) visit a rundown neighborhood just a few day's before his death? Another error that seemed glaring to me is that all the history books say Curly Howard died in 1952, however in this book, on 2 different occasions, the supposed Curly say's :Hollywood has had me dead since the late 50's or early 60's.\\" If this were the real Curly, wouldn't he know when his supposed fake death occured? I could also touch on Hoover and the Godfather claims, but it's just more erroneous facts.

Everything about this piece of trash is so bad, I am embarrased as a knowledgable consumer that I was sucked in to buying it. I wish I had read the other reviews, before buying, but Amazon should be ashamed of themselves for not running a disclaimer at the top of the page in BIG BOLD TYPE, that this puported biography is a work of fiction, and a horrible one at that. I forced my self to read the whole thing, even though after the first chapter I really felt that I need to take abath to remove the stink. Once finished, this was thrown in the recycling bin with old newspapers. At least I was able to reduce the environmental footprint of this piece of garbage."},{"Title":"Beyond the Laughter...: A Daughter's Story of Curly's Post Three Stooges Years","review":"Several reviewers have described this book as \\"believeable\\". This is problematic, as the author states clearly that the only tangible documentation that can support the myriad of claims made in the book have been either lost, sold, or usurped by the government. What we are left with is completely unverifiable.Any one of us can write a book solving all of the unsolved mysteries from the last century, and then end it with:\\"I can't prove anything I've said, because the government stole all the documents, and I can't tell you or prove who I am because it's too dangerous, but it's all true, really, take my word for it, I wouldn't tell a lie.\\"I'd be just as excited as anyone to learn that the book was factual, but I just don't see it. If Jackie's identity, as well as the book's many claims, can be verified, I will gladly take back every single word. The book is pure fiction, until proven otherwise."},{"Title":"Beyond the Laughter...: A Daughter's Story of Curly's Post Three Stooges Years","review":"This novel is a complete fabrication, an imaginary tale.

The only Curly biography out there is the one written by Joan Huward Maurer - Moe's daughter, and although not great, it is factual.Believe me, if any of this nonsense were true a bigger publisher would have grabbed this up. Not only are the events in the book implausible, the writing is not very good. There is so much unnecessary repetition. Did anyone even proof this thing?

First I thought, how strange, I never had any idea Curly lived this type of life. I knew he drank too much. He married many times. But this? Curly in the mob? And then, yes, I thought, this cannot be; a guy named Horwitz from Brooklyn, N.Y., happens to have an uncle named Guido and needs to visit Sicily on his behalf. The author says in the forward that she did research \\"and it took a year to gather the information needed to write her story and to verify certain aspects of it.\\" This is the most ridiculous, misleading book I've ever encountered. Sadly, I bought it. Amazon and the book itself should clearly label it \\"fiction\\" or better yet, garbage.. If you read the forward, you would think this is the real thing. I was excited at the thought of reading some insights into Curly. I read a few chapters, scratching my head along the way before I put it down for good.

Besides the Stooges I have always been intrigued with the underworld. This book covered that as well. I thought the book was well written and covered the part of Curly's life I am sure all Stooge fans will want to know about. In everything I have ever read, the annulled marriage was mentioned, almost like an afterthought. It wasn't until recently on one of the Stooge Webs that there was a mention of who she was. I kind of feel that the other Stooge heirs put that on to cover this. It didn't work for me becaue this book is too believable, and always before nobody knew anything about the marriage. I have also noticed the years, dates, don't match in all the other reports about the Stooges. I noticed that several years ago. Curly was always my favorite and I guess I just seem to clue in more on the things about him. Some books say he was born in 1897 and some in 1903. I think there is a big coverup going on somewhere and this book seems to offer the best explanation. It will be interesting to see what happens with this one.

To have been loved by her is one of the richest blessings I've known in life.#2. Jackie would be completely incapable of writing anything but the truth, as she would never defile her mother's (or Nanny's) memory with less. It's that simple! It was difficult for her to disclose the savage, cowardly acts inflicted upon her by a family member, but she did so out of a need for the truth to be told. I applaud her bravery.#3.

The author did zero research. If she had, she would have either made some observations that actually made sense, or simply abandon the whole foolish project.Well, I for one feel ripped off. I'm going to try to track down the author and demand a refund. I won't get one from Amazon, that's for sure.I hope the Howard family files suit against this nutcase.

On literally every single page, Don touches very lightly on a topic, and then directs you to read another book he's written on the subject if you'd like to learn more. There were a *few* fasting facts, but nothing new if you've ever read ANY other book about fasting. I urge you to save yourself the eight bucks, and instead possibly check out The Fasting Path by Stephen Harrod Buhner, which is a much more interesting and helpful fasting book."},{"Title":"Fasting Made Easy","review":"The first thing to kinow that this is a book about juice fasting; he does address other forms of fasting briefly, he also mentions the difference bethween water fasting and juice fasting. If you are interested in water fasting, or a more in depth overview of fasting in general, then the book \\"Fasting and Eating for Health\\" by Dr Joel Furhrman is a better book, also in the January 2012 issue of Scientific American there is an excellent article about the mechanism of fasting at the cellular level called \\"A new path to longevity\\". And as another reviewer mentioned, Dr Colbert uses this book as an advertisement for his other books instead of offering in depth explanations. But overall it is a pretty good book."},{"Title":"Fasting Made Easy","review":"I have read several of Dr. Colbert's books and enjoy them. I wanted to get the fasting book because I have never fasted but would like to give it a try to see if it would help with some health issues I am experiencing. I like this book because it is not recommending extreme fasting and offers a couple approaches, one that can transition you into fasting. I would recommend the book for beginners, such as myself. It is a quick read and gives enough facts to support the possibility fasting may be a benefit on several levels."},{"Title":"Fasting Made Easy","review":"This is an easy read book with great information it in. Great seller too. Thanks so much. Vickie"},{"Title":"Fasting Made Easy","review":"Good book and easy reading. Was expecting something a little different, not sure what. Will probably read it again."},{"Title":"The man nobody knows","review":"In his second major work, The Man Nobody Knows, author Bruce Barton portrays Jesus Christ as a salesman--not an ordinary salesman, but the world's greatest salesman--and exhortsreaders to profit by his example. Additionally, the story of the carpenter from Nazareth, Barton argues, is \\"the story of the founder of modern business (12).Throughout the book, Barton paints Christ in a positive color. He disavows the \\"wicked falsehood that [Christ] never laughed\\" (23), from inference of the New Testament--the men whobecame his disciples never would have been attracted to a man who demonstrated Miltonian characteristics. Further, Barton comments on Christ's leadership, as \\"only strong magnetic meninspire great enthusiasm and build strong orginizations. Yet Jesus built the greatest orginization of all...He picked up twelve men from the bottom ranks of business and forged them into an orginization that conquered the world\\" (35-36). This act could have only been done by a supreme business executive, a man who knew how to persuade others, and was so passionate in hisrhetoric that men would be willing to give their lives for his cause. Hence, Christ was the greatest salesman of all.Finally, through the use of scripture, Barton demonstrates Christ's ultimate leadership qualities during Christ's cruxifiction. As Christ was hanging on the cross, one of the thieves painfully asked that Christ remember him when Jesus returns to his kingdom. Barton believes this was Christ's greatest act of leadership, as \\"there have been leaders who could call forth enthusiasm when their fortunes ran high. But [Christ], when his enemies had done their worst, so bore himself that a crucifed felon looked into his dying eyes and saluted him as king\\" (220).Written in 1925, The Man Nobody Knows was an immesensely popular book. With the post-World war I production levels becoming so high that consumers were unable to buy all theproducts that industry produced, new markets had to be created. It was out of this climate that the advertising industry came of age. Barton, chairman of the board of the New York advertisingagency Batten, Barton, Durstine and Osborne, saw Christ as the ultimate master of salesmanship. He hoped that his readers, in an age of wealth and extravagence, would reflect back upon Jesus, not as weak man, but a man of such strong physical and emotional characteristics that readers would \\"exclaim [Jesus] is a man nobody knows\\" (vii).Bruce Barton's The Man Nobody Knows, is written in beautiful, sincere prose. Throughout the novel, Barton maintains a high quality of reverence for Christ, and his teachings.Although Barton's primary audience are salesmen and businessmen, the book appeals to any reader, religious or atheist, businessman or farmer.The Man Nobody Knows is a wonderful tool for examining Christ's life as a smiling, divine businessman. As the wheel of big business turns and men spend their lives striving tomake millions of dollars, Barton reminds us of one businessman who gave his life in comforting millions of souls."},{"Title":"The man nobody knows","review":"I think some people wrote their reviews without reading the book. If you judge it by only the chapter titles or the text on the front of the book, you are really missing out. I was required to read this for a college class and I am very glad I got the chance to find this gem. For anyone interested in the life and works of Jesus or just love to read a good book that makes you rethink things, definitely check this one out."},{"Title":"The man nobody knows","review":"Comrade McAllister's review below, \\"Astonishing This Chestnut is Still Around,\\" has nothing to do with this book (The Man Nobody Knows, by Bruce Barton). It is as if he didn't read it, much less understand its profound and deeply moral meaning. The message of this book is dead set against what McAllister sees as the \\"gluttony of corporate America.\\" Indeed, Bruce Barton says repeatedly that those who seek long term success must first be willing to \\"lose themselves at the bottom\\" - in humble, spiritually enriching service to their fellow man. The few men of history (besides Jesus) who Barton characterizes as \\"great\\", are not CEOs and Wall Street bankers, but world leaders, scientists, etc (Asoka, Abraham Lincoln, Francis Bacon) who gave us a higher vision.McAllister also concedes an all-too-common, perverted, Marxian understanding of Jesus' message. Jesus' admonition that the rich \\"give their money away\\" to find the kingdom of Heaven, was not an attack on money itself as something inherently evil, but an allegorical attack on the love of money eclipsing the love of God. Indeed, like Barton, Jesus valued monetary gain if acquired with an open, self-reliant, service-oriented heart. This message is obvious in Jesus' parable of the talents, in which 3 servants are given talents/money by their master (i.e. God) to manage in his absense. The servant who multiplied his talents the most through creative, industrious effort is rewarded/praised the most by the master. And the servant who added no profit to his talents is castigated as lazy and wicked. Thus rings Christ's truism, \\"To those who have shall more be given, but to those who have not, even what they have will be taken away.\\" To not understand this message and instead call Jesus a \\"freeloader\\", a man of lowly self-worth who leeches off society's fruits, betrays pure ignorance.Again, Barton's main reason for writing the book was to help ordinary people apply Jesus' principles in their daily lives, beyond ivory tower theology. In truth, we are all \\"salesmen\\" to some extent. We have to be to survive, grow, and prosper. Belief in the childish, utopian, and arrogant notion that we do not have to \\"put ourselves out there\\", do not have to extend ourselves in the least, do not have to try to persuade others that our philosophy, or service, or product, or even matrimonial proposal will be serve them best in the long run, is the first step on a descending path toward the stagnation of the human soul. In political terms, such belief is manifested in centralized systems of control (Communism, Fascism, Feudalism) in which a tiny elite, brandishing great power and wealth, makes decisions for billions of cogs in the wheel, who literally have no commerical or political power to be self-reliant and improve their economic condition.Perhaps McAllister would like to return to the days of the Feudal lord in which inherited stations in life determined a man's destiny from birth? Free markets, and free markets alone, lifted 90% of the masses out of that hell (even in the last 20 years, free markets, not Communism, have pulled 600 billion Chinese out of poverty). Then, when \\"the poor\\" were no longer the brunt of humanity, were no longer indistinguishably \\"equal\\" to each other in their misery, cultural Marxists began complaining about the newfound economic contrast between the poor and everyone else. Of course, they blamed this contrast on the very system that brought the other 80% out of that horrid poverty.Indeed, McAllister offers no new solution to our imperfect, yet \\"better than the alternatives', Western democracy. His analysis is that of a quibbler - an incessant complainer with no higher goal. Bruce Barton's is that of a quester - a man who is truly seeking - offering a viable method for improving people's lives amidst the realities of our human world. I guarantee if you read this book with an open heart and seeking mind, it will enrich your life for years to come.I leave McAllister with one of my favorite quotes from the movie, Chariots of Fire. Two stuffy, old, \\"ivory tower\\" Cambridge University headmasters are castigating Harold Abrahams, an ambitious collegiate runner with Olympic dreams, for subtly breaking the lofty code of the amateur athlete in hiring a professional coach to try to unlock every bit of athletic potential in himself. They maintain he has lost sight of the pure ideals of the amateur and lowered himself with this foray into \\"business\\". Abrahams replies, \\"Gentlemen... you yearn for victory just as I do, yet achieved with the apparent effortlessness of gods. Yours are the archaic values of the prep school playground. You deceive no one but yourselves. I believe in the pursuit of excellence. And I'll carry the future with me. \\""},{"Title":"The man nobody knows","review":"I wanted to read what a book written in 1925 on Christ would have to say. I was surprised that this was such an inspiring book. It took a perspective that I'd simply not thought of before. It was well written, incisive and drew some surprising, but accurate conclusions I'd never arrived at previously.I do recommend this volume.Also, I must recommend the Amazon seller I got it from: TheGokorosama. Description was precise, delivery unusually speedy, and I felt I was given a personal recommendation from the Seller. Thanks."},{"Title":"The man nobody knows","review":"The notion that Jesus' values were those of corporate America and his \\"charisma\\" of the sort that makes insurance salemen is so laughably a fantasy that I hope the other reviews are meant as jokes. Portraying Jesus as a \\"booster,\\" a kind of successful Willy Loman, is about as ludicrous as picturing Mother Teresa as a fashion model and Gandhi as a comic book superhero. The Jesus of the New Testament would have observed the conspicuous consumption of corporate America, the cultural gluttony of the Western World, with sadness and disgust.Jesus may be the ultimate Rorschach. We look at him: Nazis see a blue-eyed Aryan beset by Jews and look for somebody to beat up; gays see their lifestyle affirmed in the friendhip with John; chickenhawk warriors somehow see endorsement of the hateful causes they want others to die for; the tenderhearted and compassionate see him surrounded by happy children; feminists see the women by his side; lying hypocrites see... God knows what.The hardest thing for humans to do is to comprehend that their heroes are not just big versions of themselves. A hero should be something to push against, not a self-endorsement. Jesus told the rich to give away their money. He told his followers not to gather up treasures in the world. He said wealth is a burden that will keep the rich out of Heaven. He scourged the moneylenders. He was a freeloader. He is bad for business.Today, as the most affluent country on the planet, we hear the Christian message as unhappily as the young wealthy Hebrew who asked Jesus what he must do to be saved. His answer was NOT \\"get an MBA.\\" But instead of walking away, we invent new myths of a Jesus more suitable, one able to see past his silly prejudice against money grubbers, to see that it is possible to be rich and really nice.Barton's book is a bizarre anachronism; a last survivor of the Babbitt years of pious Philistinism and Pharisaic self-approval just before the Depression turned our complacent cultural narcissism upside down. How sad, that it's coming back into fashion. Read Jim Wallis' *God's Politics* for a theology less absorbed with self-justification."},{"Title":"The man nobody knows","review":"I pulled it out of my cataloging stack because it sounded so intriguing. \\"What a good idea, \\" I thought. \\"The Gospels are so familiar, to read them as a 'modern life' will be very refreshing.\\"And sometimes the author approached the potential -- a few paragraphs here and there really did cast light on Jesus as an actual human being.However, Mr. Barton evidently decided to ignore His divinity. That's just as unbalanced as the too reverential tomes which ignore His humanity. Barton mentions healing, feeding the 5,000 etc., but never acknowledges that He is actually working miracles.Further, he implies that it was the strength of Jesus' message which caused it to last for 2,000 years, rather than its being the actual, living Word of God, straight from His Son. Barton seems to think it's like something from Karl Marx or Charles Darwin, or even Aristotle and Plato.And finally, he ends with the crucifixion, ignoring the Resurrection altogether. Jesus was not just a magnetic preacher or an inspirational teacher. Either He was God in the flesh, or, as C, S. Lewis so aptly points out, He was a lunatic who claimed to be God.If He was God, his humanity and His divinity should be equally acknowledged and enjoyed. That is not the case in this book."},{"Title":"The man nobody knows","review":"After reading this book, you will never again think of Jesus in the same way. No longer will you see him as the soft spoken, meek, turn the other cheek preacher we so often hear about."},{"Title":"The man nobody knows","review":"Read this book for the first time over 30 years ago, reread recently and still enjoy the authors alternate view of Jesus.

Wish I didn't need it for school, or it would be going right back."},{"Title":"The man nobody knows","review":"Many books have been written about Jesus as Son of God . . . and equal with God. What Barton has done is to place emphasis on His human side. It's not meant to be the only book about Jesus in your library, and, like the Bible stories, does not need to be taken literally to be of value. Why not stress his kinship with us mortals? Perhaps it can help us to understand how we should behave as humans, not just as \\"children of God.\\" If Jesus did not come to earth to be completely human, to hunger, to desire, to suffer, to get angry, to be disappointed, and to rejoice, then of what value is His life to us?

Bruce Barton dares to conjecture a living, vibrant man who inspired others by his mere presence. This does not negate the idea of a divine Jesus. Barton attempts to paint a picture of what Jesus as a man might have been like. Why do modern men and women fear the concept of a living, human Jesus? Probably because he is still alive. They look out the window and see Jesus coming and they know that he will not simply rearrange the furniture, he will rip out the interior and create something new and extraordinary. I first read this book as a child of ten, and kept it all my life. It was such a refreshing and brilliant vision of the human Jesus ... someone I could admire and want to be around. From this seed I would one day develop a passionate spiritual relationship with Jesus. But I will never forget the humble beginning of first learning to love the human Jesus, who struggled and suffered even as his children do. I have come to believe that people fear Jesus because they believe that if they open the door and let him in he will change everything.

This book inspired the group called \\"the Family\\" whose members have infiltrated the highest levels of our government and big business. Their idea is that God intends all the wealth to be concentrated in the hands of a few \\"Big Men,\\" and He will tell them what to do with it.

The author makes his points powerfully forever changing the way I look at Jesus and his life. This book is a must read. I am so glad I came across the book. I promise you will not be disappointed.

He had a good run of those, more than 20 books and about 20 years. I find his other books a hit or a miss. I stopped reading him when he stopped writing the KC series as I enjoyed the familiarity and comfort of an old established series and old friends.This the first \\"new\\" book of his I've read in about 20 years. It's pretty good and I think embodies the best characteristics of a good British writer.The build up is slow and steady, but you know it will lead up to the main story. The main plot is very credibly written and enjoyable to read to its conclusion. I won't repeat the plot here, which can be found in the book description. Unlike modern thrillers which are peaks and valleys of excitement the enjoyment is more level all the way through the book. There is a lot of subtle humor.There is a lot of character development of the protagonist, in fact, that's what the whole of the build up is. And that may be one of the reasons I don't like his stand alone books. After spending so much time with the characters, it seems a shame to discard them. I wish there was a sequel but unfortunately there's none.Still, I enjoyed this book. If you like a book that's well and carefully written with a lot of subtle humor, then this book is for you."},{"Title":"Tina and David","review":"When I seen this book available, I just had to have it.

Hugh soon discovers, however, that prayer, bookbinding, and care for the poor aren't the only things that engage the inhabitants of Glaston. Mystery abounds and Hugh, the oblate Dickon, and the hermit Bleheris, are soon caught up in a quest for a magnificent treasure hidden for hundreds of years.The Hidden Treasure of Glaston is a lovely little tale, written in pithy, flowing prose that will easily hold the attention of even the most distracted reader. Written by an author who is obviously comfortable in her historical milieu, the story offers abundant positive messages for both young readers and old, chief among them being the importance of forgiveness and the virtue of detachment from material goods.Well-suited for kids ages 10 and up, the book is also a quick and easy read for adults. It is a good one to read and discuss with your kids and can serve as an introduction to the history of medieval England and the monastic life that dominated Christendom at a time when Europe actually possessed a culture it wasn't ashamed of.Highly recommended.If you enjoy books like this one, I would also recommend Eleanore Jewett's other novel,Big John's Secret."},{"Title":"The Hidden Treasure Of Glaston","review":"This book kept me awake when I was 10, impelled me to Glastonbury at 21, and could still hold my attention at 40.

I would need to reread it to be more specific, but alas, that does not sound like a fun way to spend my day.On the other hand, my 13 yo son read the book at an earlier date and really liked it. So I am giving it 3 stars because he's a pretty good judge of books too. :-)"},{"Title":"The Hidden Treasure Of Glaston","review":"Sometimes it seems like every tween and ya adventure/mystery/fantasy has to have an appearance by Arthur or Merlin or Mordred or one of the Knights. Their names and passing reference to their characters are just used to add some romance or some weight to what can otherwise be underwritten and underimagined.I think this book is so well regarded because it has much of the old-fashioned grace and majesty of those old tales, and it is earned through good writing and good plotting. The characters are well conceived; the world of the 1100's is well described. The plot has mystery and adventure and derring-do. Sometimes the author can hyperventilate a bit, and some passages tend toward the precious or purple prose, but by and large the writing is restrained and in service to driving the characters and the plot.I could see this book appealing to a wide variety of tastes and readers, and it certainly makes a nice change of pace for modern tween adventure readers."},{"Title":"The Hidden Treasure Of Glaston","review":"We are studying the middle ages this year and this is one of the books of required reading in the program.Never boring and intensely exciting, the book itself is a treasure!Full of adventure and mystery this book will keep you hoooked.

No Newbery Honor books should be allowed to go out of print. This is a great book."},{"Title":"The Day-to-Day Life of the Desert Fathers In Fourth-Century Egypt","review":"With all due respect to the well known work in this regard by Benedicta Ward, please study the opus of Dom Lucien Regnault, monk of Solesmes, who dedicated his fruitful lifetime to the study of the Desert Fathers, writing numerous authoritative studies and collections of their sayings in his own translation, visiting the region where they lived, worked, fasted, fought and prayed.Dom Lucien Regnault did this monumental labor all while serving Solesmes as Novice Master and later as Prior, leading there as ascetic and prayerful and humble a life as humanly possible. Although many of his most valuable works are now tragically out of print, several collections and commentaries may still be located at solesmes dot com. I know I am clinging to my collection of his five volume Sentences des peres du desert as carefully as I keep what I have left of Father Ernesto Cardenal\`s community gospel meditations from Solentiname.Until you are able to find Dom Regnault's other works and translations, this present volume is an excellent introduction to the history and life of these pioneering Christian monks who responded to the compromises the Church was making with the Emperor Constantine (including regarding his unChristian usage of violence and warfare) by following Christ out into the desert to fast and to pray in great solitude, peace and poverty.Perhaps the ancient monk best known by the public now is Saint Anthony (not of Padua, but of the Desert) whose life and temptations were novelized by Gustave Flaubert (of Madame Bovary fame) subsequent to his visits to Egypt. But here Dom Regnault introduces us to all that can be historically and actually and empirically known of these great and holy men and women, supplemented by his own livng of their lifestyle, which grants his writing an insight and perception and mystery not otherwise found in other authors, except perhaps for Trappist hermit Father Thomas Merton's own writings on the Desert Fathers and Pre-Benedicitine monks, which are published still by Cistercian Publications.Briefly, this present work introduces us to every aspect of these great monks lives, including maps, and including spiritual and psychological bases for their search and their practices. As the title promises we learn everything about their daily life, including diet and community, when not living for years in absolute solitude, about which we also read. We see the kinds of animals and spirits they might encounter, and how demons and such were perceived in thier time, or rather what phenomenom they expressed in these terms, and how we might express the same experience in our time.This work is therefore a great way for any student to study our deepest Christian spirituality as practiced by these holy men and women. An excellent and comprehensive bibliogrpahy with suggestions for further readings expands the very substantial text well planned and presented by Dom Regnault. You may find yourself thirsting to study French to read more by this author, or on a plane to Egypt to study Coptic to pursue these holy spirits in the desert! You will not be disappointed. Please read this book to find the true path to the meaning and message of our Gospel and our Faith in our Lord Jesus Christ, to make the Beatitude of His all self sacrficing Peace."},{"Title":"Force Of Reason","review":"Christopher Hitchens said that this book is a primer on how not to write about Islam. Now one thing the Hitch and I have in common is that we are both blokes, and unconsciously, we both know that we will benefit from an Islamic paradise. Yes, we larvae know this deep in our bones; that we men will benefit from the coming Islamic spring and the later Muslim paradise.What with the young full-breasted maidens you will meet in the Muslim paradise (Surah 78 an-Naba: The Announcement) and all the other sweet n sexy bits n pieces promised by Allah; why fear the inevitable march of monotheism with an erotic face? Man will own four wives in this world, and so loads of intercourse on tap; plus, no more awkward eye contact in front of an attractive woman and no more angry singles bars because women will be ours to own; just like the enslaved women in Saudi Arabia. You could even give your woman sexy tattoos and draw funny pictures on her breasts, as she is always covered up, only you would know! What an image.Aldous Huxley once joked that in a Moslem paradise, every orgasm lasts 700 years. Today, he would get wheeled off to the European courts! Therefore, one of the reasons Islam is winning is that we men don't want to get wheeled off to jail and, more importantly, we men can joke about the lustfulness, to use David Hume's term, of Islam, without feeling threatened. This is what Christopher Hitchens and the other male commentators miss; that for we men, it's an argument over yet another ideology, but for women, well there is a completely different ontology going on.We bad ass tough men really have nothing to fear from sharia law, you know. OK,we do vigorously pander to enlightenment values and all that, but I doubt you will feel threatened from the owning of four wives and interest free loans.Oriana Fallaci is an angry voiced Italiano woman who thinks otherwise! She sounds frightened and alone, to me and maybe to you. So if it's not our hope of a 700 year orgy, then what other reason for our passivity in the face of a distressed female? We are paralysed like those larvae people in The Matrix. But Muslims, Fallaci is arguing, are not. Fallaci sees Muslim men vigorously on the march. This, I think, is why intelligent women are cackling their pants! They know that they are on their own. (Germain Grear isn't worried mind, but let's bestow on her the privilege of honorary bloke). They are terrified because we European larvae people are sitting on our hands and even worse, we are kicking feminists out of their own country (like Hirsi Ali, who was booted all the way to the USA) or vilifying them in the media or dragging then to the law courts. Sorry to sound all self righteous and dramatic, but Oriana Fallaci's fear and anger sparkles in these pages. Her prose is that of a angry but petrified woman and so this has an effect on the reader. This is one of the most angry prologues I have ever read you see; and it is so well written. She's got cancer but spiteful people are writing her letters of hate and even cheering that she's got the cancer (the same thing is happening to Christopher Hitchens). She lists the flabby European politicians who are in league with the fat mullahs and dirty imams, who are all in unison, like a line of clapping seals, in trying to silence her. These men are all in agreement; Fallaci needs to be thrown into a dungeon and made to eat dung till she dies! All because she speaks the truth. What's up with us guys! The gods of unintended consequences turn the millstones in mysterious ways.Me and my drinking buddies sometimes play the law of unintended consequences game, here's a funny one. Feminist have been for years fighting for equality, and rightly so. Now we are all equal, now we have erected the pillars of civilization; however, here come a few million traditional men, with their traditional females, to live amongst these equal women. What do you think will happen? Well, let us see; because women are now equal, before the law courts and, more importantly, ontologically, then they better not object to men worshiping their leader with their buttocks pointing up to heaven. Western women better not object to these men owning many girls and slapping the said girls for refusing their husbands advances. If they do object that gangs of traditional men; traditional men who have been raised to be the protectors' of women, are not playing the equality game, then these bothersome ladies will be treated like Nazi skinheads before the benevolence of our fair and balanced courts. I bet the feminists didn't expect that one coming? Hold on a minute, this probably explains the mystery as to why white feminists, like Germaine Greer, support female castration for brown girls?There is a skinhead type, from Austria of all places, called Elisabeth Sabaditsch-Wolff, who racistly said that she didn't want her baby daughter to become chattel for men. The bitch just got convicted in the law courts, and guess what, the feminists clapped! Sabaditsch-Wolff had hinted, many times on You Tube, that women are in a weird way, somewhat weaker than men, and this is what the ideologues of equality forget, and I only use the example of Elisabeth Sabaditsch-Wolff because she speaks in a, \`hey I don't wanna arm wrestle an aggressive bloke', sort of way; though she may be putting an act on, with her concerned mother routine. How dare she do a concerned mother routine, like some sort of female!Another aggressive female, who went way too far, is, of course, the Italian skinhead, Oriana Fallaci. Fallaci dared show fear and feel threatened by the stronger, more aggressive species, and so she typed away on her typewriter. Instead of running to the ladies rescue, the grand old men of Europe set the wheels in motion to silence Fallaci. Fallaci died from cancer, thus escaping the cold hands of the judge."},{"Title":"Force Of Reason","review":"And so the rage and pride gave birth to disdain, guided by reason. In the prologue, Fallaci reveals how the gatekeepers of political correctness have attacked her since the publication of her previous book,The Rage and the Pride. She received insults and death threats from various quarters; politicians, academics and sections of the mass media joined in this choir of condemnation. But there was also an outpouring of support, mostly letters from ordinary people in Europe who expressed their gratitude for someone speaking on their behalf.What makes Fallaci's style so appealing is the blend of historical fact with eyewitness journalism. As a rhetorical device, she addresses a variety of contemporary and historical personages in the form of letters throughout the text. She scorns the peace activists, explaining why some wars are right and legitimate. In a blunt semantic shift, she now describes the shrill ensemble of politically correct \\"cicadas\\" as outright traitors and collaborators. She takes a swipe at the double standards and the hostile political climate in Europe as well as the hypocrites and fools at theUnited Nations.In chapter one she gives her assessment of the changing demographics in Europe where non-integrated immigrant communities have sprung up in most major cities. To counter the propaganda of the crusades as a sin of the West, she provides numerous examples ofIslamic incursionsinto Europe before and after the crusades, including the 668 assault on Constantinople, the 711 invasion of the Iberian Peninsula, the attempted subjugation of France in 721 and the conquest of Sicily in 827. There were also the raids on the Italian coast and the Ottoman conquest of the Balkans. Sensitive readers must be aware that this section contains many graphic descriptions of the utmost cruelty. Finally, she draws a parallel between those early wars and the Islamic expansionism of today.Fallaci then takes us on a tour of Europe to show how bad things have become. She starts and ends with Italy and visits other countries in between. In France, there are cities where Maghrebis make up 30% of the population. She refers to the murders of Pim Fortuyn and Theo van Gogh in the Netherlands, and describes Spain under its current government as a hopeless case. But it is theUKthat is the real strategic base sheltering the vanguard, and Fallaci even has harsh words for the singer Cat Stevens. She mentions Louis Farrakhan, Malcolm X and Muhammad Ali in the USA, recounting a frightening interview she had with the famous boxer.The author reproaches herself for not having seen the danger coming in the early 1970s. Drawing on the research ofBat Ye'or, she chronicles the sordid conspiracy between the then-EEC and Arab governments. It started after the Yom Kippur War and the OPEC oil boycott. In the form of the Euro-Arab dialogue, European academics and politicians, spearheaded by Leftists, have sold Europe's soul for oil and immigrants. With their servile attitude, they have betrayed the essence of our Western values. She also makes mention ofHaj Amin al-Husseini, the Palestinian leader that became an ally of Hitler.Fallaci identifies those who have sold out Europe as the Triple Alliance: the Catholic Church, the Right and the Left. The church stood by when terrible intellectual robberies took place, for example the appropriation of Judeo-Christian myths for the purposes of the enemy. Mourning the decline of the historical Italian Right of the Risorgimento, she calls it a noble lady that committed suicide. Before launching into the Left the points out the strikingsimilaritiesbetween the extreme Right and extreme Left.Accusing the Left of dogmatism and intellectual terrorism, she shows how it embraced Khomeini in 1979 and how it has since fallen in love with Bin Laden and Saddam Hussein. She claims that the Left is not secular but is in fact an illiberal and totalitarianchurchunder whose rule in the 1990s the number of immigrants to Italy increased exponentially. At the root of its Anti-Occidentalism is a profound and irrational hatred of the USA and Israel.In the Epilogue she diagnoses the death of reason in the West as caused by people too lazy to think. Here she provides further evidence of the onslaught on Western culture, talking of the fear of being free, the decline of intelligence and the decline of reason. Although the USA gives her hope,America Aloneis not enough to reverse the decay. Fallaci maintains that terrorism is just a strategy, that immigration is the real danger and that the enemy aims to destroy our very souls, our dreams, ideas and achievements.The Post-Script is the text of her speech on the occasion of receiving an award from the Center For The Study of Popular Culture on 28th November 2005. In it, Fallaci boldly states that she hates the Bin Ladens, Zarkawis, Ward Churchills, Noam Chomskys and Michael Moores of the world. She talks favourably of her meeting with Pope Benedict, expressing confidence in his understanding of the situation. Referring to the 2005 riots in France, she states that Left and Right are obsolete expressions since they are just two teams battling for power. She does not consider herself as either. Finally, she thanksthosewho persist in exposing the facts. Although they are criticized as dissidents, heretics and outlaws, she encourages them to pursue the battle of ideas, confident that truth will win in the end.The Force Of Reason is a tour de force, more measured than the previous book but not entirely devoid of her trademark fury and full of humor. In essence, the book is a comprehensive analysis of the perilous intellectual climate and alarming world events, a much-needed antidote to a set of widely held false beliefs, and an impassioned wake-up call to the West."},{"Title":"Force Of Reason","review":"A comprhensive expose' of Islam and rebukes the traditional thinking in America that the Muslims are \\"just like us\\"."},{"Title":"Force Of Reason","review":"Ms.Fallaci does not mince her words and goes right to the issue of Islam and its' impact upon Europe,particularly her native country Italy.The shocking ease with which European diplomats have relinquished control of their countries in the name of political correctness and greed is disturbing.An extremely well written book which stands as a literary hallmark and clarion call to Christians in the 21st century.The"},{"Title":"Force Of Reason","review":"This is a wonderful treatise on the problems we face.

It is a tremendous loss that this was her last treatise!"},{"Title":"Force Of Reason","review":"Reading her reminds me of Jesus' words in Luke 9:50: 'If they are not against us, they are for us.' Fallaci calls herself a Christian atheist. An incongruity I would say. He was who he said he was or he was completely crazy. She is a freelance Christian, instead of relying on God, she relies on her own reason. And that's a lot of relying that brings only rage, a heck of a lot of rage. She also claims not to sympathizeneither with the Right nor the Left, and rejects any political classification other than a revolutionary (do you know any revolution without blood?). Another incongruity, I would say, unless you live in Heaven already. We on earth have to choose, and me as a conservative, would rather choose the less evil.I sympathize with her. I understand her rage. From the very first page you will know that you are up to something special. This ain't no ordinary book. This is not an ignorant person. It's a cultivated woman who knows what she's talking about, who suffered, and sees the injustices around but doesn't mince words. Oh. the rage! She is Achiles' intellectual counterpart.Her message, her warning is call to Europeans to stand up and defend our hard earned western civilization, our culture. We are giving in to Islamo-fascism, we are commiting suicide. The history that Fallaci pours in here falls with the force of a mighty Niagara. One has to become sad reading this. It reminds me also of Job, his complaining to his legalist friends about how innocent he is, about how unjustly he is suffering. He wants a fair trial with God, sure He will understand him and get him off the hook. Who is Fallaci cliaming to? Nobody. We are even lucky we got people like Jefferson, Washington, Hamilton (and maybe somebody in Europe), so few but made it possible today for us to critize freely and not being threatened with our lives. More than lucky!The letter she writes to an Italian Catholic prelate, a bishop who wouldn't bless the coffins of 19 soldiers killed in Irak, and said it pained him to witness the celebrations that took place in their honor, is well worth putting here: \\"If that Sunday Jesus Christ had had the misfortune to find himself (she doesn't capitalize Him) in the Caserta cathedral, his disdain for the temple's Pharisee merchants would have become a joke in comparison to his disdain for you. He would have kicked your assand thrown you out into the square, and here he would have smashed so hard your face that day that you would not even be able to eat a tomato soup.\\" And she is not a Christian. Amazing!In lack of a proletariat the neo-commies have fopund in the Arab masses their natural allies. This, in a few words, explains the tremendous success of the take-over of Islam in Europe, the craddle of Socialism (Nazi and Commy).What does not amuse me is Fallaci's irreverent dismissal of religions in general. Here's one comment on account of Abraham, in his role as the Founder of Israel: \\"Who wants a Founding Father who is ready to slit his own son's throat for the glory of some God?\\" Inadvertently given herself the answer: It is not 'some' God; it is the one and only God. But otherwise her question would be rightly put.There's a lot that she talks about in this book, but I think I understand her best when she points to \\"the presumption and assumption of holding the Truth (by the Left). Its dogmatism\\" as the unforgivable sin of the Left. Meaning this: They want to put us in an intellectual ghetto, where freedom of speech would be irrelevant, useless, since we would be outside society. It is a Holocaust ofthe soul.What good is freedom? Lenin once asked. Only Fallaci seemed to have enough rage to shout the answer back."},{"Title":"Force Of Reason","review":"This is a keeper.

There is ample evidence that Osama and the Muslim fanatics who plowed into the World Trade Center and the Pentagon on Sept. 11, 2001, have a much longer memory -- witness Osama bin Laden's early justification for the attacks, it appears he had in mind a date long, long ago and far away, namely Sept. 11, 1683, the high point of Muslim expansion into Europe at the gates of Vienna, Austria and militant Islam receded into centuries of despair and defeat. He simply restarted the millenia long jihad on 9/11/2001.And the Moslem Ottoman power, which at its height again threatened all of Western Europe, was barely turned back at the gates of Vienna on 11 September 1683 by a coalition of European armies. Incidentally, could there be a connection between 9.11.1683 and 9.11.2001, or is it just coincidence?11 Sept 1683 thus arguably became the most important forgotten date for Europe in its recent history.Iran is going to get the Bomb soon and change the Dynamics in the Middle East and once again the Persian Empire will be on the March....Read History !!!!...we are at the precipice ...The Israelis are NOT GOING TO WIPED OUT!!!...You can take that as a given ...What Oriana did with her Books was bring about an Awareness to the EVIL of MUSLIM EXTREMISM...The Jihad...She tells us thsi is not a new Phenomenon....it is the very ESSENCE to what ISLAM is about .....WORLD DOMINATION.....it is that SIMPLE."},{"Title":"Force Of Reason","review":"This book is written by a woman who actually lived through a take over by Islam in her native country, Italy. It is a warning to all who allow themselves to be brainwashed by the PC crowd into accepting encroachments by foreigners who intend to subjugate the entire world and enslave all cultures for a false god. This book may appeal to people who have no religion of their own. She freely admits she is not a believer in any religion. That is sad, but the way she sees Islam is from a secular view which cannot leave the reader thinking she is just a member of one religion who disagrees with another religion. In fact, Islam is more than a religion; it is a political-religious system that is brutal and uncompromising; intent upon destruction of all ways of life other than its own. A very chilling picture is presented, and one that must be taken seriously."},{"Title":"Force Of Reason","review":"There is a new section opening up in the libraries of the world. It will contain books on 'the Islamic threat to Western Civilization.' Bat-Yeor's 'Eurabia' was a pioneer, as were the works of Robert Spencer. Bruce Bawer, Andrew Bostom and later in this year Mark Steyn will have his chance to explain why 'old Europe' seems to be folding up and dying before the Muslim invasion.What then makes Oriana Fallaci's book of special value and meaning? For one thing she is a first hand observer, a European, an Italian journalist of worldwide reputation. Secondly, she has a personal story of the reactions to her previous writings on the subject, the attacks, the boycotting, the hatred, the efforts to silence her, the driving her from her native Italy to her current place of refuge in New York. A good part of this present book tells her own story and she is not shy about condemning those who sees as not simply attacking her, but betraying the West.As Fallaci understands it all the political forces of the West, the Left, the Right, and most surprisingly and painfully the Church have submitted to the Islamic onslaught. The Muslims speak openly about taking over Western Civilization, but anyone who dares to hint as Fallaci more than does about the superiority morally and culturally of Western civilization is called 'racist'.Defining herself as a 'Christian atheist' one who sees how strong a part Christianity has played in the development of Western Civilization she is appalled by the Church's apologetics and sniveling before Islam.From her new home in New York she sees the United States as the last hope of stemming the Islamic tide.At present gravely ill this book may be the swan song of one of the most provocative and courageous of modern journalists."},{"Title":"Force Of Reason","review":"There are two groups that are going to really hate this book. One are the Islamists who divide humanity into two groups: the People of Paradise and the People of Hell. And who insist that their beliefs alone are off-limits when it comes to critical inquiry. The second group is the multiculturalists and relativists, who do not find anything particular valuable in Western Culture over any other culture (including those who kill a daughter who has been raped to preserve \\"honor\\".)So who WILL like this book? Those who do deeply cherish Western culture as it has developed through the US constitution, who value the hard won freedom and autonomy of the individual, who believe that women are the equals of men and should be treated as so, and those who believe that humanity reaches its greatest heights when the human mind is left free.Make no mistake about it. Fallaci really really hates (my word) what is happening to her culture (an ongoing surrender to an immigrating, limiting Islam), because she really loves what Western Culture (via Locke and others) has been. And that passion comes in like a great blazing fireball. She is a real and authentic voice, with ragged edges, authenticity, fire, and conviction. The multiculturalists, pacifists, Islamists and others are doing everything they can to shut her up. But it seems that the strength of her fire only grows. The West is so lucky to have a woman like her. We need a thousand such voices, and even more. We need the passionate understanding of how wonderful our own culture is, and how it is worth preserving and fighting for. Read this book with While Europe Slept and you'll get a real education.Fallaci's The Force of Reason is a raw act of courage. And Fallaci is a great hero of our time.

Printed in Italy in February 2006, Amazon delivered my copy early in March, the ink hardly dry. Always fascinated by the woman and her work, I read it immediately.While the tale she tells is backed by the force of reason, it is best described as a rant, chapter after chapter. No matter. It is stimulating, curiously readable in her very unusual style of English, and a page turner. My God! What will she tell us on the page after this one? What we have here are facts and solid reporting by a life-long journalist --- plus unafraid analysis and commentary. Yes. Fascinating.Like THE RAGE AND THE PRIDE, this new book deals with the Muslim invasion of Europe and its facilitators. It describes a Europe of today such as you have never been told about before. The media and its mentors, peddling multiculturalism and political correctness, marginalize and silence anyone who would speak the truth about the transformation of Europe into \\"Eurabia.\\" Amplifying the consequence of current events, she paints a detailed historical background such as is never taught in the schools, here in America or in Europe. I read that facet of her work very closely, testing her veracity against my own knowledge of history. That I am familiar with much of what she wrote is only because of my own research for my books on Spain, Sicily and Greece ---- all of which had a Muslim \\"problem\\" for centuries. But while I dealt with that background comparatively bloodlessly, she goes for the gut.Oriana Fallaci describes a civilization committing suicide. Leading the way are what she refers to as the \\"Triple Alliance\\": the Left, the Right and the Christian Church. She writes in precise detail how the elite of all branches of that alliance sold out their people for the sake of cheap oil and cheap labor. I imagine the elite are sure that the maelstrom they are creating will resolve itself in a decade or two with themselves richer than ever and firmly in control as a global oligarchy. I doubt it. Their Arabic associates will deal with them the same as with the Gothic pretender in Iberia who conspired with the Saracen invaders for the defeat of the Gothic army, believing he would be handed the throne. But he was \\"disappeared\\" and his wife taken into the harem of the conqueror. The remainder of the surviving \\"elite\\" were marched off in chains, on foot across North Africa, to the slave markets of the middle east.What is \\"The Force of Reason\\" of which she writes? She sees that force as the only hope for rescue of not only Europe but also America from the \\"decline of intelligence\\" where thought is reduced to \\"recipes for atrophied brains\\" and truth is quashed by a Left which \\"clings to Islam,\\" a Right which seeks out economic and political advantage, and a Church which strangely aids and abets its own destruction.Perhaps the sole weakness of her work is that she allows the \\"elite\\" to remain behind the curtain, like the Wizard of Oz, as they pull the levers. The reader may overcome that shortcoming by going to HOW THE WORLD REALLY WORKS, by Alan B. Jones, for which I also wrote a review for Amazon."},{"Title":"Force Of Reason","review":"This is the second in Fallaci's trilogy. Her third book has not yet been translated into English. But this book gives us plenty to consider in the meantime. Fallaci's first book in this trilogy was the Rage and the Pride published in Italian newspapers shortly after 911 and then made into a very short book. There is still the rage from the first book, but now it is coupled to a powerful unrelenting reason making this book, in my mind, far more powerful.This book is significantly longer and delves into much greater depth in considering the Muslim problem. Fallaci speaks with a burning passion about the problems posed by Islamic supremacism. She presents a view of the Muslim threat to Europe in unambiguous terms undiluted by political correctness. And therein lies the rub for most of her detractors. Fallaci tells the truth and they can't handle the truth. It flies in the face of their cozy ecumenical multicultural world view in which all values are rendered equal by relativism. This of course is pure sophistry. Islam is a conquering faith that is spread by the sword. It's tradition teaches supremacism and subjugation of the infidel. She paints a very compelling picture of a \\"religion\\" committed to world domination.From the book: And whoever believes in the myth of moderate Islam should reread the stories of the burned convents and monasteries, of the profaned churches, of the raped nuns, of the Christian or Jewish women abducted to be locked away in their harems. He should ponder on the crucifixions of the Cordoba, the hangings of Granada, the beheadings of Toledo and Barcelona, of Seville and Zamora. (The beheadings of Seville, ordered by Mutamid: the king who used those severed heads, heads of Jews and Christians, to adorn his palace. The beheadings of Zamora, ordered by Almanzor: the vizier who was called the-patron-of-the-philosophers, the greatest leader Islamic Spain ever produced). Christ! Invoking the name of Jesus meant instant execution. Crucifixion, of course, or decapitation or hanging or impalement. Ringing a bell, the same. Wearing green, the colour exclusive to Islam, also. And when a Muslim passed by, every Jew and Christian was obliged to step aside. To bow. And mind to the Jew or the Christian who dared react to the insults of a Muslim. As for the much-flaunted detail that the infidel-dogs were not obliged to convert to Islam, not even encouraged to do so, do you know why they were not? Because those who converted to Islam did not pay taxes. Those who refused, on the contrary, did.\\"Fallaci speaks of the vitiation of the word peace by the so called \\"peace movement\\" who she calls opportunists \\"who mimic the one-way pacifism of Immanuel Kant and resort to war with brazen-faced impudence. They do it in the name of humanity, of course. And, more than often, waving a revolutionary flag. Because also a revolution is war.\\" Plato says that war exists and will always exist because it comes from human passions. Fallaci does not believ in the masochism of turning the other cheek. She declares unambiguously and proudly, \\"my war is right. Legitimate, dutiful, right. And it is not true that all wars are wrong. Sometimes they are right. Legitimate, dutiful, right.\\" Fallaci does not shrink from the challenge of critical and \\"reasoned\\" thought. She in fact establishes a heirarchy of values and unequivocally endorses the superiority of the Western world relative to that of the world created by the sons of Allah.The myth of the \\"moderate\\" Muslim is a diabolical politically correct canard forged on the anvil of \\"tolerance\\". And to the extent that we've accepted this monstrous invention we've allowed ourselves to become denuded and emasculated. Fallaci does not hesitate to point this fact out. That we still allow ANY Muslim to immigrate to this country is a testimony to our failure to understand the problem and a failure of will to solve this crisis.Make no mistake, Islam is a best understood as a hate cult with the capacity to destroy civilization. William Durant in his \\"The Story of Civilization\\" succinctly stated, [Islam is] \\"probably the bloodiest story in history.\\" He called it a \\"discouraging tale, for its evident moral is that civilization is a precious good, whose delicate complex order and freedom can at any moment be overthrown by barbarians invading from without and multiplying from within.\\" The bitter lesson, Durant concluded, was that \\"eternal vigilance is the price of civilization. A nation must love peace, but keep its powder dry.\\"A moderate Muslim is simply a lax Muslim who does not follow the prescripts and tenets of the Islamic \\"faith.\\" This in no way speaks to the issue of whether or not a viable moderate strain of Islam which rejects Islamic hegemony exists. It does not. The Koran is replete with commands to wage war against the infidel (non Muslim) wherever you may find them. There is simply nothing moderate about Islam.Alexis de Tocqueville said the following: \\"I studied the Koran a great deal. I came away from that study with the conviction there have been few religions in the world as deadly to men as that of Muhammad. So far as I can see, it is the principal cause of the decadence so visible today in the Muslim world and, though less absurd than the polytheism of old, its social and political tendencies are in my opinion to be feared, and I therefore regard it as a form of decadence rather than a form of progress in relation to paganism itself.\\"Today we are told that what is needed in the Middle East is democracy. This has become our mantra. But as \\"Spengler\\" from the Asia Times recently said, \\"Something more than democracy is required for peace and prosperity, and that is a people committed to good rather than evil. Democracy in the Middle East means something quite different: Hamas in Gaza and the West Bank, Hezbollah in Lebanon, the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt and Muqtada al-Sadr in Iraq. The sooner President Bush changes the subject, the better.\\"Fallaci has been stricken by cancer. And one would have thoght that her voice would be somewhat tempered by her debility. This is not the case. Quite the opposite. I got the impression that Fallaci has been liberated by her disease. Any restraints that she may have felt in the past (and believe me there were precious few) have been jettisoned and she pulls absolutely no punches.Fallaci has said: \\"I find it shameful and see in all this the rise of a new fascism, a new Nazism. A fascism, a nazism, that much more grim and revolting because it is conducted and nourished by those who hypocritically pose as do-gooders, progressives, communists, pacifists, Catholics or rather Christians, and who have the gall to label a warmonger anyone like me who screams the truth. I see it, yes, and I say the following. I have never been tender with the tragic and Shakespearean figure Sharon. (\\"I know you've come to add anotherscalp to your necklace,\\" he murmured almost with sadness when I went to interview him in 1982.) I have often had disagreements with the Israelis, ugly ones, and in the past I have defended the Palestinians a great deal. Maybe more than they deserved.\\"Oriana's is the voice of rage, the voice of pride, and now, even more so, the voice of reason. Her Italian pride and Western pride are evident throughout the book. Her pride in the rich cultural traditions of the West, that have been trampled upon and spit upon, literally, by the Muslims, is inspiring. Although Fallaci ostensibly rejects the Deity she invokes His name continually. And so I say, God bless Oriana Fallaci."},{"Title":"Force Of Reason","review":"I have been freshly baptized in the words of the canonized martyr of Freedom. The scales have fallen from my eyes, I have seen the error of my ways, said my mea culpas. Yes, I too have been libertarian to the point of license in my attitude to Islamic extremism. \\"What do you expect?\\" my old (now discarded) self used to say. \\"We support the European colonization of Palestine. We prop up repressive medieval sheikdoms because we are addicted to oil. It is business as usual for the imperial West. We deserve Arab rage.\\"Fallaci does not believe in turning the other cheek. She begins her diatribe with a vituperative and often hilarious summary of Islam's thousand-year military conquest of Christendom that was finally turned back at the gates of Vienna in 1672. But the Moslems are resurgent, she says, this time attacking not with weapons but with legions of fanatic, ferociously fecund immigrants who refuse to assimilate, who instead take advantage of liberal guilt to assert their cultural supremacy.What will Eurabia be like? Not much different to Saudi Arabia. This brave new world will look back on the Renaissance and the Enlightenment as Dark Ages. Free speech will be heresy. Brutal religious police will enforce Islamic law. Females will be second class citizens.A provocative, disturbing book. No wonder Fallaci is the most hated woman on earth - the price for not tolerating intolerance."},{"Title":"Force Of Reason","review":"And so the rage and pride gave birth to disdain, guided by reason. In the prologue, Fallaci reveals how the gatekeepers of political correctness have attacked her since the publication of her previous book, The Rage and the Pride. Politicians, academics and sections of the mass media joined in this choir of condemnation and she received insults and death threats from various quarters. But there was also an outpouring of support, mostly letters from ordinary people in Europe who expressed their gratitude for someone speaking on their behalf.What makes Fallaci's style so appealing is the blend of historical fact with eyewitness journalism. As a rhetorical device, she addresses a variety of contemporary and historical personages in the form of letters throughout the text. She scorns the peace activists, explaining why some wars are right and legitimate. In a blunt semantic shift, she now describes the shrill ensemble of politically correct \\"cicadas\\" as outright traitors and collaborators. She takes a swipe at the double standards and the hostile political climate in Europe as well as the hypocrites and fools at the United Nations.In chapter one she gives her assessment of the changing demographics in Europe where non-integrated immigrant communities have sprung up in most major cities. To counter the propaganda of the crusades as a sin of the West, she provides numerous examples of Islamic incursions into Europe before and after the crusades, including the 668 assault on Constantinople, the 711 invasion of the Iberian Peninsula, the attempted subjugation of France in 721 and the conquest of Sicily in 827. There were also the raids on the Italian coast and the Ottoman conquest of the Balkans. Sensitive readers must be aware that this section contains many graphic descriptions of the utmost cruelty. Finally, she draws a parallel between those early wars and the Islamic expansionism of today.Fallaci then takes us on a tour of Europe to show how bad things have become. She starts and ends with Italy and visits other countries in between. In France, there are cities where Maghrebis make up 30% of the population. She refers to the murders of Pim Fortuyn and Theo van Gogh in the Netherlands, and describes Spain under its current government as a hopeless case. But it is the UK that is the real strategic base sheltering the vanguard, and Fallaci even has harsh words for the singer Cat Stevens. She mentions Louis Farrakhan, Malcolm X and Muhammad Ali in the USA, recounting a frightening interview she had with the famous boxer.The author reproaches herself for not having seen the danger coming in the early 1970s. Drawing on the research ofBat Ye'or, she chronicles the sordid conspiracy between the then-EEC and Arab governments. It started after the Yom Kippur War and the OPEC oil boycott. In the form of the Euro-Arab dialogue, European academics and politicians, spearheaded by Leftists, have sold Europe's soul for oil and immigrants. With their servile attitude, they have betrayed the essence of our Western values. She also makes mention ofHaj Amin al-Husseini, the Palestinian leader that became an ally of Hitler.Fallaci identifies those who have sold out Europe as the Triple Alliance: the Catholic Church, the Right and the Left. The church stood by when terrible intellectual robberies took place, for example the appropriation of Judeo-Christian myths for the purposes of the enemy. Mourning the decline of the historical Italian Right of the Risorgimento, she calls it a noble lady that committed suicide. Before launching into the Left the points out the striking similarities between the extreme Right and extreme Left.Accusing the Left of dogmatism and intellectual terrorism, she shows how it embraced Khomeini in 1979 and how it has since fallen in love with Bin Laden and Saddam Hussein. She claims that the Left is not secular but is in fact an illiberal and totalitarian church under whose rule in the 1990s the number of immigrants to Italy increased exponentially. At the root of its Anti-Occidentalism is a profound and irrational hatred of the USA and Israel.In the Epilogue she diagnoses the death of reason in the West as caused by people too lazy to think. Here she provides further evidence of the onslaught on Western culture, talking of the fear of being free, the decline of intelligence and the decline of reason. Although the USA gives her hope, America alone is not enough to reverse the decay. Fallaci maintains that terrorism is just a strategy, that immigration is the real danger and that the enemy aims to destroy our very souls, our dreams, ideas and achievements.The Post-Script is the text of her speech on the occasion of receiving an award from the Center For The Study of Popular Culture on 28th November 2005. In it, Fallaci boldly states that she hates the Bin Ladens, Zarkawis, Ward Churchills,Noam Chomskysand Michael Moores of the world. She talks favourably of her meeting with Pope Benedict, expressing confidence in his understanding of the situation. Referring to the 2005 riots in France, she states that Left and Right are obsolete expressions since they are just two teams battling for power. She does not consider herself as either. Finally, she thanks those who persist in exposing the facts. Although they are criticized as dissidents, heretics and outlaws, she encourages them to pursue the battle of ideas, confident that truth will win in the end.The Force Of Reason is a tour de force, more measured than the previous book but not entirely devoid of her trademark fury and full of humour. In essence, the book is a comprehensive analysis of the perilous intellectual climate and alarming world events, a much-needed antidote to a set of widely held false beliefs, and an impassioned wake-up call to the West.Infidelby Ayaan Hirsi AliBecause They Hateby Brigitte GabrielNow They Call Me Infidelby Nonie Darwish"},{"Title":"Force Of Reason","review":"I often buy oranges at the market. I put them in a basket in the dining room. And when I feel thirsty, I get a knife and cut some of those oranges in half. Then I squeeze them, collecting the juice in a big measuring cup. I pour the juice into a glass. And without so much as diluting it with rum, gin, vodka, or even soda water, I drink that orange juice straight!I'm not sure why I like orange juice. Perhaps it's my Muslim ancestry. But there is no doubt about it. I'm an orange-juice-drinker. And according to Oriana Fallaci, that could make me appear to some folks to be part of the problem!In this book, as in the case of \\"The Rage and the Pride,\\" the barbarians are still at the gates of Europe (with many already inside). And that brings up an obvious question. Plenty of people have reacted very negatively to demographic changes. Whether it is Whites, Blacks, Asians, Jews, Christians, Muslims, or whatever, there will be people who complain that newcomers are polluting their neighborhood! In general, that is a racist attitude, but some folks feel that way. Is that what is going on here? Is Fallaci simply a racist who can't abide the immigration of Muslims to Europe?No.The problem is twofold. One is that many of the newcomers are a threat to peace and human rights (obviously, many are not, but that's not the point). That is a political issue, of course. But Europe has become rather liberal in recent times, and many of the new Muslim immigrants are reactionaries. If they try to reverse the clock and return us to a reactionary Europe, getting rid of the Enlightenment, then many Europeans (and maybe many non-Europeans) are facing a harsh future. That could be especially true for Women: the more reactionary Muslims show little respect for Women's rights.The second problem is the assault on truth. I think we humans fare poorly when we fail to value truth. And I think there is a serious attack on truth by many of the more reactionary Muslims.I'm a Pagan. And it certainly has not escaped my notice that most of Europe is Christian. Nor am I unaware of the history of Pagan-Christian relations for the past couple of millennia (for European Pagans, Christians were almost always a frightening enemy). But these days, possibly for the first time in many centuries, it's okay to be a Pagan even in Europe. If I do get criticized for my religious beliefs by a European Christian, it is probably going to be for not showing sufficient appreciation for Islam! And Fallaci shows us in detail the extent to which European Christianity has shown enormous reluctance to criticize reactionary Islam.At the end of the book, we get a bonus chapter: a speech that Fallaci gave in November of 2005. And she explains that she requires the right to love whom she wants, and, in addition, the right to hate whom she wants. And there are some folks she hates, such as Bin Laden, Zarkawi, various kamikazes, Ward Churchill, Noam Chomsky, Louis Farrakhan, Michael Moore, and their \\"accomplices.\\" As she puts it, \\"I do hate them as I always hated any murder of Freedom. It is my sacrosanct right. My sacrosanct duty.\\" She refers to some of them as \\"the new McCarthyists.\\" I can understand her feelings, and I think we all ought to read this book to gain a better appreciation of what risks European society is taking."},{"Title":"Force Of Reason","review":"Although this book was rushed into print with a rough and inelegant translation from the original Italian, it remains a powerful defense of Western civilization against the incursions of militant Islam into the heart of Europe and - to a lesser extent - America.Fallaci is scathing in her critique of the Western collaborators with, and facilitators of, that incursion - the Left-wing political parties, the bureaucrats of the European Union, the journalists and news media, the Catholic Church, and what Fallici calls the \\"caviar communists\\" of Hollywood. All of these forces have combined to create a climate of ostracism, fear, and even legal sanctions against anyone who protests the slow death of Western civilization via the infiltrations of Islam and the political correctness which accords Islam special privileges. (Unbelievably, Fallaci herself - seriously ill with cancer - faces trial, in Europe, for the \\"crime\\" of criticizing Islam.)Fallaci traces the current situation to policies formulated in the 1970s, when the leaders of Europe made a pact with Middle Eastern countries to guarantee extraordinarily favorable immigration status to Muslims in exchange for bargain rates on Middle Eastern oil. Thus, the Left literally bartered away Western civilization, a process that has new reached a critical moment. (When pondering the question of why the Left would make common cause with Islamofascism, Fallaci takes the unorthodox position that Nazism and fascism and communism are not mortal enemies, but rather quarrelling brothers in the effort to destroy Western, bourgeois civilization. In her view, which I agree with, fascism and communism have a great deal in common, and both are mortal enemies of classical liberalism, whose values are now often identified with modern conservatism and neo-conservatism.)Lied to and intimidated by their political and media elites, the European public had little idea of what was going on until it was almost too late; the public is finally waking up to the enormity of the problems raised by massive Muslim immigration, but few - if any - solutions are on the horizon.This book is an essential wake-up call to anyone who wants to defend the values of the West - the freedoms we cherish - against the growing menace of Islam. Fallaci does not believe there is such a thing as moderate Islam. There might be moderate Muslims - surely there are millions - but there is arguably no moderate or tolerant Muslim SOCIETY anywhere in the world. The tone of Islamic society - even in \\"secular\\" Turkey - is always controlled by the imams and mullahs and religious authorities, and they are never liberal or tolerant. The ultimate enemy, says Fallaci, is the Koran, the Mein Kampf of every Muslim terrorist. Selectively quoted by Muslim apologists, the book is an eye-opener for anyone who reads it in its entirety.Is it too late to stop the suicide of the West? Fallaci thinks so, but one wonders why, given her clear view of the enormity of the threat and the powerful forces arrayed against people such as herself. The forces supporting the Islamicization of the West are enormously powerful, especially in Europe, and voices critical of that process are all too rare, and face social ostracism and even death. But hopefully, the European public is waking from its slumber, and will finally take the steps necessary to preserve their way of life against the threat of Islamism.America has a significant role to play in that process, because there is much more intellectual freedom in America than in Europe. America has a strong conservative movement; Europe does not. Hopefully, Fallaci's example will encourage others to come forward and take the necessary steps to save Europe and the West from a slow slide into Islamic tyranny."},{"Title":"Force Of Reason","review":"Oriana Fallaci is the Rocky Marciano of Italian letters. To her, the best defense is a good offense. If you're pro-Islam you will hate this book. If you're anti-Islam you will love it. If you're sitting on the fence you're in for a rough ride.I've never read anything like this book. The pugnacious Ms. Fallaci picks you right up out of the crowd and drops you in the center of the ring where the fight is taking place. Her emotionally charged first person style draws you into her mind, heart and soul. You soon feel you are fighting for your very life, right alongside her.It's been years since I've read a book I just couldn't put down. Had to take a brief break for some pressing concerns and grabbed the book up again as soon as possible. Another stint of intense and exhilarating reading, and finally radical Islam was left reeling on the ropes.Winner by a knockout, Champion of Polemical Prose, Ms. Oriana Fallaci.ADDENDUMSept. 18th Obit Internet Post by David Horowitz on his website: \\"A great warrior is gone - Friday, September 15, 2006 9:21 AM Oriana Fallaci has died after a long struggle with cancer at the age of seventy-seven. Her last years were spent in the United States in part because she was hunted in her own beloved Italy because of her war against the Islamic jihad. A fatwa calling for death was issued by an Islamic jihadist; an Italian judge attempted to put her in jail for offending the invaders. She found refuge in the United States. But she also embraced America as her homeland in exile because she understood that America was the global center of resistance to the Islamic threat. The attacks of 9/11 inspired her. From her sick bed she wrote two polemics -- The Rage and The Pride and The Force of Reason which are clarion calls to action to defend the West. If we prevail in this battle to defend our civilization they will be remembered in the same way that Tom Paine's Common Sense is remembered as a summons to Americans to defend their freedom. Orianna Fallaci was a woman of unbelievable courage. We will not see her like again soon.

Does she overplay her hand or is she merely telling it as it is? Are Europe's leaders, especially in her native Italy, biased towards Muslim sympathies in opposition to Christian values? An argument not likely to be considered by Muslims or their leaders, though the Muslim side should take note that: 1. opposing and contrary views are inherent to the Western tradition, and 2. many non-Muslims in the West remain skeptical about Muslim claims to be a religion of peace, while their mullahs propagate ingorance and hateful attitudes to non-Muslims; that women are accorded merely partial human rights, depending on the degree of fundamentalist view; and that violent terrorism is an acceptable form of mediating political and social \\"grievances\\"."},{"Title":"Force Of Reason","review":"Oriana Fallaci, a famous journalist and former antifascist partisan, offers her fascinating views on Islam, its history, and the threats facing the Western civilization as well as her personal story that has become even more striking after the 9/11 attacks. For security reasons, Fallaci had to move to America, a country she views as the main hope of the Western civilization, and so do I, a citizen of the Czech Republic.During the last years, she became the target of many fanatical Muslims and their fatwas as well as their left-wing allies who have made her life in Italy virtually impossible: her identification with Master Cecco, a victim of the inquisition, is certainly justified. But it was cancer that ultimately killed this extraordinary woman last week.Much like Fallaci, I count myself as a Christian atheist. As most scientists, I appreciate the tough struggles between science and Christianity in which the Church was wrong. Nevertheless, these old disputes seem rather subtle in comparison with the outrageous recent attacks against the main principles underlying the Western civilization, including the power of reason and arguments as opposed to violence and intimidation. Why were the controversies relatively subtle?As the Pope Benedict XVI, who privately met Fallaci a few months before she died, recently explained in Regensburg, the God of Christianity is restricted by His own words and by the laws of logic and mathematics. Allah is not restricted by anything and his followers are not restricted either. They will do anything to spread their beliefs. This fact is magnified by the ambiguous relation between the Quran and violence. Fallaci explains in detail how the Muslim clerics in Europe - a part of the future Eurabia - teach their believers that they shouldn't be restricted by the local laws.Fallaci writes that the threat that the whole Western civilization faces is amplified by the political correctness and by multicultural utopists many of whom have openly become the fifth column of jihad. I have just read a shameful anti-papal (and anti-Fallaci) article in the Guardian and it looks really scary where we seem to be going.As Fallaci convincingly argues, the presence of Islam in the West is directly proportional to our loss of freedom. Her personal experience is captivating but it is not really new to me because I have been exposed to remotely comparable kind of pressure. Everyone who advocates a principle that is inconvenient for various groups of people that are presented as \\"suppressed groups\\" and especially for their inferior ideologies - even though these ideologies are really starting to control our lives - is immediately hated by a certain segment of the society and labelled as a racist. I know these things extremely well and it was refreshing to read stories from someone with a similar attitude.This new book as well as Fallaci's example should wake up millions of people and make them realize that if they won't actively try to defend the Western values against the pressure of an Asian religion and against the cancer of political correctness, the civilization as we know it could face a genuine risk of destruction."},{"Title":"Force Of Reason","review":"I think that Oriana Fallaci and similar minded people need to be heard. Basically she is tired of the debasement of Western Civilization and the unfounded extoling of alternative cultures. Much of her rhetoric is passionate and funny. In the end we are all human and it is our thinking and culture which set us apart. Western Civilization has done much bad throughout history; however, it has also done much that is good. To naively dream that all thinking or ideas are equally valid is utter nonsense. People should be respected but not dysfunctional behaviors. This is one of the major points that Fallaci makes. In addition, it is sad to hear some of her stories about the defacing of important historical buildings in Florence and other parts of Europe.

It puts Europe and all of the West squarely in front of the threat posed by extreme islam. Two years after \\"The Rage and the Pride\\" Fallaci writes a more balanced, reasoned text, a convincing, lucid and sharp analisis. The danger is great that we in the West, children of the Englightenment and Christianity, do not realize we risk losing what we have achieved in centuries of struggle, amongst numberless contradictions, and at a very high price, in terms of personal freedom and women emancipation. Fallaci calls herself a \\"Christian atheist\\", a thinking person who does not believe in god but recognizes the role of the Christian faith in the shaping of our identity.Islamica immigration poses a problem which has been tackled in many different ways in Europe, but in all countries the danger is that instead of a healthy integration we allow values and customs to take root which are incompatible with some of ourmost treasured ones, like freedom, tolerance, respect. Those values which made the West a success, and for which it is a magnet of immigration from all over the world.One of these values is the separation of Church and State. It took a long time to achieve, and in Italy we are not fully there yet, but this separation is totally incompatible with islam. Fallaci is not against immigration, but demands that immigration be coupled with integration.I don't know what will happen in the coming years, but the big question is if the great historical cycles can be controlled by our laws: Can we prevent Europe from becoming \\"Eurabia\\"? Or, alternatively, are we going to be victims of our own tolerance, which is not reciprocated by Islam?"},{"Title":"Force Of Reason","review":"This work is a reasoned and empassioned plea to the leaders and the people of Europe to wake up to the Islamist agenda to colonise them and impose their value system.

Fallaci described herself as a Christian atheist and was more of a defender of the \\"true faith\\" than its own hierarchy! \\"This Catholic Church without which the Islamization of Europe, the degeneration of Europe into Eurabia, could have never have developed. This Catholic Church that remains silent even when the crucifix gets insulted,\\" added the author.Fallaci rebukes the politically correct and cowardly European culture which is unwilling to combat Islam's racist, sexist, and homophobic doctrines. Fallaci quotes Denis Diderot's accurate description of Islam as \\"the enemy of reason.\\" The anti-intellectualism and contempt for secular learning pervading the religion of Mohammed cannot be disputed. What has the Muslim world accomplished in the last 400-500 years? Will its more militant adherents return us to the misery of the 8th Century? Are there any life affirming moderate Muslims? If so, where are they? Oriana Fallaci deserves a statue erected in her honor. Will her memory encourage us during our inevitable future trials and tribulations? I strongly believe that this will indeed be the case.David ThomsonFlares into Darkness"},{"Title":"Force Of Reason","review":"In this book, as compared with The Rage and The Pride, Oriana Fallaci seems to go back to her roots as a journalist in dangerous places, with additional enlivened roles as educator and mass psychologist.The writing is not what one might characterize as \\"disciplined\\" journalism, but it is awfully truthful. For that deviation, one can be grateful. It is only after a lifetime of experience that one can legitimately transform or reshape the rules of their profession, and in so doing, the writer gives us the nectar of her wisdom. The audience is largely European, but the implications for America are clear. Her analysis of personal and cultural courage rises above even the brilliant supporting longitudinal study of how grand-strategy victory and defeat in the clash of civilizations is carried out. The book looks at dire realities, but, for some of us, is ultimately inspirational."},{"Title":"Force Of Reason","review":"Chapters 11 and 12 are reason alone for buying the book. Oriana points out how the left in Europe has aligned itself with Muslims in their mutual quest for the destruction of Western society. This certainly explains what we see in America as those who would be first to be beheaded if Sharia were instituted are diligently working against the people who are trying to stop that from happening. Talk about self hate and a death wish. Oriana also criticizes the Catholic Church which apparantly in a misguided effort to help the poor are enabling the Muslim takeover of Europe by freely housing, feeding, and clothing the very people who deface Catholic churches and shrines. Essentially the institutions of Europe don't believe in the value of their own heritage and are complicit in bringing about cultural suicide."},{"Title":"Force Of Reason","review":"I lived and studied in France, so I can say with certainty that Ms. Fallaci is not lying, nor is she imagining things. Her book brought out emotions hidden deep inside. It made me angry at the whores who've given away our civilization, our culture, our way of life, to swine. She narrates how efficiently they have invaded our societies, and their true agenda for Eurabia. Make no mistake, This book will make you think. You will be presented with compelling evidence of their plans not just for Eurabia, but for the entire West. If you care about our civilization, about your children, and about the preservation of your most precious liberties, please take a week to read ALL of her books."},{"Title":"Force Of Reason","review":"Anymore, it seems rare to find an author willing to take risks like Oriana Fallaci does in \\"The Force of Reason.\\" Many political commentators are content to only half-engage issues, for fear of violating the sacred doctrine of political correctness. Not only does Ms. Fallaci engage the issues fully, she does so in a convincing and insightful manner. For her honesty, she has been labeled a political enemy by the European Left (or infidel, as militant Islamics would put it), and has been accused of fostering hateful and xenophobic feelings toward the Islamic people immigrating to Europe en masse.Ms. Fallaci's \\"offense\\" is that she presents the outrageous statements and demands made by Islamic leaders, alongside the spineless response of European bureaucrats, and cries foul at the ridiculous and self-depricating behavior of European leaders who simply acquiesce to these demands. She points out the incompatibility of radical Islam with the norms of civilized society -- tolerance, pluralism, peaceful integration of immigrants, and democratic methods of governing. She gives a glimpse into the methods Islam uses to govern (read that suppress) its people: the harsh imposition of Sharia law, denial of women's most basic rights, physical mutilation of women's sexual organs, the silencing of those who oppose Islamic beliefs, among other things. Outraged that Europe (a Europe supposedly committed to tolerance and civility) is failing to address the problems presented by the introduction of radical Islamic immigrants, Fallaci posits that Europe has forgotten its roots, lost its nerve, and is running scared in the face of Islamic terrorists and terrorist-sympathizers. Her book is a refreshing (if somewhat disturbing) demand for attention to the immigration problems facing Europe in the 21st century. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in cultural and demographic trends in Europe, as well as to those interested in the clash of Islam and Western society."},{"Title":"Force Of Reason","review":"I'll keep it short and simple. This is a must read for anyone concerned with the rise of Islam and its demands for special treatment inside of Europe. Muslims are immigrating into Europe and are not adapting for a reason. They don't want to adapt to Europe, they want Europe to adapt to Islam.Oriana lays it all out in an amazingly readable fashion. I must warn you, it will make you angry. But you must act on this anger. You must demand that it not happen in America.You must read this book to open your eyes as to Islam."},{"Title":"Force Of Reason","review":"Oriana Fallaci is a noble representative of rationalism: she speaks out, clearly and courageously, against the perils that Islam as a whole - and not just extremists, fundamentalists, and terrorists - present to humankind at the dawn of this new century. She represents, today, the most rigorous tradition for the struggle for human rights, against all prejudices.Anyone who believes in human progress and that human progress can only be achieved through freedom, reason, and scientific knowledge, must recognize the universal truth contained in this little book.But, of course, those inspired by dogmatism and darkness, will certainly misread Oriana Fallaci, taking misleadingly her voice for what she is definitely not - a racist, or someone blinded by hatred or superficial judgement.Sometimes, when so-called coincidences and crimes against humanity are too many, one should recognize that the most obvious explanation is the correct one.Time has come to say: enough is enough!"},{"Title":"Force Of Reason","review":"Excellent book , well researched , truthful , and an eye-opener ,historically exact , casts a light on the lying legends of the so called \\"gentle religion\\". Many books have been written about the Islamic goals of conquering the World , but only a few have had the success that the brave Oriana Fallaci has had in opening our eyes to the dangers now facing the World . Truly the pen of Oriana Fallaci has been stronger then the threats issued against her by those who want to suppress historical truths by threats and even murder."},{"Title":"Force Of Reason","review":"The Force of Reason is a controversial book by Italian author Orianna Fallaci. In it, Ms. Fallaci goes on the offensive against European Muslims, their leftist apologists, and even Islam itself. She makes it clear that she thinks Islam is a dangerous religion that is incompatible with western civilization. Although I found her use of Islamic history very one-sided, her contemporary observations and arguments are extremely eye-opening. If half of what Ms. Fallaci says is true, it is a sad day in Europe. She claims that Muslims are over-running the continent and rather than assimilating, they are attempting to change European culture in order to suit themselves. Clerics blatantly disrespect the native European culture, telling their followers that they have no obligation to submit to the laws of the land. Islamic law is all that matters. Some even openly call for the destruction of the west, and what's worse Fallaci says, is that anyone who speaks out against this madness is ridiculed and threatened into submission. As much as the Muslims themselves, she blames the left-wing governments and media of Europe, who are unwittingly contributing to the death of western culture, all in the name of \\"tolerance.\\" Ms. Fallaci herself is a victim of many death threats, and has been virtually ostracized from the European community because of her outspoken views on Islam. From some of the other reviews I got the impression that this would be nothing but an ignorant, hate-filled diatribe, but I found it to be insightful, compelling, and even humorous. While I don't agree with all of Fallaci's views, I commend her for this courageous work."},{"Title":"Force Of Reason","review":"Forget the mainstream media, talk radio, newsmagazines, and all the rest. If you truly want to understand what is happening to Western Europe and its obvious Islamization, read this book. Like me, I think you will be astounded to discover the degree to which the Muslim faithful and their piteously naive, or not so naive, Western accommodationists have collaborated to change the course of our civilization in ways few understand. Oriana Fallaci has been villified for her honest portrayal of events, subject even to countless death threats. She is no longer free to return to her native Italy because she may be arrested and imprisoned for writing and speaking painfully honestly. This book simply must be read and understood by anyone remotely concerned about the future of Western Civilization. Multiculturalists, be forewarned: you are in for powerful condemnation."},{"Title":"Force Of Reason","review":"Let me begin by stating most emphatically that based on what I know of the late Ms. Fallaci's reputation as a journalist and public speaker she had more courage under one of her little fingernails than legions of other writers will ever have in their entire cringing selves. I'll pile on by also stating that I largely agree with her views -- strident though they certainly are -- on many subjects, including the nominal subjects of this book: radical Islam and its infiltration of Europe. And Ms. Fallaci was nothing if not passionate and entirely devoted to warning the slumbering guardians of Western Civilization of their possible demise -- not to mention their complicity in the same.With that neatly out of the way, I can say without reservation that I found \`The Force of Reason' badly wanting. Reading page after passionate page of this tome reminded me of Emperor Joseph's admonishment to the giddy Wolfgang Mozart in \\"Amadeus\\": \\"You *are* passionate, Herr Mozart ... but you do not *persuade*.\\" Simply put, this is a rant. An unambiguous, heartfelt, take-no-prisoners rant, but a wild screed nevertheless and certainly devoid of what I'd call reason. Most of it reads like the transcription of a one-sided conversation -- and the translation from Italian into English is painfully bad. (To be fair, we're warned on this score: in a note \\"to the English-speaking reader\\", Ms. Fallaci takes full responsibility for the translation and admits it contains \\"a punctuation and a lexical choice ... which reflects ... my way of writing in Italian.\\" I don't read Italian well, but in English this reads like speaking rather than writing -- largely to its detriment.)Regardless, as with any good rant Ms. Fallaci often scores good points. Her historical knowledge of Arab (and consequently Islamic) incursions into Europe is superb and she pulls no punches when describing atrocities that are actually celebrated by modern apologists. Even when punctuated by glibness like \\"and do you know what happened next?\\" and \\"you think I exaggerate? I do not\\" her research is solid.Unfortunately, she doesn't support her other broadsides nearly enough. As mentioned, Fallaci's passion is obvious but there are few real arguments here -- much less clearly stated premises. If she wishes to prove \\"radical Islamists are systematically and conscientiously invading Europe for the purpose of overthrowing Western Civilization\\" (which I surmise is her approximate position), she needed to *say* that and clearly articulate her *reasons*. This lack of coherence is especially frustrating since by the end of this blast I'm certain Ms. Fallaci *has* reasons -- and possibly excellent ones at that. But she doesn't highlight them in any fashion and the conversational tone gives the points she does cover an anecdotal feel that doesn't build on any previous evidence. Lack of organization hurts her case as well: chapters are simply numbered and she compounds this confusion by referring back \\"to a previous (unnamed) chapter\\" which is basically impossible to reference.I never heard the late Ms. Fallaci speak but I understand she was quite good. (The last thirty-odd pages, a transcription of one of her last speeches, bear this out.) Based on this book's plainly \\"spoken\\" evidence I don't doubt her persuasive skills in this area. Nothing wrong with this per se, but as filling for an argument promising \\"the force of reason\\" I read it as a missed opportunity. The author was a brave, outspoken, under-appreciated journalist with plenty to say; with clearer arguments and better organization - and perhaps a bit less malice (though it's hard to begrudge her that) -- she would have sharpened the very important points in this book made significantly duller by her style."},{"Title":"Force Of Reason","review":"One of the best books without political correctness and leftist liberalism twists."},{"Title":"Force Of Reason","review":"Because of the author's style, the reader soon has the impression that the author is in a great hurry to get her words on paper, never mind the niceties of proper word breaks at the end of lines--no time for that. Her message is clear and unyielding; \\"why is no one paying attention to this threat?\\" She takes on all authority figures for turning a blind eye; while she is now deceased, history will show her influence or lack of same."},{"Title":"Force Of Reason","review":"She rages at islam. Not a balanced work but probably much of what she says is true"},{"Title":"Force Of Reason","review":"Informative and inflaming book, but I see no \\"reason\\" here. Maybe because of the bad rap her previous angry book received, she chose a more calm title, but the content is anything but."},{"Title":"Force Of Reason","review":"If you like polemic you will like Oriana's work.She lays out many of the crimes, slaughters, injustices of the Islamic expansion post Mohammad, year by year, country by country, century by century. She does so with force and eloquence and a great command of the sweep of history and geography. However, this is polemic, not research, not scholarship.Here is an example of the polemic:---------\\"From Spain, in 721 AD, they passed into the no less Catholic France. Led by Abd al-Rahman, the Governor of Andalusia, they crossed the Pyrenees and took Narbonne. There they massacred the entire male population, enslaved all the women and children, then proceeded towards Carcassonne. From Carcassonne they were to Nimes where they slaughtered nuns and friars. From Nimes they went to Lyons and Dijon where they pillaged every single church... And do you know how long their advance in France lasted? Eleven years. In waves. In 731 a wave of three hundred and eighty thousand infantry and sixteen thousand cavalry reached Bordeaux which surrendered at once. Then from Bordeaux it moved to Poitiers, from Poitiers it moved to Tours and, if in 732 Charles Martel had not won the battle of Poitiers-Tours, today the French too would dance the flamenco. In 827 they landed in Sicily, another target of their voraciousness. Massacring, beheading, impaling, crucifying as usual, they conquered Syracuse and Taormina the Messina and Palermo, and in three-quarters of a century (which is what it took to break the proud resistance of the Sicilians) they Islamized the island...\\"--------------------------In her work contextualization is weak and contrarian information is not presented or only tangentially presented (and yes, I will agree that most history books overemphasize those periods where muslim rulers well tolerated non muslims and, yes, most history books also fail to adequately cover the muslim slaughters of Hindus, the muslim slaughters of Bhuddists, etc).Ultimately it is a matter of taste. If you like anti islamic polemic, get this book. If you don't, don't."},{"Title":"Force Of Reason","review":"Oriana Fallaci is just another nut that is an Islamaphobe rascist. Obviously trips to Italy don't reflect her views in anyway. Italy, a mainly Catholic nation, is getting invaded by Islam? Yeah, right!Then again if you lived in Italy during the 70s you probably couldn't help but see what was going on. The nation had it's own internal terrorism from The Red Brigades and others, but soon it had international terrorist attacks within it's borders. Not to mention that with the Cold War then there was a wave of anti-American and anti-capitalism sentiment in the nation. Tuscany, where Oriana is from, was a stronghold or heart of the Communist Party movement. Heated arguements over politics went on from the tiniest villages to the largest cities all over Italy.There was talk that Italy was on the brink of civil war back then. I often wonder what happened to the Communist Party with the fall of Russia, and Oriana answered that question. Hate runs deep and is something that is passed on forever. The vendettas we think are a thing of the past are very much alive today.Oriana makes a brilliant observation when the sheik told her they have oil but they lack water back then. Perhaps we should have sold them water by the barrel and kept it $10 over the price of oil, instead of giving it to them for pennies.Oriana Fallaci is probably just a quack. Then why do current headlines talk about Muslim parties running for election in Italy wanting to make immigrants vote with less than a year of residence? Why in an April 6, 2006 article are Italian security saying they foiled two terrorist attacks? Elections are April 9-10. One was to bomb the subway in Milan. The other was at a basilica in Bologna(Tuscany) that has the dreaded picture.The website mentioned in the book has been hacked. They had to shut it down.Oriana Fallaci probably belongs in an insane asylum which would be a pity for those who have seen the obvious."},{"Title":"Force Of Reason","review":"I'm afraid that I find myself in agreement with her critics. Not, of course the ones who call her names and wish to torment her. The poor woman has obviously suffered enough, and responsible criticism does not abandon civility. I find, however, that her writings, in spite of the title of her book, have little of reason in them and amount to no more than a racist tantrum. I think she has a very poor grasp of history (or is willing to distort it shamelessly to advantage her argument in complete disregard of a more balanced truth) and laughed out loud at her claim that Napoleon was a lover of the republic as the most cursory investigation of his rise to power would show to be nonsense. Unfortunately there are far too many these days who have not even the most cursory acquaintance with the facts of history and it is these, one presumes, who make up her intended audience.It is interesting that she begins the book with the story of Cecco and the inquisition. She makes much of the fact that Secco was correct in the essentials of his world view but seems to completely miss the point of the barbarity of the inquisition. It matters very little that one or more individuals who fell victim to the inquisitors happened to be right in their views. The inquisition was condemnable on its methods alone. Even if Mr. Secco had been lost in the deepest errors of untruth, neither he nor anyone else should ever have had to suffer the inquisitors, as Ms. Fallaci should know. The inquisition, in the final analysis, was not about being right or wrong, it was about being inconvenient to power.Ms. Fallaci tries to paint a picture of herself inconvenient to power, in the same position as Secco, but the combination of her self pity and her self aggrandizement fail to arouse sympathy. One merely waits for her to get through with her emotional troubles and present some kind of rational argument, some reasonable thesis and evidences. This she never does, betraying the title of her work. As for her courageous stand against power... she has aligned herself with the most powerful nation on the planet and far from speaking truth to power, preaches the gospel of the powerful to the masses. Hardly the position Secco found himself in. This is brought home by her speech at the end accepting an award of the right wing Center for the Study of Popular Culture. Being feted by Horowitz and his ilk, firmly in the camp of the currently powerful, supporting Mr. Bush and attempting to clear the way for a further move to the right of this already extreme right wing faction while branding her enemies as fascists... Well, it is understandable that some people respond to this sort of outrage with rage. It is deplorable, yes, but understandable."},{"Title":"Force Of Reason","review":"I used to admire this woman. She was smart. She inspired me when I was young. It is a shame, however, to see her intellectual decline in her last years. Was this the effect cancer had on her brain? First, I can't understand how a book written with more heart and passion than brain and analysis can be called \\"The Force of Reason.\\" She appeals to our feelings and fears more to our rationality. Second, she conviniently chooses historical events that only prove her point sometimes ignoring undeniable facts. For instance, she quietly forgot the role of Christianity in the Conquest of the Americas and the slaughter of the Indian races. Or the role religion played to justify the worst atrocities of the European powers. And what about the survival of Catholicism in Spain in spite of eight centuries of Muslim domination? Yes, there were churches and synagogues in Muslim Spain. This manifesto doesn't look very different from those fascists wrote about Jews in Europe in the 1930s.

ALL religions have their faults and fanatics.....It is sad to see once great mind deteriorate so sharply."},{"Title":"Force Of Reason","review":"This book is a well written expose of what is wrong with Europe and much of the West, including the leftists in the USA. While the EU has many rules regarding social behavior, none of them are enforced when it comes to Islamic practices of polygamy, female genital mutilation, \\"honor\\" murders of family members, and other such barbaric customs now infecting the West. Fallaci shows the hypocrisy of many Western politicians who talk about \\"multiculturalism\\" but file charges against her when she protests the evils of Islamofascism. She points out that this is a culture war which the West is losing because it is abandoning its culture as hard-fought rights are lost to those who prefer the tenets of the Prophet and his followers who command jihadists to kill the infidels wherever they are found.One of the more interesting parts of this short book is her conversation with a former leader of the Italian fascists who instantly became a Communist leader after WW II without missing a beat in supporting totalitarian regimes of the Eastern Block, and fighting to introduce Communist hegemony in Italy.I can see why she had so many death threats from the Left all over Europe since she keeps talking about reality and ugly facts instead of utopian pipe dreams while Rome, and most other cities in Europe, burn with Islamist fanaticism."},{"Title":"Force Of Reason","review":"This is an eye-opening book. Oriana Fallaci is Cassandra speaking to the wind, while the herds of Europeans and Americans are sleeping in their naivety or stupidity.The old Kazakh legend about Mankurt in the book of Chingiz Aitmatov tells that Mongols, when conquering the lands, slaughtered the soldiers and enslaved the survivors by taking away their memory. They shaved their heads and wrapped it tightly in thick freshly cut belly piece of the ram's skin. Victims then were left chained under the burning sun, while skin dried, squeezing their heads, and had they survived (one from ten) - they have become the morons, Mankurts. All physical abilities were perfect, but no memory and full subordination to master.But it looks nowadays that Mankurts could be made even without any visible violence. The book of Oriana Fallaci tells you how this is done today in the \\"democratic Eurabia\\" or USA.This book is the chance not to become a Mankurt.

In a way, it is to be regretted that not only was she aware of her impending death, but that she decided to do her own English version. Fallaci's English was not up to the task and, as a result, the book is an unnecessarily difficult read which will understandably put many people off.Too bad because Fallaci's message is important. Fallaci correcetly perceives the menace of Islam in Europe. She recognizes the mass migration of Muslims and their refusal to assimilate as an invasion intended to conquer Europe. She laments, loudly and shrilly, the craven cowardice of the politically correct left. What really infuriated Europe's so-called liberals was Fallaci's tracing of their history back through their origins as socialists, fascists and communists. Fallaci distinguishes between the \\"left\\" of pre-Bolshevik days and the \\"left\\" that emerged after WWII and predominates in Europe today.Fallaci engages in a lot of self-referential comments, talking about her \\"martyrdom\\". She was badly treated by the intellectuals in Europe who did not like her message. Her self-pity is understandable, but a distraction.Fallaci's message is simple in the end: \\"The decline of intelligence is he decline of Reason . . . Refusing to admit that all Islam is a pond inside which we are drowning, in fact, is against Reason.A\\"Fallaci provides more than ample evidence of her latter point which proves the former.

Unfortunately the book is marred by really terrible English and words that she has obviously made up.It should get wider distribution and more readers, but the language really needs to be cleaned up so that it is intelligible at first glance.Ms. Fallaci does, however, point out one serious problem with us liberals. We like to think that everyone wants to live in a world of live and let live social norms. That is not true and one only needs to look at the history of Islam in every country where it is the dominant religion. Live and let live along with pluralistic democracy are utterly alien to the Islamic mindset and value system.I'm afraid that liberals are still willing to give the rope to their enemies with witch their enemies will be more than happy to hang them.

Loomis, by pouring through old documents and by meticulous research, has an uncanny way of recreating the past in all its subtle details. This book shows how Marie Antoinette was vilified by her friends, some family members, and by her host country (France), and more significantly, how her spririt became more courageous and fortified as she endured extreme hardships unto her execution. Loomis retraces all the details of her and the deposed king's attempted escapes, from the flight to Varennes under the plan of Count Ferson, to the foiled plot to sneak the queen and her child out of prison. Loomis exposes the truth behind the queen's sequestered love affair with Count Ferson, and her own Austrian family's betrayal of her. Loomis does a fantastic job in showing us King Louis XVI as well- his kind nature in the face of his adversarys (which up to the end he refused to see as his enemies, but maintained that he &quot;would not cause a drop of blood to spill from my subjects&quot;), and his ultimate martyrdom by those he sought to understand. King Louis XVI should be given the accolades befitting a Saint. Loomis' creative command of vocabulary instills his writing with top-notch character descriptions and sometimes with more philosophical questions and ideas. But this book is not pedantic or just for the bookmarmish French history types, it is exceptionally entertaining and highly recommended. For another excellent book by Loomis, please read &quot;Paris In the Terror&quot;! You will not be disappointed with either of these!"},{"Title":"The Fatal Friendship, Marie Antoinette, Count Fersen, and the Flight to Varennes","review":"Friends, do yourselves a favor and get this book if you're interested in an unbiased, accurate account of the relationship between the last queen of France and the handsome, (and rather conceited), Swedish count. Recently author Evelyn Farr has taken up the subject, under a title that leads one to believe she has uncovered new and startling information regarding the &quot;star-crossed lovers&quot;: &quot;Marie Antoinette and Count Fersen, the Untold Love Story&quot;. Spare yourselves the 40 odd bucks that this tissue of fantasy and conjecture will set you back. I have posted a review of Farr's book accordingly, which you may consult for further details. Suffice it to say, Loomis does the job expected of a fine historian...he writes with a passion for his subject without sacrificing accuracy. Loomis has no problems sharing his personal opinions regarding the subject matter, but he has the decency to claim them solely as his own. For an intimate sketch of the Terror and its effects on leading figures of the Revolution, you may also want to check out his &quot;Paris in the Terror&quot;. A delight to read...but then, I expect nothing less of Loomis."},{"Title":"The Fatal Friendship, Marie Antoinette, Count Fersen, and the Flight to Varennes","review":"I read everything I can get my hands on about Marie Antoinette, and this was the best biography of her. Well-written, entertaining, objective, I could go on and on. Really a pleasure. The account of the flight to Varennes was so suspenseful, even though we all know the outcome."},{"Title":"The Fatal Friendship, Marie Antoinette, Count Fersen, and the Flight to Varennes","review":"From reading the descriptions, you'd think this book is about Marie Antoinette friendship with Ferson and his life and times. The vast majority of text in this book centers around Marie Antoinette and Louis XVI, about 90% of the text. While the prose is pleasant to read, it adds nothing new. Those looking for new insight into Marie Antoinette through the relationship of her best friend and confidant will learn nothing new. While Marie Antoinette's life has been covered in great detail in so many other books, we know so little about Ferson. He was an active seducer of prominent ladies across Europe, was witness or participant in many great European events as ambassador, and surely lived some great tales. Unfortunately, this book doesn't really develop the fascinating life of this gentleman, so you're left with a good story the same old story of Marie Antoinette that's already been told a hundred times elsewhere."},{"Title":"The Fatal Friendship, Marie Antoinette, Count Fersen, and the Flight to Varennes","review":"Once again Stanley Loomis takes us there- to the time of the Great French Revolution, and before, but this time to the side of Marie Antoinette and Louis XVI. Loomis, by pouring through old documents and by meticulous research, has an uncanny way of recreating the past in all its subtle details. This book shows how Marie Antoinette was vilified by her friends, some family members, and by her host country (France), and more significantly, how her spririt became more courageous and fortified as she endured extreme hardships unto her execution. Loomis retraces all the details of her and the deposed king's attempted escapes, from the flight to Varennes under the plan of Count Ferson, to the foiled plot to sneak the queen and her child out of prison. Loomis exposes the truth behind the queen's sequestered love affair with Count Ferson, and her own Austrian family's betrayal of her. Loomis does a fantastic job in showing us King Louis XVI as well- his kind nature in the face of his adversarys (which up to the end he refused to see as his enemies, but maintained that he &quot;would not cause a drop of blood to spill from my subjects&quot;), and his ultimate martyrdom by those he sought to understand. King Louis XVI should be given the accolades befitting a Saint. Loomis' creative command of vocabulary instills his writing with top-notch character descriptions and sometimes with more philosophical questions and ideas.

I found it very interesting. It answered many of the questions I've had reguarding Marie Antoniette's life. Mr. Loomis is a very good writer, he has done a great deal of research on the Queen of France as well as Axel Fersen. I am going to keep this book which for me says alot."},{"Title":"The Fatal Friendship, Marie Antoinette, Count Fersen, and the Flight to Varennes","review":"This book is a real page turner!

I am extremely happy with my copy of this book."},{"Title":"How to Draw Manga: Occult & Horror","review":"This is an excellent book for those who have basic artistic skills. There's plenty of stuff to get ideas off of, such as the Griffin, Chimaera, etc... It tells about the \\"moods\\" of the background in a demonic scenario.Other things included in this book are: zombies, ghosts, and fictional monsters. But there's also ways to turn a \\"conventional\\" character into a demonic-like one, such as sharpening the eyes a bit, or changing the pupils to make your character look psychotic.One of the things I really loved about this book was the \\"bitten-off limbs\\" section. It shows dramatic cuts, non dramatic cuts, faces being partly bitten off, etc...The cover, however, is quite misleading. If you're looking to draw \\"Nekos\\" (catwomen) like the one shown on the cover, you're better off looking at \\"How to Draw Manga: Bishoujo/Pretty Gals\\" and its counterpart, \\"How to Draw Manga: More About Pretty Gals\\"I highly recommend both, by the way.Long story short, this book is great for people who just want ideas or something to draw off of, or maybe even incorporate horror and mecha. Possibilities are endless. Your imagination's the limit."},{"Title":"How to Draw Manga: Occult & Horror","review":"These specific themed books are wonderful as references and Occult & Horror is no different from the rest. Hayashi once again covers a wide variety from human monsters, standard monsters, animal monsters, and how to create the mood necessary for a successful horror manga.This book is not for the faint of heart. The zombie was fantastically grotesque and there is a section on drawing dismembered body parts which may be unsettling for some folks. Not to mention the cool ghost scenes and other... umm yeah, if you don't like creepy stuff, then this book isn't for you. Otherwise, this book is mostly for reference."},{"Title":"How to Draw Manga: Occult & Horror","review":"Im sure all of you manga artists out there have probably heard of the \\"how to draw mang\\" series, although most of the books are for experts a begginer such as myself can learn a whole lot out of a book like this. The book concentrates on things like monsters and gosts ect.. The book shows some background techniques (very important) and as another reveiwer said there are a lot of RPG character ideas. The bad side: None of the how to draw manga series shows how to draw manga step by step if the book showed step by step it would definetly earn its 5th star. Although I must admit it is sometimes fun just copying the pics. It may seem expensive but trust me its worth every penny. for those who like step by step then perhaps a Christopher Hart book may be best for UThanks for reading my review !!"},{"Title":"How to Draw Manga: Occult & Horror","review":"Don't let ANYONE fool you. The books at this level of &quot;How to Draw Manga&quot; series are not for beginners. Don't let anyone come and tell you that you'll get step by step instructions...because you won't. Especially not in this book.BUT WAIT! Don't go off just because of that. This book isn't so much about walking you through things as it is about giving some EXTREMELY useful tips. While using this book I found myself looking back and saying...&quot;Wait I ALREADY DO THAT!&quot; And by paying attention to the techniques I was using for the genre unconciously I was able to refine and get better! If your interested in Occult, Horror, Fantasty, and magic based comics I'd suggest this book greatly. It's a nice RESOURCE.Buy it as soon as you can. Just don't expect to have steps taken with you. This is a &quot;Look at us do it and now YOU do it.&quot; Also for you strict pencillers out there, some of the inking techniques in this book can be applied to you.

When the book came in was exstatic. This book is very indepth and a great refrence book for anyone looking to learn how to draw zombies and witches and monsters and the like.

This book is probably the worst book in the series, and the cover is very misleading. If you're looking for a how-to-draw book on cat girls with big boobs, this is not the book. At some point in the book me and my sister were looking through, and we came across a huge spider. Me, being aracnaphobic screamed and started to cry. My sister had to rip out the pages that contained spiders. So if you're afraid of spiders, please watch out.Another thing is that some of the mythical creatures' info is not at all accurate. When there is a Kelpie, and they are describing it, is says that it's part of British legend, but in fact it's from Irish.One more thing that bothers me is that the title CLEARLY says \\"How to Draw Manga\\" but in fact it doesn't teach you how to draw at all. It just shows pictures, and there is no slep-by-slep.This book is occult, but it is not how to draw. And the cover has NOTHING to do with the book.I will admitt that this book was very fun to draw on, and make mini-comics out of it. But overall, this was not a good book and I do not reccomend it."},{"Title":"How to Draw Manga: Occult & Horror","review":"As mentioned by other reviewers, this book is not a step-by-step instruction manual. If you are a beginner, this series of books isn't nearly as helpful as the &quot;How to Draw Anime and Game Characters&quot; 5 book series which will provide you with a basic foundation to work with.If you are past the beginner stage, it is an excellent reference with some good pointers and tons of information on Japanese mythology.The only major complaint with this book is the English isn't clear sometimes and there are numerous grammatical errors. There are a few instances in which ideas just aren't communicated clearly.Although I must say I was generally disappointed when I received this book, I do find it to be a useful resource and I will definitely be hanging out to it."},{"Title":"How to Draw Manga: Occult & Horror","review":"I got this book pretty much based on the front cover, I have to say.

One thing though, there were some cool sections about Japanese mythology and monsters.I do like this book, it just wasn't as good as I hoped. I still look through it when I'm drawing, but I think only one picture (chibi devil girl) actually has any elements from this book."},{"Title":"How to Draw Manga: Occult & Horror","review":"By the look of the cover you'd expect to be drawing vampire queens or ghoulish gilrs but instead it tells you how to turn a paper lantern in a ghost.

This is an exciting anthology. It has articles (and D's responses to them) by McDowell, Stroud, Higginbotham, Rorty, and other notable philosophers. The strongest material here is probably that which encounters Davidson's work in the phil. of mind and action (akrasia, rationality, etc). For me, Stroud's (on radical interpretation) and McDowell's (on the scheme/content dualism) respective articles here are the most intriguing. But I must say, Davidson's biographical material is also a fun and interesting read.Notable articles: Quine, \\"Where Do We Disagree\\"; McDowell, \\"Scheme Content Dualism and Empiricism\\"; Stroud, \\"Radical Interpretation and Philosophical Skepticism\\"; Tom Nagel, \\"Davidson's New Cogito\\"; Burge, \\"Comprehension and Interpretation\\"; Rorty, \\"D's Mental-Physical Distinction\\"; B.

Their impressive and enigmatic rock art and architectural ruins are well known, but the arid Four Corners climate has also preserved such artifacts as loomed clothes, intricate baskets, and sandals. This book is the most comprehensive volume on Anasazi sandals and weaving technique. Three hundred twelve examples from the extensive holdings at the Utah Museum of Natural History demonstrate the Anasazi genius as skilled textile artists. These examples incorporate colorful geometric patterns and reveal elaborate manipulations of warp and weft. Within the relatively rigid requirements of size, shape, and function, the ancient sandal weavers created almost as many decorative expressions as there are recorded specimens. The impact of the sandals as a group is emotionally and aesthetically powerful - a tribute to the Anasazi sandal weavers. [The color photos are amazing and detailed.]"},{"Title":"Plantation Parade the Grand Manner in Louisiana SIGNED","review":"I've had this book since 1962 and when Katrina washed away the first one, I bought a new one from Amazon. This is a GREAT book for those that want to travel River Road from Baton Rouge to New Orleans (or vice versa)to see the plantations and the ruins of some plantations. The way the book is written, with a map, is VERY helpful in finding all the old homes, some of which are now bed and breakfasts and others that are simply open to the public. Some, of course, are just private homes. I like the way that Mr. Kane writes such as, \\"...and 2 miles farther down the road on the right you will see...\\" as he gives distances between each plantation, etc. He also tells that when you see an avenue of old oak trees, they lead from the Mississippi River (or where it WAS at that time) to a plantation that may or may not be there now. It's fun to read the stories of each plantation before taking the trip so that you know the history of each and can be reminded of each history if you have your book with you, which is a must! You need to read the other review on this Amazon site for more information. It is a truly wonderful book that I'd love to be able to give as a gift to many people interested in the old way of life and the plantations. There have been several movies made in and around these plantations and at least one (maybe more, can't remember) is mentioned in the text. Our favorite of the mansions is Ashland/Belle Helene where Clark Gable, Sidney Poitier and Yvonne de Carlo made the movie, \\"Band of Angels\\". Another of many filmed in these plantations was \\"Hush, Hush, Sweet Charlotte\\" filmed at Houmas House, the site of many.

The book's various segments focuses on various aspects of these lesbian midlife issues in a very informative and entertaining way. Particularly notable is the segment entitled \\"Lesbian dating and courtship from young adulthood to midlife\\". It was extremely interesting and brought up quite a few points about the way women, in particular lesbians, perceive courtship and dating and the roles people play.

I only read the section which interviewed the lady from South Texas on Mexican American cooking. But I came across enough errors, to indicate that the journalism was pretty sloppy, at least in this section. Errors which should not have been made and which could have been avoided by checking a couple of sources and coincidentally would have made for a more interesting story.Example 1: &quot;Taco&quot; is defined as a snack. The word taco comes from &quot;wedge&quot; or &quot;wad&quot;, the wadding such as was used to stuff a cannon or rifle. Because tortilla tacos were originally soft and round, well, you can see how you'd get to the image of stuffing a wad of food into your mouth.Example 2: A little research would have turned up that enchilada is a shortened form of tortilla enchilada, &quot;chili'ed tortilla&quot; in other words. They shouldn't have missed this one.Example 3: The dicho for &quot;como el agua para chocolate&quot; is completely wrong."},{"Title":"Eats: A Folk History of Texas Foods","review":"I agree with the other reviewer.

Sad when it ended. Wonderful story. Mrs. Trapp had a great take on life. Inspiring, and a fun read many times over the years."},{"Title":"THE STORY OF THE TRAPP FAMILY SINGERS","review":"I bought this book at the intermission of the Sound of Music musical I recently attended. I was curious how closely the musical followed the true story. The book quickly covers the material in the musical then focuses primarily on the family's adjustment to America. It covers the years of their touring and their eventual settling in Stowe, VT.The musical, of course, takes some artistic license with the story, in order to heighten the drama and tension. For example, the father isn't really so cold towards the children in real life (but he does use a whistle to call them!). The children's names in the story are different too. The escape from Austria does not involve scaling mountains. Unfortunately, the book barely covers this part at all - in fact, it is covered in a few sentences told in flash back during a family meal on the boat to America. I don't understand why it was written this way when other parts of the story were covered in such detail.The book was very much from Maria's point of view (of course, she wrote it!), and I did not get a strong sense of the personalities of the other family members. Another difference from the musical - Maria and Georg have 3 children of their own for a grand total of 10 children! Maria portrays herself very positively - she is cheerful, pious, optimistic, and indefatigable. She does not cover her past much at all. The book pretty much starts where the musical does.The book, at its core, is an immigrant story. The family was a bit atypical in that Maria and Georg had been rich in Austria (in fact, a Baroness and Baron), and the family was a professional singing group. However, much of the story is similar to other immigrants - the struggles with language, cultural differences, and a lack of money. It is fun to read of their introduction and adjustment to New York City.The Trapp family worked very hard to make it as a singing group - they were by no means an overnight success. The element that was holding them back was a lack of stage presence. Finally, one night a fly flew down Maria's throat during a performance and when she mentioned it to the audience, they burst out laughing and the ice was broken. It was not an easy life traveling with so many children (and so much luggage!). I felt exhausted just reading about all their tours and travels through the U.S. The book covers how they finally settled in Stowe, VT on a farm where they had to build a house almost from scratch. They also established a summer music camp there which was very successful. I enjoyed reading this part because I have been to Stowe and even to the Trapp Lodge.All in all, it was an entertaining story. I got a very positive portrayal of a strong, hardworking family full of love for each other. The family was enterprising with an admirable \\"can-do\\" spirit - a real American success story. One of the daughters wrote a book as well, which I hope to read."},{"Title":"THE STORY OF THE TRAPP FAMILY SINGERS","review":"I just returned from Salzburg, Austria and had to download her book. I previously read &#34;Maria&#34;, and bought a book about the family while I was in Salzburg, but it was not written by her. What a difference! What a remarkable family. My only regret was that I still want to know more. What a wonderful read especially during the Holiday season. This family had to defy remarkable odds just to get to the USA and even more odds to stay here and earn a living. You will love it."},{"Title":"THE STORY OF THE TRAPP FAMILY SINGERS","review":"So good to hear the real story. Loved the details and characters. I was inspired by Maria's determination and the family's ability to adapt to difficult situations. What an incredible family!"},{"Title":"THE STORY OF THE TRAPP FAMILY SINGERS","review":"This, Maria's story, is truly delightful & gives such a wonderful background story for \\"The Sound of Music\\". This enlarges on an already awesome experience. Graham Stephens, M.D."},{"Title":"THE STORY OF THE TRAPP FAMILY SINGERS","review":"The book's always better than the movie, right? Well, in this case I'd say they're both pretty close. This is the true story of Maria Von Trapp - how she met her captain and how the Trapp Family Singers became world famous. Maria is a feisty character. You can see why the beginning of this book became a stage play and the greatest musical of all time. You'll see the differences in the true story versus the movie. You'll wonder why some of the best parts were left out of the movie. You'll laugh out loud and you'll enjoy Maria's singular writing style. If you love \\"The Sound of Music\\", you must read this book!"},{"Title":"THE STORY OF THE TRAPP FAMILY SINGERS","review":"When I started this book I expected to discover that the film is very different from the reality of the Trapp family. I was surprised to find that much of the film is accurate. Notable changes/omissions in the film are the children's names, the date of Georg and Maria's marriage, dealings with Hitler and the Nazis, the family's devout religious practices, and the \\"escape\\" from Austria. Much of the book deals with the Trapp family's struggles and triumphs in America. In its Biography of the family, A & E tv implies that Maria paints a rosy picture in this book and glosses over some of the darker chapters in the family's life. I did not find that to be the case. I feel that Maria tells her story, warts and all. You will love learning about Georg's first wife, the true story of leaving Austria, Maria's effort at grasping English, the fascinating religious rituals, and the recurring reality of how music truly saved their lives."},{"Title":"THE STORY OF THE TRAPP FAMILY SINGERS","review":"The Sound of Music is my favourite film I have seen it at least 25 times. But when I read the real story I liked it more. I think Maria was a great woman who kept the family together with her love. It was the most important thing for her. When I am sad and fed up with all the things around me I always read the book /of course only parts of it/ and after reading I always feel better. It is One Of My Favourite Things! I would recommend to everybody to read it. It is about love and history."},{"Title":"THE STORY OF THE TRAPP FAMILY SINGERS","review":"In the late 1960s, when I was maybe 9 years old, my mother let me ditch school to attend a lecture by Maria von Trapp. I'm guessing that the author was promoting a newer edition of her book at the time. She struck me as an opinionated, very strong personality, but one who had twinkling eyes and who encouraged me to continue my piano lessons. The baroness autographed my EZ-Play &quot;Sound of Music&quot; piano book, but sternly made sure that I realized that the movie was not REALLY what her life was about--that it was just Hollywood stuff. When I grew up and became a music teacher myself for 15 years, I wish I'd remembered this book, because I would have recommended it to every student of mine. I just found this copy in an antique shop, but THIS one won't be recycled or resold!What comes through on every page is the dedication to a will and purpose higher than any human's will. This was not meant to be a &quot;religious&quot; book, but a history of a family who made a huge difference in the world by their faithful service to God. Being willing to work hard, submit their discomfort or inconvenience to God's will and have Him turn it into great blessings and lessons for the family and indeed the world, are truly building blocks of faith, hope, love, and encouragement.In addition, the stories of the family's dedication to their profession and the pursuit of excellence are inspiring. To attain such stature and not have one's nose in the clouds is an accomplishment in itself! (Ever meet a music scholar or highly-educated performer? The humble ones are few and far between.)I agree with the other reviewers that Maria probably was the Captain of the family, but look what happened to a country peasant girl who was truly noble, not just assigned the title!"},{"Title":"THE STORY OF THE TRAPP FAMILY SINGERS","review":"This book was truly an inspiration to read, seeing the hardships the Von Trapps went through after leaving Austria. It reminds us all of what our priorities in life should be. Knowing that this was a true story and not fiction made it all the more inspiring, that a family could go through such hardships and still survive without being bitter."},{"Title":"THE STORY OF THE TRAPP FAMILY SINGERS","review":"Okay, \\"War and Peace\\" it ain't, but what it is is a charming rendering of the Trapp Family history. Told in an almost childlike voice, it was refreshing to learn about this amazing woman and her struggles to keep her family afloat during a turbulent time in the world. After hearing so much about Paris Hilton and Tori Spelling these days it was refreshing to come back to reality and see how insipid today's youth can be. Maria was a strong woman who didn't flinch in the face of adversity. I enjoyed hearing about her faith, as well, being a rather lax Catholic, my interest in my own faith has been inspired by reading her book. I enjoyed her exuberance over the simplest things and it made me appreciate everything I have. I would recommend this book to everyone...young, old, religious, atheists, etc. There is something to learn from Maria von Trapp and this delightful book now goes on my short list of \\"All Time Favorites\\". Read this book and share it with someone you love, or better yet, share it with someone you hate."},{"Title":"THE STORY OF THE TRAPP FAMILY SINGERS","review":"This adventure is full of human laughter, tradition, and inspiration. The true story greatly surpasses &quot;The Sound of Music&quot; in humor, candor, and joy. You also get the rest of the story: after they flee Nazi Austria, they come to the United States to share their traditions and song, and it would inspire anyone to read how they survive through financial struggles, tour the nation singing, set up a humanitarian organization to aid severely depressed Europe at the end of WWII, and start music camps in Vermont. This is one of my three favorite books"},{"Title":"THE STORY OF THE TRAPP FAMILY SINGERS","review":"One of the best books written of all time. It will make you cry, laugh, and just make you feel good inside. i first read this book at the Trapp Family lodge in Stowe, VT and I just fell in love with it. This is a great book for all! Please rate my review!"},{"Title":"THE STORY OF THE TRAPP FAMILY SINGERS","review":"Our whole family --six of us, including three teenage boys-- enjoyed this story and have read it several times. And the reason I bought this copy is because we loaned our other one away, and it never came back, and we just had to have it in our home library.We appreciated the author's descriptions of the many celebrations and festivals in their family life that were so closely tied to their devout Catholicism. Being Protestant, we knew little and understood less about the benefits of \\"hand-on\\" reminders and \\"helps\\" to our worship. The knowledge has expanded our thinking.Plus the story is just that --a great story."},{"Title":"THE STORY OF THE TRAPP FAMILY SINGERS","review":"Seeing as how this book came out in 1949 and the musical didn't come out until 1959, Maria Augusta Trapp is the one that gave the world the story of \\"The Sound of Music\\". If as other reviewers have pointed out that this was a book not all together truthful, I ask \\"Who Cares?\\"So, maybe we can't believe everything in this book, but why does it matter? The book is a great read. Maria Trapp gave us some of herself in this book. It was a great way to spend the weekend.Besides, the observations about the modern world she made in 1949 are just as meaningful now. I say, take knowing the truth with a grain of salt. I guess if you are historical purist, this book isn't for you. If you want a great read, then this is your book."},{"Title":"THE STORY OF THE TRAPP FAMILY SINGERS","review":"The movie itself is one of my favorites. It was so nice to have a better insight (without the glamour of the movie) of how the family lived."},{"Title":"THE STORY OF THE TRAPP FAMILY SINGERS","review":"I read this for the first time in high school and really enjoyed it. I watched the movie again for the first time in probably 8 or 9 years and found myself frustrated because it ends with only part of the story told. The book is written by Maria herself, and goes much farther than them escaping Austria. The movie version is great, but I find myself gong back to the book to get all the fun details and the full story over and over."},{"Title":"THE STORY OF THE TRAPP FAMILY SINGERS","review":"Growing up in the 60's, one of my favorite movies was \\"The Sound of Music\\". I've always wanted to read the real story, and now I have. It is quite different from the movie, but I enjoyed thrilling over the adventures just the same. It is an amazing story of a family that had to endure many hardships and overcome many obstacles and still kept on singing. I recommend this book to anyone who wants to see how to live life for the Lord in spite of the turmoil going on in the world about you."},{"Title":"THE STORY OF THE TRAPP FAMILY SINGERS","review":"I've probably watched the movie 20 times but never actually read the real life version of the Von Trapps. This book was very interesting reading, if a bit heavy on the religious references. However, what I learned from this book that I did not know from the movie is that the family actually sang a lot of religious music and not the more folk/showtune music that Broadway/Hollywood made their story famous with. This was apparently a point of discord with the actual Trapp family themselves. Maria Von Trapp, however, was an excellent writer and her story engages. You get the sense that her ability to write a good story is an extension of her interesting, compelling, and strong personality. Several times during the book, I almost laughed out loud. I would have loved to have actually met her. The Austrian history that the book often includes, as a prelude to WWII, is also very interesting as an aside to the Von Trapp story. If you have any interest in this family, the movie, or the historial period, I think you'll enjoy this. It's a relatively easy, engaging read."},{"Title":"THE STORY OF THE TRAPP FAMILY SINGERS","review":"This is the original book that was written before \\"The Sound of Music\\" was ever thought of. It is written by Maria von Trapp herself and has the story of their lives before, during and after the period reflected in the film. The energised personality of the writer conmes through clearly, making one think about the difference one's outlook on life can bring to those around you. If you ever wondered what came before and after \\"The Sound of Music\\" this is the book for you."},{"Title":"THE STORY OF THE TRAPP FAMILY SINGERS","review":"I enjoyed every page of this book. It's inspiring, interesting and even funny! I was so glad I could buy more copies at amazon to give out as presents, they make an excellent gift!"},{"Title":"THE STORY OF THE TRAPP FAMILY SINGERS","review":"I had borrowed this book from my local library after having read another book on the same topic by Agathe von Trapp that I purchased at Barnes & Noble with a gift card I received for my birthday. Decided that I wanted a copy of this book for my personal library as well, so ordered it from Amazon. It was excellent and meant a lot to me since I am not only a fan of The Sound of Music but have also visited Salzburg, Austria."},{"Title":"THE STORY OF THE TRAPP FAMILY SINGERS","review":"Lovely, inspiring, TRUE story filled with uplifting testimonies about a life lived in faith. I laughed and cried with this one. Then I turned around and recommended it to my entire family. I really enjoyed learning about the romance between Maria and the Captain.

Read it and pass it on! This is a great book to share."},{"Title":"THE STORY OF THE TRAPP FAMILY SINGERS","review":"A really wonderful story.A bit disillusioning as the real story is a bit different to the movie,but still an amazing family with an inspiring tale to tell"},{"Title":"THE STORY OF THE TRAPP FAMILY SINGERS","review":"When I received this book I began reading it immediately. I could not put it down until I had finished with it .Hope to visit their home this Aug. When I go to Maine for a month, to visit family."},{"Title":"THE STORY OF THE TRAPP FAMILY SINGERS","review":"Along with everyone else who has read this book, I loved \\"The Sound of Music\\" and knew that it was a glossed over account of their real life. I picked up this book, hoping that there would me some truth to it. While I am sure that the majority of the events DID happen, they way they are presented leaves much to be desired. I got the impression reading this book that there was yet a 3rd side to the story that is not presented here.This is the story of the family, as told by Maria. This is the book on which the movie is based. The book leads the reader to believe that everything was sunshine and roses and that whenever anything bad happened, God provided the opportunities. While I am not doubting Maria's faith, I also think that she worked her tail off to get some of the opportunites the family recieved.This book is very moving. Some of the antics of the little kids made me chuckle and the story of Georg's death brought tears to my eyes. I would be interested in finding out what happened later.....I would recommend this book to anyone who loves the movie."},{"Title":"THE STORY OF THE TRAPP FAMILY SINGERS","review":"The Trapp Family Singers is high on my list of all time favorite books. I first read it when I was a teenager and have read it probably 20 times since then. About 3 years ago I obtained a new copy, as my old one was totally worn out and I wanted to be able to read this again and again. It is an entertaining story, but more than that it is inspirational. Their faith is tremendous and each time I read it my own faith is strengthened. I love the humor in the book- it leaps out at you in unexpected ways. I related the story of the turtle to my children on the way to church the other day and my family howled with laughter! I am so glad that the book has been reprinted, as it was out of print for several years."},{"Title":"THE STORY OF THE TRAPP FAMILY SINGERS","review":"The &quot;Sound of Music&quot; is one of my favorite movies and I've seen it probably over 20 times. But Maria's book made me cry over their pains and their victories. It also reminded me of the saying, &quot;A Family that Prays Together, Stays Together.&quot; They did not only pray, they sang and sang and sang. This book should be in K-12 readings lists. I just turned 9 and I think families will benefit from this book especially with all the trouble around today."},{"Title":"THE STORY OF THE TRAPP FAMILY SINGERS","review":"This book tells the real story of the Trapp Family Choir, as it started, and ended, the beginning(first couple pages) was slow but picked up speed rappedly, the further you got , the better it got. This intriging nove I would recommend for all adults, and mature children(as I am 10)."},{"Title":"THE STORY OF THE TRAPP FAMILY SINGERS","review":"That really was an interesting book!!!!! When I started to read the first page, I was so cautivated by its contense, that I could hardly stop reading!!!! I also liked it, because I read it when I had already seen the movie and so I could see what was true and what was invented by the producers of the film.What I liked best in this absolutely interesting book is the way Maria starts learning Enlish in the ship American Farmer, because thats really an ingeniouse and funny way of learning a language.I also liked the part when they arrived in America and they saw that the american culture was very different from the european one. In this part it was very easy to understand how lost and confused they surely felt in the first days of being there. But also in this part of the book we can see how brave they were, because although they had a lot of problems, they had success in their lives in the american continent.The part in which I was almost moved to tears was the ending, because there you can see what friends are for and why you have to have some."},{"Title":"THE STORY OF THE TRAPP FAMILY SINGERS","review":"What a wonderful book! I laughed and cried all the way through it. The story of the Trapp family, their adventures, their singing career and their camp were uplifting. And the constant trust in God and the way in which they lived out their Catholic faith were beautifully described. A story full of the joys and sorrows of real life."},{"Title":"THE STORY OF THE TRAPP FAMILY SINGERS","review":"Back in the spring of 1965, when the film \\"The Sound of Music\\" was breaking box office records, I was an almost eleven year old in the fifth grade whose teacher simply loved the play and film. The class listened to the Broadway original cast album starring Mary Martin, and learned to sing several of the songs in music class; she told the story of the film before any of us even had a chance to see it. So, being so indoctrinated to \\"The Sound of Music\\" I was excited to learn that my aunt actually knew the real Maria Von Trapp, and that she would be the guest of honor at a charity benefit my aunt was hosting. My mother took me with her, and I was thrilled both at the possibility of meeting my first celebrity, and the thought that I might get some extra credit from my teacher if I \\"interviewed\\" the real life Maria.The big moment arrived and my aunt brought over Maria Von Trapp to introduce her to us. At first glance I was let down, I had expected kind of an amalgamation of Mary Martin and Julie Andrews, this tall, strapping, robust, ruddy complexioned woman clad in an old world peasant style dress with a kerchief tied around iron gray hair looked nothing like either one of them. Also to my eleven-year-old eyes she was \\"really old\\", (she was in fact sixty years old, four years older than my current age!), and she spoke with a heavy Austrian accent. However, she had a beaming smile and twinkling blue eyes as she shook my hand heartily. I will always remember how remarkably attentive and charming Maria was to me, the schoolboy solemnly explaining that I could get extra credit in my school if I could interview her. With the passage of time I mercifully don't remember the questions I asked, fairly inane I'm sure, but she was delightful, patiently answering each one, never rushing me, or patronizing me. Before we parted she had signed a program for me, which is tucked somewhere in my old desk in my parent's home.I had read this book just before I had met her; we had it in our classroom library, naturally. Since then I have read it several times, obviously gaining a deeper appreciation than I did as a callow boy. However the charm of Maria's writing style is that it is simple enough to embrace readers from pre adolescent to adult, but also is an engrossing tale told by a natural storyteller that bridges an age gap. It's very readable, and I think holds the reader's interest from beginning to end, the first time I had reread it after meeting Maria, I felt as if she were chatting with me again recounting stories of her family and herself. Be sure you read the \\"The Chapter Before the First\\" which is really a forward or introduction, but has a engaging little anecdote that is pertinent to the book.For anyone that loved or has an interest in \\"The Sound of Music\\", this is a must, since you will get to know and have a better understanding of the real Trapp Family Singers, and admire them that much more. Also, although most of the basic facts of the film are true, the events portrayed are telescoped and run together, and dramatic license is taken. The timeline in fact from when Maria arrives at the Villa Trapp to the family's fleeing Austria from the Nazi horror is about twelve years, not the several months shown in the film. In that twelve year span, not only do the Captain and Maria marry, but they have two daughters of their own, in addition to the original seven children, lose their fortune, and begin their singing career and start to earn acclaim in Europe. The Captain himself is a kinder, gentler character than the initial frigid autocrat of play and film. Maria is pregnant with their third child when the family departs Austria in a much less dramatic fashion, but they did turn down three lucrative offers from the Nazis and were in peril if they remained in their homeland. Also, they did escape by the skin of their teeth, since the Nazis closed the borders the day after they left. Shortly before they decide to leave Maria recounts a chilling vignette where the Captain and she sit at an adjoining table next to Hitler and his storm troopers in a Munich restaurant and witness firsthand the appalling banality of absolute evil.Happier events are recounted; I especially loved her vivid, enchanting descriptions of the celebrations and customs of an Austrian Christmas and Easter, so different from what we're used to in America. It's disheartening to realize these lovely traditions from the 1920's and 1930's are most likely not widely practiced any more in this nuclear age, so much has been lost in man's march of \\"progress\\". Since my parents emigrated from Ireland in the 1940's, I could identify with the Trapps' immigrant experience as they struggled to assimilate and establish a home and some security in their adopted homeland. Some of the stories that she recounts about other immigrants in addition to her own family's wrestling with the attempt to learn English quickly will give you a good chuckle!The thread running through her memoirs is Maria's strong faith; trust in God's grace, and acceptance of His will, even if it may not seem to be ours at the time, the title of the review is a quote she uses that exemplifies this fact. After Maria's death in 1987, stories came out that she was not as \\"sweet\\" in real life, among other things she was supposed to have a hot, violent temper and be very headstrong and dominating towards her family. That well may be, but I don't think she comes across as a saccharine, shrinking violet in this book; she's a definite force of nature, and her strength and determination are quite apparent. They had to be, the Von Trapp family totaled twelve in all, plus their musical conductor Father Franz Wasner, they had to support themselves. In addition, I read later on that Maria lost her mother as an infant; her father abandoned her to harsh, uncaring relatives who physically abused her during her childhood. Under the circumstances it's amazing she turned out so well. While perhaps the whole story of the Trapp Family Singers is not presented, and this may be a whitewashed version, it is still an absorbing, uplifting biography penned by a remarkable woman.Though our paths never crossed again, I will always have a warm memory of our encounter so long ago. I did visit Salzburg, Austria as a young man and see Nonnberg Abbey where Maria had been a postulant, plus several other sites from the film. I also visited her grave while on vacation at the Trapp Lodge in Stowe, Vermont several years ago, and said a silent prayer for her, remembering her kindness to me. And yes, I did get extra credit from my delighted schoolteacher for my report back to the class and Maria's autograph!"},{"Title":"THE STORY OF THE TRAPP FAMILY SINGERS","review":"It's been a while since I've read this book, and I realize now that Maria Von Trapp wrote it in the style of an earlier time in which the main characters look unfailingly noble. While we can admire the family's stand against the Nazis, the details that have been left out, which were recently revealed by A&amp;E's &quot;Biography&quot; make them more human and realistic. For in reality, we learn that Maria was the stern, tempermental, dictatorial one and the Captain the more mild mannered one, and that it was against Maria whom the children had to fight for their independance when they wanted lives outside the singing group. The A&amp;E version also gives a more detailed account of Maria's harsh childhood, that she hadn't always been so religious and in fact had been an atheist at one point, her stepchildren's true feelings about accepting her into the family, and the way Maria took her husband for granted. Her account of their lives resulted in one of the world's greatest musicals, and is a clear monument to virtue in the world, but as part of a modern audience, I don't mind a touch more reality and humanness to such stories. Without it, they seem a little too lofty and untouchable."},{"Title":"THE STORY OF THE TRAPP FAMILY SINGERS","review":"\\"The Story of the Trapp Family Singers\\" is the wonderful life story of the Trapp family singers. Maria details how she met and married the Baron Georg von Trapp; loved and cared for his children; and went on to have three children of her own. The first half of the book is set against the background of pre-World War II Austria, with charming details of holidays and the annual Salzburg music festival.Then the Baron loses his money; and the family uses their musical talents to earn a living. They become more and more successful, but when the Nazis invade Austria, the von Trapps must choose between material success (on the Nazis' terms) or freedom (and starting over) in America. Their choice proves to be an inspirational one.The second half of the book deals with the von Trapps's new life in America. There are many comical scenes of Maria's struggle to learn English. And they also face the problems of continuing their careers in America, as well as dealing with publicity, agents, etc. But their faith in God sees them through all difficulties.I really found this book inspiring. The von Trapps never gave up, even when they were tempted to, many times. They were --and are-- a strong family."},{"Title":"THE STORY OF THE TRAPP FAMILY SINGERS","review":"The Sound of Music is my favorite movie, so I HAD to track this book down and read it.I was not disappointed!Maria inspired me with her faith in God and his help through all the trials of life. She also had SO MANY MORE STORIES TO TELL THAT NEVER MADE IT INTO THE MOVIE. One example: I was interested to know that their mansion in Austria was made into a Nazi Headquarters after the family fled. Once, when Hitler was visiting, he overheard one of the German soldiers whistling a tune which happened to be of Russian origin. Hitler was so enraged that he ordered all the German guards present to be shot.This book is one of the best books that I have ever read.--George Stancliffe"},{"Title":"THE STORY OF THE TRAPP FAMILY SINGERS","review":"I had a copy of this book as a child and lost it so was thrilled to find it on Amazon. It's not the best quality paper, but was just fine."},{"Title":"THE STORY OF THE TRAPP FAMILY SINGERS","review":"In post-World War I Austria, an orphan teenaged girl entered the convent at Nonnberg with a burning desire to serve God as a Benedictine nun. In spite of her best efforts to adapt to the contemplative life of a sister, she developed health problems that a doctor attributed to the sudden and tremendous change from the active life she had left behind. So Mother Superior decided that the would-be postulant must go back to the world for a time - just on loan, as she put it - as live-in teacher to the invalid daughter of Baron Georg von Trapp. Maria quickly grew to love not only her pupil, but the widowed Baron's other six children. When God asked her to spend the rest of her life with him, as his second wife and stepmother to his brood, it was the last thing in the world she either expected or wanted. Yet it launched her on a long, rich, and intriguing life, one that this book chronicles (up to its 1949 publication, at least).I read this as a girl, and I loved Maria's story so much that I found I could almost quote whole passages decades later when I came across a copy and picked it up again. \\"The Sound of Music\\" is a wonderful musical and a fine film. But this, the story on which it was based, is so much better! The wealthy von Trapps lost first their fortune, and then their home and country, as the Nazis took over Europe. They learned to make their living doing what they did best together, by singing, and they had to do so in a foreign country. Faith in God, love for each other, and the love of friends saw them through. This book ought not to be missed. It's a gem.--Reviewed by Nina M.

A great deal more of the spiritual character of Maria and the Trapps are seen in this book than was even hinted at during the movie. Throughout the book the reader can rejoice in the love and understanding of people that Maria von Trapp has. The Trapp children readily sacrifice and work to make it during the hard times.

After nine years ~ and continuing the tradition of watching the great classic musical every Thanksgiving ~ my husband is just enamored with the film... So much so that he would get online and research the actors and the movie...This book was a Christmas gift that satisfied so much curiosity for him in ways unforeseen upon purchasing... Within a month he finished the book (which is HUGE since he works 10 to 11 hour days).He loved reading the history of this family through Maria's eyes... As he told me, the movie only touches on a very small part of their lives...but the general premise is true...they're a singing family who really did have to skidaddle out of Austria right under the noses of the Nazi authorities...Here's one thing he told me that really stuck... The Von Trapp family didn't have much money when they got to the States (not going to spoil it so I won't state why). They didn't know where to settle for a little while when a friend had suggested building there...and the Trapp Family Lodge in Stowe, Vermont is their actual former house...the one they built!! How cool is that?!?!?!?!!! Ahh...history... It's a beautiful thing :)If you like the musical...and are interested in learning more about the family's experience (after Maria's arrival) this is a fabulous book that cleverly tells &#34;the rest of the story&#34; :)"},{"Title":"THE STORY OF THE TRAPP FAMILY SINGERS","review":"I bought this book for myself for Christmas last year & read it immediatly. Like so many little girls, I fell in love the 1st time I saw the movie in the movie theater when I was a small girl. I'm 51 now & &#34;in my time&#34;, we didn't have dvd or video. You watched it at the theater & hoped they put it on tv. I watched it every chance I had & was so happy when it came out on vhs. It was a must-see for my kids to see also. I never knew about this book until I found it on Amazon. I never knew what happened to the family after they escaped & I had absolutely no idea they had such a long entertainment history in the US - and I was amazed that they even traveled so close to my childhood home in Arizona when I was young! I absolutely enjoyed reading every page of this book, learning their history, hearing their stories. Reading between the lines, it was obvious there were more to the stories than what was being said, that things were maybe 'bent' as someone else said. But the basic facts are the same. And if Maria was a tough woman, that's probably what saved them & I admire her & all of them even more. Reading the true story & having to grow up & realize my beloved movie was not actual fact in many ways was a bit disappointing. But in no way did reading the book detract from how much I still love the movie, which is what it was made to be after all - entertainment. In fact, I love it more, knowing more about their real lives. I think the book was more special, because my mother's grandfather was an educated man from Austria & he left his family behind when he came to the US as a young man. I've ehard stories about how he lost touch with his sisters during the war & never heard from them again. Reading this book gives me a better idea of what my ancestors must have gone through. And I love the book. Some people don't like it because of the way it's written. You have to realize the book was written by a woman who #1-was not trained as a writer, #2- grew up in an entirely different era & #3 who's main language was not English......so of course the writing style & use of language can be rough at times, but I think that makes it even better because it wasn't handed over to be re-written by a professional, so as to be more acceptable. I would recommend this book to anyone who has any interest in this family, or maybe even the history of that time."},{"Title":"THE STORY OF THE TRAPP FAMILY SINGERS","review":"This book is a personal family history of the Trapp Family Singers. It begins with Maria's days in the convent, traces the migrations of the family during the War years, and finishes in their family home in Vermont.Ever since seeing The Sound of Music for the first time, I have always been curious about what happened next- -did the entire family manage to safely climb the Alps to freedom? How did they pay for their journey to the US? And what connection do they have to the Trapp Family Lodge in Stowe, Vermont? Maria Trapp answers all of these questions in this book. While the musical version of their life did convey many of the main episodes, the storyline of the musical compressed these episodes so that they seemed to happen one after the other: Maria leaves the convent, teaches the children how to sing, marries their father, and they flee the country at the outbreak of the war, all within 2 hours. Phew! Like the musical, this book also starts with Maria's last day in the convent, but more than a year passed before she and the Baron were married, in 1927. They were married some 12 years and had 2 additional children along the way before leaving Austria. Yes, as unknowns, the family did win a song festival, but that was in 1936, and by the time they fled Austria, they were already quite well-known and had toured Europe as a family singing group. Indeed, one additional reason for leaving the country when they did was that they had been invited to sing at Hitler's birthday.When driving past the Trapp Family Lodge in Stowe, I have always thought of it as a ritzy place, and assumed that the money to purchase it and develop it had come from the Baron's family fortune. In reading this book, I found that that was not the case at all. The Baron's fortune was lost before the family left Austria, and they arrived in the US on borrowed money. In their new American lives, they had to restart from the very bottom of the social ladder, digging themselves out of debt before they could even begin to think of buying new clothes or a home. For years they dressed in the same simple clothes they had arrived in, and they built their first house in Vermont from the foundation up with their bare hands. That is, the girls did, since the two boys had been drafted into the US army and were fighting in Europe at the time.This book relates all of these details and many more, with a considerable sprinkling of humor. Maria comes across as a determined optimist, a young girl barely out of her teens who arrived on the doorstep of a house filled with grief and dissension. Through her personal character and upbringing, she created a family with strong bonds to each other that was able to withstand remarriage, loss of fortune, becoming refugees, and establishing a home and a livelihood in a distant foreign land. The two elements that were her constant guidance and source of inspiration were her faith and the music. This book is peppered with remarks that ring true even today: \\"The family that sings together, plays together, prays together, and usually stays together.\\" \\"Our age has become so mechanical that this has also affected our recreation. People have gotten used to sitting down and watching a movie, a ball game, a television set. It may be good once in a while, but it certainly is not good all the time. Our own faculties, our imagination, our memory, the ability to do things with our mind and our hands- -they need to be exercised. If we become too passive, we get dissatisfied.\\" The Sound of Music is a great story, but the story presented in this book is much better."},{"Title":"THE STORY OF THE TRAPP FAMILY SINGERS","review":"This is simply one the most uplifting books I have ever read! I adore the movie &quot;The Sound of Music&quot; but this book is even more amazing. The von Trapp family went from immense wealth to poverty in a very short time, but throughout their trials they never lost their faith that God would provide. I was also impressed that they were so easily able to recognize the evil around them (Hitler, etc.) for what it was. My favorite part of the book is when Georg gathers his family together and tells them, &quot;Children, we have a choice now: do we want to keep the material goods we still have. . .our friends, and all the things we are fond of?--then we shall have to give up the spiritual goods: our faith and honor. We can't have both any more.&quot; The family chooses to relinquish their wealth and retain their honor. This is the best example I know of a family that stuck together through thick and thin."},{"Title":"THE STORY OF THE TRAPP FAMILY SINGERS","review":"My mother ran the gift shop at the Trapp Family summer camps in Stowe in the late '40s, and I spent my summers with her when I was three and four, the youngest child there. Agatha, the oldest daughter, appointed herself as my caretaker during those two summers, and I have many clear and wonderful memories of those times - Cor Unum, their home which later became the original Lodge, just completed; singing and dancing all day and evening, indoors and out; hiking Pico Peak singing; the family with their dirndls and braided crowns; and always, the figure of Maria, the Baroness, looming over all, larger than life, laughing and singing and leading the fun.That said, this book was one of my earliest attempts to read a &quot;big people's&quot; book. I loved it - still do! - and the way it captured the characters of the people I knew. But I also recall my mother telling me that while the Baroness was a wonderful raconteur, her book, like all memoirs, was somewhat skewed and biased. She was not the holy innocent who had no idea that the Captain was in love with her and who meekly married him only because it was the will of God. She was an immensely strong-willed woman who knew exactly what was going on and also knew that she was entirely ill-suited to contemplative convent life. Which isn't to say that her account is untrue; light that passes through a prism is still light, although bent, and her account, while similarly bent, is still fundamentally true. There is some truth in all she says, but some of the details have been fluffed up a bit.The family probably wouldn't have survived without her strength, will, and humor, and there is no doubt of her religiousity - she turned to charismatic Catholicism in her later years and was speaking in tongues. As is the case with all strong people, some people, including some in her family, had difficulties with her. And of course, the play and film bear very little resemblance to reality - the very fact that the family names weren't flossy enough for Hollywood tells you that the producers felt a need to tart up the story.But I've always loved this book, and will continue to recommend it - forget the movie!"},{"Title":"THE STORY OF THE TRAPP FAMILY SINGERS","review":"Though our whole family loves the movie &quot;The Sound of Music,&quot; the book -- as usual -- is much better! It includes so much more detail and personal and historical facts to add to the story. The movie covered only the first HALF of this book -- and the second half is the best part! I've often wished they would make a &quot;sequel&quot; to &quot;The Sound of Music&quot; to show the wonderful &quot;rest of the story!&quot; This is a great &quot;READ-ALOUD&quot; book for families with even quite young children, an excellent &quot;historical read&quot; for older children, and fine entertainment and inspiration for young and old alike!"},{"Title":"THE STORY OF THE TRAPP FAMILY SINGERS","review":"This is my all time favorite book! I have watched the movie a million times since I was two years old, portrayed Maria von Trapp in the musical play and read this book. I find it extremely engaging and entertaining. I found myself laughing out loud while reading and at other times on the brink of tears. I think it is an uplifting, encouraging story! I reccomend it to anyone!"},{"Title":"THE STORY OF THE TRAPP FAMILY SINGERS","review":"The true, complete story of &quot;The Sound of Music&quot; is even richer and more riveting than the film. The book goes into much deeper historical detail about Hitler's persecution of believers in God. The book is an excellent primary source for teaching history. When teaching high school students about the Second World War, I always read my classes the sections in the book where Maria describes how the family's life in Austria was changed once the Nazis rose to power. I hope that the publishers will put this gem of a book back in print and back on the shelves of America's bookstores!"},{"Title":"THE STORY OF THE TRAPP FAMILY SINGERS","review":"I read the 1949 edition of this book, and in doing so I got to share in Maria's heart, her mind, her faith, her family. I feel as if I know them all! Too bad the movie didn't come even close to being as real as this true story. I can't help but feel like America was fed a fluff story of little substance with &quot;The Sound of Music&quot;, and too bad everyone knows the stars but not the real Trapps! May the remaining original Trapps be blessed and honored, wherever they may be living out their years."},{"Title":"THE STORY OF THE TRAPP FAMILY SINGERS","review":"Aside from so many more details than a movie could ever give, this book has other small treasures hidden in it. My favorite part of this book is Maria's humorous relaying of her difficulties with learning a new language- English. Her misuses and others people's misunderstandings had me laughing out loud.Maria also gives details about their family traditions (how they celebrated birthdays and religious holidays, for example), many of which I hope to adopt for my family. Her faith and simple lifestyle inspire me. She has her priorities straight and knows what's really important in this life."},{"Title":"THE STORY OF THE TRAPP FAMILY SINGERS","review":"The book was a joy to read, one filled with hope, love, struggle and triumph through faith and hard work. The true value is in learning how different the Trapp family's life was from the Sound of Music and quite different indeed it was.I was unaware of just how musically gifted the family really was, how much of a struggle their early years in America were and just how deep their faith in God was throughout their lives.I would have given it 5 stars but the tale of the romance between the Captain and Maria and their escape from Austria were brief to non-existent . I would have liked to have heard more from Maria on those chapters of their life.On the plus side, her writing is from the heart, and filled with wonder on her part on the goodness of people wherever she went.The path of a family who succeeded by faith, hard work and personal responsibility was a real inspiration.Pick up this book, read their true story, and be inspired."},{"Title":"THE STORY OF THE TRAPP FAMILY SINGERS","review":"...and while I have loved the movie &quot;The Sound of Music&quot; since I first saw it when I was 16 years old (24 years ago), I must say the book is a better story. My 19 year old daughter read this aloud to us a while ago and my 2 younger children (ages 9 and 3) LOVED it and begged to have more than one chapter each night. I love WWII history and so I loved this book for that reason too. We found it very interesting to learn so much about what it was like to be Catholic. It seems this family loved each other very much, and their faith was amazing too. One time they had a need and the family took turns for many days to pray around the clock, each up and praying for an hour I think it was. You could tell they LOVED God very much, and depended on HIM for all things. And He never failed them. Their life was not without trials and heartache. I recommend this book highly as a family read-aloud. You will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"THE STORY OF THE TRAPP FAMILY SINGERS","review":"I, too, saw the A&amp;E Biography of the Von Trapp family, which revealed the &quot;real&quot; story. So, while reading Maria's book, I had to be somewhat skeptical when she characterized herself as a decent, noble, loving mother, always ready to do the will of God, (Well, she probably was, at least in part.) Despite this skepticism, I still enjoyed the book. Parts of it are quite humorous, and others are filled with richly detailed descriptions of Austrian folk life and thier celebrations of holidays. Some parts were even a little moving, too. It was nice to hear what really went on, even if Maria left certain things out conveiently. There's no reason why anyone shouldn't read this, especially if they're interested in the story behind The Sound of Music. Even if it isn't the complete true story, it's still throughly engaging. And it's got to be at least half-true, so, oh, well."},{"Title":"THE STORY OF THE TRAPP FAMILY SINGERS","review":"You will enjoy this true story of the \\"Sound of Music\\" family. It is both historical and charming. The family's adventures and trials will keep you turning the pages."},{"Title":"THE STORY OF THE TRAPP FAMILY SINGERS","review":"One of my favorite books. &quot;The Sound of Music&quot; was the best movie ever so I had to read the book it was based on. this book was great and I loved all the extra info that was not in the movie. A real inspiriring story."},{"Title":"THE STORY OF THE TRAPP FAMILY SINGERS","review":"Excellent writing--My mother has enjoying reading the book. I have enjoying reading it also."},{"Title":"THE STORY OF THE TRAPP FAMILY SINGERS","review":"....in the german language - but that's not important.The story is written very good. But the cover is sign in on the false side. Sorry."},{"Title":"THE STORY OF THE TRAPP FAMILY SINGERS","review":"This book is the story of the Trapp family as told from Maria's viewpoint. It would be interesting if we could read the honest appraisal of the children. For example, in the 1949 book, Maria tells about meeting the captain and the children for the first time. She describes a scene that is very similar to what we saw in the movie. She even tells how the captain used a whistle to call the children.In 1972, however, she wrote a book called &quot;Maria,&quot; in which she states that the captain was not at home when she arrived, and that &quot;Baroness Matilda&quot; introduced her to the children.OK, which was it?I suspect there are deep divisions in this family (as there usually are in second-marriage situations), and so far, the children have been too polite (or too psychologically mixed up) to tell us the real truth. Evidence of the division is found in the fact that the movie does not use the children's names, and mixes up the order of their births (e.g. in real life, the oldest child was a boy, not a girl). Did the children refuse to grant the right to use their names?"},{"Title":"THE STORY OF THE TRAPP FAMILY SINGERS","review":"The real Maria writes about the Von Trapp family story! Very interesting, full of great history, and a story full of love even through hard times."},{"Title":"THE STORY OF THE TRAPP FAMILY SINGERS","review":"If you are obsessed with the Sound of Music like me, then this book is a must-read. It answers all of your questions about the film and about the real lives of the von Trapps, such as: Did the family really climb a mountain to escape? Did the Captain really use a whistle to summon his children? What happened to their enormous home in Austria?I loved the fiesty side of Maria that came through in her writing, and I chuckled as she relayed her struggles with learning English.Maria also discusses the places she lived and visited in Austria. If you ever get a chance to go to Salzburg, go, go, go! There's nothing like running through the gardens or spinning on the Alps. And even if you can't, this book makes you feel like you're right there with Maria."},{"Title":"THE STORY OF THE TRAPP FAMILY SINGERS","review":"When the movie \\"Sound of Music\\" came out I went to see it and was instantly entranced. I was also horrified at the harshness and reality of the Nazi occupation of Austria. Since then I have learned that although Hollywood produced this remarkable movie, it was not entirely factual. I live in Vermont where the VonTrapp family settled in Stowe after fleeing German Nazi occupied Austria. Maria VonTrapp was not pleased, to put it mildly, with Hollywood's version of their life story. This book is Maria Augusta Trapp's true life story as written and recorded by her. Included is the story of the VonTrapp family's singing career. It is a remarkable and very interesting book, highly recommended for anyone interested in the VonTrapp's."},{"Title":"THE STORY OF THE TRAPP FAMILY SINGERS","review":"Thank you! This book arrived timely & in good shape.Have a blessed week!"},{"Title":"THE STORY OF THE TRAPP FAMILY SINGERS","review":"I am so glad I saw a review of this book on amazon.com. Another reader recommended it, and I also loved this book. It was easy to read -I love true stories, and this one is the true story of the \\"Sound of Music\\". The book was very humorous and touching. The author's accounts of her adjustments when she arrived in America were very funny! Her life was a model of a good family life and bravery. What an artistic family!the author also overcame many hardships in her unusual life."},{"Title":"THE STORY OF THE TRAPP FAMILY SINGERS","review":"Bought it as a gift, wife said she found it interesting. Of course it had more meaning because we had been in Saltzburg."},{"Title":"THE STORY OF THE TRAPP FAMILY SINGERS","review":"If you've ever wondered what happened after the movie ended, this is the book to read. A little jumpy in places, a lot of religious documentations, but enjoyable. Made me smile and cry."},{"Title":"THE STORY OF THE TRAPP FAMILY SINGERS","review":"This was a very enjoyable book about the Von Trapp family. It was fascinating to find out how many things in the film, The Sound of Music, actually happened, as well as how many things were different. Maria Von Trapp also shares the role faith had in sustaining the family through some very difficult times. I recommend this to all who would enjoy a relaxing and positive book. The second half of the book does lag in spots, but the overall reading experience makes the book worthwhile and fun reading for ambitious upper elementary students through adults."},{"Title":"THE STORY OF THE TRAPP FAMILY SINGERS","review":"This book is an easy read. It is interesting and there are many entertaining parts. Inspiring, uplifting? Less so. One soon realizes that Maria is the &quot;Captain&quot; here. Such amibition, enthusiasm and hard work is admirable but it becomes a little tiresome when piously clothed in &quot;the will of God&quot;. Clearly all of this is the will of Maria. Read it for part of the &quot;real&quot; story. See the play and movie to see how great artists can make a story come alive and inspire us to better things."},{"Title":"THE STORY OF THE TRAPP FAMILY SINGERS","review":"I'm a huge fan of the movie \\"Sound of Music\\" and finally got around to reading the true story.Now please don't take my next comments badly. I love that she wrote this and was able to get it published. I am. But the writing style I found very distracting. There seemed to be a lot of jumping around and at times almost felt if it were being told by a young child, it was almost like reading a stream of consciousness. That may be just me.There were many places I wanted more detail, more information. For instance, I was hoping to learn - through her eyes - more about the how the Nazis came to power in Austria, that sort of thing. One thing she did touch on was the Nazi's deceitful intent in trying to convince the rest of the world that the Austrians were happy and celebrating the take over (holding people at gun point to ring church bells then playing the bells ringing over a radio broadcast for all to hear the \\"joy\\" in the streets). Makes one think about a group these days that are attempting to infiltrate under the guise of peace and innocence, claiming those who kill in their name are \\"radicals\\".This is definately worth reading, though. A truly amazing family with an amazing story."},{"Title":"THE STORY OF THE TRAPP FAMILY SINGERS","review":"I wanted to cry after reading this, which is unusual for me. Maria Augusta's Trapp's honesty as she shares her struggles of adjusting to new social groups is amazing. This book offers insights into what culture shock is truly like; so it would be great for the social sciences, especially multicultural educatiion."},{"Title":"THE STORY OF THE TRAPP FAMILY SINGERS","review":"I was so suprised when I discoverd a tatterd copy on my mothers shelf. The movie is so diffrent from the story. I liked the movie but Johannes,Lorli, and Rosemary were forgotten. When they decide to hold the music camp, I coud just picture little Maria teaching her little students the recorder. Also why leave out the true names of all besides Maria and Georg? What happend to Johanna, Martina,Hedwig,Agathe,Rupert, Werner,and Maria? Over all this was a 10 star book. I reccomend it to ages 11-?"},{"Title":"THE STORY OF THE TRAPP FAMILY SINGERS","review":"I have never actually seen or heard the Trapp Family Singers, but like most Americans, know their story from \\"The Sound of Music\\". This is the third copy of the book that I have bought. I lost the first, have the second and this copy is for a gift.The real story is much more fascinating than the movie. Mar&iacute;a was a remarkable woman, but she was nothing like Julie Andrews in the movie. Their escape was made by train to Italy and then by ship to travel to the USA where they were going to go on a concert tour. Hiking through the Alps to escape certainly would not make much sense for a woman who was at that time pregnant, with two very small children as well! The number, names and ages of the children were all changed in the movie.But I don't want to ruin the story. It is a good read if you are interested."},{"Title":"THE STORY OF THE TRAPP FAMILY SINGERS","review":"This book was very well written with a little lull in the beginning. After that I didn't want to put it down. Very easy read and food for the soul. The family's dedication to each other and God was endearing and made me re-evaluate my spirtuality. After reading this book I felt like America is truly the land where hard work can get you anywhere and opportunities are always out there. Not like the movie, even better."},{"Title":"THE STORY OF THE TRAPP FAMILY SINGERS","review":"Maria comes alive as a very sincere godly woman. Devoted to her Lord, Family, Friends, and Country. To read this book was to understand a deep trust in your God, a faith beyond imagination. If you enjoyed the movie for the family values and inspiration you may have received, you will enjoy the book that inspired the movie. I will recommend this book to all of my Christian Mommy friends."},{"Title":"THE STORY OF THE TRAPP FAMILY SINGERS","review":"I smile whenever I see this book on my shelf...Picture a large, creative, talented family seated around a fireplace in the evenings--playing with dolls or whittling--while the mother reads aloud.

Its intriguing to see it through Maria's eyes. One of my favorite quotes in this book is: \\"you can't say no three times to Hitler.\\" My second favorite quote is: \\"The Americans never seemed to ask, \\"Who are you?\\" but \\"How good are you?

If you said Jacobite I might have known what you were talking about, but I certainly couldn't have explained the risings of the eighteenth century to you.Now, I can.I found this book not only easy to read, but comprehensive, and best of all.....INTERESTING. That's quite a big compliment considering that the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries are not desirable at all to me, even as a student of history.Yes, very easy to read, but not simplistic. And best of all, it is free of the sarcasm and haughtiness I've found in works like the Penguin classics book on Scottish history, and in essays by well known and respectable historians!!"},{"Title":"The Scottish Nation: A History, 1700-2000","review":"This is an excellent account of the long and troubled road for Scotland under the rule of Great Britain. Beginning with the Union of 1707, which Scotland pretty much got railroaded into, Devine charts the meandering path toward Home Rule in 1999. Along the way he touches on the cornerstone events which shaped modern day Scotland such as the Crofters' War, the Highland Clearances, the Scottish Enlightenment and Industrial Revolution. It is amazing to read just how vital the Scots were in the expansion of the British empire, yet Scotland remained subordinate to England throughout this period.Devine focuses primarily on the social and economic history of Scotland, noting how the failure of the Scots to construct a link between the Caribbean Sea and the Pacific Ocean at the isthmus of Darien led to a financial crisis which England was able to exploit, thereby forcing Scotland to submit to its will in 1707. However, England still had a difficult time suppressing the Jacobeans in Scotland, which continued to mount resistance movements throughout the 18th century.Probably the most notorious period was in the 19th century, when English landowners with the help of Scottish landowners forced the Highlanders off their grazing lands and made them to settle along the coastline. What began as a method of suppressing the remaining Gaelic culture, became a major relocation project that destroyed what remained of clanship in Scotland. It lived on in name only.Devine notes how Queen Victoria, a Jacobean at heart, revived Highland pride during her reign by establishing an estate at Balmoral. This along with the historical novels by Sir Walter Scott helped rekindle an interest in ancient Scotland and led to a cultural renaissance.With the industrial revolution, Glasgow usurped Edinburgh as the leading city in Scotland, irrovocably altering the way of life for most Scots. Devine charts the rise of the political movements in Scotland, which began to push for greater home rule, feeling that Scotland was still be overlooking by the Parliament. The rise of the Labour Party was instrumental in the drive for Home Rule. Devine also notes the troubled relationship between Scots and Irishmen, particularly in Northern Ireland. A once similar culture now found itself at opposite ends of the spectrum.Devine takes in a big sweep of Scottish history, referencing early aspects of history, but focuses on the 300 years of Union with Great Britain. It is rich in reference notes, pointing the way to further reading on the subject. This is the culmination of his work on Scottish history, which he began with his book, Clanship to the Crofters War."},{"Title":"The Scottish Nation: A History, 1700-2000","review":"In 1999, Scotland experienced a momentous event, when after several centuries, a Scottish Parliament was convened in Edinburgh. Scotland is thus in a unique position at the beginning of the twenty-first century to enter a new era of self-determination and national pride such as has not been seen since 1707 (the year of the last Scottish Parliament) or since the times of the Stuart reign.T.M. Devine, professor of Irish and Scottish Studies at the University of Aberdeen, has put together the first comprehensive and authoritative history of the Scottish nation during this 'non-parliamentary' (and, thus perhaps one might consider, non-sovereign) period in a generation. Scotland, as Devine explains in 'The Scottish Nation: A History 1700-2000', has almost always been misunderstood by the outside world. Thought of Scotland today (by those outside) conjure up visions of green sweeping Highland views, quaint tartan-patterned objects, kilts, bagpipes, Scotch whisky, and a wild rusticity that is quite at odds with the modern, urbanised character that is more typical of Scottish life today. As any good Scotsman will tell you, Scotland had seven universities when England had only two; even in the nineteenth century as London reigned supreme on the world stage politically and, in many ways, economically, Scotland was an industrial pioneer, providing much of the backbone for British success.'For historians of Scotland the last three decades have been an exciting time. Research has boomed, established views are vigourously challenged and entirely new fields of investigation opened up which were uncharted in the older historiography.'Devine commends the modern trend toward further investigation and research in Scottish and other non-England nations of the British Isles, but worries that most of this research is being shared and read only with professional peers rather than the general public. His book, The Scottish Nation is intended to be (and, in my opinion, succeeds at being) an accessible resource for the casual reader while being authoritative and thorough enough for the scholar to find it valuable.Devine breaks the history of Scotland into four broad ranges: 1700-1760; 1760-1830; 1830-1939; 1939-2000. These periods roughly correspond to the eras of consolidation of political domination by England, the growing urbanisation of Scotland and attendant decline of Clanship, the period of immigration and Highland clearances , and finally the resurgence of Scottish nationalism in the wake of Irish independence and the aftermath of the second world war.Devine examines the breakdown of traditional Scottish government in the aftermath of the ouster of a hereditary Stuart king in favour of William and Mary; Devine examines both English efforts to consolidate political and economic hegemony over Scotland (which included a movement in 1705 to declare all Scots aliens, thus subject to import duties and taxes that would be ruinous to the Scottish economy) as well as the Scottish problems of maintaining their own institutions in the face of English power. This is a different perspective than most will be used to, as history (traditionally written by the victors) has usually been stated 'authoritatively' from Oxford or Cambridge, not from Aberdeen or Edinburgh.Following issues that are economic, military, social and political, Devine traces the various strands of Scottish history through to the present Parliament, detailing the London Parliament's intriguing struggle to deal with the issue of devolution and maintenance of the union through the post-war period. Devine devotes attention to aspects of family life, the role of women at various points in Scottish history, the development of educational systems, church/state relationships, and the status of the royals in Scotland -- again, any good Scotsman will tell you, it is inappropriate to say the present reigning monarch is Elizabeth II in Scotland, because Elizabeth I was never queen there.This is a rather hefty book for light reading, but is quite enlightening for those of us with Scottish background (my family background includes many strands)."},{"Title":"The Scottish Nation: A History, 1700-2000","review":"although i have to admit that i'm a bit biased towards any book that paints scotland in a flattering light, this is a great read. i found it especially helpful when i was writing a thesis about the ebbs and flows of scottish power within the united kingdom. since this book covers everything from the act of union to the recent establishment of the scottish parliament, it was extremely helpful. it's one of the few books of its kind. if you are curious to know how exactly the UK works (ie how can england, wales, northern ireland, and scotland be seperate countries and the same country) this is a good place to start, and it's a compelling read!"},{"Title":"The Scottish Nation: A History, 1700-2000","review":"T.M. Devine's account of Scotland from 1700-2000 is the most up-to-date review of Scottish history over the past three centuries. Mr. Devine covers every aspect of the development of Scotland and Scottish life over that time period. On many topics such as religion, immigration/emigration, government, cultural traditions, economics, and much more, Mr. Devine presents a thorough analysis. I was hoping for more details on Adam Smith, David Hume and other figures of the Scottish Enlightenment, but Mr. Devine chooses to stick with the story of Scotland as a whole for this work. This is a slow read at times, but for those genuinely interested in knowing more about the modern history of Scotland, this book has to be as good as one will find."},{"Title":"The Scottish Nation: A History, 1700-2000","review":"T.M. Devine's \\"The Scottish Nation: A History, 1700-2000\\" is that rarest of breeds, a scholarly work that can be enjoyed by the general reader. The book covers the history of Scotland from the 1707 Act of Union with England to the beginnings of devolution in 2000. In between, the author packs an astonishing amount of political, sociological and economic information into a coherent history.Devine's approach is both chronological and thematic. His narrative favors the norm over the heroic. A connecting thread is the uncertain relationship of Scotland to the United Kindgdom. One aspect of the relationship was the Jacobite challenge, with uprisings in 1715 and 1745. Another aspect was the disproportionate contributions of the famous Highland regiments to the wars of Empire. A third aspect was the early urbanization of Scotland and its transformation into the workshop of Britain. All these events had profound impacts on Scottish society in terms of education, religion, and local conditions; Devine combines a big picture approach with vignettes of often startling detail.Devine investigates the Scottish diaspora, which took thousand of migrants to the British Dominion countries and the United States, while noting the surprising volume of immigration, mostly but not entirely from Ireland. He describes the phenomenon of \\"Highlandism\\", in which a decliing portion of Scottish society suddenly became emblematic of 19th century Scotland. More latterly, the struggle to rebuild a viable economy in Scotland after the World Wars has renewed interest in political devolution. Devine sees the reconvening of a Scottish Parliament at the close of the 20th Century as a sign of the times.\\"The Scottish Nation\\" is very highly recommended as a scholarly but readable investigation into the unique national entity that is Scotland."},{"Title":"Contracts Law Audio Review (Bar Exam)","review":"I could have learned more than this from 15 minutes of reading an outline.

This is a thoughtful, insightful look at Celtic Spirituality, written by a woman who knows her stuff! The passages from Celtic literature add to this work, taking the reader on a truly magickal journey to the Celtic Otherworld and back. If you're Celtic in heritage, this is one way of 'getting back to your roots'; if you're Celtic in spirit, this is one way of appreciating and experiencing one aspect of Celtic Spirituality in a totally new context. (Knowing the author as I do, and knowing how hard she and her husband worked on it, I am truly in awe of their wonderful creation!)"},{"Title":"A Circle of Stones: Journeys and Meditations for Modern Celts","review":"Although I don't look at Danu and Bile (Erynn's main &quot;Celtic&quot; deities) in the same way, the rest of the information is very helpful in creating, not only a Celtic Pagan rosary, but a Celtic Pagan circle of magic. I tend to see the winds differently than she does too (I stand in the South, to call the North wind across the &quot;land&quot; to welcome the energies of Samhain and full new year-winter stuff) but everything else is either completely useable without changing it, or just needs a little tweek to fit. I would recommend that anyone who uses it, even if they use each prayer word for word, that they copy it in their own writing. It will orient you physically with the magic of the words and into her idea of a Celtic circle.Highly recommended for anyone wishing to get to know their Celtic Pagan roots without the trappings of too much neo-pagan and Wiccan influence. I hope she writes another book again soon."},{"Title":"A Circle of Stones: Journeys and Meditations for Modern Celts","review":"Okay, let's say I was expecting actual meditations to record and listen to. Not so. What you get with this book is basically a Celtic rosary. Tells you what kind of beads to acquire to assemble your own rosary-type thing, and gives short Celtic poems to recite. Kinda interesting. I am actually inspired to make my own take-off from this idea and write little &quot;prayers&quot; that are meaningful to me. The little poems are presented in Gaelic and English, though there are no pronunciations next to the Gaelic, which was a little disappointing. There is a little pronunciation guide in the back, though, but I find it lacking many sounds I couldn't figure out. It is by no means a large tome. You could nearly call it a booklet. Based on looks, I probably wouldn't have bought it, or certainly wouldn't have paid as much as I did sight-unseen."},{"Title":"A Circle of Stones: Journeys and Meditations for Modern Celts","review":"The author (that's me) has now made the book available on her website for the original cover price. While I do feel that the text is outdated and I've learned a lot since it was first published, I still get a lot of requests for this book and feel that the prices being asked by used book shops can be extortionate.If you're interested in the original book on Pagan prayer beads or one of the historical documents from the early days of Celtic Reconstructionist Paganism, you will probably enjoy this book. Buying it from the author saves you money and makes her writing other books possible!"},{"Title":"A Circle of Stones: Journeys and Meditations for Modern Celts","review":"I read this book in a day--but don't let that fool you into thinking it's an emprty read!Far from it. *This* is Celtic paganism for modern people. Have you been disappointed by the \\"Celtic WIcca\\" that gets tossed around? Pick up this gem.Erynn starts with an explanation of how to create and use a devotional circle of beads tied closely to Celtic cosmology as gleaned from original myth and lore. She devotes a couple of pages to each step of the journey, explaining their origins and how to connect with them in everyday life.She then dedicates the rest of the book to thoughts and suggestions on honoring the Celtic deities and spirits. No stone is left unturned; however, rather than spoonfeeding you, she instead gives you the tools to create your own sacred space.The real beauty of this book is that it's genuine. Erynn's scholarship is solid, and she is careful to explain that this is the best approximation of Celtic religion that she, in this day and age and with the resources available, could create. She doesn't try to say \\"This is exactly how the Celts did it\\". In addition, she also mentions when certain facets come from a specific group of Celts, such as those on the European continent rather than Ireland. And she does her own translations from Gaelic to English, which I bet is more than most Celtic pagan authors can boast.I think that Celtic Reconstructionism is highly needed in modern paganism; this book is a fine example of a solid scholarly foundation put to practical and spiritual use, even more than a decade after its initial publication. I can hardly wait for Erynn's book on ogam, due out in 2007!"},{"Title":"A Circle of Stones: Journeys and Meditations for Modern Celts","review":"I enjoyed this book very much, but the Celtic poetry, while beautiful, didn't really resonate with me. So I took Laurie's bead arrangement and modified it to suit my own worldview (the Sacred Land for me is not Ireland but the Rocky Mountains, for example, and I think of the four treasures as being the four familiar tarot suits). I wrote my own prayers based on her ideas. I made a bracelet of small beads using her design, and I carry it with me when I go hiking. After years of doing this, I find that when I go through these prayers at home, I'm transported back to the mountain trails I love.One thing that would have made this book better would be a summary of the prayers in once place. I loved the meditations, but when I first tried to read through the prayers with the beads, flipping through the pages was distracting. I finally ended up typing them out in order so that I could see them in one place. It was after that that I modified them. It would also have been helpful, for those who wanted to follow her suggestion of saying the prayers in Gaelic, to have a better pronunciation guide, or even a cassette to listen to. Those are the only reasons I gave this book four stars instead of five. The concept itself is wonderful.I'm not a pagan (or a Christian either. I'm a Unitarian monotheist.) But the lovely earth-centered quality of this bead arrangement has a more universal possibility than just Celtic paganism. Anyone who is interested in prayer beads should read this book."},{"Title":"A Circle of Stones: Journeys and Meditations for Modern Celts","review":"I just got this a couple of days ago.

He quite rightly points out that there is romance in the fantastic, science fiction in the literary, mystery in romance, etc., etc. It is therefore the stated ambition of this collection to gather authors who would otherwise not be lined up side by side, in an effort to blur these distinctions of genre, and introduce the reader to new styles and authors. I am glad to report that the result is spectacularly successful. While there is no connection between the stories, the uniformly excellent writing and passion displayed by the contributors results in a collection of diverse entries that somehow works as a whole.The collection begins with Margaret Atwood's \\"Lusus Naturae\\" which immediately captures the spirit of the book with a romantic/gothic/science fiction entry. An ideal first piece, it sets the tone for the subsequent entries. Next is the remarkable David Mitchell with \\"What You Do Not Know You Want\\"; a noir-ish mystery with a supernatural twist. Readers of his recent \\"Cloud Atlas\\" will particularly enjoy this entry as it definitely echoes the themes and settings of that work. Moreover, like Atwood's entry, this blurring of genres adds to the cohesiveness of the work as a whole.Jonathan Lethem's \\"Vivian Relf\\" carries things forward with an enigmatic romance written in a literary style. It is a classic short story, and a good change of pace which keeps the reader on their toes. Next is \\"Minnow\\" by Ayelet Waldman which probably had more of an impact on me than any other stories. It would be difficult to go into detail without spoiling the plot, but the themes surrounding parenthood are somehow both disturbing and reassuring at the same time. \\"Zeroville\\" by Steve Erickson just might be my favorite entry. His tale of a door hidden across the breadth of cinema, and just what it means, is fascinating and perfectly executed.In \\"Lisey in the Madman\\", Stephen King proves that he is still the master of scene setting; no one can make you feel the heat of a noonday sun like him. However, this is also an interesting psychological/supernatural thriller, and if he does flesh it out into a novel (as is suggested) it could prove to be a remarkable work. \\"7C\\" blends hard science fiction and romance in perhaps the most original entry in the book. It's rare that quantum physics makes for exciting reading, but author Jason Roberts pulls it off nicely.\\"The Miniaturist\\" by Heide Julavits is reminiscent of a \\"Twilight Zone\\" episode with all of the macabre scene setting and bizarre conclusion one would expect. \\"The Child\\" by Roddy Doyle is an excellent companion piece as it has the same sort of feel, but the motivations are far more vague and the twist at the end definitely leaves open a host of interpretations. \\"Delmonico\\" by Daniel Handler offers another nice change of pace in a fun little mystery that reads like a magic trick.The next two entries are the only two that I have mixed feelings about. Both \\"The Scheme of Things\\" by Charles D'Ambrosio and \\"The Devil of Delery Street\\" by Poppy Z. Brite are well written, but neither really got of the ground. The first features superb scene setting and some fascinating characters, but the payoff was never really there, while the latter seemed to be building to a great conclusion, but ultimately fell flat in the end. I should emphasize that neither contribution is \\"bad\\" by any stretch, but compared to the other entries they just don't measure up.Fortunately, the next two entries are superb, and along with \\"Zeroville\\" make up my top three for the collection. The first is what motivated me to buy the book in the first place, China Mieville's \\"Reports of Certain Events in London\\". As usual, he doesn't disappoint; while he maintains his thus far ubiquitous fascination with urban landscapes, he has once again gone in a totally unexpected direction that is reminiscent of Mark Danielewski's \\"House of Leaves\\", but entirely original. Next is Joyce Carol Oates' amazing \\"The Fabled Lighthouse of Vina Del Mar\\". The entire time I was reading it, I felt like I was reading a lost Edgar Alan Poe story, and sure enough on the last page the reader finds that the story is based upon the only surviving page of a lost Poe work. I should emphasize that this should in no way detract from Oates' writing, as she pays tribute even as she writes a wildly original piece that has some echoes of Lovecraft as well.Finally, Peter Straub's enigmatic \\"Mr. Aickman's Air Rifle\\" provides the perfect conclusion to this collection. A nice touch is that following this entry is a brief biography/bibliography of each author for those who would like to further explore the contributors' work.Generally speaking, one expects an ensemble collection to be a mixed bag, and one crossing numerous genres, even more so. Gladly, Michael Chabon has produced in \\"McSweeney's Enchanted Chamber of Astonishing Stories\\" that is informally excellent even as it accomplishes in breathtaking fashion its goal of breaking down the barriers between genres. This collection is a real treat for fans of short stories, and is definitely not to be missed.Jake Mohlman"},{"Title":"McSweeney's Enchanted Chamber of Astonishing Stories","review":"There must be millions of us who share Michael Chabon's enjoyment of both literary fiction and genre fiction, and count among our greatest pleasures works that live on the border between. But it's not that easy to summon up that borderland at will, and in this grab bag of poplit, dallying with the genres of fantasy, thriller, and horror, there are as many pieces that fizzle as there are pieces that pop.I agree with the other reviewers that the finest of the lot is from the hitherto unkown Jason Roberts, whose \\"7C\\" ushers in the end of the world with the intensity of delirium, the clarity of a theorem, and a chilling tendresse all its own. By itself, it's worth the price of entry. We will, I hope, be hearing much more from Roberts.No one experiments with the Gothic form more freely or successfully than Joyce Carol Oates, and her Poe tribute \\"The Fabled Lighthouse at Vina del Mar\\", with its claustrophobic Galapogan landscape of mental decay, is another high point. Daniel Handler's \\"Delmonico\\" is another tribute, bringing Spider Robinson's Callahan's Saloon out of SF into the world of the hardboiled private eye, a journey which only improves its genial flavor.Other standouts are \\"Zeroville\\", an eerie trip into the metaphysic of film; Jonathan Lethem's deceptively straightforward and naturalistic antiromance \\"Vivian Relf\\"; and China Mieville's tale of a secret society of urban naturalists, \\"Reports of Certain Events in London\\", a marked departure from his usual style that suits the story like a glove.Most of the big marquee names here (Poppy Z. Brite, Stephen King, and Margaret Atwood) turn in solid journeyman offerings, but not ones that will linger in your memory. A few of the stories - \\"Minnow\\", \\"The Child\\", \\"The Scheme of Things\\" - are derivative one-finger exercises that may not make it into your short term memory.If you're prepared to sift the gems from the chert, you'll be well rewarded by this collection."},{"Title":"McSweeney's Enchanted Chamber of Astonishing Stories","review":"This new collection of stories, edited by Michael Chabon, aims to \\"reinvigorate the stay-up-all-night, edge-of-the-seat, fingernail-biting, page-turning tradition\\" (taken from the book's back cover) of literary short fiction. For me, that was about half right. Half the stories had me on the edge of my seat and didn't let up for a moment, such as \\"Lusus Naturae\\" by Margaret Atwood, \\"The Fabled Light-house at Vi&ntilde;a del Mar\\" by Joyce Carol Oates, and the astonishing \\"7C\\" by Jason Roberts (probably the best of the collection). The other half seemed a bit unclear and left me wondering what I had just read.The collection includes some already well-known authors - Stephen King, Joyce Carol Oates, Peter Straub - and introduces some welcome newcomers (to me, anyway) - Ayelet Waldman, Jason Roberts, Roddy Doyle. As a whole, this collection was hit and miss; however, the hits make it worth reading."},{"Title":"McSweeney's Enchanted Chamber of Astonishing Stories","review":"So with a title like \\"Enchanted Chamber of Astonishing Stories\\" one is whisked away to the days of pulp writers, Robert E. Howard, Robert Bloch, and H.P. Lovecraft. However you are in for a big disappointment. This book has more flops than gems, sad to say most of the stories downright suck. I'm not sure when it became popular to start writing plot less stories but that's exactly how some of them will read. Once I finished reading them I was tempted to go back thinking, \\"Did I miss something?\\" On the contrary, this book is hardly an enchanted chamber of astonishing stories, but a decent volume of worthless, ho-hum reading. Here is the list of stories with a quick overview.Lusus Nature-Good story. This is about a girl who starts to have features resembling a werewolf.What you do not know you want-This was also a good story. A guy is on a quest to track down a valuable artifact that was originally used as a suicide blade.Vivian Relf-Skip it! A guy & a girl continue to run into each other over the years, with no romantic connection. No climax or anything. Waste of time.Minnow-Skip it! As usual any story associated with pregnancy I tend to hate, this one is no different. A woman has a miscarriage and can't seem to get over it.Zeroville-Skip it! A former film director is convinced in every movie for a split second of frame a door in visible in the shot. There is no climax.Lisey and the Madman-Ah Stephen King doing what he does best, boring the crap out of me. I guess I shouldn't have been surprised, I've come to easily recognize King's style of writing and its typical ramble on, get off the subject everyday dull story go nowhere plot. I hated this story.7C-This story is worth reading. It's a very unusual tale that in my opinion is hard to explain, however it leads up to a reverse \\"Big Bang Theory\\" if you will.The Miniaturist-This story is pretty good. It starts going at a spooky ghost story style pace. Two sisters are asked to be bridesmaids at their half sister's wedding. They get stuck in the snow and have to stay the night at an old woman's log cabin out in the woods.The Child-Skip it! The whole time you're thinking this is probably a ghost story but no, it's not and like many others in this book it has no climax and ends rather dull.Delmonico-Skip it! In an old gum shoe style setting to toughs enter a bar seeking a possible answer to the mysterious disappearance of one of the guy's wife. No good climax, no real interesting twist. Boring.The Scheme of things-SKIP IT & BURN IT! This is absolutely the worst story in this book! It has no plot and you feel like part of your life was robbed from you just by reading it. A couple of door to door con artists end up in Iowa selling fake magazine subscriptions to make money, they stay a few days at an elderly couples house and drive away with corn in the backseat at the end. The author of this should be drug out into the street and beaten.The Devil of Delery Street-This is my first encounter with Poppy Z. Brite. Many of my friends like her, but after reading this I was very disappointed. It starts off as a ghost story but goes nowhere and ends very boring. The only thing I did like about this story is when she's describing the streets of New Orleans apart from that skip it.Reports of Certain Events in London-So as not to make the same mistake I did with wasting my time with the other stories I skimmed through this one. Just the format alone was enough to tell me I wasn't going to like it. I can't really tell you the plot but from the little I read, I saved myself from reading yet another \\"ho-hum\\" story.The Fabled Light-House of Vina Del Mar-This was a very good story. There were strong hints of Lovecraft all over this tale. A man takes up the task of being the sole occupant of a light house with his terrier. As you read his diary entries you see what isolation & loneliness can do upon one's mind. This was a great tale.Mr. Aickman's Air Rifle- 3 men in a hospital are reunited with an old acquaintance for whom they don't care, after which strange similar dreams haunt the men and certain circumstances begin taking their toll. This one is worth reading."},{"Title":"McSweeney's Enchanted Chamber of Astonishing Stories","review":"While McSweeney's last offering of this sort didn't really seem to accomplish what it set out to do: the genre stories were by genre writers and the \\"literary\\" writers didn't seem to offer anything different from what they usually write(exception, Rick Moody's Albertine Notes), this time a definite effort seems to have been made to fit their work into the genres they were aiming for in the first collection.The work by Margaret Atwood and Jason Roberts was the best, while Heidi Julavitz sets her story up and flubs with a predictable ending that made me want to throw the book across the room. I think that some of those people who would like to separate themselves as \\"literary\\" artists have the very mistaken notion that genre writing must be predictable, either that, or Julavitz simply couldn't come up with a better ending, which would prove the anti post-modernists correct in their assumption that today's literary fiction is intended to obfuscate because the writers don't have a handle on the basics of story telling. Julavitz's ending didn't work. It was like one of those hilarious jump-cuts in the \\"Funkenstein\\" skits on Mad TV and it disappointed because it started out so well.David Mitchell's What You Do Not Know You Want, also had a quickie ending that didn't quite work, but still managed to raise hackles, while Steve Erickson's Zeroville was superb. At any rate, this collection is definitely more enjoyable than the first and I hope that McSweeney's continues to put these out periodically."},{"Title":"McSweeney's Enchanted Chamber of Astonishing Stories","review":"Like the previous volume Chabon edited, many of the stories seem to miss their aim. Despite claims to the contrary, many of these tales are bogged down by the exact literary trends and pretension that inspired this collection (and the previous) as a reaction against. There are some outstanding stories--Ayelet Waldman's \\"Minnow\\", China Mieville's \\"Reports of Certain Events in London\\", and Jason Robert's \\"7C\\"--that accomplish that thrilling edge-of-your-seat anticipation that inspired so many young folks to become lifelong readers. Many of the other stories are mostly good but seem to not exactly fit into this anthology. I will say that I loved the stories by the inimitable David Mitchell and Jonathan Lethem and would suggest picking up this volume for those alone."},{"Title":"McSweeney's Enchanted Chamber of Astonishing Stories","review":"Obviously with a collection of this sort, you're going to have your hits, your misses, and your mediocrities.First, the hits: The best story in this collection is \\"The Fabled Lighthouse of Vi&ntilde;a del Mar\\" by Joyce Carol Oates, a captivating, spot-on diary of loneliness in the South American primeval that fleshes out a posthumous Poe storyscrap into a fully realized, phenomenal story. It's just incredible. \\"The Miniaturist\\" by Heidi Julavits is an extremely well-realized classic ghost story that's perfect for an early-a.m. reading. \\"Delmonico\\" by Daniel Handler is a very engaging and funny murder mystery. \\"Vivian Relf\\" is a basic but highly effective story of confused identities, intriguing in its account of the barely explored ability of strangers to affect us more than friends do. \\"The Child\\" is one of the better pieces I've ever read by Doyle, a quick, immediate account of a child ghost, perhaps told by an untrustworthy narrator, with a puzzling ending worthy of discussion. Let me defend \\"The Scheme of Things\\" here, which is being called aimless. It is, a bit, but the writing and plot are so strong to make up for it. It's about a poor couple who swindles other poor families by pretending to work for a charity. It's an astute look at human weakness and vulnerability, and again, unlike many pieces in this collection, the writing makes up for any tangentiality of plot.The mediocrities: \\"Lusus Natur\\" by Margaret Atwood, about a literal cat-woman, is pretty good, although she's clearly out of her element and sees the story as a lark. Nevertheless, it's an accomplished lark, and probably the best of the mediocrities. David Mitchell's story, a hazy missing-relic mystery set in Hawai'i, certainly has its moments, but is also very bland in parts, flowing smoothly then dragging its feet. It's a deft voice, but it's executed too piecemeal to make it work as well as it should have.The mediocrities, part II: Many are raving about \\"7C,\\" the Weird Short Story Prize winner. It's...OK. It's really not that weird, and reins itself in where it could have been much weirder. Most of the \\"weirdness\\" comes in self-mutilation, of a scar that sort of lives. The problem isn't that it isn't that weird, it's that it advertises itself as being really bizarre when it's a pretty basic short story conceit played out in slightly errant fashion. Still, the writing's fairly strong. Many are also lauding \\"Zeroville\\" by Steve Erickson. It's a decent story, with a very good central idea (man finds similar images in very disparate films), but it's so bogged down with references, references, references it almost can't be read. You have to have spent your life as a Hollywood sycophant to get half the references--so much of the time is spent dropping names and films, the idea is all but lost. China Mi&eacute;ville's bizarre story \\"Reports of Certain Events in London\\" is an experimental exercise without much substance, but it's fun to read, to see the lengths the short story can be taken to. Again, the plot of it--that streets vanish just as people do--is flimsy and hardly played out, but conceptually, it's an enjoyable read.The worst story, by far--and it's a true stinker--is \\"The Devil of Delery Street\\" by Poppy Z. Brite, which is painfully amateur, the kind of story that would be torn apart by a first-level creative writing workshop, airport literature at best. Ayelet Waldman's \\"Minnow\\" is more of the same, poorly written tripe with a cloying narrative about bland and clich&eacute;d melancholies: prescription medication, dead babies, pop culture namedrops, and soap opera hysterics. Less offensive but still pointless are Stephen King and Peter Straub's entries, which are both in desperate needs of editing--the stories are prolix as can be. They flop back and forth between decent narrative and painful stereotype dialect/lousy dialogue.Well, it's a book worth sampling, as are most things McSweeney's--it's just as scattershot as the yearly Nonrequired Reading series."},{"Title":"McSweeney's Enchanted Chamber of Astonishing Stories","review":"The reason I nought this book is Stephen King's \\"Lisey and the Madman,\\" a novella that is (so the buzz insists, at least) actually an excerpt from a novel King has recently finished but has not decided yet to publish in full. Well, I for one hope that the entire novel is available at some point. This excerpt demonstrates again that King's writing style is simply getting better, without sacrificing a jot of the storytelling skill.The best of the rest of the stories are Jonathan Lethem's \\"Vivian Relf,\\" Peter Straub's \\"Mr. Aickman's Air Rifle,\\" and Poppy Z. Brite's \\"The Devil of Delery Street.\\" But there isn't a bad story in the entire book, making this one well worth a read."},{"Title":"McSweeney's Enchanted Chamber of Astonishing Stories","review":"At last, a collection of short fiction that spans genres as easily as sliding across a dark, icy lake at midnight, plummeting towards the black void of the thorns that await you at the weedy edges. Michael Chabon has gathered together some of the best writers of the era, and presents them to us as tidbits in this delectable collection.In most of these tales, you will find the lick of the macabre, a scent of titillating sci-fi, and a squeeze of horror that make for the best of short literature.China Mieville's 'Reports Of Certain Events In London' is a fantastic tale of rogue streets (yes, streets!) that roam the cities of the world. Joyce Carol Oates 'The Fabled Lighthouse Of Vina Del Mar' (my favorite) is a sultry, frightening tale of isolation, madness, and strange quivering sea life. Margaret Atwood delves into the bestial heredity of an otherwise sweet little girl in 'Lusus Naturae'.A mysterious doorway taunts the edge of your vision in 'Zeroville' by Steve Erickson. A horrid foretelling of events spurs a man to try and change the future in '7C' by Jason Roberts. Meet a bartender with a gift in Daniel Handler's 'Delmonico'. Live with a household specter in 'The Devil Of Delery Street' by Poppy Z. Brite, and reminisce while deteriorating in Peter Straub's 'Mr. Aickman's Air Rifle'.Probably one of the more prominent attractions to this book is Stephen King's new short, 'Lisey And The Madman', but while giving adequate characterization, the story fell short by being a little too long-winded, a trait of King in his later works. At any rate, with famous names like these, you know you are getting a superb treat. 'Astonishing Stories' is just that, lip smacking fun for anthology lovers. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"McSweeney's Enchanted Chamber of Astonishing Stories","review":"Just plain mediocre, especially considering the fact that many of these folks are well established authors.

This collection, however, with very few notable exceptions (Stephen King, for one), contains stories that were not very good and did not hold my attention.

This is an eerie tale about a couple who have a miscarriage and how the mother copes and what she does to appease the crying she hears on the other end of the Baby monitor.I hope you all enjoy the short stories as much as I did!!"},{"Title":"McSweeney's Enchanted Chamber of Astonishing Stories","review":"McSweeney's Enchanted Chamber of Astonishing Stories is Michael Chabon's second attempt to bridge the ever-widening gap between literary fiction and genre fiction, to make a place for well-written, literary short fiction that is strongly plot-oriented and unabashedly indulges in genre (science fiction, fantasy, mystery, horror, romance) plots and plot elements. Like the first anthology in this series (McSweeney's Mammoth Treasury of Thrilling Tales) Chamber is a mixed bag in terms of quality. This is to be expected, and no doubt different readers will have different configurations of favorite and least favorite stories. More importantly, however, only a few of the 15 authors collected in Chamber give the impression of actually understanding their purpose, and only a few of those seem capable of successfully writing a genre story.Of the 15 stories in the collection, one is science fiction, another a mystery and a third a fantasy. Two others defy easy categorization, and the remaining ten are horror. Seven of these are ghost stories - nearly half the collection. This is hardly a coincidence. Even a writer completely unfamiliar with genre writing - someone who's never cracked open The Lord of the Rings or read a Sherlock Holmes mystery - will have heard a ghost story or two in their lives, or watched an episode of The Twilight Zone. A great deal of horror is formulaic, and these formulas are more readily available to non-genre readers than the formulas of, say, science fiction. A tentative author would no doubt be tempted to take advantage of these templates. The result is that many of the stories in Chamber are familiar, albeit well crafted, repetitions of old themes. Take Margaret Atwood's \\"Lusus Naturae\\", in which a misunderstood monster sadly narrates their short life, or Ayelet Waldman's \\"Minnow\\", yet another entry in the hoary sub-genre of pregnancy- and new motherhood-themed horror. Both are moving and well-written, but neither one treads new ground.The remaining ghost stories are mostly dull. In Poppy Z. Brite's \\"The Devil of Delery Street\\", a young girl is possessed by a spirit, only to have it go away quietly after a while. In Heidi Julavits' \\"The Miniaturist\\", the villain and the outcome are obvious three paragraphs in. Only David Mitchell delivers a truly chilling effort with \\"What You Do Not Know You Want\\", one of the high points of the collection. In this tale of a shady businessman who travels to Hawaii following the suicide of his partner, Mitchell manages to tell a creepy and innovative tale which hints at a dangerous underside to the familiar world without tossing reason and a coherent plot out the window.In non-ghost horror, Stephen King once again cheats by contributing an excerpt from an upcoming novel. This is a pity, as King writes superb short stories, and \\"Lisey and the Madman\\" - the story of a famous author's near-invisible wife - could have been an excellent short story with just a few tweaks. As it is, it is enjoyable and suspenseful up until its non-ending. Joyce Carol Oates' \\"The Fabled Light-House in Vina del Mar\\" is another familiar plot - the journal of a man being driven insane - but is a cut above the rest in terms of quality and because of its unexpected and disturbing ending. Steve Erickson's \\"Zeroville\\" - the story of an obsessed film editor searching for a repeating image in all movies ever made - is without a doubt the most original horror story in the collection (probably because it straddles horror, fantasy, and just plain strangeness) but it fails to make the leap from good to superb.The collection truly shines, however, when it comes to non-horror stories. In \\"Delmonico\\", Daniel Handler (better known as Lemony Snicket) delivers a sweet punch of a story, a pitch perfect hard-boiled mystery with a neat twist that will leave a smile on your face. China Mi&eacute;ville's \\"Reports of Certain Events in London\\" is an innovative fantasy that is clever, funny, and decidedly strange - you'll never look at a city map in the same way again. The best story in Chamber, however, is newcomer Jason Roberts' \\"7C\\", a science fiction short that wouldn't be out of place on the Hugo or Nebula shortlist. The story of an astronomer who draws conclusions about the fate of the universe from mysterious scars on his body is the best kind of SF - intelligent and moving.Jonathan Lethem, however, seems to be the only author in Chamber who has truly understood his assignment - to combine the modern short story - moody, atmospheric, light if not bereft of plot - and the genre short. The result, \\"Vivian Relf\\", about two people who keep meeting and feeling a very strong familiarity despite having nothing in common, is perhaps not a very good story, but it is a superb examination of what really happens when the mundane and the fantastic meet, and an interesting commentary on the wisdom of Chabon's attempts to accomplish a fusion between the two.There are some genuine jewels in McSweeney's Enchanted Chamber of Astonishing Stories, and very few duds (Roddy Doyle's \\"The Child\\" is the sole turkey). Almost every story has something to recommend itself, but in the end I'm not sure that Chamber isn't a better repudiation of Chabon's thesis - that to abolish genre boundaries would make all literature stronger - than a corroboration of it. If nothing else, it proves that the process will require a great deal of work and thought, which only some of Chabon's contributers seem capable, or willing, to expend."},{"Title":"The Ark of Millions of Years Volume Two: 2012 and the Harvest of the End Times","review":"I have to chime in. It is quite obvious to me that Mr. McNaughton has reviewed the wrong book. This book, The Ark of Millions of Years, Volume TWO, which I own, is all about the 2012 Mayan End Time date. Because the authors are the first to \\"crack\\" the 2012 Mayan calendar code meaning in a very unique way, I rate this book highly.Now, I believe that Mr. McNaughton is referring to the Volume One of The Ark of Millions of Years. He mentions several books that are not even in the authors reference list. Regardless, the questions that he raises were indeed answered in that book, in fact every one of them.The authors bring to the table a new version of the creation as told through many ancient reliable texts, including the Bible, that answers the questions about the flood of Noah, origin of the Jews, whether man was created or evolved, the true age of the earth, the role of the fallen angels, and much more in a new light from ancient Jewish texts recently translated.The authors make the claim that it is the most comprehensive book on the creation; and they did it admirably, in a most remarkable way. They also claim the book restores a key piece of knowledge that was lost about 6,000 years ago pertaining to the understanding of the creation; this loss caused the chasm between creationists and evolutionists. Additionally, the book actually fulfills an ancient Jewish prophecy found in the Zohar and its publishing was heralded by a Grand Sextile (Star of David) alignment of heavenly bodies announcing the return of the lost \\"key.\\" I love this book, have read it twice, and highly recommend it to others."},{"Title":"The Ark of Millions of Years Volume Two: 2012 and the Harvest of the End Times","review":"The recent publication of The Ark of Millions of Years Volume Two sounded interesting, since the subtitle is 2012 and the Harvest of the End Times. The 331-page book has very poor quality graphics, many of which are blurred and pixelated images downloaded from the net with no acknowledgement to their origin. There is an acknowledgement of the author's cat, however - the book is dedicated to it! The authors, E.J. Clark and B. Alexander Agnew, Ph.D seem to see themselves as archaeologist-explorers in the vein of Indiana Jones, but their book shows that they have simply read a few New Age authors such as Arguelles, Yaxkin-Joy and/or Hunbatz Men, (or more likely, got the information second hand, off the internet), have misunderstood them, not done any proper research or checking and have mixed in the Nephilim of Sitchin and a large dose of biblical material. They even attribute the Tzolkin to Abraham or Shem (p.142). In fact it seems that the whole book is an attempt to prove and justify the bible (p.147-148). Their list of errors is huge. Here are a few:1. Talking of Dreamspell's \\"galactic tones\\" and other concepts as if they are genuine artefacts of the Maya calendars (p.117-131)2. Announce that Arguelles is deceased (p.120)3. Show 2 Dreamspell Tzolkin grids and say one is the original design, while the other is modern (just because the former includes Maya numerals) p.121\`-122.4. Wrongly state that the Maya used wheels to measure time, since many people use interlocking wheels to help explain Maya calendars. (p.129-131).5. They call the 52-year Calendar Round and 104-year Venus Round the \\"short count\\". The Short Count is actually a 13-katun cycle of just under 260 solar years (260 tuns). (p.132)6. They state that the Maya had a 28-day lunar cycle. (p.132). The cycle was in fact alternately 29 and 30 days, with extra interpolated 30-day months.7. They state that \\"The Tzolk'in (pronounced Zol Keen) is the divine or religious long count calendar of the Maya used to measure the cycles of the Pleiades, a cycle being 26,000 years.\\" (p.132 and also p.141). The Tzolkin is NOT the Long Count, and the rest is an over-simplification - the movement of the Pleiades was used to check the precessional movement towards the alignment in 2012, (by the Maya of Chichen Itza), which only happens every 26,000 years.8. Another misunderstanding: \\"The Tzolk'in calendar ends on December 21, 2012, at precisely 11.11.am GMT\\". (p.143). No, it is the 13-baktun cycle of the Long Count calendar that ends on 21 December 2012, but not at 11.11. That is when the Winter Solstice occurs. It is debateable amongst Mayanists as to when the date rolls over - either dusk, dawn, or midnight.8. They state that the Haab is the Calendar Round. (p.135)9. Mixed start and end-dates: start date: Aug 13 3114 BC (p.136) end-date: 23 December 2012 (p.139), buit also talks of Galactic Alignment, (p.136), which is applicable only if the other correlation is used - start date 11 August 3114 BC; end-date 21 December 2012. On p.153, both dates are given, \\"December 21-23\\") showing the authors' confusion.10. \\"The Aztecs used a sacred calendar called the Tonalpohualli, a long count calendar borrowed from the Mayan Tzolk'in system with some modifications added.\\" The Tzolkin (and Tonalpohualli) ARE NOT the same as the Long Count!11. The central panel of the Aztec Sunstone is presented as the entire Sunstone. The reason is that it was copied from the internet, and only the central panel of the colour rendition by Roberto Sieck Flandes can be found online. If you want to see the whole painting, see Beyond 2012 colour plates.12. Galactic Alignment is stated to be \\"the winding down of precession\\". Galactic Alignment is a 36-year time window in the 26,000-year cycle of precession - not the end of it.There are many more errors, but I'm sure you get the gist of this. This book is actually an insult to the intelligence!"},{"Title":"The Ark of Millions of Years Volume Two: 2012 and the Harvest of the End Times","review":"*** SPOILER *** This book is based upon the simple idea that our current Earth is a combination of a \\"temporal\\" earth that has been here for quite a long time and a \\"spiritual\\" earth that was created in a different universe and moved here during an event described in the Bible as the flood (of Noah). Evidence for this idea is nothing more than the words of various writings, including the Bible (including the Apocrypha), the Talmud, the Dead Sea Scrolls, the Book of Mormon, and lots of other books both ancient and modern. Whether quoting from the Bible, from Joseph Smith, or from Ragni and Rado, all writings are taken as equally authoritative. Since many of these writings have been interpreted, reinterpreted, and misinterpreted over and over, I found the lack of any real evidence very disappointing.At the end, Mr. Clark relates, \\"My daughter Eve asked, 'Can you prove that such an event actually occurred?' I replied, ' Does it answer all your questions?' She slowly said, 'yes.' 'Then it must have happened' was my reply.With apologies to Eve, this book fails to answer any of my questions. How can there be people and civilizations without spirit? How can there be people and civilizations in a spiritual world without bodies? What kind of a God creates non-spiritual beings and subjects them to catastrophic cataclysms? What kind of God creates spiritual beings, most of whom become incredibly evil, then destroys the evil ones and banishes those who have remained good and pure?I'm glad I was able to borrow a copy of this book to read.

E.g., a reader may want a coffee-table Bible, a devotional Bible, or a study Bible. The reader may want a Bible that gives the interpretation of a passage (regardless of the passage's literal language); or, the reader may want the Bible to translate the language from Greek, Hebrew, and Aramaic accurately, and to make up his or her own mind about the passage's meaning. One reader may be distressed if language favors the male gender; another reader may be distressed if the publisher changes the Greek, Hebrew, and Aramaic canon text to make language more gender-neutral.This review assumes the reader wants an Updated NASB Bible. The Updated NASB Bible: (i) translates the language from Greek, Hebrew, and Aramaic literally; and (ii) follows the canon text with respect to gender. If the reader wants a Bible that gives a passage's interpretation, rather than the passage's literal translation, that reader may be happier with a Message Bible (or similar Bible), which gives a modern paraphrase of the literal translation. If the reader wants gender-neutral language, the reader may be happier with a New Revised Standard Version, which uses inclusive pronouns.First, the pluses of the Scofield Updated NASB Study Bible.This Bible is beautiful. The leather is of excellent quality. The gold leaf is flawless. The pages are neatly-arranged, and the arrangement renders the Bible very user-friendly. The print is somewhat larger than the print of competing study Bibles, making the Scofield Bible more convenient for those with poor eyesight.Second, the minuses.Where New Testament language quotes a passage from the Old Testament, the NASB translation emphasizes the reference by using a different typeface: small capitalized letters. This is an excellent feature. However, inexplicably, Scofield rarely identifies the Old Testament passage that is being quoted. The reader is left frustrated, knowing that the small-caps language quotes an Old Testament passage, but with no convenient way to locate the passage being quoted (forcing the reader to do what I am doing: have both a Scofield Study Bible and a Zondervan Study Bible in front of him or her, and read the two together-a time-consuming, bulky, and expensive method that calls into question the rationale for buying the Scofield Bible in the first place).Also, the quality of Scofield's footnotes varies wildly. I bought the Scofield Bible because I compared its notes on one particular topic with the notes of competing Bibles, and found Scofield's notes to be more helpful than the others. I assumed that Scofield's superiority on that one topic would carry through the rest of the Scofield Bible.That assumption was incorrect.Some text that desperately needs extensive footnoting has little or none (which is probably how Scofield could produce a study Bible about the same size as a comparable Zondervan Study Bible but with larger print). As one example, Scofield has four notes in Mark explaining the Olivet Discourse; Zondervan has 29.Some notes are poorly-written. As one example, the note describing Judas Iscariot in connection with Matthew 26:14 says Judas was \\"One of the twelve disciples of Jesus who betrayed Him.\\" The note implies that there were more than 12 disciples, 12 disciples betrayed Jesus, and Judas was one of the 12 who betrayed Him. The note should read (simply to be grammatically correct, and without regard to the additional information the note would need in order to be more nearly accurate and complete), \\"One of the 12 disciples of Jesus; the disciple who betrayed Him.\\"Some footnotes contain interpretations that are simply incorrect. As one example, recall the Parable of the Landowner. In that parable, a landowner walls off his property, installs a grape press, and leases the property to vine-growers. The landowner sends a slave to collect the rents; the vine-growers beat him and send him on his way, empty-handed. The same scene is repeated multiple times; the vine-growers beat some of the slaves, and kill others. Finally, the landowner sends his son. The vine-growers kill the son. Plainly, the landowner in the parable is God. The slaves are the Old Testament prophets and John the Baptist. The landowner's son is Jesus. The vine-growers are the Pharisees (and presumably the Sadducees and Herodians). But, the note to Mark 12:1 maintains that \\"the vine-growers . . . are the O.T. prophets and John the Baptist.\\" I.e., according to the note, the Old Testament prophets and John the Baptist-not the Pharisees (and Sadducees and Herodians)-persecuted Jesus and caused him to be crucified.Scofield's sloppiness and errors, such as those described in the examples above, render its notes on less-clear parables, discourses, and other material highly suspect.In short, while the Scofield Updated NASB Study Bible may have some usefulness in one's library, and is certainly beautiful, the serious student would be better off buying a Bible with better references, more notes, and better note scholarship._______________"},{"Title":"Web of Futures : A Fantasy Palindrome ( TSR Books )","review":"All of Swycaffer's books are great, some are classic pursuit novels like Universal Prey, Warsprite, etc. This, like some of his others, is one of a kind.

In between are Chamberlain's insightful views on gun control, mathematics and death and divorce.Reading \\"Don't Look at Girls Who Drive Volvo Station Wagons\\" is akin to listening to an intelligent friend, with brandy in hand by a cozy fireplace after dinner, ruminating, dispensing thoughts and wisdom and humor and even poetry. You may not always agree, but you will enjoy the evening."},{"Title":"Don't Look at Girls Who Drive Volvo Station Wagons","review":"What you have here is one man's odyssey of both mind and spirit, encompassing forty years of his life, during which time he thought deeply about all he went through.What you must know is that at the outset of this odyssey he thought of himself as a candidate for the Episcopal ministry. He was a virgin. At the end of this time, however -- well, judge for yourselves.Of course, you must read the book. In it you will find this man's views on many subjects. What he thinks of guns. What he thinks of death, divorce, sex, relationships and love. And more importantly, most importantly, having abandoned orthodoxy generally, what he thinks of God.His style is refreshing. He reads well out loud. And there are occasional bursts of reserved power that come like thunder claps when one hears him read out loud. He can be dramatic. But he can also be very persuasive.For the most part in these essays he is matter-of-fact and to the point. And the gliding ease with which he guides one's mind from point to point in his arguments is pure skill, no accident.There are poems too in this book. Philosophical poems, provacative poems, one even rather sexy poem and some that almost bring a tear to the eye. But there are no laughs. Not to say Chamberlain is humorless but in this case he is laying out food for your thought. And if you read this book, all 178 pages of it, you will find yourself doing just that, believe me."},{"Title":"JIMMY BROCKETT. Portrait of a notable Australian.","review":"SPOILERS AHEAD:In this novel, published in 1951, a man narrated his rise from a working-class background to wealth and power in Sydney between 1905 and World War I, and then his slow decline into the 1930s. For me, the book was most interesting in the first half, when he was on his way up, aggressively entering boxing promotion, starting his career as a landlord and collector of votes, and launching a racing syndicate. He measured his rise in terms of his growing net worth, the increasing sums spent on his house, car and clothes, the expanding number of servants in his home and employees in his businesses, his meals and cigars, and his attempts to enter high society. There were a number of interesting scenes, mainly involving the boxing promotion and matches, his scheming and confrontations, and his friendships with women.In the second half of the book, as he moved into newspaper publishing and politics and reached his peak, before experiencing political defeat and decline, the action began to flag, as the description of his various schemes lost detail, the more interesting characters began to fade out, and his interaction and dialogue with them lost their variety and color.The narrator was deeply flawed, with little self-awareness. He really loved only himself and his son, as an extension of himself. He lied and cheated to get what he wanted, used many people and discarded them, cheated on his wife, ran a newspaper that countered the public interest and engaged in political corruption. At the same time, it was impossible to dislike his charisma and drive to succeed, his willingness to take risks, to fight and overcome his enemies no matter what, his liking for workers who stood up to him, and his desire for friendship. The paradox was intended by the author, I assume. In any case, it helped the book capture my attention.This novel was also interesting as a description of a man's youth, middle age and decline. Despite his many flaws, the narrator was a dynamic and interesting character as he rose, and it was touching to see his energy and health eventually flag and his life begin to diminish. Could he ever really have been a force for good in his country, as he believed at the end he'd tried to be? Throughout his life, his actions were driven mainly by self-interest, and he left little behind him other than bequests to charities and relatives and a large funeral monument."},{"Title":"The Rhythmic Structure of Music.","review":"Here Cooper and Meyer take on the nature of rhythm in music, using a system of relationships between accents and unaccented or lesser accented notes based on poetic feet. It is one of the very few attempts to discuss rhythm (beyond a basic categorization such as simple/compound; duple/triple)--that it is not, perhaps, completely successful should not entirely invalidate the effort, or indeed, the achievement. Certain topics are not entirely well-explained. I remember that as a student I asked Professor Meyer the difference between two particular terms used in the book--his answer was that he could no longer remember (this was probably 15 years after the book was written) and that the distinction no longer seemed important to him. True, the book was jointly authored and perhaps this distinction was never fully convincing to Meyer--I don't know. In spite of this, the book is truly important for introducing and discussing the concept of form as a rhythmic idea. That rhythm, like pitch, can have hierarchic structures may at first seem counterintuitive; but Cooper and Meyer make a convincing arguement. And that after some 35 years this book is still in print and has not been superceded speaks volumes."},{"Title":"Happy birthday, Wanda June: A play in three acts","review":"Written in 1970 or so, I think this one is a good example of how opinionated people really need to disguise their personal opinions better in order to keep a story interesting. That doesn't mean you can't express your opinion; you just have to be subtle about it. Vonnegut is better at this in some of his other writing.One of the characters is a one-dimensional brute (possibly based on Ernest Hemingway) who treats his wife and son as things and has filled his house with taxedermised animals he has killed. The other characters are similarly simplistic, and the plot is even weaker. In fact, it's difficult to believe that the same person who wrote this play is also the author of such classic literature as Cat's Cradle."},{"Title":"Happy birthday, Wanda June: A play in three acts","review":"The book I purchased was in excellent condition upon arrival. Special care was taken in the shipping as well.The seller really came through. I was and am very happy with my purchasing experience!"},{"Title":"Happy birthday, Wanda June: A play in three acts","review":"Ya know what I really hate about The Von? (Besides everything.) It's his constant harping on his midwestern innocence. Or on Marsha Mason's midwestern innocence. *What* innocence? It doesn't exist outside of his own head. But The Von is too smugly solipsistic to realize it. He &amp; Marsha are almost as insufferable as Holden Caulfield and his precious baby sister.Don't get me wrong. I'm glad The Von survived Dresden. (SOMEBODY had to.) But his boring bleeding-heart Jesus-mongering really drives me up the wall when it's coming from a goddam atheist. (Either believe or get off the pot, Kurt. You remind me too much of that atheist nun at the end of WHITE NOISE.)Where the hell was I. Oh yeah. Have you ever wondered why the Germans constantly put verbs at the end of sentences instead of in the middle of sentences where they belong? It's an expression of German machismo. Germans think that it's macho to do everything the hard way. This trait gets mentioned in WANDA JUNE.Major Siegfried von Konigswald says: &quot;Harold Ryan said he killed maybe 200 guys. I killed a hundred times that many, I bet. That's still peanuts, of course, compared to what that crazy Looseleaf did. Harold and me---we was doing it the hard way. I hope the record books will show that. There should be a little star or something by the names of the guys who did it the hard way.&quot;"},{"Title":"Happy birthday, Wanda June: A play in three acts","review":"I read Vonnegut's first play \\"Happy Birthday, Wanda June,\\" and thought it was really good. The basic plot of the book is a man who used to be considered a hero, but after an eight year absence from society, comes back and sees that he is no longer seen as he used to be. In this play Vonnegut expresses his protest of the Vietnam War. Vonnegut does this with the character of Harold Ryan and his family. Harold Ryan symbolizes a Vietnam veteran who comes back to the States after fighting. Just like the Vietnam veterans, Harold is seen as a warmongering brute by his wife. She now is interested in a man who doesn't believe in violence and is an intellectual. Vonnegut uses this to represent the protests of the war and the honor draft dodgers received by some Americans. The symbolism of the protagonist reveals Vonnegut's theme of the play: Times changes along with political viewpoints of society and the portrayals of heroes. Vonnegut is able to strengthen the theme by structuring the play in a linear fashion like a timeline. This is a great play that withstands time and can be seen now with the war in Iraq. I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys Vonnegut's style of writing and viewpoints."},{"Title":"Happy birthday, Wanda June: A play in three acts","review":"Happy Birthday, Wanda June is an anti-b.s. play. Anti-macho nonsense, anti-abuse, anti-syncophant, anti-war mongering, anti-violence, anti-abandonment. All the \\"living\\" characters in it are trying to be someone else....except Harold, who is so much himself (or forgone) that his personality is deadly against the others.This is a very funny, bizarre, timely play. Now, as America is back in a questionable war, as we were when this was written in 1970, and blatant aggression is somehow acceptable here is Vonnegut standing up to show us all how ridiculous we are, and ridiculous just about everyone in the play is.Harold is single-minded and aggressive enough to not see its effect on others. Penelope, who is lost throughout most of it, is stuck and needs the borishness of Harold to see the error of her ways. Woodly is patently lost in a field of peace, joy and positivity full of rage, but smitten by the myth of manliness. Shuttle is an idol worshiper and caught in an Americana sport/brotherhood fetish. Looseleaf is in a haze of wonder and awe at his past, shocked by his own inhumanity. Paul is angry, needy for a father, but protective like a fatherless child is of his mother. The three \\"ghosts\\" are ironic and a hope for us all. Since this world is ridiculous and stupid, belief that the next one is anything but remains a peaceful possibility.A good play, full of social commentary, Vonnegut's wit and black humor. Recommended, especially in this day in age, and for Vonnegut fans."},{"Title":"Happy birthday, Wanda June: A play in three acts","review":"hello there, lovers of vonnegut!! i am currently playing penelope ryan in a high school production of &quot;wanda june,&quot; and i simply do not have enough wonderful things to say about this play. to start with, it's absolutely hilarious. and for theater snobs like me, this is quite possibly the most difficult character i have yet come across. vonnegut has mentioned that he has had trouble writing women's roles.....and this is absolutely the most complex and interesting female i have seen in his work. he does a great deal of experimenting here, it's fascinating. not mentioning the vonnegut style brought to my favorite creative outlet...oh joy! oh rapture! i could go on for many more pages, but i suppose i'll just leave with that. go read. now."},{"Title":"Happy birthday, Wanda June: A play in three acts","review":"Vonnegut is typically bizarre. It's his style. In the books of his I've read I notice a lot of fiddle-diddling around until the last 30 pages of the book. Happy Birthday, Wanda June isn't quite like that. I found it to be a kind of... portrait of the stereotypical Americans. First of all, there's the mother, Penelope, who lives an insipid existence with her son and two suitors -- she doesn't do much, and has little character (as most Vonnegut women do). Her son, Paul, is pressured into growing into a chauvinist, like Herb Shuttle, one of Penelope's suitors. Herb is a prolific athlete who knows nothing of science or any form of literature other than Sports Illustrated. Norbert Woodly is a \\"hippie-ish\\" doctor who plays the violin, and is Penelope's other suitor -- to say the least, Woodly and Shuttle despise each other. Penelope's house is filled with animal skins and taxadermy creatures her husband, Harold, killed while scrounging through various jungles (Woodly: Throw out all this junk. Burn it! This room crawls with tropical disease.), along with jungle-theme doorbells they aparently acquired from Abercrombie and Fitch.It's a short play, quite darling, and full of enlightening perspectives (mainly in the arguments between Woodly and Harold or Shuttle). By the end, it leaves you looking at people in a different light, wondering under which category-of-character-persona they would fit under."},{"Title":"Happy birthday, Wanda June: A play in three acts","review":"This has to be one of the most interesting plays I've ever read! I am currently doing a monolouge from the play, Wanda June's, and I believe that the characters is this play are absolutely hilarious! What kind of genius would put an happy and slightly dumb half-witted ex-bomber, a dead 10-year old girl who was killed by a drunk ice-cream truck driver, a talented violinist-doctor, and a animal hunting, taxadermy-happy explorer into one brilliant play? I give it 6 out of 5 stars!"},{"Title":"Happy birthday, Wanda June: A play in three acts","review":"This play was a great read, and I would be very interested to see it performed. The only major problem I had was that I thought some of his stage instructions seemed a little difficult to accomplish (especially onstage). For example, how exactly should Penelope show that she has recognized Harold, but is trying to conceal that very fact. TV and movies can show nuance and hint much better than stage. Its just an idea. And I think that Vonnegut's experience as a novelist is the reason for this 'fault'. But my main point is that the play is great. Its a shame that Vonnegut did not persue the genre a bit further. One last problem: this play is difficult to find. I would like very much to have a copy of my own. I was lucky to have found it in my college's library, but I have to return the copy soon which isn't any good at all."},{"Title":"Happy birthday, Wanda June: A play in three acts","review":"I love Kurt Vonnegut, but I have not been able to procure a copy of Happy Birthday Wanda June.

Its a pity that Cats is still running, and this play is not!"},{"Title":"Happy birthday, Wanda June: A play in three acts","review":"Learn to spell 'quit' before you go off insulting Kurt Vonnegut's wonderful &quot;Happy Birthday Wanda June&quot;. If you are intereted in the opinion of a true die-hard Vonnegut fan, take it from me-this play is excellent. It is everything that one would not expect out of a play by anyone other than Vonnegut.If you are a theatre person like myself, take my advice that this play has got to be one of the most outrageous and humorous around. It'd be extremely fun to produce (especially in a high school or small community theatre setting). This play is definately worth your time."},{"Title":"Happy birthday, Wanda June: A play in three acts","review":"On top of the world after the success of &quot;Slaughterhouse 5&quot;, Vonnegut decided to try his hand at playwriting. Why not? His able hand at believable character sketching would make this seem obvious. But before the first line has even ended, it becomes obvious where Vonnegut is going: Pretention land. Oh, sure, the play DOES right itself a bit in the second act. But by then, who cares? The laughs a bound as the plot sweeps out of boundaries. Vonnegut may have been a bit hard on the work in future years, rating it a dismal &quot;D-&quot; in &quot;Palm Sunday.&quot; But it is one piece that might best be left out of print; it is one experiment that didn't work out"},{"Title":"Rogue Lawman","review":"This is the first in a new series from Peter Brandvold featuring Deputy Marshal Gideon Hawk.Peter Brandvold paints a savage picture of the west, in fact many times his descriptive words created vivid images within my mind. His bad guys are vile and his hero, Gideon Hawk, is definitely an anti-hero who can be as cruel as those he's hunting.If you like westerns with obvious lines between the good and the bad then maybe this isn't for you but, if like me, you enjoy the more savage types of western fiction then get this book now! This book is filled with one violent confrontation after another, tough and at times sadistic action, that will satisfy anyone who likes brutal and bloody.Peter Brandvold has produced a new western character that has me counting down the days until the release of the second book in this series - Deadly Prey."},{"Title":"Rogue Lawman","review":"Deputy US Marshall Gideon Henry Hawk slowly turns vigilante and outlaw in the wake of tragedy, turning his back on the ideals of law and order he believed in.As has been noted elsewhere, a character in the book is named DeRosso. Appropriate, since this novel is in the spirit of pulp and paperback author H.A. DeRosso's noirish Westerns, Brandvold drawing his characters and situations with bold, economic but evocative strokes that lift's it far above the sort of cheap paperback action-adventure Western the bare bones description of the plot resembles."},{"Title":"Rogue Lawman","review":"If you're a fan of westerns, spaghetti westerns in particular, look no further than Peter Brandvold. He starts his Rogue Lawman series with a bang and never lets up. There's plenty of gunfights, blood and chases to go around. If you're a fan of Zane Grey, Louis L'Amour or Sergio Leone, Peter Brandvold is the guy you should be reading!"},{"Title":"Rogue Lawman","review":"Peter Brandvold's Rogue Lawman opens with an atmospheric scene of a trio of lawmen trailing villains across sage covered badlands. They track the bad men to a ramshackle saloon and a quick and dirty shootout ensues.Before too long, one of those lawmen, Marshal Gideon Hawk, finds his family wiped out by a desperado seeking revenge. Gideon apprehends the scoundrel and brings him to trial, only to have justice denied. This leads him down the dark path to revenge.Rogue Lawman is reminiscent of the best of thespaghetti westerns. A gritty and violent western chock full of unusual characters: a vicious dwarf and guys with names like Three Fingers Ned Meade, Crazy Chuck and Beaver Face Pyle. The writing is effective and descriptive, which is an improvement on the writing of the last Brandvold book I read,.45-Caliber Revenge. The author has a real knack for describing shoot-outs clearly and loads them with suspense.It clocks in at a slim two hundred pages, but I have to say that it still felt like there was a bit of padding to the book. There was a fifty page stretch detailing Meade's activity after attacking the Marshal's family: an exciting bank robbery that bleeds into a shoot out between Ned's gang and Hawk's posse in the middle of a town.While this set piece is one of the highlights of the book, it is also immediately forgotten and not mentioned again. When Meade goes to trial it is for the murder of Hawk's son only. He is released for lack of evidence and freed. No one seems to remember his part in a bank robbery, or the very public gun battle, which left several dead on both sides of the law, just three pages before. It seems it would have been better for the story if Hawk wounded and captured Meade immediately after his son's death. Then Meade's acquittal and release would have been plausible. The bank robbery felt like it was clumsily wedged in after the fact to increase the page count.Also, to me the big baddie just didn't seem bad enough. He was literally jumping at shadows throughout the book. It was hard to believe that a man that skittish could even manage to be that bad. It could be that he wasn't skittish over all, that he was just terrified of Hawk. But if that is the case, Brandvold never explained why Meade would suddenly be so afraid of the lawman. So far as the reader knows, Meade had never met Hawk prior to when he murders Hawk's son and never mentions that Hawk has any sort of legendary reputation.In the end, I liked the bleak tone of the book and thought the action was well done (especially that terrific opening scene). However, the large plot hole made me feel like the book was rushed. I may pick up thesequel, to see if Brandvold can keep the stuff I like and improve what I didn't like, but I'd have a tough time recommending this first one to anyone except an avid reader of westerns."},{"Title":"Commentary on the Epistle to the Ephesians","review":"A great resource book for the layperson or serious student of Ephesians or the writings of Paul. The author writes an in-depth study, but uses language, proofs, and arguments that are easy to cross-reference and understand."},{"Title":"Greek Lyric Poetry","review":"Writing this review 'cause I wanna contradict the only other review of this book, which rated it poorly. First, its a nice anthology of archaic poets, with plenty of notes and comments, informative and often witty about historical and textual issues. It's not for the beginner, since it comes without translations and Campbell assumes the reader already knows the basics. But don't let that stop you! There are plenty of translations online and beginners just need to stick their nose in a grammar and a lexicon to get something useful out of the book. If you are scared of Aeolian and Doric, it's too much for you so go home and boo-hoo in a corner of your room. Or you can have a go. Once you have mastered each poem, you have an anthology and history to keep you entertained for years to come. Let's face it; lyric poetry is not the easiest Greek, but there is not all that much that survives (apart from Pindar and he isn't represented in this book). So it's a chance to know just about all there is to know on a fascinating subject, minus Pindar (specialists and advanced student may laugh up their sleeves but they're just being pompous). It also includes some iambic and elegiac verses. My suggestion is buy this book and some Loebs on lyric poetry, iambics and elegiacs. I should add that it is just a little out of date. The appendix contains some major new fragments since the original edition. But if you want all the latest fragments you are a would-be expert and you are unlikely to be reading this review anyway."},{"Title":"Greek Lyric Poetry","review":"The poetry itself is wonderful, but the commentary is rarely helpful.

If you consider yourself a fine artist with fabric, you will appreciate what this book has to offer in the way of fabric manipulation through sewing machine embroidery and fine art medium.

It's the story of a young boy and how he deals with the sudden death of his best friend due to an allergic reaction to a bee sting. My mother had died unexpectedly of a heart attack only weeks before I read it. I'm so glad our instructor chose to include this book in our curriculum! It gave me the opportunity I needed to participate in class discussions of the fears and pain associated with death. And I found I was not alone. Many among us had already lost someone dear to them. Death is a univeral experience, and yet one for which I, and many of my classmates had been totally unprepared. I wish I had been exposed more to that particular reality of life as a child and believe that A Taste of Blackberries opens the door for just such discussions between parent and child or between children and their friends. I find, because it is fiction, that it can be an easy way to broach a difficult and frightening subject with children, then encourage a sharing of feelings.I'd like also to say that this is a fairly short book, written for children. It does not deal with all of the more complex, dark issues and feelings that can be associated with death, nor should it. As I said it's written for kids. I personally found the ending of the book to be realistic, yet uplifting and hopeful."},{"Title":"A Taste of Blackberries","review":"I came across this book in my sister's bedroom.

This is such a touching story and i'm sad that jamie had to die but i liked the way that the book ending. It didn't end up really sad. ( i hate sad endings) Normally i don't like books where people die but in this book it was so pure and simple that i don't mind it. I would recommend this book to anyone it is a wonderful book that everyone needs to read. The most heartwarming part of this book is where the main character offered (silently) to be Jamie's mom's &quot;substitue son.&quot; That part made me cry too. The most interesting part of this book is that the name of the character is never revealed. It makes the story seem so much more personal, as if the reader is actually the main character and is experiencing everything along with him.

I learned a lot about what I like to read by this book, because it so perffectly quenched my thirst for a book. Something about the way the friendship, and thee personalities, and thoughts, and situations, and reaction...it all just clicked with me.

We may have even wished something bad would happen to him as we read the story. But when it does, we are taken aback, and just can't believe that he will never play another trick again. The descriptions of picking and eating the blackberries, of attending Jamie's funeral, of eating food that still tastes good even after Jamie's death, are so very vivid to me today, 26 years later.

He was fatally wounded and died the next day.The 4th grade teacher was not my favorite and, all year, I had found incidents and issues to address--but he was right on when he tearfully read A Taste of Blackberries to the class. It was a springboard for discussion and for expression of grief. My son recounted the story to me on that Friday afternoon after school. When I told a co-worker about the book, she immediately ordered it for my son. We've shared it through these years, one of the best tools I've ever known for dealing with a child's death.

She has enjoyed it so far."},{"Title":"A Taste of Blackberries","review":"Best Friends Are ForeverThe book is about two best friends who are always together. Jamie is always getting into problems. But when he gets a big surprise he gets out of all the problems he had.What happened in that story is that the two best friends were always trying to climb over a fence. But there was a lady named Mrs. Houser that would always threatened to call the police. One day she offered them to come to her house and clean the backyard for her. She said she will pay each and every one of them. They were picking all of the Japanese beetles. Soon someone said, \\"WATCHOUT! THE BEES GOT OUT OF THE BEE HIVE!\\" Everyone started to run except Jamie. Jamie was lying on the ground. A bee had stung him and he was allergic to bees. A man called the ambulance and they came to pick up Jamie. Everyone had thought that Jamie died. Jamie's best friend said that if Jamie died he would want to die with him. Jamie's best friends mom said she would want to ride in an ambulance. He did not think it was funny at all. He did not think it was funny because his mom was thinking of riding in an ambulance. Instead of thinking how Jamie is doing. After all that happened everyone was waiting to see what had happened to Jamie and there were no news about him. The next day they said that Jamie was dead and his best friend could not believe it. To prove that he was really dead he would have to go his funeral and that was in two days. Two days passed and it was time for his funeral Jamie's best friend went to the casket to see if Jamie was really their and he was in that casket. After the funeral was over, he went to a garden and picked up blackberries and then he gave them to Jamie's mother.What I like about this book is that it talks about two best friends and best friends are forever. This boy lost his best friend Jamie. Now he has no one to play with. This relates to me because I have a best friend named Winnie. She did not die but I have not seen her in one year. It's a little different but I lost her and I hope to see her again one day."},{"Title":"A Taste of Blackberries","review":"I read this book in one sitting because it was so good I just couldn't put it down.

It deals with an issue that no parent wants to face, and it's a tough book for a parent to read. Children are less affected, although they find it sad. The narrator recovers with childlike rapidity and with no apparent signs of guilt, although there is grief. Most of us do feel guilt at the death of a friend or relative, and I would have been happier with the book if this issue had at least been raised."},{"Title":"A Taste of Blackberries","review":"I thought this book was weird.Jamie liked to play trickes.Jamie was a funny kid.He liked to get in troubel.And he could get trouble.He could get people to laugh.Jamie was the speakers best friend.Jamie got stung by a bee and Jamie died.Jamie's sister couldn't go to the funerel because Jamie's sister was to young.Jamie's sister was a nice little girl."},{"Title":"A Taste of Blackberries","review":"If your child loved A Bridge to Terebithia, he'll adore this book.

It is the type of book an adult thinks a child would like rather than one a child actually does like.Note the reviews of the class of children who had it read aloud to them in class. Almost none even understood what it was about. Most mention disliking the part about the death, but there are few mentions (beyond a vague teacher-pleasing \\"it was a good book\\") of things they actually LIKED in it.Read it when you're a teen or older, and you'll love it. Read it as a young child, and you'll probably hate it, too."},{"Title":"A Taste of Blackberries","review":"Maybe it was just that this book was too simple but I found it very boring and the story line is basically what people go through in their lives.

I do think they're the best. And the reason is because they get you to repeat the phrases over and over and over again. Learning a language takes time, but if you need some essential expressions before your trip, this is the audio CDs you want.The important thing in learning a language is repetition, and you'll get plenty of it with these CDs, as well as learning correct pronunciation. As far as books go, you may end up using a combination, but I do like the Living Language Beginner's book a lot.Definitely join a course in your area - there's no better practice than to practice in a group! Perhaps you can ask if a community college has it as a continuing education program - although you won't have big problems with the language in the bigger cities, Italians do appreciate if you know at least a little bit.If instead, you're planning on visiting Southern Italy, or the countryside, you definitely want to know some Italian (if you want a vacation, and not an adventure, that is!).I hope this helps!"},{"Title":"Italian, Conversational: Learn to Speak and Understand Italian with Pimsleur Language Programs (Pimsleur Instant Conversation)","review":"I have tried several audio language learning programs, but have really enjoyed the Pimsleur Italian program & found it most helpful for learning. I believe the best features of this program are the variety of topics and complexity of each lesson, the way repetition is used while complexity of phrases and sentences increases (i.e., they start with a word, then a phrase, then making the phrase negative, then a sentence, then incorporate prior learning with the new, so on), and it's fun. It helps to enjoy learning a language. Not sure if it is just me or is intentional but the stories/subplots in the lessons are entertaining. It makes me laugh often when the American male traveller in the lessons strikes out with Italian women! Certainly makes my drive to work more enjoyable! I highly recommend the introductory lessons & plan to continue with the more advanced ones myself."},{"Title":"Italian, Conversational: Learn to Speak and Understand Italian with Pimsleur Language Programs (Pimsleur Instant Conversation)","review":"I've taken language courses in the past, and listened to audio cassettes (dating myself), and none have been as effective as this. I am 90% through the course now, and had a native Italian speaking client today. I understood much of what she said, and she was impressed by what I could say and understand! Great price if you think you will stop studying here!If you think there's a good chance you'll want to learn more, just go for Italian I instead since the first half of it is in this course. I was skeptical at first, and I didn't want to invest in the more expensive 30 lesson set. Now I'm hooked and I'll be buying Italian I. Wish I had just paid the full price in the first place instead of buying BOTH Conversational Italian and Italian I, since they overlap by 16 lessons."},{"Title":"Italian, Conversational: Learn to Speak and Understand Italian with Pimsleur Language Programs (Pimsleur Instant Conversation)","review":"I have been more than pleased with the Pimsler's Into to Italian. I have done a side comparisons of different courses. Pimsler wins. I purchased the into to Italian courses of different publishers including Berlitz and Rosetta Stone. Pimsler is the one I have used the most because it an audio disk and can be used in my vehicle. Any time I am in my vehicle I am learning.The into Berlitz course is also on audio disk but it does not match the Pimsler in useful content or style of presentation. I have stopped using it entirely. I have also stopped using two other lesser known courses.I am continuing use the Rosetta Stone but not as much as the Pimilser on about a 4 to 1 basis. Rosetta Stone is excellent, has more features than Pimsler but that is also one its downfalls. Since it requires that I be at my computer to use it, I use it less. At the moment I use it for working on my pronunciation. The voice print analysis and pronunciation meter features are cool. Also when I start trying to learn to read Italian is suspect Rosetta Stone will be more useful.However for the average beginner just trying to learn a basic vocabulary and practical phrases Pimsler wins hands down. For example the Pimsler course taught me how to order wine and beer while Rosetta Stone was teaching me how to say \\"The boy is Jumping\\". Also, If you are on a budget, the Pimsler is cheaper. If you are not on a budget get both Pimsler and Rosetta Stone but if you have to choose, get Pimsler"},{"Title":"Italian, Conversational: Learn to Speak and Understand Italian with Pimsleur Language Programs (Pimsleur Instant Conversation)","review":"To learn some Italian before visiting Italy, I tried multiple language-learning programs borrowed from my local library. Some were ridiculous, many required using a workbook. Then I stumbled on the Pimsleur program, which is totally audio, allowing me to learn Italian while I drove to and from work. Due to the pedagogically- sound method Pimsleur developed for language learning, I actually did learn some basic Italian. As a result I bought \\"Conversational Italian.\\" Though I've never considered myself adept at language-learning, I actually felt confident in my ablility to learn Italian as a result of these CDs. I've raved about them to friends who have expressed interest in learning a language."},{"Title":"Italian, Conversational: Learn to Speak and Understand Italian with Pimsleur Language Programs (Pimsleur Instant Conversation)","review":"Stop! Don't buy this one if you're serious about learning Italian.The Pimsleur series is the best self-taught language learning system out there but this product is just the first half ofItalian I : Pimsleur Comprehensive (Pimsleur CD Series). Once you hear these 16 CD's you'll want the rest and you'll be angry you spent the money buying these first. The first 16 lessons just give you enough to get interested but not enough to reasonably converse with anyone. You'll be sorry if you like them and end up wanting more."},{"Title":"Italian, Conversational: Learn to Speak and Understand Italian with Pimsleur Language Programs (Pimsleur Instant Conversation)","review":"I have listened to these CDs to learn Italian during my 40 minute commute each way to work. I really liked the set - although after completing the 8 two-sided discs I feel that I should have learned more nouns, colors, basic stuff. Also, I would love to have an enclosure in the kit with how the words are spelled and what is masculine or feminine. So while I liked it and learned from the format, I think it could offer a little more bang for the buck!Now that I have tried the Living Language Series - I am revisiting my original review of Pimsleur. Really skip this product. You will only learn how to order Beer and Wine (but not red or white wine because you won't learn colors). You will be able to pay in dollars or euros but that's about it. You will be able to tell time until about 10 o'clock but you won't learn noon or midnight. You won't learn the days of the week or any basic nouns. Very Disappointing. Also there is no \\"next\\" edition of Pimsleur for about $30...you have to spend about $200 for the whole set."},{"Title":"Italian, Conversational: Learn to Speak and Understand Italian with Pimsleur Language Programs (Pimsleur Instant Conversation)","review":"I was born in Brazil, but my parents were Italians. So we spoke only Italian at home. I've been married for 10 years now and my wife was always complaining about how difficult it was to speak Italian. She claims that she understands almost everything when she hears my mother and I talking, since Italian and Portuguese are similar in many ways, but she is very shy in trying to speak with us. She had some classes in a language school some years ago but talking remained very hard. Not anymore, since she put her hands in this Pimsleur Conversational Italian.

I was left feeling as though I learned all the material presented, although I did replay all the CDs at least twice. On the downside, after completing the program, I was left feeling as though there was a lot left to learn...but that is to be expected from only 16 hours of instruction.Something that I found helpful was to stop the tape when I could not visualize the spelling of a word after hearing it a few times. I'd look the word up by Googling (eg: \\"Italian word for drink\\"). It's much easier for me to say a word if I know how it \\"looks\\".

I tried teaching myself the language through books, but they were of no help in teaching me pronunciation. Having listened to Pimsleur's Spanish cassette tapes (a long long time ago), I knew what I needed, so I bought Pimsleur's Conversational Italian CDs. I'm glad I did. The sixteen, 30 minute lessons taught me enough elementary Italian to be able to order food from a menu, buy gifts for family and friends, and ask for directions to Piazza This and Via That while wandering around Venice and Rome. Of course, I had to refer to an Italian phrase book and use hand gestures, but at least I could try to speak the language with the people there, without the usual fear of getting lost that comes with being in a foreign city. Too, the Italians I met were very friendly and patiently appreciated the effort I made to try to speak their language.By learning some commonly used expressions and being able to put together simple sentences, you will be free to enjoy your vacation in Italy.

I have never been very good at grasping foreign languages. I tried to learn Spanish in high school and French in college. I only \\"learned\\" those languages in the most basic of ways even after studying them for YEARS. I wanted to learn Italian for personal reasons and didn't want to risk the time and money of taking it in a classroom setting (surely, it would be a failure like the other two languages). So, I chose Pimsleur. I cannot tell you how much I am enjoying this program! It is intuitive and simple, yet I feel like I have actually learned something at the end of each lesson. Sometimes I will repeat the day's lesson another time or two just for good measure, so if you do not grasp at least 80% the first time do not feel bad about repeating the lesson. Although I have no immediate plans of being a tourist, I feel that if I ran into an Italian speaking person in my daily life I could confidently converse with them in a basic way. That is a big thing for me. I never, ever felt confident to speak when learning in school. You had to push me to speak in the classroom and going up to a stranger? Forget it!I plan to buy the rest of the Pimsleur Italian program (buying the series in MP3 from their website is cheapest. Buying everything on CD is a lot more). This program really does work.

Instead Pimsleur will have you dwelling for quite some time on just a few rudimentary conversations, working on fluency and intonation and sensitizing your aural processing.Italian is the second Pimsleur product I've tried, having successfully finished the first half-level of German before (!) I left on a grand odyssey. Pimsleur Italian was packed into the same trip, but was rarely touched due to dense itnerary and distractions that go along with traveling. That didn't change my outlook on language training and I have now started into a third Pimsleur product. So I believe the method can return results and is worthwhile.On the topic of the hugh price jump from the introductory half-level up to the full level, I suspect that the publisher is price protecting old product or channel contracts. Fortunately I didn't spend beyond the first (unfinished) half-level of Italian. On my third purchase I found a half-off clearance price on the full level. The choice depends on your long term plans and level of commitment."},{"Title":"Italian, Conversational: Learn to Speak and Understand Italian with Pimsleur Language Programs (Pimsleur Instant Conversation)","review":"Ive been doing a lot of research about the Pimsleur method and decided to start with this purchase. Trying to decide which methods I wanted to use to help me learn. I finished all the cds and was amazed! I pretty much got everything that was said on every cd, so it was easy for me to progress onto the new cd. I think I have a natural language learning ability and can speak some Spanish, so it wasn't that bad. One has to recognize the program for what it is: an audio course. If your intent is to SPEAK the language, this is the way to go (as well as hearing). I will probably go with rocket Italian in the future to supplement this (either after I finish the whole Pimselur or right before). I dont mind there is is no transcripts. Usually, every time they introduce a word or phrase, you will hear it MULTIPLE times again. There were a few exceptions. For instance, in the first few cds, there was something long the female said near the end of the lesson. I kept trying to figure out what she said before going on to the next lesson.I eventually did before I started the next one. Surprisingly, they never went back over it:/. But most everything they do. I also wish they didnt spend so much time on saying street and avenue. There is so much to talk about, even vocab, i felt they kept going over that too much. I posted on my Facebook I cant imagine where I will be after 100 lessons. I disagree with people online (ive found various Pimsleur forums etc)in that you cant get on the track to fluency with this. After all lessons, you will probably have a good speaking knowledge of Italian. Remember, there is a difference between fluency and being like a native. If you start to think in the language, its one sign you are becoming more and more fluent. I am just now starting on lesson 17 and continuing with the rest. I have a couple Italian friends online. Writing to them even now and then (maybe even skyping to them in the future) along with finishing this product, and I will be really good to go. Visiting an actual location is only really good because you have no other choice but to be submersed in the language. You can, however, get it other ways like how I am doing it. I speak a good amount of Spanish and in many ways feel I know a lot more about Italian grammar (w/ out awareness) than with Spanish."},{"Title":"Italian, Conversational: Learn to Speak and Understand Italian with Pimsleur Language Programs (Pimsleur Instant Conversation)","review":"I've been doing 1 lesson per day for the past week and have learned so much.

This Pimsleur starter set is quite good and we love the way the lessons keep coming back to things you learned previously. It really helps the words and phrases stick and helps tune the ear to particular phrases, each of which are likely to be of at least some importance while we're there. The one thing that kept me from giving this a 5 star is the lack of ANY written materials. I knew this when I bought it and it's still a great CD set. However, there are many times when the speakers say something that is simply hard to understand and say properly, so I find myself going to an online translator to identify the word or phrase. If Pimsleur simply included a PDF with the transcripts, this series would be a 5 easily. As it stands, I'm creating my own transcript as I go, and it's helping me learn more effectively that doing audio alone. All said though, I've been learning Spanish off and on for years and wish I'd known about the Pimsleur-type learnings methods for that.

Ben Stein is supposedly one of the most learned and scholarly celebrities in America. A writer of economic and legal articles and essays, it is very difficult to believe he wrote this particular novel.Rife with impossible characters whose development and character is defined by what they are wearing, how the smell and what size their breasts are if they happen to be women, they are thrust through an equally impossible tale of rags to riches, boy meets girl cliches for 298 pages.I was unable to determine if the author was writing about alcoholism, a love story, the intricacies of big business in the 1980's, or perhaps simply attacking conservative politics, the Japanese economy or his perception of minorities. There are countless and needless inferences to Jewish people in less than conscientious or appropriate ways, African-Americans are servile and inconsequential and Hispanic people are consistently one rung below that. Where does all this fit in with the story line? I couldn't figure that out either.The dual protagonists are far too heroic and far too weak at the same time. A drum major from Tennessee and a tycoon from Texas, perhaps they are the fantasy characters the author always wished he could be. There is no realism in this novel and it is lacking in ironic or sarcastic unrealism to balance the imaginary universe these characters operate in.There are high points, however. At times there are very real and powerful emotional pangs that the reader can feel from the pages. Sadly they are few and far between. The book is laced with too much descriptive narrative regarding name brands and designer items, hopelessly imprisoned in the 80's, to read with continuity. There are loose ends and grand excursions taken by the characters that don't make much sens and seem to have been added by the editors either from another work or to fill out the novel. All of which combined makes it difficult to get through this novel without giving up.If this book was intended to be a high line romance novel it missed the mark. If it was a sardonic, satirical treatment of one it missed even more so. If it was intended as a corporate love story, there was too little knowledge about the subject matter on the part of the writer and editors to make it work. Again, difficult to believe considering who wrote it."},{"Title":"Ladybird","review":"As we wend our way through Fraley's sorrow and survival, we sense her strength: strength derived from a firm foundation in God's word.

A book you'll curl up with over and over."},{"Title":"Ladybird","review":"In the Old West, out in the Badlands, a young girl has grown up like a rare wildflower, under the sole and loving guidance of her mother. Her father's death has left the young girl and her ill mother at the mercy of criminals who threaten them on a daily basis.One day, however, when young Fraley MacPherson's mother dies, she makes her escape, armed with an old woolen bag containing all her worldly possessions and her mother's well-worn Bible. Within its pages are the names of relatives who live in New York.Wending her way amongst the mountain passes and forests, taking refuge in trees along the way, the young girl manages to stay ahead of the men who seek her.Her journey takes her into unlikely places and toward accepting the occasional kindness of strangers, until the day she meets a young man from the East. He offers his return train ticket to New York, since he'll be staying on awhile, and manages to persuade the proud young woman that she'll be doing him a favor. Of course, he is handsome and appealing, and has just the right approach to overcoming the young woman's resistance to his help.Ladybird (Grace Livingston Hill #55)is a book I read as a young person, along with many other titles by this author. I was recently reminded of these books by another blogger, and decided to reread a few, to see if they appealed to me at all these days.While many aspects to the book seemed a bit Puritanical for my current tastes, they also seemed quite appropriate for the times in which they were set. And I really enjoyed reading about young Fraley's courageous escape from tyranny, which is a theme that appeals to me.Despite the parts of the book that sometimes seemed unrealistic and overly romantic, I did enjoy rapidly turning pages to rediscover how the young girl would finally capture her own happy ending.Four stars."},{"Title":"QUESTION OF MAX (Kate Fansler Novels (Paperback))","review":"This is a slow-paced, detail-heavy mystery novel that will please people who really love and know literature. Loaded with imagery and references from the classic 19th and 20th century canon, it might be difficult to truly enjoy or appreciate by someone who does not. The novel is written in very intellectual and academic prose (lots of big vocabulary words -- after all the heroine is an English professor), but is nevertheless appropriate and entertaining, not too dry. The mystery unfolds extremely slowly -- in fact, until the second half of the book you are not really sure what the mystery IS -- but there is something tantalizing about this, and it makes the book feel as much like a &quot;regular&quot; novel as a mystery (so even someone who does not usually read mysteries might very well enjoy it). The last quarter of the book speeds up dramatically, with lots of unanswered questions, new clues, and even a bit of old-fashioned suspense; the ending is simple but somehow seems to fit just right. I did enjoy this book, and it was a quick and pleasant read, but I can warn you in advance that if you do not like literature, or reading very intellectual novels, you will probably find it boring. If the story of an upper-class English professor trying to solve a mystery surrounding a recently deceased British writer appeals to you, however, then pick this one up and give it a go. It's not an amazing book and it won't blow you away, but it's not expensive, and it's certainly good reading for a rainy day or a long trip."},{"Title":"QUESTION OF MAX (Kate Fansler Novels (Paperback))","review":"Kate's colleague and friend Max manages to find her in her Berkshire hideaway.

I haven't really done any repairs based on this book yet, but it seems to be an okay book. It has different sections on each of the major systems of the car viz. cooling, heating and ac systems, fuel and exhaust systems, engine electrical systems, emissions and engine control systems, transmission systems, suspension and steering systems, chassis electrical system etc.I basically bought this book hoping to be able to troubleshoot a trouble code (P0183) that made my 99 Mustang's &quot;Service Engine&quot; light to come on. This code is not listed in the OBD II codes list in this book. According to my scan tool, this code means &quot;Engine Fuel Temperature Sensor A shows a high input value&quot;. This book does not have any mention of an Engine Fuel Temperature Sensor. So, I have to warn you there may be a few things missing in this book.I think one essential section that should be in any of today's auto repair manuals is a section on the possible trouble codes and step-by-step troubleshooting for each code. In the 3 cars that I have owned in the last 6 years, one common issue has been the &quot;Service Engine&quot; light coming on out of the blue. Dealers make big bucks just debugging the OBD code. My dealer charged me 120 for just reading the code and finding out what is wrong.Also, I felt that many of the pictures are too close-up making it extremely difficult to determine the relative location on the car."},{"Title":"Haynes Ford Mustang 1994 thru 1999 (Haynes Repair Manuals)","review":"this book is really good, i would have given it 5 stars but most pictures are for 3.8 liter and 4.6 liter cobras and i own a 5.0 liter 94 GT. they describe things well including potential problems with malfunctioning parts, which is good for diagnosis. i have saved 3 to 4 hours on labor by doing some jobs myself. i am somewhat mechchanically inclined. i have never changed my own oil (too messy and i wouldn't know how to get rid of it), but i did replace my EGR valve and sensor, my fuel pump relay, my belt, O2 sensor, spark plugs and wires. the book always tells you when you might be getting in over your head, and says, let a pro do this part. i have learned alot, and saved more."},{"Title":"Haynes Ford Mustang 1994 thru 1999 (Haynes Repair Manuals)","review":"I have used this book for reference on several projects. One was replacing all the suspension components, book told us how to do it the most difficult way possible. It seems when you look up each step, they assumed that is ALL you were doing. So for Spring removal, they told you to remove the front swing arms instead of just removing the struts. We wasted literally a day on one wheel stubbornly following the book.As for the rear end, all you had to do was drop the rear end, book wanted you to remove all the swing arms, torque struts, lines and brakes. All you needed to do was detach the shocks, loosen the lines and compress the springs, whole thing swings down. Book would have wasted hours of our time.Now I need to remove the starter on a Convertible, no pictures, no decent instructions, no diagrams. Remove 3 bolts and remove starter. LOL. how about, where are the bolts, how do you get to them, how do you even get the starter out through the welded cross brace ford installed on the convertible, how about at least mentioning you need to access it through the front fender liner to get to the THREE, not TWO bolts.There is no diagram for the fuses that I have been able to find. Half the Torque specs for the front end job were FAR higher than we could attain.There is a lot of good info but when a novice is doing the job the book really fails to deliver the details needed.

In short this book is *not* for beginners but the serious practioner who has absorbed and studied their form and who now want to deepen the martial aspect of their knowledge base through studying practical applications.I found this book a delight to read and while both deeply informative and thought provoking it was simultaneously accessable and practicle. Some photographs are occasionally too dark around the legs losing a little definition, due to the fact that while one person has a white shirt both have black pants. This is really a minor thing if you recognise the form being expressed, besides they put a white arrow for a black arrow when needed.I found the sections on Taiji fighting strategies and analysis of the Taiji fighting set to be instantly informative/gratifying and this is where I spent the bulk of my time when I first bought the book. There is an excellent 'training techniques' section for Push Hands, what follows after that is predominantly images of the Taiji applications themselves sometimes accompanied by a selection of non form driven alternatives! Excellent...I personally find a book like this invaluable being serious about Martial Taijiquan as opposed to the purely health dance aspect. I wouldn't recommend this book to the novice or anyone not interested in getting into the deepest realms of *real* Taijiquan, it will simply ask too much of you and without a teacher or master who fully understands the essence of this art as a fighting art you could find yourself doing yourself more harm than good.This book is a must for advanced Yang Stylers and well worth the price, find a training partner and begin training on your applications!Taijiguy,"},{"Title":"Tai Chi Chuan Martial Applications: Advanced Yang Style Tai Chi Chaun (Martial Arts-Internal)","review":"This is another good book from master Yang. I had previously read his tai chi chin na and Shaolin chin na books, and also his book on power in tai chi, which I'd found quite good, so I thought I'd try this book, too.I also have one of his videos showing well over 100 chin na applications, which can show the applications even better than any book can. But the books can give more complete information about theory, strategy, and the more abstruse concepts of tai chi such as jin or the different types of energy and power and force that can be used, Taoist concepts such as yin and yang, and so on, which Dr. Yang discusses too. In that sense books on the martial arts can still fulfill an important purpose even in a world of inexpensive martial arts videos which often aren't much more expensive than the books (especially if you pick them up used on A_azon or eB_y), and are far better for seeing the actual physical applications of the techniques.The book shows many of the applications of the tai chi movements, discusses other topics such as tai chi strategy, the morality of fighting, some tai chi theory and history, and a few miscellaneous other topics. Several dozen tai chi applications are shown. The pictures are easy to see except for the occasional photo where it's hard to interpret the action, but that's no different from any other martial arts book since almost all have at least a few photos with that problem.A brief aside here. I am a student of Hung Gar kung fu also, and the application on the cover of the book is similar to one of the tiger claw techniques in Hung Gar, although it's done from a lower bow stance. Actually, there are many similarities between tai chi and other shaolin techniques, in which case, one could ask what is the real difference between shaolin and tai chi, or even karate and the other arts?Well, ultimately in tai chi it all comes down to chi principles and the circulation of the chi. All the other aspects of tai chi such as relaxation, softness (actually more like hardness within softness, or wood within cotton), yielding, and so on, are ultimately related to that since using muscle power and too much strength is thought to block the chi. Hence, once reason tai chi postures open the joints and muscles is to prevent blockage of the chi at the joints. If you understand all that, you're doing pretty well.(Of course, this brings up the question of what chi really is about, but I don't propose to discuss the Taoist medical principles vs. western physiology and medicine here; I merely present the above facts and leave it up to the reader to decide their validity for himself).Although I liked the book, I have one quip, though, which is that I rate it four stars instead of five due to the fact that all the applications are against punches. Another writer here mentioned the same problem, and I agree. There are no applications against holds, locks, grabs, pushes, etc. They're all against punches. That's fine, but that basically makes the book a specialized monograph about only punching attacks rather than a book on the full diversity of possible defenses in tai chi.Perhaps it's meant to be used in conjunction with Dr. Yang's Tai Chi Chin Na book, which does show the uses of many of the postures against those sort of attacks. But I think some of these should have been shown also just for variety, and then the reader could be directed to the other book for the rest. However, it's still a good book and should be especially useful for the beginning to intermediate student."},{"Title":"Tai Chi Chuan Martial Applications: Advanced Yang Style Tai Chi Chaun (Martial Arts-Internal)","review":"This book is fantastic if you want to learn how to block a punch. Basically, almost every single attack in here is a punch. There isn't much intricate work regarding escapes, joint manipulations, throws, counters or anything like that. That to me, is a travesty, as anyone who purports to know about Tai Chi and tries to make money off a book about Tai Chi should at least explore the depth and versality of the 38 moves in the form.The later Analysis of the Fighting set has a few nice moves in there, but it's nothing you can't figure out after awhile (if it's not imminently obvious).The pics are in black and white. The fact that the \\"attacker\\" often wears black and Dr. Yang's pants are black (his shirt is white) makes it hard to tell what's going on in some of these pics. This is especially true when black motion arrows overlap the black clothing.It's an ok book, don't know if it was worth (the money) though.-(...)"},{"Title":"Tai Chi Chuan Martial Applications: Advanced Yang Style Tai Chi Chaun (Martial Arts-Internal)","review":"If you are looking for a book about Taiji martial theory and applications, this is a good read. The applications shown are clearly described, and obviously these aren't the only applications...it's up to you to discover more! There is a lot to this book besides the pictures...like the section on the morality of fighting is excellent, and something many martial artists don't realize/understand. It also includes some interesting things other books leave out, such as Taiji ball training, and the two-person fighting set.That said, it seems like some of the obvious applications are left out...perhaps because they are obvious? Another oddity for me is that while Dr. Yang seems to be a well-respected martial artist and author, his \\"Classical\\" Yang style form looks different in certain places from ANY Yang style I've seen or been taught. Maybe I just lack experience? But for that reason I wouldn't recommend the book as form reference.Finally, a big hit to the rating for me was that my book very quickly began to fall apart. The binding is terrible, so large chunks of pages separated and fell out.

As a near-beginner in Tai Chi (slightly over a year of instruction and practice), I found this book of only moderate use. I do find that I practice better if I envision the martial applications of the movements, rather than treating Tai Chi as a kind of dance. I'm not competent to judge its value for advanced students, but it's written clearly enough, and the illustrations rate a B-plus in my book. There are lots of them (good), and the text follows them (good), but the &quot;bad guy&quot; taken the fall is in black and it's often hard to see where the master has gripped him.

They are one of the more important new organizational forms. Despite the managerial and organizational challenges they undoubtedly present, there is no sign that alliances are a transient phenomenon. A survey based on 323 questionnaire responses and over 400 interviews with senior executives in 2000 indicated that alliances were \`expected to account for 16 percent to 25 percent of median company value within five years and, astonishingly, more than 40 percent of market value for one-quarter of companies' (Contractor and Lorange 2002: 4).Alliances are, along with outsourcing and virtual value-chains, one of the defining forms of modern networking among firms. As noted, they represent a clear break away from the internalized, hierarchical model of the firm, of which General Electric and IBM were salient examples in the 1980s. Today, leading corporations such as these have as many as 1,000 alliances. In the past, such corporations might have regarded alliances as a relatively peripheral activity, primarily for entering emerging country markets in which risks were high or government regulations required jVs or licensing agreements. Today, alliances are regarded as a means to achieving fundamental strategic objectives such as a strong market position, significant knowledge acquisition, and major cost reductions.This book attempts to take stock of current thinking on the subject of cooperative strategy. The focus will he on cooperation between firms, though many of the insights into establishing and managing interfirm cooperation can also be applied to partnerships between other types of organization. Alliances, which are partnerships between firms, are the normal agent for cooperative strategy. \\"they are often \`strategic' in the sense that they have been formed as a direct response to major strategic challenges or opportunitieswhich the partner firms face. Alliances are a means to an end, and consequently they are not necessarily formed with a long-term cooperative relationship in mind. But they may be established with this intention, the more so when the partners invest substantially in them. Once alliances are up and running, partners may also perceive unanticipated benefits from cooperation, such as mutual learning, which lead them to reevaluate it positively.However, alliances can also be formed with shorter-term objectives in view. A firm may intend to use an alliance as a means of appropriating competencies and knowledge from its partner, which it continues to regard as an actual or potential competitor. Or it may enter into an alliance as a way of taking out an option for the future in conditions of uncertainty-for example, entering an unfamiliar national market. Once it has mastered the uncertainty, it may no longer attach much value to continuing the cooperation.Whatever the underlying motivation for its formation, any alliance requires an ability to manage cooperation in order to generate returns to the partners. The ever-growing prevalence of alliances, and the need to understand the basis for their successful management, provides the main justification for the present book. It is informed by John Child's work on JVs in China and to a lesser extent Brazil and Eastern Europe, David Faulkner's work on strategic alliances between companies in developed nations, and Stephen Tallman's work on understanding the processes and motivations for alliance strategies. It also attempts to integrate what the authors believe to be the salient ideas of other writers on cooperative strategy in tackling some of the key issues currently under debate in the field. A number of important ideas emerge from the writers' efforts in this endeavor, which are perhaps worth capturing before the reader embarks on the task of a detailed reading of the book:Cooperative strategy is not new; it has always been with us. It means what it suggests, namely the achievement of an agreement and a plan to work together; not the giving of orders down hierarchies. Firms embarking upon alliances with other firms need to keep this in the forefront of their consciousness when devising systems and controls, and activating them in the joint enterprise. This book, whilst concentrating on perhaps the pre-eminent form of cooperation-namely, the various forms of strategic alliance-encompasses other forms of cooperation as well that are met in business activity, even down to the humble distributor or supplier agreement.Commitment and trust are the key attitudes most strongly associated with success in alliances. No amount of energy and clear direction will compensate for their absence. And it should be noted that commitment can exist without trust and vice versa, but both are necessary for a lasting and stable relationship.Strategic alliances, including JVs, collaborations, and consortia, are at base all about organizational learning, and should be structured towards that end. However, many other types of cooperation, such as networks or virtual corporations, are primarily about skill substitution-that is, Company A cooperates with Company B because it sees that its partner can exercise a particular skill better than it can.Other forms of cooperative strategy, such as virtual organizations, networks, and outsourced corporations, are about capability substitution. Their strength lies intheir specialization, adaptability, and flexibility, but not necessarily in the learning opportunities they afford.Cooperative enterprises do not do away with the need for intelligent purpose, a brain, and a central nervous (information) system if they are to achieve competitive advantage in relation to integrated corporations that more self-evidently have these characteristics.To cooperate does not mean to allow all proprietary information to pass unchecked to the partner. As Richardson (1972) warns: 'Firms form partners for the dance but, when the music stops, they can change them.'Issues of control need to be addressed, but more subtly than in hierarchies, as too great a degree of control in cooperative enterprises stifles innovation and motivation, and can lead to the breakdown of the cooperation.A successful alliance is one that evolves into something more than was perhaps foreseen at the outset. Conscious attempts must be made to cause the alliance to develop if it is to attract the best people, and contribute most to the partner companies.The interface between the two (and sometimes more) company cultures is the crucible of potential achievement. Sensitivity to each other's cultures is vital to effective joint operation. Its absence leads to a failed alliance, however great the potential economic synergies between the partners.Information technology (IT) makes the task of coordinating cooperative strategy that much easier, but it cannot and must not be allowed to substitute for bonding between cooperating company executives.These and other key lessons from the research behind this hook are developed in more detail in the chapters that follow.Part I is concerned with the nature of cooperation and its role in strategy. Chapter 2 outlines the main perspectives from economics that contribute to an understanding of cooperative strategy. The theory of cooperative strategy is related to market-power theory, transaction-cost economics, agency theory, resource-based theory, transaction value theory, real options theory, and increasing-returns theory. Chapter 3 continues to address major theoretical models of cooperation, but from managerial and organizational perspectives, such as game theory, strategic-management theory, resource dependence, social network theory, and organizational theory. It summarizes the relevance of these theories and draws out the complementarities between them.Cooperation depends on trust between partners. Chapter 4 presents the insights into trust that can be derived from psychological and sociological research. This identifies the factors on which trust can he based and through which it can develop. The first step is to find a basis on which the risks of depending on partners become mutually acceptable.As the partners get to know more about each other, this improved understanding should breed further mutual confidence. Eventually, the cooperation may become firmly established on the basis of genuine personal friendships between the key participants. These elements in trust development can support the phases through which cooperation within an alliance can develop. The chapter closes with guidelines for developing trust within cooperative relationships between firms.Part II is concerned with how cooperation between firms is established and the various forms it can take. Chapter 5 introduces the idea of an alliance process by which two firms find each other for a cooperative venture and discusses the principal motives behind a cooperative strategy. It considers the most common reasons for setting up a collaborative activity with a competitive or complementary firm. The various types of resource and skill deficiency are rated in relation to their importance as stimuli to cooperative activity. It is emphasized that it is not only competence vulnerabilities, but also the desire to spread risk and the need to reach markets fast, whilst 'windows of opportunity' last, that drive organizations to set up cooperative arrangements. Strategic, transaction-costreducing, and organizational learning motives for cooperative activity are compared and contrasted (Kogut 1988).Chapter 6 considers the criteria to be highlighted in selecting a partner and deciding upon the appropriate form the alliance should take. Once a collaborative activity has been decided upon, it is necessary to find an appropriate partner. This chapter attempts to operationalize the strategic-fit/cultural-fit matrix. It emphasizes that the possible achievement of synergies through the use of complementary assets and competencies underlies the concept of strategic fit (Geringer 1991). It also draws the reader's attention to the need for intercultural sensitivity if the alliance is to succeed. The second half of the chapter considers the question of collaborative forms, and which one to select. The key characteristics of the various forms of cooperative activity are considered, as well as the circumstances in which each form is most appropriately adopted. In addition to the major strategic alliance forms of the joint venture, the collaboration and the consortium, the flexible nature of collaborative networks is discussed.Chapter 7 addresses the question of how to negotiate in an alliance situation, and how to value your partner's and your own prospective contributions to the enterprise. It emphasizes that, whereas in a takeover situation, the negotiators are single-mindedly concerned to achieve the best price for their company-the highest or lowest price depending on the side of the negotiating table-this is not the case in an alliance. Unless both partners are concerned that the other has a good deal, the alliance will not prosper over time. A so-called win-win situation is sought. The problem of contribution valuation, however, is truly more an art than a science.Chapter 8 looks at the strengths and limitations of network forms in greater detail. It considers the varied types of network that form the basis of much cooperative strategy. Networks are the loosest form of alliance between companies. At their weakest they represent a well-developed communication system within an industry that enables companies operating in that industry to keep abreast of developments. They are often crystallized in trade associations. In d stronger form they represent a ready-made band of would-be cooperating companies willing to tackle commercialopportunities together without setting up formal links that may compromise the individuality of networking firms. Dominant-partner and equal-partner networks are compared and contrasted.Chapter 9 addresses the concept of the IT-based virtual corporation in the information economy. The \`Virtual Corporation' is the name for the network and F1'-orientated form of organization based around centers of excellence in particular competencies. It can be created very rapidly to meet specific, sometimes transitory, sets of circumstances. It can equally easily be dismantled and re-formed as circumstances and profit opportunities change. This new concept is discussed and its strengths and limitations assessed. Many strategic alliances demonstrate characteristics of the virtual corporation.In Part III different aspects of the management of cooperative activity are reviewed. Chapter 10 discusses the general and overall management of alliances. It emphasizes that the management of alliances differs in its essential nature from that of unitary companies. The ability to give instructions is replaced by the need to seek areas of mutual agreement and to develop constituencies behind a course of action (Kanter 1989). It is noted that appropriate management styles will differ, particularly in the circumstances of a JV, which can be treated much like an ordinary company, and a collaboration, where a sensitive boundary-spanning mechanism is necessary.Chapter 11 looks at control as an issue in cooperation. It recognizes that control is not possible in a complete sense in alliances because of the consensual nature of alliance activities, but also that some control by each partner is necessary if the partners are not going to feel themselves to he in the hands of total uncertainty. The importance therefore is to specify controls that are at once clear yet flexible.Chapter 12 addresses the issue of alliance corporate governance, which has been relatively neglected in the literature on alliances. The question of corporate governance arises particularly with equity JVs in which parent companies as owners appoint managers to run the ventures as their agents. This chapter suggests key elements in an analysis of JV governance, focusing on partner preferences. It adopts a broad definition of corporate governance as the process of control over and within the firm (i.e. the JV) that aims to reduce risks to its owners and to ensure that its activities bring a stream of acceptable returns to those owners in the long term.Chapter 13 deals with organizational learning. It discusses the role of organizational learning in all its aspects as a primary driver in cooperative activity. It distinguishes different forms of learning in alliances, including learning about, from, and with an alliance partner. Learning is divided into technical, systemic, and strategic components and the implications of these distinctions for alliances are identified. Particular attention is given to the mechanisms and policies that help promote and transmit learning within alliances.Chapter 14 addresses the specific area of human resources. It considers some of the key human resource issues that arise when personnel from different countries and different cultures are brought to work together in a new collaborative environment. The building of local management teams, the nature of training, and the role of the international manager are discussed, as is the role of human resource management (FIRM) as a tool of control within alliances.Chapter 15 is concerned with culture. It is now widely recognized that one of the most common reasons for the failure of alliances is the clash of the partners' contrasting company cultures. These can be reinforced by differences between national cultures in an international alliance. Yet there is evidence to suggest that the issue of cultural congruence is not high on the checklist of companies seeking partners. The chapter discusses the nature of cultural differences and how they can present barriers to performance and to bonding. It also considers measures to overcome such problems. The chapter deals in particular with two distinct forms of potential cultural problem-that between two partners from the developed world, and that between a developed world company and a partner from the developing world such as China, Central and Eastern Europe, and Latin America. In discussing these collaborative configurations, the 'culture problem' will be assessed in its broader institutional context.Chapter 16 looks more specifically at how to manage cooperative strategy in relation to emerging economies. Cooperation between companies in developed and emerging economies is a particularly fast-expanding feature of global business relationships. The chap-ter discusses this issue with particular reference to Brazil, China, and India, and seeks to identify ways in which such collaborations differ from those between firms that are both in developed countries.Part IV addresses the question of how cooperative activity can achieve positive performance, however defined, and he helped to evolve through time. Chapter 17 examines the issue of alliance performance. Unlike unitary forms of business organization, alliances, whether formal or informal, often face differing objectives and so find success and failure difficult to assess. Objectives may be less economic in scope than for other organizations, payoffs may be indirect through influences on other organizations, and economic performance is seldom reported directly. These considerations make both academic study and practical oversight difficult and challenging.Chapter 18 emphasizes the importance of the role of evolution in the success of alliances. This implies the growth of the alliance in terms of new projects and new responsibilities. It is maintained that all alliances suffer potentially from entropy (Thorelli 1986), and that, unless the bonds brought about by the creation of the cooperative activity are constantly attended to and strengthened, there is an ever-present risk that the alliance will decline in importance to the partners, attract mediocre staff, and steadily become marginalized in the partners' priorities.Chapter 19 presents some closing reflections on the ways in which progress needs to he made in bringing cooperative strategy further into the mainstream of management thinking. It gives reasons why cooperation between organizations is increasingly appropriate for operating in a complex global competitive economy.As a whole, the hook provides a broad view of the practical and theoretical literature concerning cooperative strategies and the alliance and network organizational forms that are the outcome of these strategies. While based on the research of the authors and representing their views of cooperation, it summarizes and evaluates the work of many other authors as well. It is tied to the academic literature, but is also grounded in cases developed by the authors and others and addresses practical issues of alliance management as well as alliance studies. It can he and has been, used as a textbook in MBA and executive programs."},{"Title":"German Sectarians of Pennsylvania 1708-1800 (2 Volume set)","review":"This book's actual subtitle is: &quot;A critical and legendary history&quot;. Sachse does not differentiate between fact and legend: it has been up to the researchers this past century to separate the two. One must read these volumes with care: Sachse was out to prove certain things about Ephrata, including a tenuous Rosicrucian connection, and often did misleading translations, misdirections, and out and out boondoggling. He re-drew or had re-drawn a picture of Jeremiah found in der Christen ABC Buch for his own volume: just as the picture was made less &quot;primitive&quot;, and a window removed from the Zion Hill building, so too he laundered information. (Never let a nasty fact interfere with a good theory...) I recommend you read Jeffrey Bach's excellent doctoral dissertation &quot;The Song of the Turtledove&quot; available from UMI, and my own book &quot;Music of the 18th c community of the solitary at Ephrata&quot; due out from AR-MUSA in 2002/3 for solid research that clarifies some of the &quot;legendary history&quot;. Also, a new (brief) history with excellent new photos by Craig Benner is available from the site museum store. Otherwise, this is a valuable document in that much that might have been lost to us over time has been collected and maintained; certainly Sachse's work stirred an interest in this settlement that might otherwise never have preserved. The volumes, in 19th c fashion, are profusely illustrated, and much of the information is very good. Casual reader, however: beware: Do not use this as the end-all of authoritative work on Ephrata. Unfortunately, much in print today is still derivative of Sachse, so tread carefully. Finally, I suggest you visit the Ephrata Historic Site, well maintained by the PHMC; if you are fortunate enough to meet with Michael Showalter, Museum Educator, you can put to rest many of Sachse's misleading &quot;legends&quot;. I was fortunate to be named &quot;Scholar in Residence&quot; for Ephrata by the PHMC, and am delighted that the site actually acts on new information, including Stephen Warfel's excellent publications on his archaeological digs there, the re-naming of two buildings at the site, and my own new and more accurate transcriptions of the original music. Thanks to AMS for reprinting this book and making it available again! It is definitely worth collecting!"},{"Title":"German Sectarians of Pennsylvania 1708-1800 (2 Volume set)","review":"I did write a review... but I don't think it came through. Here we go again: AMS did a great service in reprinting this set. However, the subtitle of the books is &quot;A Critical and Legendary History&quot;. Sachse never differentiated between the two, often presenting theory and legend as fact. Researchers have been correcting or validating his findings for a century. He did, for example, doctor or have doctored a drawing from der Christen ABC Buch, of Jeremiah: the picture, reproduced in these volumes, was made less primitive; shoes were added, the window removed from the cupola of the Zion Hill building. As he laundered the picture, so too did he launder information. A letter from Regnier was combined into an account of a &quot;mystical ritual&quot;. That ritual was never written of by Regnier, who was wrote the letter before the Zion Hill building was built. Sachse was out to prove certain theories, including a tenuous link with the Rosicrucians. His work must be carefully sifted, as must much of what is currently in print and derivative of these volumes. As Scholar in residence at Ephrata, I can assure the reader that, while these volumes are worth having, they must not be considered as faultless and definitive. I recommend Jeffery Bach's excellent doctoral dissertation &quot;the Voice of the Turtledove&quot; from UMI, my own volume &quot;music from the 18th c community of the solitary at Ephrata&quot; due from AR-MUSA in 2002, and the new, beautifully illustrated pamplet of Ephrata available from the museum store.

These included terror and lynching, working with northern businesses and unions to cap the number of blacks leaving the state for better job opportunities and using the judicial system to have a pool of cheap labor sitting in jails.Through it all, leaders from all walks of life emerged in the black community. Ortiz explains the various aspects surrounding the birth of black organizing and the small victories from boycotts, self-defense groups and other means to achieve the goal of having full rights under the law.It ultimately centers on the right to vote and how the white power structure used every tool in its Jim Crow arsenal in 1920 to try and break the will of blacks and destoy the ever-expanding civil rights movement.A time in U.S. History avoided in most books covering this time period, Ortiz again demonstrates that those who forget the past can never set a true course in the future. Emancipation Betrayed is an important book for those seeking the truth surrounding this nation in a proper historical context."},{"Title":"Emancipation Betrayed: The Hidden History of Black Organizing and White Violence in Florida from Reconstruction to the Bloody Election of 1920 (American Crossroads)","review":"The struggle by blacks to obtain their civil rights in Florida is not well-known. In fact, many have seen blacks' efforts to obtain their civil rights there as weak and ineffectual after the Civil War only becoming powerful after World War I. Paul Ortiz supports his theme that blacks, in fact, engaged in generations-long efforts to force whites to recognize their basic civil rights by showing all of the methods they used to combat white racism and violence. He shows that blacks used organized groups as their most effective tool, including secret societies, lodges, churches, labor unions, black veterans' posts and women's groups to battle white racism and violence. Too, black women took a key role not only within most of these groups but also by individual efforts. By his employment of personal accounts including oral histories and personal interviews, as well as many other primary and secondary sources, he gives an in-depth account of the history of the continuous struggle by African-Americans for civil rights in Florida from antebellum times to the election of 1920.Ortiz begins by showing that many blacks fled to the Spanish-owned colony of Florida prior to 1763 when it came under British rule. Escaped slaves, many from the British Carolinas, helped the Spanish fight against British forces then joined with Seminole Indians to battle United States militia or federal troops seeking to recapture escaped slaves and displace the Indians. Many escaped slaves settled in Gracie Real de Santa Teresa de Mose (Fort Mose), the first all black settlement in the future United States. This organized settlement showed that blacks must form groups for effective self protection and for mutual aid.After regaining Florida from Britain following Britain's defeat in the American Revolution, Spain ceded it to the United States in 1819; it became a state in 1845. Before becoming a state, U.S. armed forces engaged in three wars resulting in the removal of most Seminole Indians and decreasing Florida's attraction as a haven for runaway slaves. Violence against blacks in Florida had its beginnings in these and earlier vicious battles. However, escaped slaves early use of Florida a destination was a precursor of later black attempts for freedom.During the early Civil War, escaped slaves made desperate efforts to escape to Union ships and to Union lines and later many slaves joined the Union military to fight their former owners. After the largest battle in Florida at Olustee, some Confederate soldiers killed black Union prisoners continuing the legacy of violence against blacks and presaging the violence found during the generations following the war. But experience as soldiers fighting for their freedom helped many blacks after the war as they were forced to take up arms to defend themselves and fellow blacks.After the war, blacks hoped that in addition to emancipation, they would find unfettered access to farmland, jobs, public schools and the right to vote. However, Reconstruction gave only limited success obtaining these goals but one of the most important was the formation of religious and other mutual aid groups for support. These early efforts at organizing were begun to counter the violence and terror whites employed to resubjugate the newly freed blacks.Some of the early post Civil War groups promoted solidarity among blacks by celebrating Emancipation Day each January 1, and by having organized ceremonies honoring veterans. Other activities maintained and promoted black history of contributions blacks made to the U.S. including those made in the Revolutionary and Civil Wars. In addition, efforts were made to ensure that memories of the horrors of slavery were not forgotten during these ceremonies. Black groups pursued every avenue in their quest to fight white domination and terrorism. Unions organized strikes and other actions to try to get better wages and working conditions as well as respect on the job. Churches and women's groups organized successful boycotts such as against segregated public transit during the streetcar boycotts in several Florida cities. Secret societies not only fostered mutual aid and respect but like many of the other groups provided for decent burials for their members and support for those who were ill.Many blacks were often members of more than one group, e.g., one could be a member of a church, a union and a secret organization simultaneously. Ad hoc committees and groups were sometimes formed in response to volatile situations as in armed black responses to white vigilantes. As blacks made concerted efforts to enforce their suffrage rights under the 15th (and later the 19th) amendment, these already organized groups were immediately available as organizing centers and made them the logical places to which blacks could turn. They served as bases for political action groups since only through politics could blacks fight local, state and federal white racism as the established groups created spaces within which these new efforts could form and grow.These groups were the fundamental bodies which formed black culture and society in Florida and when combined with the extraordinary efforts of black women, they were in the forefront of black resistance to white tyranny. Ortiz successfully shows that these groups were engaged for generations fighting against white racism and terror with more or less effect. The culmination of the various groups' efforts was the remarkable efforts made in the 1920 elections. Blacks were recruited, registered, and then escorted to polling locations but due to the pervasive efforts of whites including pervasive use of violence and intimidation through the KKK and local law enforcement authorities, opening of mail to detect black plans, unfair enforcement of election laws, poll taxes, and black vigilante actions, their efforts failed. Despite this failure the progress made by these groups and women in general was remarkable."},{"Title":"Emancipation Betrayed: The Hidden History of Black Organizing and White Violence in Florida from Reconstruction to the Bloody Election of 1920 (American Crossroads)","review":"This book is more of a documentary of that time in our American History I wish could be rewound and done another way. It's tragic how white's treated people of color, especially our black citizens.

Blacks fought in the civil war, yet were not recognized because of their skin color.

If you have not, I would highly suggest you start with Proust's novel before moving along to insight on his thinking and/or writing. Truthfully, this book doesn't give away that much information about Proust the man, but contains a great deal on Proust the artist. Many of the essays contained within were published in the journals of the day, especially Le Figaro and La Revue Blanche, and are therefore written in a public style, carefully considered, analysing different topics from a mainly objective stance. In other words, this book documents less his private life and thoughts, which one may find in the many volumes of his correspondences, than his public, artistic life. This is worth mentioning because 'Contre Saint-Beauve' is one giant critique - an inadequate word - of the notion that an artist's biographical life is at all related to his artistic life.'Contre Saint-Beauve' is an ethos that he developed several years earlier than his novel, though it plays a large part in the novel (and was not published until long after his death). This philosophy is partially explained in the later volumes of 'In Search Of Lost Time' when the narrator ruminates on Vinteuil's genius. Indeed, many of the characters and scenes in Proust's later novel find their early beginnings in a strange series of sketches that pop up throughout this essay. It was probably one of Proust's last stabbings at an academic or literary career, before he began his work on Swann's Way, but it proved to be very fertile ground.Now, it's true that I originally bought this book for 'C S-B' alone, but I was very pleased to find that there were around two dozen other essays included. None of them match the length or depth of Saint-Beauve, but many of them are still very beautiful and incisive ('The Wane of Inspiration' is a particular favorite). Aside from a handful of random Proustian musings, the other essays deal with specific writers like Stendhal, Goethe and Tolstoi, or specific painters like Monet, Chardin and Rembrandt, or other such important figures of the era (even Robert de Montesquieu).In brief, this book is definitely reserved for those who are already very familiar with 'In Search of Lost Time,' for much of the main essay is profoundly related to the novel, and much of the prose seems to be working towards the style he would later adopt. This book reveals very little of his personal life (see his theories in 'C S-B'), and stands independently as art.

It's an over-the-top gangster/vampire/biker/bad-cop/worse-cop shoot-'em-up blood-with-extra-guts sort of thing.It has some problems, though. A note in the front warns you that it was written for a UK audience and that you will just have to get over the fact that 'realize' is not spelled, but rather spelt 'realise.' That's not all you have to get over.The story takes place almost entirely in the (presumably) fictitious town of Santa Mondego. At first you can't figure whether this city is in the southwestern US or in northern Mexico somewhere. A little later the US government sends a spook to investigate and you get the impression it must be in US territory because this guy isn't an international spy type; he seems more of a domestic spook. Who knows? One impression that you definitely do not get is that Santa Mondego is in the British Isles--not from the descriptions, anyway. If you were to read only the dialog, however, you might very well come to that conclusion. The speech of these hard-bitten, sun-baked, Spanish-surnamed banditos is oozing British slang, colloquialisms and dialogical idiosyncrasies.The thing that will bug people who have passed a science course at some point in their lives is that the bad guys threaten to change the orbit of the moon so that it orbits the sun rather than the earth. This is supposed to cause an \\"eternal eclipse\\" of the sun over Santa Mondego which will turn it into permanent Vampireville. Well, get out your globe and your orange and take the shade off your lamp and work that one out. To have a permanent eclipse over a particular point on earth, not only do the earth and the moon have to be in perfectly synchronous concentric orbits (presumably what the bad guys want to accomplish), but the rotation of the earth on its axis needs to change from once a day to once a year so that one side of the earth (the side with Santa Mondego) perpetually faces the sun so that the sunlight can be perpetually blocked by the moon. This leaves the other side of the earth in perpetual freezing darkness. Maybe that's the point. It left me shaking my head.The other really noticeable wart is that an ancient, mysterious, hand written book that was begun in the first century AD and completed over the course of many centuries can be checked out of the library and read by anyone. What choices did we have in 50 AD? Aramaic? Hebrew? Greek? Latin? This is some pretty sophisticated citizenry here in old Santa Mondego. But, of course, once you let the vampires out of the zip-lock bag and into the mixing bowl, you really don't need to account for anything anymore. With anchovies in the chocolate chip cookies no one's going to notice that the raisins were a bit dodgy.Anyway, I found the inconsistencies and such more endearing than annoying. It was a hoot. Robert Rodriguez needs to get the rights to this thing and make it into a movie just as it is. Set it in a city on the US-Mexican border and film it wherever he filmed Once Upon A Time In Mexico . . . with all British actors. It could be a hoot. And I exist to be entertained, so get on it, Bob!"},{"Title":"The Book with No Name","review":"I have to give this book five stars for one reason only: I haven't even finished reading it and already i have people queueing up to read it because it i've spoken about how good it is. It is turning into one of the best books i have read in the past two years!!! I don't want it to end.The characters are well thought out and the writer has managed to tie the humour in very well. Sometimes the writer has had me laughing out loud. He builds the tension up very well and makes you increasingly more desperate to meet the much talked about, Bourbon Kid. The book reads like a western; murder, women and hard as nails characters all looking for the coveted blue stone, the eye of the moon.If you like action, humour and suspense all tied up into one plot i strongly recommend this book. I very much doubt you will be disappointed."},{"Title":"The Book with No Name","review":"I'm getting near the end of 'The Book With No Name' (been reading it for 2 days) and I've enjoyed the ride.I must say I'm having trouble understanding those low reviews. A lot of characters are introduced in the course of the book, but they are all memorable so I've had no trouble keeping them straight.The book reminds me of a serial story where a tightly written episode is published that is short and has a hook to keep the reader coming back. And that's probably what it is. My understanding was this was originally published on the internet & it was probably done a chapter at a time.I'd recommend getting the book and read it in the spirit it was intended, as a wild romp. We're not talking Dickins or Chaucer here. But then that was never the intent.The closest I can think of is the bar scene in the movie El Mariachi by Robert Rodriguez. The tension builds quickly and then never lets up. This is an action movie put on paper.One other note: If you love stories that have a lot of Pop Culture references, you may appreciate this book for all the references too. None of them are too obscure now, but 20 years from now people picking up the Book With No Name may be puzzled by a good many of them."},{"Title":"The Book with No Name","review":"This is an extremely dark and often creepy \\"under your skin\\" type horror / crime thriller. It crosses many different genres but once the story is established and begins to unravel it's a total page turner. Set in a mysterious town / city it follows the lives of a number of different characters who's paths cross throughout. Many of them have dark secrets hidden away and no one is quite what they seem. Expertly crafted and at times blackly humourous The Book With No Name is a modern day horror with it's roots firmly established in the realms of early Stephen King. There are nod's to books like Salem's Lot and It, but also influences notably from modern day stuff like The Ring. Full of interesting deep characters and frighteningly real scenes that left me wanting to sleep with the light on, this is well worth a look."},{"Title":"The Book with No Name","review":"You really don't need to know much more than that. What else do you expect from a book written by both Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez? Yes, that's what this is...I can't believe no one else knew that, but hey,I suppose the comparisons were right on the money, lol.If you like Tarantino, Rodriguez, and horror-comedy-shoot-em-ups, you will like this book."},{"Title":"The Book with No Name","review":"This is one of the best books that I have read in quite some time. I do not want to give anything away, so I will only say that you should settle down with a cup of cocoa (or your beverage of choice) and get ready for a great, fun read!!!"},{"Title":"The Book with No Name","review":"I really, really wanted to like this book! I think the plot is great and I like the characters but you can tell it was written by an amateur. I gave it 3 stars because if the plot was as aweful as the author's writing skills, I would have given it 1 star. I do have to say it would make a great movie! Reminds me of a Planet terror or Dusk Til Dawn type movie."},{"Title":"The Book with No Name","review":"After reading the fantastic reviews of this book on Amazon I bought this book for my boyfriend because it looked like something he might like (he's a big fan of Steven King's Gunslinger series). When the book arrived I flipped through it and immediately decided not to give it to him. It is clearly self-published and looks it (very cheap flimsy cover). It is also exceptionally poorly written. And don't get me wrong - I was not expecting a literary master piece, the plot synopsis made it clear it was going to be a rather silly splatter-fest, but I did harbour hopes (mostly from the five star reviews!!) that it would actually be readable. My conclusion is that the other people who have reviewed this book must be friends of the author and trying to prop up sales. I have never written an Amazon review before but given the wildly inaccurate reviews of this book I felt morally obliged to try and balance the scales in the hope that I can prevent someone else making the same mistake I did. This book is expensive by Amazon's standards. Do yourself a favour and give it a skip. My copy is going straight to a second hand book store to try and at least recoup some of the money I spent on it."},{"Title":"The Book with No Name","review":"This was non stop action from start to finish. Laugh out loud funny at times and down right dark and scary at others. I was gripped right through to the end when the truth behind the deaths of everyone who ever read the book was revealed. Brilliant stuff."},{"Title":"The Book with No Name","review":"I really have no idea how I came to have this book in my possesion I think I saw that it was highly recommended on amazon, and for good reason. This book is in my top ten. I got this book on a monday and finished reading the next day. I then read the first chapter to about ten of my friends and they all wanted to borrow. Some people even went out and bought the book that night. I really want to find out who this author is. He was really discriptive, but without being boring. Every chapter is about 4-5 pages long and sucks you in so much that you can't help but read the next chapter. You will not be able to put this book down. I have now been reading this book out loud every night to my roommates and friends and they love it, cause I am so into the characters. You will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"The Book with No Name","review":"I'm a sucker for these kinda popcorn books. It reads like a screenplay to me. It's a fun read and kinda a good roller coaster ride. Another reviewer mentioned Tarintino and it did feel like \\"From Dusk to Dawn\\" to me, but all the plot points made it a much tighter story. It would make a great movie. Funny, action packed, and a good page turner. I say it on a \\"recommended shelf\\" at the airport book store in Heathrow and made a note to pick it up when I got home, Really glad I did.This book led me into reading all the Dresden Files series.Writing this note about this book reminds me to grab the next book \\" Eye of the Moon\\" to see if it's as fun. Some times you just want a quick action book when your on a coast to coast flight. Too many books, too little time."},{"Title":"The Book with No Name","review":"The Book With No Name is a damn good piece of writing. It pays homage not just to Quentin Tarintino and Robert Rodriguez, but also Riddley and Tony Scott. yes homage, this book moves along like bad chinese through your system and carry's even more explosive force.The writing style is perfect for telling the story and moves at an excellent pace.As for the story itself, you have a mess of characters of all descriptions from The Bourbon Kid to the bad arse monks to.......well, you should really read the book for yourself because much of the enjoyment comes from the reveals throughout the story until you reach the climax.I can easily see this as a grindhouse style movie."},{"Title":"The Book with No Name","review":"You may be asking yourselves, \\"How good is 'The Book with No name' if the author is anonymous and the cover for it is very basic?\\" The answer, Really Good!The begining chapter of the book had me hooked and determined to read the entire 280 page book. Right away we are introduced to a world filled with corruption, mischeif, mayhem, dark humor, and some rad undead characters. What branches into a legend revolving around a man only know as 'The Bourbon Kid.' Sounds like a western, right? Well that's just the tip of the ice burg. Along the way, after 5 long years after a massive shoot-out in a bar called The Tapioca, Characters begin to gravitate toward the town of Santa Mondego. A woman wakes up from a five year coma, a mysterious detective comes to town sniffing around, Two hubal Monks are in search of a precious stone known as 'the eye of the moon.'The writing style of this literary masterpiece is very different from the run of the mill novel. The Text isn't justifyed to the right, leaving jagged edges but giving the book an original feel. There are some words that are spelled differently but it's mainly due to the fact that the author is no doubt british. And the diaologue is thick and sweet like warm fudge on a cold winter day. Each chapter was better than the next. This book gives you exactly what you deserve from a novel this thick: Tension, suspense, anxious, nail-biting scenes. Each scene is cinema-screen worthy and memorable even after your done reading the book. This book is definitly among my \\"Books I will re-read just for fun\\" section.Do not be fooled by the cover, this book is truly an original novel. I had so much fun reading it, I found myself reading 30 to 60 pages at a time. It's just that good. And the best thing about this book is that the characters aren't flat. Each one has strength and weaknesses. The Bourbon Kid is among my favorites. What this anonymous author did was take a figure in this book and totally made a legend out of him. Here and there you hear peices of The Bourbon Kid's history but he appears rarely in the book. This makes the anticipation of his arrival even more exciting and thrilling. The author has made another pop icon, following in the footsteps of The Gunslinger from stephen King, Harry Potter from J. k. rowling, and Kinsey Milhone from Sue Grafton.Funny enough, 'The Book With No name' is a book that is written into the story's plotline. It's an item that ties the events together. At first, little is known about it and where it came from, but when it is revealed, it was the most shocking and interesting plot turn I have ever read. This author really has a interesting and thought-provoking imagination.And the ending of the book was a really cool surprise. I was almost sad that it ended. But, who knows, there may be a sequel. The Author left a faint inclination that their would be.This story has a great mix of undead wars, gunfight showdowns, colorful characters, qoutable lines of dialogue, and interesting plot twists.I enjoyed this book so much, for the plot and the characters, I feel compelled to read it again, draw the characters out, imagine if it were a hollywood film.This author knows what he's doing and is on the right track. I'm going to read whatever he dishes out next."},{"Title":"The Book with No Name","review":"Hold onto your hats boy and girls - This is one wild ride!This book is great. It is full of great characters surrounded by a great place. This book has it all - drama, comedy, violence, and a little sex. However, the one thing this book is full of is killing.The book begins by introducing you to Sanchez - the bartender for the Tapioca Bar. However, if Sanchez does not like you he will fill your glass full of piss. One of the people to walk into the Tapioca in chapter one is the Bourbon Kid. The Bourbon Kid plays a pivital role in the book but after chapter one he does not reappear until much later in the book.After the first chapter, you are thrown ahead 5 years into the future. This is when it really begin to hit the fan. We then meet Jefe, a boundy hunter and all around bad a** who has taken a stone, The Eye of the Moon. He has agreed to sell it to the most notorious ganster in the town of Santa Mondego. Then enters two Hubal Monks who are the owners of the Eye of the Moon. However, these are no ordinary monks - they kick A**. Then enter a women who has been in a coma for 5 years and just happens to wake up at that time of the lunar eclipse. Then enter a bounty hunter that walks and talks like Elvis and is actaully called Elvis. Also enter Marcus the Weasel and Dante and Kacy. In all this, we have two cops who are looking for the Bourbon Kid.There is also one other aspect of the story and that is the aspect that surrounds the Book with No Name by Anonymous. It is discovered that all the people that have read this book have been killed. The reason behind this is the most wonderful surprise in the book.This is a book that must be read quickly. The reason is that the chapters jump from one story line to another. At first it is a little hard to get used to but if it is read quickly then it does not become a problem. I did not find it difficult to follow since I read this book in a mere 2.5 days. The chapters are short and a lot happens in a very short span of pages. The dialogue between the characters are short and to the point. There is a lot of foul language in this book but it bring out the reality of it.When you start this book, just be ready for one wild ride. Suspend the notion of reality for just a little bit and enjoy the story. It is much better that way.I hope that there is a sequel to this book. There has been only one other book that I have read for which I looked forward to the sequel and that is Pillars of the Earth. If a sequel comes out, I will be in line to buy it. However, the tall order is for this author to compete with his own book.Read this book. You will love it.The characters are great. The story is great.

The primary purpose of this text is to strengthen the vocabulary of the learner. It is designed with the adult learner in mind, tailoring the vocabulary and language exercises to be of use to those who are continuing their education toward GED, community college and general literacy skills.Each chapter of the book has three key elements - word mastery, learning strategies, and interesting features of words. In the mastering of words, each chapter presents the tried-and-true vocabulary list, to be used again and again in the course of the chapter (and repeated occasionally throughout later chapters). Several sentences are used to put the words in context. It is not simply a dull list of definitions - words are connected, and related words given.Learning strategies are introduced in each chapter as well. These include use of a dictionary (how can you look up a word when you don't know how to spell it?), using context clues to figure out the meaning of a word, analysing word elements by parts (prefixes, suffixes, etc.), and learning words in settings such as forms, newspapers, and other familiar settings.The special interest sections include articles that highlight the vocabulary (articles include the history of Ben &amp; Jerry's, stories of how cars get named, biographical stories of famous people like Jackie Robinson, and more), as well as brief histories of words and word categories.Each chapter has a variety of exercises - mix and match, word association, fill in the blank, analyzing paragraphs, discussion questions for the reading passages, and more.The one thing I would wish for this text would be a general glossary or dictionary at the end of the book, for students to use with greater ease in looking up the meanings of words. This could be organised in the manner of a dictionary, to be useful for the dictionary use exercises, too. Other than this, \`The World of Words' serves as a very useful guide in language arts, reading and writing classes, as well as for individual tutoring for those looking to enhance their basic literacy skills."},{"Title":"World Of Words, Fifth Edition And The Reader's Guide And American Heritage College Dictionary, Third Edition","review":"I was very pleased with the speedy shipping and condition of the used book.

For a similar book from a Northern perspective, see Aodan MacPoilin's anthology of essays.Both MacPoilin and MacMurchaidh provide alternatives to overly romanticized visions of a Gaelicized Ireland that dominated so much of the past century's discourse, as well as practical evidence that refutes Reg Hindley's 1990 book \\"The Death of the Irish Language? A Qualified Obituary.\\" While the health of Irish in its native redoubts remains debated, twice the number of speakers (about 60,000) outside the Gaeltacht now (2002 census) claim to use Irish daily in its five cities. (Consult Diarmait MacGiollaChriost's 2005 study \\"The Irish Language in Ireland: from goidel to globalisation\\"--dense data but useful. See my review on Amazon.com too!)Such a diversity and a reminder of the flexibility employed by those active in the language and passing it on in schools and cultural opportunities speaks well for the enthusiastic core of users who have chosen--rather than had been compelled mostly and wound up alienated in the past century--to keep Irish nimble and relevant today. (Contrast Adrian Kelly's educational analysis of \\"Compulsory Irish\\" from the 1870s-1970s.) Its only drawback is a neglect of how the Net and multimedia are influencing its prospects for the future in the diaspora as well in Ireland itself. MacMurchaidh's various contributors may differ on its survival prospects as a community language contiguous within its designated areas, but as an optional way of communicating, its recovery within urban areas speaks surprisingly and well to those who have for too long stigmatized or stereotyped Gaeilge."},{"Title":"A Natural History of American Birds of Eastern and Central North America","review":"While indeed this work was last published in 1955 (the edition I am reviewing here), I has it roots firmly planted with Birds of Massachusetts and other New England States, by Edward Howe Forbush who published his work in 1928. This work has evolved into the rather large volume on hand to this day. Reader take note: This is not a field guide in any sense of the word. This is one big book! This is a rather important book though, and there are considerations which should be noted.First it the art work or illustrations. These have been executed by Louis Agassiz Fuertes, Allan Brooks and Roger Tory Peterson. Most of the paintings were done prior to WWII or just after. At the time these illustrations were created, they were quite likely the most accurate and most professionally created available anywhere in the world. This volume contains 96 full color illustrations. The accuracy of composition and color is quite remarkable. It is interesting to note that the publishers have stated \\"Fortunately, the color plates for the book were made before the war, for to manufacture an identical set today would be prohibitively expensive.\\"Secondly, it must be noted that the narrative or text in this work goes far and beyond what is recorded in the average (actually, all that I am familiar with) field guide of today. This text of course covers the natural history and known facts about the particular bird being addressed. As to the text, the reader must keep in mind that we have come a long, long way since the days this work was published. You will find little to no mention (hey, they simply did not know), of the myriad of subspecies we are dealing with now. Also, just because \\"The Great Man,\\" roger Tory Peterson was involved, does not mean that we have his trademark identification points recorded...this book does not include that information. Also, it must be remember that the range of many of these birds has increased and/or decreased drastically over time, in particular over the past 15 or so years. Also, we have some major name changes we are dealing with such as some of the birds in the Heron family and some of the raptors. We also have a wonderful text, pictures and all, of birds such as the passenger pigeon and others that tragically are no longer with us.Although this work certainly has its limitations as to a field guide or identifier, it is never-the-less a wealth of useable and very readable information. The writing found here is a wonderful mixture of scientific data (presented as such), but at the same time it is actually literature comparable to the best writing of the greatest naturalists of our time. It is a delight to the eye and inner ear. I dare say that a reading of this work will increase your knowledge of birds greatly and it is also just chucked full of wonderful first hand birding stories, tips and birding adventures.For any one interested in drawing and painting birds, I cannot think of a better volume to assist and encourage...it is absolutely ideal if used for an art test book.For those interest in birds, this in an ideal book on hand. For those who collect books on birds, this one falls into the category of a \\"must have.\\"Personal Note: Books like this are extremely important purely for their historical record. With the current world wide climate changes, both natural and man made, the insatiable greedy appetite to burn, plunder and despoil the land both here in North America and South America, and again poorly administered stewardship of our natural resources as witness in the past eight years (did you know that there is a growing movement among the extremely anti-environmental crowd on the extreme right that actually wants to lift the ban on manufacturing and use of DDT in this country?), we are faced with the extinction of over 20 percent of existing bird species over the next 20 to 30 years. This will happen, I have no doubt, so you should probably purchase a copy of this book for your kids and grandkids, as it is going to be their last shot at knowing such wonderful creatures actually existed. In the not so near future, parents will be asked \\"Mom, Dad, tell be about the Great Auk, Robin, Blue Bird, Cardinal, and all the other birds that are now extinct.

The main characters are a CIA operative, Major Mann, and the story's narrator, a nameless British agent. The plot twists are entertaining enough, but as in all of this author's better books, the real fun is in overhearing the conversations and the wry observations that reveal the characters and situations in which the coolly competent protagonists operate. Much of the pleasure in a Deighton novel lies in coming upon the author's clever turns of phrase -- as in a scene where our two agents are in the posh Florida home of a communist agent grilling the wife regarding her knowledge of his activities. She tries to maintain a facade of innocent southern gentility, but as her story is being picked apart item by item, she fiddles with her purse, which our narrator observes is \\"made from a couple of yards of the Bayeaux tapestry.\\""},{"Title":"Catch A Falling Spy","review":"A very nice book, probably not as good as his nine Bernard Samson novels, but still a nice read.

A nameless British agent criss crosses the globe in an effort to aid a defecting Russian scientist. Nothing is as it seems and our protagonist must sort it all out."},{"Title":"Catch A Falling Spy","review":"Thought this was the best of Deighton's spy novels. The plots of some of his novels, such as Billion Dollar Brain, was thin and, thus, the book was dull. In other novels, his prose was more like a dense thicket the reader had to plow through.But in this one, the plot is excellent and his prose - while not sparkling - is better than average. It's an excellent suspense novel with twists and turns, and none of them cheat the reader. The unnamed British agent remains interesting and full of quips and the other characters are very well drawn too. The plot is exceptional.As I said, the best of the Deighton's novels."},{"Title":"Catch A Falling Spy","review":"Catch a Falling Spy (also published under the title Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Spy) is a well crafted spy thriller that incorporates elements of dark comedy with gritty action, suspense, and a noir atmosphere. The characters lack the depth of Bernard Sampson, the star of many of Deighton's later novels, but they are nonetheless convincing.British agent Harry Palmer teams with CIA agent Mickey Mann to help Bekuv, a Russian scientist, defect. Their mission leads them to a dangerous encounter in the Sahara Desert. Once they finally have him in a place of safety, Bekuv refuses to cooperate unless his beautiful young wife, Katerina, joins him. An assassination attempt and the emergence of a secret society of Ruyssian scientists contribute to the intrigue. Added to the ever growing list of characters who may or may not be traitors are a U.S. senator, the senator's aide, and Harry Dean, a washed up CIA operative who is found with an embarrassing amount of cash in his private stash. Is anyone to be trusted? Only by reading to the conclusion of this exciting story can the reader answer that question.Deighton mixes credible, fast-moving action scenes with psychological drama in a novel that takes the reader on a wild journey. While not as complex as Deighton's later work, Catch a Falling Spy offers an early example of this fine spy novelist's talent."},{"Title":"Catch A Falling Spy","review":"All spy stories entail - maybe require is a better word - betrayal to drive the narrative. While all of author Len Deighton's books are prime examples of that, it was this triad of books (Spy Story, Yesterday's Spy and this one) where the betrayals not only increased numerically but also moved to a more personalzied level. One might even say the reader is also subject to a form of betrayal - perhaps that is an extreme statement - becasue the ultimate solution to the narrative has nothing to do with what is presented at the start other than locale.The story begins with our unnamed agent - who, while close, but not exactly the same, to the ones in the preceding two books and is different from the one many call Harry Palmer (a name that was the invention of screenwriters not Deighton)- working to extract a Soviet defector from the desolate wastes of the western Saharan desert. The rescue is successive but comes with literal and figurative baggage in the form of the defector's wife and a curious reluctance on the part of said defector to \\"pay his bill\\" with the sought after information.In trying to solve this dilemma, our (anti)hero and his CIA superior travel a hazardous route along which wives and husbands and fathers and sons come to realize how little of what they see is actaully the way it appears. Politicians are moles and agents are double agents and by the end of the story several characters are compelled to face the reality about who their loved ones really are and for whom they have emotional and physical attachments.In an ironic twist, the novel finishes about where it started physically, but emotionally, the ending is miles and miles away. And, for the reader this was the last spy book from Deighton for about seven years. During the interim, he wrote of other things - some of it non-fiction and other books dealing with a form of alternate history - before returning to the spy genre in 1983 with the triple triad plus one saga of Bernard Samson."},{"Title":"Catch A Falling Spy","review":"Nowhere near the quality of Game Set Match.

The book rambles in places while in others fairly gallops to the next part. Perry has developed a knack for overstatement and also for writing some very clunky prose which continually slows down the characters. The murder mystery is also a mess. Hester conveniently forgets a conversation which throws a different light on the investigation and pursues a line which she must know is untrue but this discrepancy is never explained. Perhaps Perry herself forgot she'd written that section or hoped the reader wouldn't notice.I felt slightly insulted by this book.

Beaton's Hamish Macbeth mysteries then Anne Perry will not disappoint. I recommend reading this series from the beginning, in order. Monk is not always likeable, and is a typical Victorian sexist but the men defined in Perry's novels are appropriate to the time. Perry's men and women can be frustrating but she not only delves into the day to day lives of the Victorians in an accurate, detailed manner, she also writes a mystery that is NOT predictable. Perry specializes in the seedier side of the habits of the era. Don't expect to figure out what will happen, plan on being surprised unless you have read Perry's other Inspector Pitt series. In this novel a nurse has been found strangled. Hester Latterly is once again involved, a Crimean war nurse. The detail of the horrors of war experienced by early English nurses under Florence Nightingale is very well done. The battles between Hester and Monk are frustrating but enjoyable.

He cannot appreciate Perry's real skill in character development. He is opposed to any discussion of the status of women in Victorian England; dislikes Perry's careful depictions of social mores and class status in Victorian London --despite the fact that these are often the very crux of the novels. One of the best examples is \\"A Breach of Promise.\\" I haven't the Kirkus review for that novel but I am willing to bet that he really really hated it!Actually, this series of novels should be called theHester Latterly - William Monk - Oliver Rathbone series. Hester is often the central sleuth and it is the links between these three characters which move the plots forward ingeniously. As example of this I recommend \\"A Breach of Promise which the Kirkus reviewer undoubtedly hated."},{"Title":"A Sudden, Fearful Death","review":"When I began the book (with the problem of Marianne) it obviously had five stars, when you finish that part you won't understand why it was written in so many pages and it really doesn't have to do anything with the book, so the book has now four stars, in the middle of the book, when you see why it was written the [beginning], the book has only three stars ..., and that keeps during all the judgment of the doctor (I won't tell you which one because I will tell you the story), but when the judgment is almost over, when you almost finish the book you will see that this is definitely a five stars book, And when you read the last chapter you will see that you will recommend this book to your friends."},{"Title":"A Sudden, Fearful Death","review":"A Sudden, Fearful Death is the fourth mystery in the Inspector Monk series of books by Anne Perry. Better known for her Pitt series, the Inspector Monk series are slighly earlier (just after the Crimean War), grittier, and in many ways more riveting. They are longer than the average Pitt novel, and this allows the author's wonderful ability to convey period detail and characterization to shine through.In this mystery Inspector Monk is called in to investigate the murder of one of Florence Nightingale's Crimean nurses, who is working at a London hospital. Those of you who have read the previous three novels know how hard it can be for these young women to adapt to English hospitals after their stint abroad, and at first it seems that Prudence Barrymore might be a victim because of her desire to reform the medical system. As the plot unfolds, however, we realize that there is a great deal more going on at London's Royal Free hospital than meets the eye.One of Perry's greatest talents lies in character development, and she is always careful to let a different character feature prominently in each novel. This time it is Lady Callandra Daviot's turn, Inspector Monk's female patron, who emerges as a more three-dimensional character. Hester Latterly, another Nightingale nurse, is also featured, along with the brilliant Inspector Monk and the lawyer of lawyers, Oliver Rathbone.I would particularly recommend the Monk series to fans of TV's Law and Order, since these mysteries combine excellent sleuthing with taut court-room drama. If you like historical mysteries, you will love this series. If you already like Anne Perry, I encourage you to give Inpsector Monk a try!"},{"Title":"A Sudden, Fearful Death","review":"In the London of Queen Victoria, in a public hospital where \\"nurses\\" require no qualifications because all they do is the work of a drudge, a Crimean War veteran nurse is found strangled to death and stuffed into a laundry chute. Those nurses who worked under the legendary Florence Nightingale find life in their post-war homeland difficult, especially if they choose to continue nursing, because they know how to do far more than change bedding, roll bandages, and dump slop pails. They want to see medical care reformed, based on what they learned during their service under \\"the lady with the lamp\\"; and their presence makes those around them uncomfortable, doctors as well as matrons and ordinary nurses, because these are forceful women who usually have no need to earn a living. They are gentlewomen who should, according to their era's customs, confine their hospital work to that of board members and charitable contributors. Instead they insist on doing what no decent upper-class female ought, and their outspoken desire for specific reforms both disturbs and insults England's current medical establishment.Former police detective William Monk, now a private detective, inquires into the death of Prudence Barrymore at the request of his patron, Lady Callandra Daviot. He asks another Crimean nurse, Hester Latterly, to take a position at the hospital and learn all that she can; and then he takes the resulting evidence to the police, in the person of a former colleague whose competence he has reason to distrust. After which Monk begins to think it may be a false accusation, despite that evidence. So what will he do now, with the accused already on trial?Although I had read other Anne Perry books, this was my first William Monk installment. The amnesiac detective is that rare fictional character, a not very likable \\"hero\\" who nevertheless gains the reader's interest and holds it to the story's end. Which for me came at an unholy hour of the night - I found the book's final chapters impossible to put down. You do not need to be a mystery genre reader to appreciate Anne Perry. You only need to enjoy character driven fiction in general, and well written historical fiction in particular. I will definitely read more of the novels in this series.--Reviewed by Nina M. Osier, author of 2005 science fiction EPPIE winner \\"Regs\\""},{"Title":"A Sudden, Fearful Death","review":"I have recently started to listen to Anne Perry mysteries. I have thoroughly enjoyed them. The reason this one gets a four-star rating is because I was disappointed with the role Calandra played in this one. She has been a stalwart and formidable presence in the earlier books, not one to worry about someone's reputation when justice is at stake. I guess we're supposed to believe she has temporarily lost her presence of mind because she is in love.Other than that spoiler, I enjoyed this thoroughly. I especially enjoy the courtroom scenes, the carefully crafted defense of a supposedly innocent doctor."},{"Title":"A Sudden, Fearful Death","review":"After reading all the \\"Thomas & Charlotte Pitt\\" Victorian London murder mysteries, this series, starring police inspector-turned-private detective William Monk (and set thirty years earlier), are quite different. Where most of us sympathize strongly with Pitt and his wife, and would like them is we were to meet them, Monk is another kettle of fish. He's angry, arrogant, superior, self-righteous, often cruel in his methods, occasionally violent, and generally distasteful. The fact that he's usually right, and that other investigators respect his professional brilliance doesn't make him any more likeable -- and they don't.. When he was forced to resign from the police, it was largely his own fault for having alienated so many people. Anyway, Monk is own his own now, dependent on Lady Callandra to underwrite his career when clients are scarce, and frequently teamed in his cases with Hester Latterley, Crimean nurse (also rather arrogant on occasion), and with Oliver Rathbone, a highly gifted defense attorney (. . . and also rather arrogant on occasion). This case concerns the murder of Prudence Barrymore, another Crimean nurse, whose body was found stuffed down the laundry chute in the London hospital where she was employed. Prudence's greatest desire her entire life was to become a doctor -- a totally impossible ambition for any woman in 1858, no matter how brilliant. That gender inequality is one of Perry's social themes this time out -- another being the complete lack of professionalism among nurses of the day, who were ignorant, low-born, and frequently drunk, and who were little more than hospital charwomen. Prudence worked closely with a highly regarded surgeon, who may be the murderer -- or maybe not. The third theme is abortion rights, about which Perry never quite clarifies her personal position: Is there a difference between free abortions performed in the back of butcher shops for the impoverished, exhausted mother with far more children than she can feed, and abortions for convenience for the wealthy, performed by skilled surgeons and for which they pay high prices? In any case, it's a generally well-written novel with several subplots, romantic and otherwise, and Hester and Rathbone get largely equal billing."},{"Title":"A Sudden, Fearful Death","review":"Having read the three prior MONK novels, I am, as usual, frustrated by the inconsistency of Perry's writing. I think this one may be my last. She provides some fascinating details on life in Victorian London, but also devises plots in which the solutions to the mysteries are extremely obvious, and the behavior of the characters completely contrived and unbelievable. I figured out the \\"twist\\" of the plot 100 pages before all the intelligent major characters - Monk, Hester,& Rathbone - had. Can they be that dense??!! The entire first section of the novel is devoted to a plot which becomes mere background. Certain characters - such as Evans - are given a good deal of attention and then dropped completely. Other characters behave unbelievably in order to come up with the pat solution (eg. SPOILER: Dora Parsons suddenly opening up to Hester and having an unbelievable quick change of heart). I am frustrated by the fact that there is a good deal to enjoy in Perry's writings and yet at the end I feel I have wasted hours and hours on a book with no surprises or interesting and unexpected solutions; the books always seem to end with a huge letdown at the banality and predictablity of the plots."},{"Title":"A Sudden, Fearful Death","review":"I won't bother to rehash the plot of this book, as that has been done. I have very much enjoyed the William Monk series, but was quite disappointed with this particular entry. Although I agree with the reviewer that the opening scene with Marianne does not originally make sense to the reader, the relevance becomes pretty clear by at most page 100. The 200 pages or so devoted to determining what it was Prudence actually wanted were almost completely wasted. I had figured out the answer to this question immediately, but thought that in Perry's traditional style, Monk and crew would be pick this up as easily as I had, and then it would be on to the next twist. Alas, they did not pick this up until the last 20-30 pages of the book!! The last chapter, which a previous reviewer raved about, in my opinion was remniscent of some of Patricia Cornwell's poorly exectued later entries in her Kay Scarpetta series: pick a person randomly to solve the crime. Also, character development was not up to Perry's usual standards; there was no additional insights or progressions of any of the ongoing relationships. I gave the book two stars because I enjoyed both the description of hospital consitions in 1850's London and did originally like the plot but that it was not brought to a sufficient height and lacked \\"meat.\\" I will continue reading Perry, since I know later books in this series are up to her usual standards, but would forewarn readers that this is not the book to start with if one wishes to \\"test\\" Perry."},{"Title":"A Sudden, Fearful Death","review":"I have read and enjoyed the previous books in this series, and was very eager to read and enjoy this one, as well. Each of the books prior to this one held my attention, and I read each of them within 2 weeks -- and only took that long because I have a crazy work schedule and was not able to read as often as I would like. This book, however, I started reading a YEAR ago, and as of the writing of this review, I still have about 10 pages LEFT!! The reason that it has taken me SO long is because, in addition to the crazy work schedule I have and difficulty always finding time to read, I simply have lacked the INTEREST in this book to TRY to MAKE time to read it! This book haa simply dragged on and on, and it feels like it hasn't gotten anywhere! It is SOOO repetitious, and just goes over and over theories, etc, but nothing really ever happens! It takes some 400 pages to build (but \\"build\\" really isn't the right word because it isn't really very suspenseful, and there really are no twists, and it's not really \\"building\\" toward anything)! Then at the end it feels as though the author is trying to quickly pull it all together and finish the book. Dora's revelation is hurried and contrived, particularly since the story leading up to it is so very slow!All in all the book was just ok. I like Perry as an author and have already purchased the next few books in the Monk series. I am hoping this particular book was written while she was in a funk, and that the series will get back on track. Having so enjoyed the first few stories, I am holding out hope for the rest of the series.

He committed seppuku (ritual suicide by sword) after finishing the final book of this tetralogy--The Sea of Fertility. He, along with Kawabata and Murakami, is one of the most prominent Japanese authors that actually gained attention during his life. Mishima was called a radical, a right-winger. Some think that this stigma affects his writing greatly, but hearing someone say that makes me wonder why they're reading him to begin with.SPRING SNOW is the story of Kiyoaki Matsugae, and his Imperially sanctioned and revered family. I thought that it was clear early on that Kiyoaki was an interesting character. He is the image of adolescence in this novel; Honda, Kiyo's best companion (I don't go out of my way to call him a friend), is, I think, more respectable. I'm not sure if Mishima, in writing this novel, was masochistic with Kiyoaki and more level-headed with some of the other characters, but it certainly gives us a great perspective in what goes on in Kiyoaki's mind.Kiyo and Satoko were childhood friends; after his interest in her wanes, he's given notice that she is to marry a Prince. \\"The grass always looks greener on the other side\\"--this is what I think of, looking back on Kiyo and his decision to tell his father that there was \\"absolutely nothing\\" between himself and Satoko. He goes on to become more infatuated with her presence; \\"doomed as it was inevitable\\" is what the synopsis says of this romance.The reason I give this 4 stars? I really felt the book could've been 50 to 75 pages shorter. I couldn't help but get tired of it in places. Another reviewer mentioed that Mishima isn't very inventive, but is very skilled. I agree with that totally. The story itself is not enough to warrant a reading (seriously--I've read countless other Japanese novels with the exact same romance-based-on-family-strain plot). It's the way that Mishima tells us of his characters, and the settings. I might go as far to say that--yes, I think that he is one of the greatest writers of the 20th century.All complaints aside, this novel is amazing, and I feel that I'd appreciate it even more if I paged through it again. Mishima writes with a beauty that is hard to categorize; it's not really comparable to Murakami or Tanizaki, or any other famed Japanese authors who are still hailed today.Mishima carried with him demons. And angels! And their chorus is in these pages."},{"Title":"Spring Snow (Vintage Classics)","review":"Mishima is one of the most descriptive writers of modern Japan. His texts tell the stories of the upper class, nevertheless, you will not find a better description of a Japanese garden or house.&quot;The trees that encircled the now-darken garden, the tiled roofs of the mansion itself beyond, even the maple hill-the reflection of all this, and more, had been fixed in jagged outline, compressed into the circle of water that was defined by the rim of the basin.&quot;Approaching some of Mishima's greatest senteces is equivalent to appraiching a Michelangelo, Picasso, or Rembrandt painting. That is what makes his writing so captivating and tantalizing."},{"Title":"Spring Snow (Vintage Classics)","review":"For an outsider, this book provides remarkable insight into a foriegn culture that most Americans know little about. The indelible differences between cultures are exposed in this remarkable novel. Although missing some key elements, this is very close to a Japanese Romeo and Juliet type story. Mishima, ever the historian, also digresses at several points to devulge in some eastern history and philosophy."},{"Title":"Spring Snow (Vintage Classics)","review":"&quot;See just the trees, but not the forest&quot; is an old Chinese saying, meaning to comprehend, and thus evaluate, things only from partial angles and views.

I found it a decent read, though the book is certainly flawed.On the surface the novel appears to a simple tragic love affair taking place in 1911. Kiyoaki, a son of a marquis and finishing high school, enters a complicated relationship with Satoko, the daughter of a count he boarded at during his early childhood. He cannot decide whether he truly loves or despises her until she is engaged to a royal prince, at which point series of events make their lives fall apart. Kiyoaki is supported all the while by Honda, his best friend and a law student who is discovering at this time Western philosophy. In the background the Meiji emperor has just died and his successor swept into power, and provincial nobles are attempting to legitimize themselves in Tokyo while the fortunes of the old center of power decline.Mishima's style is quite alluring, but the finest aspect of the novel is its characters. Kiyoaki is fantastically portrayed, a deluded romantic who unwittingly serves the forces of history tearing apart Japanese nobility. There is always a conflict between despising him and pitying him. Satoko is more of a mystery, but this seems to be intentional, an expression of some unknowable female otherness. Honda is the intent observer, trying to make sense of the tragedy befalling his friend and his society.I found the novel a bit disappointing because of its meandering. Mishima felt he would die when \\"The Sea of Fertility\\" was completed, but when he began with this first installment he didn't quite know how yet. So, it is only in the following volumes where we can see his motivation for political action, which brought him to lead his attempted coup of 1970 and which ultimately led him to commit ritual suicide when his plans for a greater Japan failed. This uncertainty of the future shows in SPRING SNOW, Mishima doesn't quite know what is trying to get at behind the surface.The translation by Michael Gallagher is generally readable, though I occasionally wondered if bits were added to Mishima's text in order to explain aspects of Japanese culture to English readers.I would recommend SPRING SNOW, if only because it is necessary to move on to the other portions of the generally fine \\"Sea of Fertility\\" cycle. On its own it doesn't quite satisfy."},{"Title":"Spring Snow (Vintage Classics)","review":"&quot;See just the trees, but not the forest&quot; is an old Chinese saying, meaning to comprehend, and thus evaluate, things only from partial angles and views. To assess/critic, even compare any one of the 4 &quot;Sea of Fertility&quot; novels is to do just that. The 4 novels are all part of a grand design in a way very much like 4 movements from a symphony. Yes each novel stands on its own as a great literature accomplishment, but so does each movement of any symphony by Beethoven or Mahler. Now, I am not a write or a literature critic in any shape or form, but I have read the complete &quot;Sea of Fertility&quot; twice before, and am onto &quot;Runaway Horses&quot; for the third time now. Just want to remind every one that, these novels are not meant to be read individually."}]`),S={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:A},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:H,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},E={class:"card-container"},P=["disabled"],F={key:0},W={key:1};function M(n,o,s,u,r,i){const c=f("PoemCard");return e(),t("section",null,[o[1]||(o[1]=a("div",{class:"top-banner"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),a("div",E,[(e(!0),t(y,null,w(i.visiblePoems,(h,m)=>(e(),p(c,{key:m,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(e(),t("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:o[0]||(o[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(e(),t("span",W,"Loading...")):(e(),t("span",F,"See more"))],8,P)):g("",!0)])}const x=d(S,[["render",M],["__scopeId","data-v-a5185331"]]),R=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"quotesmag/24.md","filePath":"quotesmag/24.md"}'),B={name:"quotesmag/24.md"},O=Object.assign(B,{setup(n){return(o,s)=>(e(),t("div",null,[b(x)]))}});export{R as __pageData,O as default};
