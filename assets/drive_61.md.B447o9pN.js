The once-vaunted Green Bay Packers were a laughingstock by the late 1950s. They hadn t fielded a winning team in more than a decade, and were close to losing their franchise to another city. They were in desperate need of a savior and he arrived in a wood-paneled station wagon in the dead of winter from New York City. In a single year, Vince Lombardi the grizzled coach who took no bull transformed a team of underachievers into winners and resurrected a Wisconsin city known for its passion for sport. He would lead them to championship to championship, and bring out the best in players including Bart Starr, Jim Taylor, Willie Davis, Forrest Gregg, and many more.

Currently, there are over 16.6 million African American Males in the U.S. population who are largely ignored and misrepresented. This volume of The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science is being published to help rectify that problem. \\"Dope addicts\\", \\"welfare pimps\\", home boys\\", \\"bloods\\" - the images of the African American male portrayed throughout the American media have been distorted to say the least. The neglected part of the story is that black males in America are products of a rich African heritage. They are sons of African kings and queens and have made enormous and valuable contributions to Western civilization. African American men are not only pioneers in sport , but have proven themselves in all walks of life including the sciences, medicine, law, engineering, and the American Armed Forces. It is clearly time for African American male studies to be realized as a legitimate field of academic inquiry. The African American Male in American Life and Thought addresses several questions in relation to this: Who are the black males? How do we define this population? What are their demographic characteristics? What impact does the black American male have on American life and thought? To examine these and related questions, a group of nationally recognized scholars and practitioners has been assembled, and represent several disciplines and areas of expertise in American studies. In this volume, scholarly research has been combined with thoughtful original essays to bring together a well-rounded view of the African American male experience within the context of American life and history.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=cFF7AQAACAAJ&dq=The+African+American+Male+in+American+Life+and+Thought+(The+ANNALS+of+the+American+Academy+of+Political+and+Social+Science+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Exploring the Book of Daniel (The Exploring series)","description":"\\"John Phillips writes with enthusiasm and clarity, . . . cutting through the confusion and heretical dangers associated with Bible interpretation.\\" --Moody Magazine","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=qLyBSlGToA4C&dq=Exploring+the+Book+of+Daniel+(The+Exploring+series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Masterpieces of world philosophy in summary form","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=j-dQAAAAYAAJ&dq=Masterpieces+of+world+philosophy+in+summary+form&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Pheasants of the World: Their Breeding and Management","description":"Pheasants of the World is an indispensable reference work to guide and stimulate newcomers as well as a valuable refresher for veterans.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=v_JJAAAAYAAJ&dq=Pheasants+of+the+World:+Their+Breeding+and+Management&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Symbol of Wilderness: Echo Park and the American Conservation Movement (Weyerhaeuser Environmental Classics)","description":"Harvey details the first major clash between conservationists and developers after World War II, the successful fight to prevent the building of Echo Park Dam.

Such arguments come under the heading of the argumentum ad baculum, the \`argument to the stick/club', traditionally treated as a fallacy in the logic textbooks. The new dialectical theory is based on case studies of many interesting examples of the use of these arguments in advertising, public relations, politics, international negotiations, and everyday argumentation on all kinds of subjects. Many of these arguments are amusing, once you see the clever tactic used; others are scary. Some of the arguments appear to be quite reasonable, while others are highly suspicious, or even outrageously fraudulent. In addition to the examples taken from logic textbooks, other cases treated come from a variety of sources, including political debates, legal arguments, and arguments from media sources, like magazine articles and television ads. The purpose of this book is to explain how such arguments work as devices of persuasion, and to develop a method for analyzing and evaluating their reasonable and fallacious uses in particular cases. The book shows how such arguments share a common structure, revealing several distinctive forms of argument nested within each other. Based on its account of this cognitive structure, the new dialectical theory presents methods for identifying, analyzing, and evaluating these arguments, as they are used in specific cases. The book is a scholarly contribution to argumentation theory. It is written in an accessible style, and uses many colorful and provocative examples of fear and threat appeal arguments that are suitable for classroom discussions. The matters treated will be of interest to professionals and students in law, critical thinking, advertising, speech communication, informal logic, cognitive science, rhetoric, and media studies.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=QZVHBAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Saint Philomena, the Wonder-Worker","description":"Though nothing historical is known of her, she was declared a Saint in 1837, only 35 years after discovery of her relics.

Finally, employing the latest techniques to observe spatiotemporal patterns of brain activity, Kelso shows that the human brain is fundamentally a pattern forming dynamical system, poised on the brink of instability. Self-organization thus underlies the cooperative action of neurons that produces human behavior in all its forms.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=caGqQgAACAAJ&dq=Dynamic+Patterns:+The+Self-Organization+of+Brain+and+Behavior+(Complex+Adaptive+Systems)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ordinary Differential Equations (Classics in Applied Mathematics)","description":"Covers the fundamentals of the theory of ordinary differential equations.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=v0z4ckZbuhMC&dq=Ordinary+Differential+Equations+(Classics+in+Applied+Mathematics)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Progressive Heavy Metal Techniques for Lead Guitar","description":"Guitarskole.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=x7qtAAAACAAJ&dq=Progressive+Heavy+Metal+Techniques+for+Lead+Guitar&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Murphy'S Law (Men In Blue) (Silhouette Intimate Moments)","description":"MEN IN BLUE Love in the line of duty.

I'm pleased that there is finally a comprehensive book on this important subject.\\" --Larry Peterson, Professor of Computer Science, Princeton University \\"This book is a remarkable piece of work, well-organized and clearly articulated. The authors have masterfully presented advanced topics in Internet Web infrastructure and content delivery networks in a way that is suitable for both novices and experts.\\" --Steve McCanne, Chief Technology Officer, Inktomi As the Internet grows, evolving from a research tool into a staple of daily life, it is essential that the Web's scalability and performance keep up with increased demand and expectations. Every day, more and more users turn to the Internet to use resource-hungry applications like video and audio on-demand and distributed games. At the same time, more and more computer applications are built to rely on the Web, but with much higher sensitivity to delays of even a few milliseconds. The key to satisfying these growing demands and expectations lies in the practices of caching and replication and in the increased scalability solutions they represent. Web Caching and Replication provides essential material based on the extensive real-world experience of two experts from AT&T Labs. This comprehensive examination of caching, replication, and load-balancing practices for the Web brings together information from and for the commercial world, including real-life products; technical standards communities, such as IETF and W3C; and academic research. By focusing on the underlying, fundamental ideas that are behind the varied technologies currently used in caching and replication, this book will remain a relevant, much-needed resource as the multi-billion dollar industries that rely on the Web continue to grow and evolve. The book approaches its two central topics in two distinct parts. The part on caching includes coverage of: Proxy caching, including latency reduction and TCP connection caching Transparent and nontransparent proxy deployment Cooperative caching Cache consistency Replacement policies Prefetching \\"Caching the uncacheable\\" The part on replication includes coverage of: Basic mechanisms for request distribution, including content-blind and content-aware request distr...","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=iWJTAAAAMAAJ&dq=Web+Caching+and+Replication&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"SAUL BELLOW: DRUMLIN WOODCHUCK","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=9GOanQEACAAJ&dq=SAUL+BELLOW:+DRUMLIN+WOODCHUCK&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Tony, Tony, Tony!: \\"Tails\\" of an Italian Greyhound","description":"TONY,TONY,TONY! is a delightful, \\"not for children's only\\" book that illustrates the life of a very lucky 9.5lb Italian Greyhound.

It is especially applicable to our day, pointing out the immediate future. In The Story of Daniel the Prophet, a few of the interesting facts in regard to God's dealings with His people have been gathered into a simple narrative.This book is the result of much prayerful study. It is sent forth with an earnest prayer, that in the hands of the parents it may be the means of making the study of the Bible in the family a blessing to young and old; and that the teacher in the schoolroom may see precious rays of light flashing from its pages, pointing both teacher and pupil to the Great Divine Teacher.We trust that while its simplicity will attract many who might not be inclined to read a deep argumentative treatise, the most studious will find food for thought, and thus become better acquainted with the character of our Heavenly Father. Those who wish to enter into more comprehensive study, will find that the marginal references open up many veins of precious ore in the deep mines of God's Word.Throughout the entire book the special providence of God over those who are faithful to Him is brought out in clear contrast to the fate of those who ignore His guiding hand. The truth is the same, whether in the history of nations or individuals.As The Story of Daniel the Prophet goes forth on its mission of love for the Great Master, may it prove a blessing to all classes, young and old, rich and poor, learned and unlearned.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=taCXO1w2oqkC&dq=The+story+of+Daniel+the+Prophet&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"That's True of Everybody","description":"A collection of stories offers portraits of such offbeat characters as a libidinous poet who learns the true meaning of harassment and the bowling alley proprietor whose artist daughter specializes in painting phalluses.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=AdKBdDgDRNkC&dq=That%27s+True+of+Everybody&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Alaskan Nights","description":"After a frantic call, Sloan McKinley travels to the heart of the Alaskan wilderness to be there for her best friend, who's just inherited property in the small town of Indigo.

In 2004 Pippa was a double Olympic medallist in Athens, and this autobiography includes her Olympic diary, as she records the ups and downs of the competition, the triumph of the dressage, her cross-country round and the showjump down that cost her a gold medal. As if all this were not enough, there was the controversy of the medals being reallocated on appeal, meaning Pippa won both a silver and a bronze.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=4zs2AgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Improve Your Eyesight a Guide to the Bates Method for Better Eyesight Without Glasses","description":"With constant strains on the eyes from use of computers, devices and the ordinary stresses of modern life, the Bates method is more relevant than ever.

Pure, bracing ventilation they must have up there at all times, indeed: one may guess the power of the north wind blowing over the edge, by the excessive slant of a few stunted firs at the end of the house; and by a range of gaunt thorns all stretching their limbs one way, as if craving alms of the sun. Happily, the architect had foresight to build it strong: the narrow windows are deeply set in the wall, and the corners defended with large jutting stones. Before passing the threshold, I paused to admire a quantity of grotesque carving lavished over the front, and especially about the principal door; above which, among a wilderness of crumbling griffins and shameless little boys, I detected the date ?1500,? and the name ?Hareton Earnshaw.? I would have made a few comments, and requested a short history of the place from the surly owner; but his attitude at the door appeared to demand my speedy entrance, or complete departure, and I had no desire to aggravate his impatience previous to inspecting the penetralium. One stop brought us into the family sitting-room, without any introductory lobby or passage: they call it here ?the house? pre-eminently. It includes kitchen and parlour, generally; but I believe at Wuthering Heights the kitchen is forced to retreat altogether into another quarter: at least I distinguished a chatter of tongues, and a clatter of culinary utensils, deep within; and I observed no signs of roasting, boiling, or baking, about the huge fireplace; nor any glitter of copper saucepans and tin cullenders on the walls. One end, indeed, reflected splendidly both light and heat from ranks of immense pewter dishes, interspersed with silver jugs and tankards, towering row after row, on a vast oak dresser, to the very roof. The latter had never been under-drawn: its entire anatomy lay bare to an inquiring eye, except where a frame of wood laden with oatcakes and clusters of legs of beef, mutton, and ham, concealed it. Above the chimney were sundry villainous old guns, and a couple of horse-pistols: and, by way of ornament, three gaudily-painted canisters disposed along its ledge. The floor was of smooth, white stone; the chairs, high-backed, primitive structures, painted green: one or two heavy black ones lurking in the shade. In an arch under the dresser reposed a huge, liver-coloured bitch pointer, surrounded by a swarm of squealing puppies; and other dogs haunted other recesses.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=b3ctQ5L7zNoC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Psychic Academy: v. 1","description":"Injured when an unknown aura attacks the Academy, Mew falls into the hands ofthe enigmatic Dr. Watabe, creating a whole new puzzle that Ai must solve.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=WaWivgEACAAJ&dq=Psychic+Academy:+v.+1&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Pullman Case (Landmark Law Cases & American Society)","description":"The American Railway Union strike against the Pullman Palace Car Company in 1894 pitted America's largest industrial union against 24 railroads, and was broken up by federal troops and suppressed in the courts.

Here, the remains of many thousands of weird and wonderful prehistoric animals have been superbly preserved in the limestone outcrops. There are marsupial lions, carnivorous kangaroos, 23-foot long pythons, primitive platypuses, and early ancestors of the now extinct Tasmanian tiger. So important is this site to our understanding of what has happened to Australia and its living cargo over the last 25 million years that Riversleigh has been inscribed on the World Heritage List. Michael Archer, Suzanne J. Hand, and Henk Godthelp, the principal scientists on a remarkable excavation since 1976, explain the vast environmental and geographic changes that have occurred in this area since Australia broke away from the supercontinent of Gondwana, and how the animals on board this continental raft evolved through the ages. Photographs and evocative artwork bring to life the teeming tropical world that once existed in the now arid wastes of Riversleigh, and the authors discuss some of the unusual techniques used on a dig. They describe how to recognize fossils, how to date them, and how to reconstruct extinct animals from them.

The exposition is example and problem-oriented, where the applications are taken from mathematics, numerical calculus, statistics, physics, biology and finance. The book teaches \\"Matlab-style\\" and procedural programming as well as object-oriented programming. High school mathematics is a required background and it is advantageous to study classical and numerical one-variable calculus in parallel with reading this book. Besides learning how to program computers, the reader will also learn how to solve mathematical problems, arising in various branches of science and engineering, with the aid of numerical methods and programming. By blending programming, mathematics and scientific applications, the book lays a solid foundation for practicing computational science. From the reviews: Langtangen ... does an excellent job of introducing programming as a set of skills in problem solving. He guides the reader into thinking properly about producing program logic and data structures for modeling real-world problems using objects and functions and embracing the object-oriented paradigm. ... Summing Up: Highly recommended. F. H. Wild III, Choice, Vol. 47 (8), April 2010 Those of us who have learned scientific programming in Python  on the streets  could be a little jealous of students who have the opportunity to take a course out of Langtangen s Primer.  John D. Cook, The Mathematical Association of America, September 2011 This book goes through Python in particular, and programming in general, via tasks that scientists will likely perform. It contains valuable information for students new to scientific computing and would be the perfect bridge between an introduction to programming and an advanced course on numerical methods or computational science. Alex Small, IEEE, CiSE Vol. 14 (2), March /April 2012  This fourth edition is a wonderful, inclusive textbook that covers pretty much everything one needs to know to go from zero to fairly sophisticated scientific programming in Python...

The kingdom of Valencia occupies a uniquely important place in the history of the Spanish Inquisition because of its large Muslim and Jewish populations and because it was a Catalan kingdom, more or less \\"occupied\\" by the despised Castilians who introduced the Inquisition. Haliczer underscores the intensely regional nature of the Valencian tribunal. He shows how the prosecution of religious deviants, the recruitment and professional activity of Inquisitors and officials, and the relations between the Inquisition and the majority Old Christian population all clearly reflect the place and the society. A great series of pogroms swept over Spain during the summer of 1391. Jewish communities were attacked and the Jews either massacred or forced to convert. More than ninety percent of the victims of the Valencian Inquisition a century later were descendants of those who chose conversion, the conversos. Haliczer argues convincingly against those who see all the conversos as \\"secret Jews.\\" He finds, on the contrary, that a wide range of religious beliefs and practices existed among them and that some were even able to assimilate into Old Christian society by becoming familiares of the Inquisition itself. Nevertheless, it was controversy over the sincerity of the converted which spawned the first proposals for the establishment of a Spanish national Inquisition. That very same controversy, persisting in the writings of history, may be resolved by Haliczer's stimulating discoveries. Inquisition and Society in the Kingdom of Valencia is a major contribution to the lively field of Inquisition studies, combining institutional history of the tribunal with socioreligious history of the kingdom. The many case histories included in the narrative give both Valencian society and the Inquisition very human faces.

One spring night in 1998 the beautiful Cressida Strauss plunges from a fourth-floor balcony at the Lyc e Internationale Suisse with catastrophic consequences. Loath to draw negative publicity to the school, a bastion of European wealth and glamour, officials quickly dismiss the incident as an accident, but questions remain: Was it a suicide attempt? Or was Cressida pushed? It was no secret that she had a selfish streak and had earned as many enemies as allies in her tenure at the school. For her best friend, scholarship student Kersti Kuusk, the lingering questions surrounding Cressida's fall continue to nag long after she leaves the Lyc e. Kersti marries and becomes a bestselling writer, but never stops wondering about Cressida's obsession with the Helvetian Society a secret club banned years before their arrival at the school and a pair of its members who were expelled.

Instead of transcendence to the heavenly world that will come after the destruction of the shakable creation, Lee suggests the possibility of a more dualistic new world. By first defining Urzeit-Endzeit eschatology, Lee is then able to explore its place in both pre and post 70 CE Second Temple Judaism. In examining Enoch, the Qumran Texts, Jubilees, the Liber Antiquitatum Biblicarum, 4 Ezra and 2 Baruch and finally the Book of Revelation, Lee compares a multitude of eschatological visions and the different depictions of the transformation of the world, judgement and the new world to come. Bringing these texts together to analyse the issue of God's Rest in Hebrews, and the nature of the Unshakable Kingdom, Lee concludes that Hebrews envisions the kingdom as consisting of both the revealed heavenly world and the renewed creation as the eschatological venue of God's dwelling place with his people.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Pc9HEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"What Are You Doing With the Rest of Your Life?: Choices in Midlife","description":"A guide to aging sucessfully examines the importance of midlife changes and transitions as turning points that can determine the quality of the second half of life, and discusses how to cope with problems that occur with aging","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=HWCua10Lgt4C&dq=What+Are+You+Doing+With+the+Rest+of+Your+Life%3F:+Choices+in+Midlife&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Narvik","description":" An intensely detailed historical account and counterfactual analysis of the strategic dilemmas faced by German and Allied forces at Narvik.   Naval Historical Foundation Published for the first time in English, this is a German account of the German invasion of Norway in the spring of 1940. It focuses on the efforts of Group  1  led by Eduard Dietl. This group of Gebirgstruppen mountain troops was landed at Narvik in early April by ten destroyers. These ships were then all sunk by the Allies. Dietl s troops were outnumbered by Allied troops but his defense utilized ammunition, food and sailors from the sunken ships and his men retook Narvik once the Allies abandoned their efforts to push the Germans out of Norway.  The book does provide detailed accounts of the numerous battles and skirmishes around Narvik in the spring of 1940. The maps are useful to help understand the terrain and geography. The focus of the text is at the tactical level, and any historian interested in the tactics of the Norwegian campaign or of German mountain troops at this time would find this especially useful.   Journal of Military History  The story of Dietl s improvisation in the face of such inadequacies is quite impressive . . . the best account in English of the German side of Narvik.

Many are now aware that the ways we utilize our natural and cultural resources have had a range of negative consequences internationally\\\\m-\\\\from the destabilization of ecosystems, the depletion of resources, and the degradation of our environment to the disintegration of cultural values and ethnic identity within local communities. Responses to this dilemma have varied, with traditional economists characterizing environmental issues as mere externalities and many ecologists focusing solely on protecting the environment. Offering a far more comprehensive view, Enrique Leff provides a Marxist approach to environment and development that focuses on the process of production, as well as implications of the environmental crisis on human values. To truly achieve a more rational and integrated use of our natural resources, he convincingly argues for a reorientation of science and technology towards the objectives of sustainable development, the decentralization of production, and the participatory management of natural resources.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=hk7CtAEACAAJ&dq=Green+Production:+Toward+an+Environmental+Rationality&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"This Bo Peep Ain't No Fairy Tale!","description":"This inspirational book encourages us to find our purpose from God.

His earlier publications have shown how dramatic British innovations in India, including revenue and legal systems, led to fundamental structural changes in Indian social relations. This collection of his writings in the last fifteen years discusses areas in which the colonial impact has generally been overlooked. The essays form a multifaceted exploration of the ways in which the British discovery, collection, and codification of information about Indian society contributed to colonial cultural hegemony and political control. Cohn argues that the British Orientalists' study of Indian languages was important to the colonial project of control and command. He also asserts that an arena of colonial power that seemed most benign and most susceptible to indigenous influences--mostly law--in fact became responsible for the institutional reactivation of peculiarly British notions about how to regulate a colonial society made up of \\"others.\\" He shows how the very Orientalist imagination that led to brilliant antiquarian collections, archaeological finds, and photographic forays were in fact forms of constructing an India that could be better packaged, inferiorized, and ruled. A final essay on cloth suggests how clothes have been part of the history of both colonialism and anticolonialism.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=QU0gEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Thus spake Zarathustra (The Modern library of the world's best books)","description":"Friedrich Nietzsche's most accessible and influential philosophical work, misquoted, misrepresented, brilliantly original and enormously influential, Thus Spoke Zarathustra is translated from the German by R.J. Hollingdale in Penguin Classics. Nietzsche was one of the most revolutionary and subversive thinkers in Western philosophy, and Thus Spoke Zarathustra remains his most famous and influential work. It describes how the ancient Persian prophet Zarathustra descends from his solitude in the mountains to tell the world that God is dead and that the Superman, the human embodiment of divinity, is his successor. Nietzsche's utterance 'God is dead', his insistence that the meaning of life is to be found in purely human terms, and his doctrine of the Superman and the will to power were all later seized upon and unrecognisably twisted by, among others, Nazi intellectuals. With blazing intensity and poetic brilliance, Nietzsche argues that the meaning of existence is not to be found in religious pieties or meek submission to authority, but in an all-powerful life force: passionate, chaotic and free. Frederich Nietzsche (1844-1900) became the chair of classical philology at Basel University at the age of 24 until his bad health forced him to retire in 1879. He divorced himself from society until his final collapse in 1899 when he became insane. A powerfully original thinker, Nietzsche's influence on subsequent writers, such as George Bernard Shaw, D.H. Lawrence, Thomas Mann and Jean-Paul Sartre, was considerable. If you enjoyed Thus Spoke Zarathustra you might like Nietzsche's Beyond Good and Evil, also available in Penguin Classics. 'Enigmatic, vatic, emphatic, passionate, often breathtakingly insightful, his works together make a unique statement in the literature of European ideas' A. C.

Iran s past, present, and future are exposed the country s quest for nuclear weapons and support of Palestinian terror groups, its ability to  play the oil card,  and Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad s apocalyptic beliefs that motivate his actions. You ll discover the truth about today s events, how they relate to Bible prophecy, and what the Bible clearly describes is yet to come. It s a crisis unlike any the world has ever faced. Are We Headed for a Nuclear Jihad?  Israel must be wiped off the map,  Iran president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said it himself. He has denied the Holocaust, and his actions are motivated by a dangerous apocalyptic view of Islam.

This allowed Northwest Europe to grow dramatically in population, specialize further in manufactures, and remove labor from the land, using increased imports rather than maximizing yields. Together, coal and the New World allowed Europe to grow along resource-intensive, labor-saving paths. Meanwhile, Asia hit a cul-de-sac. Although the East Asian hinterlands boomed after 1750, both in population and in manufacturing, this growth prevented these peripheral regions from exporting vital resources to the cloth-producing Yangzi Delta.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=W2GYDwAAQBAJ&dq=Divergence&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Digital Circuit Testing: A Guide to DFT and Other Techniques","description":"Recent technological advances have created a testing crisis in the electronics industry--smaller, more highly integrated electronic circuits and new packaging techniques make it increasingly difficult to physically access test nodes.

Absorbing, moving, and compulsively readable.\\" Lydia Davis In this affectionate, heart-warming chronicle, Rosamund Young distills a lifetime of organic farming wisdom, describing the surprising personalities of her cows and other animals At her famous Kite's Nest Farm in Worcestershire, England, the cows (as well as sheep, hens, and pigs) all roam free. They make their own choices about rearing, grazing, and housing. Left to be themselves, the cows exhibit temperaments and interests as diverse as our own. \\"Fat Hat\\" prefers men to women; \\"Chippy Minton\\" refuses to sleep with muddy legs and always reports to the barn for grooming before bed; \\"Jake\\" has a thing for sniffing the carbon monoxide fumes of the Land Rover exhaust pipe; and \\"Gemima\\" greets all humans with an angry shake of the head and is fiercely independent. An organic farmer for decades, Young has an unaffected and homely voice. Her prose brims with genuine devotion to the wellbeing of animals. Most of us never apprehend the various inner lives animals possess, least of all those that we might eat. But Young has spent countless hours observing how these creatures love, play games, and form life-long friendships. She imparts hard-won wisdom about the both moral and real-world benefits of organic farming. (If preserving the dignity of animals isn't a good enough reason for you, consider how badly factory farming stunts the growth of animals, producing unhealthy and tasteless food.) This gorgeously-illustrated book, which includes an original introduction by the legendary British playwright Alan Bennett, is the summation of a life's work, and a delightful and moving tribute to the deep richness of animal sentience.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=rJHqDwAAQBAJ&dq=Secret+Life+of+Cows&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Behavior of the lower organisms, (Columbia University biologocal series)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=1NASnQEACAAJ&dq=Behavior+of+the+lower+organisms,+(Columbia+University+biologocal+series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Quest Crosstime","description":"This science fiction story swings Blake and Marfy across the fabric of counted years from the successor world of Vroom to a strange level warred over by rival factions of a remotely familiar Toltec empire to near-disaster in the rivers of a lifeless project world.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=d2hXAAAAYAAJ&dq=Quest+Crosstime&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Kipps: The Story of a Simple Soul","description":"Kipps: The Story of a Simple Soul by Herbert Wells George, first published in 1905, is a rare manuscript, the original residing in one of the great libraries of the world.

In Petrograd, as St. Petersburg was then known, luxury-store windows are still brightly lit; the Duma debates the monarchy, the course of war, and clashing paths to reform; the workers in the miserable munitions factories veer toward sedition. At the front, all is stalemate, while in the countryside sullen anxiety among hard-pressed farmers is rapidly replacing patriotism. In Zurich, Lenin, with the smallest of all revolutionary groups, plots his sinister logistical miracle. With masterly and moving empathy, through the eyes of both historical and fictional protagonists, Solzhenitsyn unforgettably transports us to that time and place--the last of pre-Soviet Russia. November 1916 is the second volume in Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn's multipart work, The Red Wheel. This volume concentrates on a historical turning point, or \\"knot,\\" as the wheel rolls inexorably toward revolution.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=DgDangEACAAJ&dq=November+1916:+The+Red+Wheel+/+Knot+II&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Stop Panic","description":"Learn how to stop anxiety from stopping you Breakthrough Program   How to Stop Anxiety and How to Stop Panic Attacks: Our pace of life has increased exponentially in the last few decades.

FRANK LLOYD WRIGHT CONTAINS MANY NEVER BEFORE PUBLISHED PHOTOGRAPHS AND SITE PLANS   . . . a comprehensive and intriguing look at the work of Frank Lloyd Wright from the outside. It provides a view from the perspective of his designs in settings or landscapes . . . the point of view is to see how the designs of the outside flow into, out of, around, and in a few classic cases, under the architecture of the building.  -- John Crowley, Dean, College of Environmental Design, University of Georgia Shedding light on a fascinating yet previously unexamined topic, Wrightscapes analyzes 85 of Frank Lloyd Wright s designs paying particular attention to site planning, landscape design, community scale and regional planning. The authors include many original diagrams, rare archival material, and some 200 photographs and site plans, many never published before, detailing Wright s residential and public work and his urban design initiatives. A true collectors item Wrightscapes is a pleasure to read and a joy to own. Frank Lloyd Wright is perhaps best remembered for his unmatched mastery of the organic style of architecture  where a structure s form and material blend harmoniously with its natural surroundings. Less well known, but equally inspirational are the contributions Wright brought to landscape and site design. His creations in this area reflect a holistic, sustainable, and environmentally-sensitive utilization of plants, climate, solar power, and natural lighting. Wrightscapes is the first definitive book to address Frank Lloyd Wright s landscapes and environments. The authors provide a unique new perspective of the man and his work by presenting previously ignored, yet important aspects of his achievements, interests, and career, including little-known facts such as: * Wright originated the visionary concept of a rear living-room opening into a garden terrace -- fifty years before the California architects generally credited with the concept * Wright actually designed the first carport  three decades prior to the date he is said to have  invented  it * During the first forty years of Wright s career, he personally and professionally interacted with, and was significantly influenced by, designers who today would be described as landscape architects * Wright had a career-long fascination with community-scale planning Wrightscapes also chronicles how and why Wright s famous ecological sensibilities were established, delving into Japanese and European influences as well as forces that shaped both the young and the mature architect. The authors also demonstrate how his design aspirations went far beyond the accepted definitions of architecture. In order to be as complete as possible, Wrightscapes even includes a detailed listing of  dos and don ts  for owners of homes designed by Frank Lloyd Wright Here is truly groundbreaking, richly-illustrated coverage of an important yet unexplored aspect of Frank Lloyd Wright s genius.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=CTYo2Fs36nQC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Impact Firecrackers : A History and How-To Guide to Classic Fireworks","description":"Here John Donner takes you back to a time when there were fewer restrictions on fireworks, including the classics such as globe torpedoes and cracker balls.

Is it even possible? In this concise book, one of the world's leading political philosophers presents with clarity and wit a compelling moral case for socialism and argues that the obstacles in its way are exaggerated. There are times, G. A. Cohen notes, when we all behave like socialists. On a camping trip, for example, campers wouldn't dream of charging each other to use a soccer ball or for fish that they happened to catch. Campers do not give merely to get, but relate to each other in a spirit of equality and community. Would such socialist norms be desirable across society as a whole? Why not? Whole societies may differ from camping trips, but it is still attractive when people treat each other with the equal regard that such trips exhibit. But, however desirable it may be, many claim that socialism is impossible. Cohen writes that the biggest obstacle to socialism isn't, as often argued, intractable human selfishness--it's rather the lack of obvious means to harness the human generosity that is there. Lacking those means, we rely on the market. But there are many ways of confining the sway of the market: there are desirable changes that can move us toward a socialist society in which, to quote Albert Einstein, humanity has \\"overcome and advanced beyond the predatory stage of human development.\\"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=BEk_mQEACAAJ&dq=Socialism&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Plato: The man and his work","description":"This outstanding work by a renowned Plato scholar presents the thought of the great Greek philosopher with historical accuracy and objective analysis.

Pb","description":"The pub has been at the centre of Irish life for centuries. It has played many roles: funeral home, restaurant, grocery shop, music venue, job centre and meeting place for everyone from poets to revolutionaries. Often plain and unpretentious, it is a neutral ground, a leveller  a home away from home. From the feasts of high kings, through the heady gang-ruled pubs of nineteenth-century New York, right up to the gay bars and superpubs of today, this is an entertaining journey through the evolution of the Irish pub. Our  locals  have become a global phenomenon: the export of the Irish pub, its significance to emigrants and its portrayal in cinema, television and literature are engagingly explored. The story of the Irish pub is the story of Ireland itself. \\"Fascinating ... endlessly surprising.\\"  Irish Independent. \\"Full of brilliant anecdotes, packed with legal, literary, religious and historical bits and pieces that will keep you talking in the pub all night.\\"  Neil Delamere, Today FM. \\"An enjoyable romp through the ephemera and facts surrounding that most Irish of institutions.\\"  Irish Examiner. \\"Fascinating ... a great gift.\\"  Mark Cagney, TV3","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=PwiWDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Terms of Endearment (Signet)","description":"This is a story of how mother and daughter learn the joys and pitfalls of love.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=VMFvPAAACAAJ&dq=Terms+of+Endearment+(Signet)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Gardens of the World: Two Thousand Years of Garden Design","description":"A truly magnificent panorama of garden design for professional and designers and garden travelers alike.

The government moved Inuit from their family camps to crowded settlements run by White government officers, took their children away to residential/boarding and day schools, and began a wage economy that created poverty. The greatest change took place in the Inuit family. This is a family-based collectivist culture, so when the family is dramatically changed everything will go wrong. Generations were segregated where family life meant being very close across generations, parenting changed, children became much more independent. The generation that was placed in the boarding and day schools developed problems with alcohol, domestic violence, and romantic relationships. Their children beginning in the 1980s started killing themselves. Suicide among youth has become an epidemic, with Inuit having among the highest suicide rates in the world. I trace suicide and other social problems to the imperialism/colonialism of the government. But then the book turns to how Inuit are preventing suicide by developing and running their own programs and activities. Government suicide prevention has not worked, but when Inuit are in control it does appear to work quite well. The actions by a group of youth in one community are detailed, showing how they organized themselves and started a youth center that seems to have stopped many suicides. The aspirations and challenges of Inuit youth are described, and their futures are outlined.\\"--Provided by publisher.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=68ObDwAAQBAJ&dq=Return+to+Suicide&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Pulp Classics: Strange Tales #4 (March 1932)","description":"When Strange Tales first appeared in 1931 as a pulp magazine, it was clearly something new.

Cave, Ray Cummings, and numerous others. Had the Great Depression not intervened and killed it after seven issues, the whole history of fantastic fiction might have been different.

The royal coroner ruled that Christopher Marlowe was killed in self-defense, but historians have long suspected otherwise, given his role as an \\"intelligencer\\" in the queen's secret service. In sixteenth-century London, Marlowe embarks on his final intelligence assignment, hoping to find his missing muse, as well as the culprits behind a high-stakes smuggling scheme. In present-day New York, grad student turned private eye Kate Morgan is called in on an urgent matter. One of her firm's top clients, a London-based financier, has chanced upon a mysterious manuscript that had been buried for centuries -- one that someone, somewhere is desperate to steal. What secret lurks in those yellowed, ciphered pages? And how, so many years later, could it drive someone to kill? As Kate sets off for England, she receives a second assignment. An enigmatic art dealer has made an eleven-million-dollar purchase from an Iranian intelligence officer. Is it a black-market antiquities deal, or something far more sinister? Like Marlowe, Kate moonlights as a spy -- her P.I. firm doubles as an off-the-books U.S. intelligence unit -- and she is soon caught like a pawn in a deadly international game. As The Intelligencer's interlocking narratives race toward a stunning collision, and Kate closes in on the truth behind Marlowe's sudden death, it becomes clear that she may have sealed a similar fate for herself. Propelling us from the shadows of the sixteenth-century underworld to the glitter of Queen Elizabeth's court, from the dark corridors of a clandestine American op-center to the cliffs of Capri, The Intelligencer is at once a murder mystery, a tale of poetic inspiration, and a richly detailed foray into parallel worlds of espionage and political intrigue separated by centuries.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Rede4ErU3hsC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Grayheart","description":"Rezsia, an inexperienced wolfwalker from the city, faces her toughest challenge when the elders ask her to investigate a series of strange deaths, and she discovers a mysterious hidden evil.

First-rate scholarship presented in a pleasingly accessible style.\\"  Stephen Spector, author of Evangelicals and Israel: The Story of American Christian Zionism It is generally accepted that Jews and evangelical Christians have little in common. Yet special alliances developed between the two groups in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Evangelicals viewed Jews as both the rightful heirs of Israel and as a group who failed to recognize their true savior. Consequently, they set out to influence the course of Jewish life by attempting to evangelize Jews and to facilitate their return to Palestine. Their double-edged perception caused unprecedented political, cultural, and theological meeting points that have revolutionized Christian-Jewish relationships. An Unusual Relationship explores the beliefs and political agendas that evangelicals have created in order to affect the future of the Jews. This volume offers a fascinating, comprehensive analysis of the roots, manifestations, and consequences of evangelical interest in the Jews, and the alternatives they provide to conventional historical Christian-Jewish interactions. It also provides a compelling understanding of Middle Eastern politics through a new lens. Yaakov Ariel is Professor of Religious Studies at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

In her new Introduction, Nel Noddings revisits her seminal book and places care as central to current debates on standardization, accountability, privatization, and the continuous struggle between traditional and progressive methods of education. Rather then forcing one side to yield to the other, this book advocates an alternative,  responsive system  that will allow the best ideas to flourish. In the Second Edition, Noddings once again envisions a school system built on the idea that different people have different strengths, and that these strengths should be cultivated in an environment of caring, not of competition. She suggests that if we make the responsiveness characteristic of caring more basic than accountability, we can accommodate both traditional and progressive preferences in one school system to the benefit of all . . . especially the children. Chapters address the practical and theoretical questions involved in organizing traditional and nontraditional areas of study around themes of care. Introductory chapters focus on caring in general and on the problems of liberal education, while the final chapter offers sound advice for implementing a caring curriculum in our schools. Praise for the First Edition! \\"A welcome addition to the often fragmented discussion of what children need and what school and education should be.\\"  Harvard Educational Review \\"I recommend this book to all concerned about education, personally and/or professionally.\\"  Journal of Moral Education \\"In the morass of school reform that calls for such changes as national standards, improved assessments, and new ways of organizing schooling, Noddings provides lucid thinking about the priorities we ought to consider.\\"  Teachers College Record","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=LaRDAwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Costa Rica","description":"DIVAn interdisciplinary anthology that includes many primary resources never before published in English./div","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=_SzrmuGMPjIC&dq=Costa+Rica&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hell's Legionnaire: The Conroy Diary- Buckley Plays- A Hunch: A Special Collection of Short Stories","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=JCS3nQEACAAJ&dq=Hell%27s+Legionnaire:+The+Conroy+Diary-+Buckley+Plays-+A+Hunch:+A+Special+Collection+of+Short+Stories&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Stepping on the Cracks SIGNED","description":"Culled from Hahn's memories of growing up under the shadow of World War II, this story has touched young readers for more than 15 years.

Marilyn Strathern challenges the traditional separation of Western kinship studies from the study of the wider society. If contemporary society appears diverse, changing and fragmented, these same features also apply to people's ideas about kinship. She views ideas of relatedness, nature and the biological constitution of persons in their cultural context, and offers new insights into the late twentieth-century values of individualism and consumerism. After Nature is a timely reflection at a moment when advances in reproductive technology raise questions about the natural basis of kinship relations.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=W1eBswEACAAJ&dq=After+Nature:+English+Kinship+in+the+Late+Twentieth+Century+(Lewis+Henry+Morgan+Lectures)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Dead (Case Studies in Contemporary Criticism)","description":"Adopted at more than 1,000 colleges and universities, Bedford/St. Martin's innovative Case Studies in Contemporary Criticism series has introduced more than a quarter of a million students to literary theory and earned enthusiastic praise nationwide.

Zamperini s story has touched millions through Laura Hillenbrand s biography Unbroken and its blockbuster movie adaptation directed by Angelina Jolie. Now, in his own words, Zamperini reveals with warmth and great charm the essential values and lessons that sustained him throughout his remarkable journey. He was a youthful troublemaker from California who turned his life around to become a 1936 Olympian. Putting aside his track career, he volunteered for the army before Pearl Harbor and was thrust into World War II as a B-24 bombardier. While on a rescue mission, his plane went down in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, where he survived against all odds, drifting two thousand miles in a small raft for forty-seven days. His struggle was only beginning: Zamperini was captured by the Japanese, and for more than two years he courageously endured torture and psychological abuse in a series of prisoner-of-war camps. He returned home to face more dark hours, but in 1949 Zamperini s life was transformed by a spiritual rebirth that would guide him through the next sixty-five years of his long and happy life.

But it is not. The 1980s witnessed a tremendous boom in pawnbroking. There are now more pawnshops thanever before in U.S. history, and they are found not only in large cities but in towns and suburbs throughout the nation. As John Caskey demonstrates in Fringe Banking, the increased public patronage of both pawnshops and commercial check-cashing outlets signals the growing number of American households now living on a cash-only basis, with no connection to any mainstream credit facilities or banking services. Fringe Banking is the first comprehensive study of pawnshops and check-cashing outlets, profiling their operations, customers, and recent growth from family-owned shops to such successful outlet chains as Cash American and ACE America's Cash Express. It explains why, despite interest rates and fees substantially higher than those of banks, their use has so dramatically increased. According to Caskey, declining family earnings, changing family structures, a growing immigrant population, and lack of household budgeting skills has greatly reduced the demand for bank deposit services among millions of Americans. In addition, banks responded to 1980s regulatory changes by increasing fees on deposit accounts with small balances and closing branches in many poor urban areas. These factors combined to leave many low- and moderate-income families without access to checking privileges, credit services, and bank loans. Pawnshops and check-cashing outlets provide such families with essential financial services thay cannot obtain elsewhere. Caskey notes that fringe banks, particularly check-cashing outlets, are also utilized by families who could participate in the formal banking system, but are willing to pay more for convenience and quick access to cash. Caskey argues that, contrary to their historical reputation as predators milking the poor and desperate, pawnshops and check-cashing outlets play a key financial role for disadvantaged groups. Citing the inconsistent and often unenforced state laws currently governing the industry, Fringe Banking challenges policy makers to design regulations that will allow fringe banks to remain profitable without exploiting the customers who depend on them.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=eeOFAwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"College Algebra: Graphing and Data Analysis","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=YUkGuAEACAAJ&dq=College+Algebra:+Graphing+and+Data+Analysis&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Land of Two Halves","description":"After ten years in New Zealand, Joe Bennett asked himself what on earth he was doing there.

In New Orleans in 1937, a man and a woman embark on a headlong flight into the wilderness of illicit passion, fleeing her husband and the temptations of respectability. In Mississippi ten years earlier, a convict sets forth across a flooded river, risking his own chance at freedom to rescue a pregnant woman. From these separate stories Faulkner composes a symphony of deliverance and damnation, survival and self-sacrifice, a novel in which elemental danger is juxtaposed wiht fatal injuries of the spirit. The Wild Palms is grandly inventive, heart-stopping in its prose, and suffused on every page with the physical presence of the country that Faulkner made his own.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=jmi9bKpirnoC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Feline Online: What Happens When a Smart Cat Surfs the Internet?","description":"Tarzan, a sealpoint Siamese cat, can read, surf the 'net, and communicate with Bastet, the cat goddess of ancient Egypt.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=eh7jPAAACAAJ&dq=Feline+Online:+What+Happens+When+a+Smart+Cat+Surfs+the+Internet%3F&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Peach (Nexus)","description":"This book discusses key issues concerning water, energy and food in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region.

The essential is always invisible and life is a perfect example of this because we do not see it, only its manifestations. Accessing the invisible world to broaden our understanding is perfectly legitimate and this book is a very precious guide so that we avoid the mistakes, illusions or even certain dangers that may arise. Thus, through rigorous work we will be able to access luminous revelations of great purity.  You must not imagine that, just because some people have mediumistic capacities, this necessarily gives them access to every region of the invisible world; on the contrary, they will see only what corresponds to their own level of consciousness, their own thoughts and desires. Each individual receives the degree of clairvoyance that matches his level of evolution; those who are still mired in the lower regions of the astral plane are bound to suffer because they will encounter only the entities of that plane. If you want to be in communication with heavenly entities, with divine splendour, you must purify yourself, broaden the scope of your consciousness and work for the highest ideal: the brotherhood of all men, the Kingdom of God. When you do this, your emanations become purer, your vibrations subtler, and not only will the spirits of light allow you to reach them, but they themselves will come to you, for they will find nourishment in you.

Sean had now consumed so much alcohol that everything seemed perfectly reasonable. He'd started planning the job already. The first problem was how to do it. Thirteen thousand pounds in an envelope seems a fair price for a man's life. Particularly if you don't know the man, he seems a nonentity, and you quite fancy his wife. And there's no chance of being caught. Sean is a drifter, working as a building labourer and waiting for something to happen. When Sean is offered easy money to tail someone and even more easy money to dispose of him, it's all more tempting than you might think. Except when you realize that you've been led up the garden path the whole way... KING OF THE ANTS is dark, disturbing and violently comic. In the tradition of both Joe Orton and Iain Banks, Charlie Higson pinpoints the casual vagaries of evil and its attendant powers. Unnerving, horribly accurate and wickedly enjoyable, it remains Higson's finest book.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=dJCDCgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Scots worthies;","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=aK1CAAAAYAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Kites: Twelve Easy-To-Make High Fliers","description":"Provides instructions for making and flying all kinds of kites, including a serpent kite, six-sided kite, shooting star, and flexible kite.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=y5Ogfo0Z_OEC&dq=Kites:+Twelve+Easy-To-Make+High+Fliers&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Religions of the World Series: Buddhism","description":"Produced specifically to answer QCA concerns over attainment and assessment in RE at Key Stage 3, this series balances learning about religions with learning from religions.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Gvv4kk1pQqoC&dq=Religions+of+the+World+Series:+Buddhism&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Gay Cosmos","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=3TwbAAAAYAAJ&dq=Gay+Cosmos&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Iceland (Classic Geology in Europe)","description":"For over a decade this concise and authoritative field guide to an exceptional natural laboratory has been an essential companion for all those visiting Iceland to observe the Earth in action.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=YLO0wwEACAAJ&dq=Iceland+(Classic+Geology+in+Europe)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Pennine Journey: Unabridged: The Story of a Long Walk in 1938","description":"This study looks at the processes whereby archaeology became a formal academic subject in which degrees are awarded, and the pioneering role played by Cambridge University in this.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=CDUrAQAAIAAJ&dq=A+Pennine+Journey:+Unabridged:+The+Story+of+a+Long+Walk+in+1938&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Your Hands Can Heal You : Pranic Healing Energy Remedies to Boost Vitality and Speed Recovery from Common Health Problems","description":"What if one of the most effective tools you have to restore your health is not surgery or medications, but your own hands?

Even before everything was disrupted by COVID-19 (not to mention by Trump), millions of Americans were already questioning capitalism s  values.  We were already challenging the idea that your job defines you. We already knew something was wrong. Loneliness, frustration, and alienation were already on the rise. Even the most successful of us felt too busy, too preoccupied, and too distracted to enjoy what we intuitively know are life s greatest rewards: vibrant relationships, family life, connection to others, involvement in our community, and the thrilling experience of love. Fall in Love . . . builds a well-researched and entertaining bridge to living happier lives and to a better future. It shows us that based on a better understanding of our evolutionary selves, we can thrive in family life and in our work life, too. But to do both joyfully and at the same time depends on rediscovering the priority of relationships, connections, community, and love.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=oYZGEAAAQBAJ&dq=He+Saves:+How+to+Become+-+and+Stay+-+a+Christian+(Foundations)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Nader: Crusader, Spoiler, Icon","description":"A biography of the consumer advocate who has devoted his life to crusading for citizens' rights, and who ran as the Green Party's presidential candidate in 2000.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=SCbsAAAAMAAJ&dq=Nader:+Crusader,+Spoiler,+Icon&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Advanced Project Management Office: A Comprehensive Look at Function and Implementation","description":"The Project Management Office (PMO) is a rapidly emerging concept in project management that has evolved in terms of its application, sophistication, and proven results.

These women used their songs to proclaim their pain or to speak up and protest unfair conditions and discrimination. Through their songs, they expressed a desire for freedom and equality in a time when women were almost universally subjugated. The 37 women profiled here are representative of the many blueswomen who performed in the United States through the end of World War II. Some are well known (e.g., Lucille Bogan and Sippie Wallace), but many are obscure (such as Lil Johnson, Liza Brown and Margaret Whitmire).

Central to this effort is Grieve's unfolding of Poundian \\"objectivity\\" in Pound's early poetry and poetics, which is shown to be not just an attitude toward reality but a self-conscious deconstruction of subjectivity as the privileged ground of poetry.

The Ancient and Mystical Order Rosae Crucis, also called the Rosicrucian Order (AMORC), is a worldwide philosophical and humanistic, fraternal order devoted to \\"the study of the elusive mysteries of life and the universe.\\" The organization is non-sectarian and it is open to both men and women of adult age regardless of their various religious persuasions. The current open cycle in America of AMORC was re-activated by Harvey Spencer Lewis in 1915. Lewis received authority to do so from the Supreme Council of the Rosicrucian Order after being tried, tested and finally initiated into the Order in 1909, Toulouse, France. AMORC's teachings draw upon ideas of the major philosophers, particularly Pythagoras, Thales, Solon, Heraclitus and Democritus. The teachings are divided into Degrees which are further grouped into broad categories under titles such as Postulant, Neophyte and Initiate sections. These degrees cover various fields related to physical, mental, psychic and spiritual existence such as physics, metaphysics, biology, psychology, parapsychology, comparative religion, traditional healing techniques, health, intuition, extrasensory perception, material and spiritual alchemy, meditation, sacred architecture, symbolism, and that mystical state of consciousness relating to the experience of unity with the Divine.

Lana and Gil Martin marry in 1776, just as the rumblings of war begin to echo throughout the wilderness of the Mohawk Valley.

Amusing and excellent,  this famous collection of Soviet satire from 1918 to 1963 devastatingly lampoons the social, economic, and cultural changes wrought by the Russian Revolution (Isaac Bashevis Singer). Among the seventeen bold and inventive writers represented here are the brilliant Mikhail Bulgakov, Ilf and Petrov, Mikhail Zoshchenko, Yevgeny Zamyatin, Valentin Katayev, and Yuri Kazakov. Whether the stories and novellas collected here take the form of allegory, fantasy, or science fiction, the results are ingenious, critical, and hilariously timeless.  The stories in this collection tell the reader more about Soviet life than a dozen sociological or political tracts.   Isaac Bashevis Singer  An altogether admirable collection . . . by the highly talented translator Mirra Ginsburg . . . Many of these stories and sketches are delicious, even-a miracle!-funny, and full of subtlety and intelligence.   The New Leader  Hilarious entertainment.

Translated from the Polish by award-winning translators John and Bogdana Carpenter, these sixty-eight verse and prose poems span forty years of Herbert's incredible life and work. The pieces are organized chronologically from 1950 to 1990, with an emphasis on the writer's early and late poems. Here Zbigniew Herbert's poetry turns from the public--what we have come to expect from this poet--to the more personal. The title poem, \\"Elegy for the Departure of Pen Ink and Lamp , is a three-part farewell ode to the inanimate objects and memories of childhood. Herbert reflects on the relationship between the living and the dead in \\"What Our Dead Do,\\" the state of his homeland in \\"Country,\\" and the power of language in \\"We fall asleep on words . . . \\" Herbert's short prose poems read like aphorisms, deceptively whimsical but always wise: \\"Bears are divided into brown and white, also paws, head, and trunk. They have nice snouts, and small eyes.... Children who love Winnie-the-Pooh would give them anything, but a hunter walks in the forest and aims with his rifle between that pair of small eyes.\\" Elegy for the Departure and Other Poems confirms Zbigniew Herbert's place as one of the world's greatest and most influential poets.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=OX6FQgAACAAJ&dq=Elegy+For+The+Departure&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"History of the Indians of Puerto Rico","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=n1AzpwAACAAJ&dq=History+of+the+Indians+of+Puerto+Rico&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Russian Postmodernism: New Perspectives on Post-Soviet Culture (Studies in Slavic Literature, Culture, and Society, Vol 3)","description":"Presents essays and manifestos on recent Russian literature, culture, and religion","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=5qjzj3JwaoIC&dq=Russian+Postmodernism:+New+Perspectives+on+Post-Soviet+Culture+(Studies+in+Slavic+Literature,+Culture,+and+Society,+Vol+3)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Martyrs' Shrine: The Story of the Reform Movement of 1898 in China","description":"\\"With a plot that extends over forty years of Chinese history, Martyrs' Shrine is at the same time an ultimately pessimistic account of the possibilities for meaningful political change in China, and a hymn of praise to those who have fought against the odds to try to achieve it.\\"--Jacket.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=jRmCAAAAIAAJ&dq=Martyrs%27+Shrine:+The+Story+of+the+Reform+Movement+of+1898+in+China&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Wedding Planning For Dummies (For Dummies (Lifestyles Paperback))","description":"Congratulations, you re planning a wedding!

Beginning with the premise of the infallibility of the Bible, it argues that both the Reformers' understanding of the atonement and their doctrine of salvation are invalid, since they are contradicted by numerous scriptures. In the end, the result of this search is a new understanding of both the atonement and salvation and the development of doctrines on these subjects, which will enable us to read canonically without seeing contradictions. Through faith and reason, a sound hermeneutic and careful exegesis, The Mystery of the Cross and the Narrow Gate uncovers the internal coherence of scripture, with the principal objective of restoring truth and bringing reform to a church that fails to grasp that the Holy Spirit is given to humankind to enable us to become holy and be made fit for the kingdom in heaven-refer www.themysteryofthecross.com.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=_Y03DwAAQBAJ&dq=Crossing+the+Narrow+Gate&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"How You look and Dress","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=jDXTAQAACAAJ&dq=How+You+look+and+Dress&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Skills for Consumer Success (with CD-ROM) (Title 1)","description":"This updated seriec reinforces necessary skills in reading comprehension, vocabulary, grammar, writing, math applications, problem solving, test-taking and more.

Drawing from numerous examples of his own past and current work, he shows that ethnographic practice and the ethnographic imagination are vital to understanding the creativity and irreducibility of experience in all aspects of social and cultural practice. Willis argues that ethnography plays a vital role in constituting 'sensuousness' in textual, methodological, and substantive ways, but it can do this only through the deployment of an associated theoretical imagination which cannot be found simply there in the field. He presents a bold and incisive ethnographically oriented view of the world, emphasizing the need for a deep-running social but also aesthetic sensibility. In doing so he brings new insights to the understanding of human action and its dialectical relation to social and symbolic structures. He makes original contributions to the understanding of the contemporary human uses of objects, artefacts and communicative forms, presenting a new analysis of commodity fetishism as central to consumption and to the wider social relations of contemporary societies. He also utilizes his perspective to further the understanding of the contemporary crisis in masculinity and to cast new light on various lived everyday cultures - at school, on the dole, on the street, in the Mall, in front of TV, in the dance club. This book will be essential reading for all those involved in planning or contemplating ethnographic fieldwork and for those interested in the contributions it can make to the social sciences and humanities.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=-b3VAAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Stress Analysis of a Strapless Evening Gown: Essays for a Scientific Age","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ze1ZAAAAMAAJ&dq=A+Stress+Analysis+of+a+Strapless+Evening+Gown:+Essays+for+a+Scientific+Age&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Stripah Love","description":"\\"Sizzling as a fried clam.

On March 8, 2014, Malaysian Airlines Flight MH370 disappeared with barely a trace, carrying 239 people on board--seemingly vanishing into the dark night. The airplane's whereabouts and fate would quickly become one of the biggest aviation mysteries of our time... Richard Quest, CNN's Aviation Correspondent, was one of the leading journalists covering the story. In a coincidence, Quest had interviewed one of the two pilots a few weeks before the disappearance. It is here that he begins his gripping account of those tense weeks in March, presenting a fascinating chronicle of an international search effort, which despite years of searching and tens of millions of dollars spent has failed to find the plane. Quest dissects what happened in the hours following the plane's disappearance and chronicles the days and weeks of searching, which led to nothing but increasing despair. He takes apart the varying responses from authorities and the discrepancies in reports, the wide range of theories, the startling fact that the plane actually turned around and flew in the opposite direction, and what solutions the aviation industry must now implement to ensure it never happens again. What emerges is a riveting chronicle of a tragedy that continues to baffle everyone from aviation experts to satellite engineers to politicians--and which to this day worries the traveling public that it could happen again.

French women seem to have a special knack for life's most important things food, love, raising children. And in matters of beauty and style, they appear to be at an unfair advantage.

French women learn at a young age how to feel beautiful, confident, and sexy, inside and out. It's an allure that outlasts youth in fact, some of France's most celebrated women are femmes d'un certain age.

Now she shares that wisdom along with advice from other French women on fragrance, image consulting, makeup, and more.  This charming foray into French femininity will make a perfect cadeau for any Francophile lady.

The necessary equipment is described in relation to its purpose, along with checklists and hints for practical use. The practical handling of light, with observation of the relationship of cause to effect, is central to the study of stage lighting. Rehearsal pressures usually restrict the time available for experimenting with lighting for a performance, but laboratory-style projects can be used to enable specific lighting problems to be solved. The core of this book is a series of 'discovery' projects using minimal resources, to explore the use of light in the theatre, with particular emphasis on the interaction of conflicting visual aims. The projects cover all the major scenarios likely to be encountered by lighting students and have been tried and tested by the author, who has taught lighting students all over the world for over 30 years. The book has been updated to include more on safety and the latest technology including: - fixed instruments using the new lower wattage high efficiency lamps in combination with dichronic reflectors - an increase in the availability, reliability, range and usage of 'moving light' technology based on remotely controlled instruments. New lighting projects have also been added. If you are studying the art and craft of stage lighting this book is an excellent working manual that will provide you with the technical knowledge and skill to cope with a range of lighting situations.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=9JVACwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"What kinda cactus izzat?: A \\"who s who\\" of strange plants of the southwest American desert","description":"Dr ULRICH MEVE'S book on Duvalia, one of the 30 genera comprising the group of stem-succulent Asclepiadaceae, is a piece of well-done research.

The rare work of irresistibly inviting philosophy, Bachelard s seminal work brims with quiet revelations and stirring, mysterious imagery. This lyrical journey takes as its premise the emergence of the poetic image and finds an ideal metaphor in the intimate spaces of our homes. Guiding us through a stream of meditations on poetry, art, and the blooming of consciousness itself, Bachelard examines the domestic places that shape and hold our dreams and memories. Houses and rooms; cellars and attics; drawers, chests, and wardrobes; nests and shells; nooks and corners: No space is too vast or too small to be filled by our thoughts and our reveries. In Bachelard s enchanting spaces,  We are never real historians, but always near poets, and our emotion is perhaps nothing but an expression of a poetry that was lost.  This new edition features a foreword by Mark Z. Danielewski, whose bestselling novel House of Leaves drew inspiration from Bachelard s writings, and an introduction by internationally renowned philosopher Richard Kearney who explains the book s enduring importance and its role within Bachelard s remarkable career. For more than sixty-five years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world.

They've perfected their dramatic roles and are prepared to do whatever it takes to win. There's the takenoprisoners Marine sergeant, the gay hairdresser, the ruthless lawyer, the brainy poet. But one player refuses to compete Gloria Hamm, a sullen dental hygienist, voted least likely to win by the show's crew. The higherups are desperate for ratings and sensational twists to trump the plots of seasons past. But the producer haunted by personal tragedies all too real is losing control of the show and its crew. While he obsesses about Gloria, the crew plots mutiny, a contestant dances with insanity, and disease threatens to halt the show completely. When real catastrophes strike, the producer finds it harder and harder to navigate his surreal landscape, where boundaries of the real, imagined, and orchestrated have blurred beyond recognition. Deus Ex Machina deconstructs our notions of narrative, revealing how tricky it is for any auteur to disappear from his creation. In an age when people will seemingly do anything to be on television, it asks what is the true nature of \\"reality,\\" and what is its cost?","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=TtoREAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Tout Brel (French Edition)","description":"In celebration of his unique talent and in commemoration of the twenty-fifth anniversary of his death, this is the first book-length study in English of the work of Belgian chansonnier Jacques Brel.

When an affair with a dashing aviator and friendship with the spirited Amelia Earhart awaken her passion for flying, Lenora  captivated by two cultures and loved by two men  finds herself on an exhilarating path towards independence.

Rival factions - Lancastrians and Yorkists - are hacking each other to death in a conflict that only the English could name after a beautifully-scented flower. It's not an ideal climate for tourists - but three exotic travellers from the Far East are not here for pleasure. They've come to find a missing kinsman. The English, however, are truly strange. Most of the indigenous population are of the cowed peasant variety whilst any noble who can't trace his ancestry to Norman Conquest isn't, really, an awfully nice chap. In between battles of the most astonishing brutality they convey respects instead of affection, make love strangely (and briefly) and amuse themselves by playing a game with an inflated bladder that is in everyway a war except it's called 'footie'. The Indians think they're mad. They also have this horrible suspicion that one day they will rule the world... A wonderfully offbeat take on medieval England at its most brutal and savage, KINGS OF ALBION snatches history, imbues it with the spirit of Rider Haggard and Joseph Conrad, turns it on its head, invites scintillating speculation and, best of all, renders it into a fabulously readable novel.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=gzpTDwAAQBAJ&dq=KINGS+OF+ALBION&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Lovejoy genealogy with biographies and history, 1460-1930","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=PM56zgEACAAJ&dq=The+Lovejoy+genealogy+with+biographies+and+history,+1460-1930&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Inventorship: The Art of Innovation","description":"\\"From this lively and personal account, we learn that we can all practice inventorship to great advantage-measured either in gold or pleasure, or perhaps both!\\"-From the Foreword by Walter Cronkite \\"Inventorship is truly the stuff from which the future will be molded.

As Americans, we assume that more choice means better options and greater satisfaction. But beware of excessive choice: choice overload can make you question the decisions you make before you even make them, it can set you up for unrealistically high expectations, and it can make you blame yourself for any and all failures. In the long run, this can lead to decision-making paralysis, anxiety, and perpetual stress. And, in a culture that tells us that there is no excuse for falling short of perfection when your options are limitless, too much choice can lead to clinical depression. In The Paradox of Choice, Barry Schwartz explains at what point choice the hallmark of individual freedom and self-determination that we so cherish becomes detrimental to our psychological and emotional well-being. In accessible, engaging, and anecdotal prose, Schwartz shows how the dramatic explosion in choice from the mundane to the profound challenges of balancing career, family, and individual needs has paradoxically become a problem instead of a solution. Schwartz also shows how our obsession with choice encourages us to seek that which makes us feel worse. By synthesizing current research in the social sciences, Schwartz makes the counter intuitive case that eliminating choices can greatly reduce the stress, anxiety, and busyness of our lives. He offers eleven practical steps on how to limit choices to a manageable number, have the discipline to focus on those that are important and ignore the rest, and ultimately derive greater satisfaction from the choices you have to make.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=g422yyua-P8C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Very Best Baby Name Book in the Whole Wide World","description":"Over 13,001 girls' and boys' names.

In so doing, he casts the art and the artists we love in a new light, and reveals how film can both expose the fault lines in conventional masculinity and point the way past it, toward a more nuanced understanding of what it means to be a person with desires.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=HejEDwAAQBAJ&dq=A+Stranger%27s+Desire&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Perfectly Sexy (Harlequin Temptation)","description":"Perfectly Sexy by Emily McKay released on Apr 23, 2004 is available now for purchase.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=8VMulUSaISwC&dq=Perfectly+Sexy+(Harlequin+Temptation)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cock of the walk, qui-qui-ri-qui!: The legend of Pancho Villa","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=J7hVAAAAMAAJ&dq=Cock+of+the+walk,+qui-qui-ri-qui!:+The+legend+of+Pancho+Villa&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Quilts From A Painter's Art 2006 Calendar","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=dfaPC_WSlNwC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"War Crimes: Japan's World War II Atrocities","description":"Now in a significant new edition, this landmark book documents little-known wartime Japanese atrocities during World War II, including cannibalism; the slaughter and starvation of prisoners of war; the rape, enforced prostitution, and murder of noncombatants; and biological warfare experiments.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=CCkzDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ultrasonic Bioinstrumentation","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Real Small Groups Don't Just Happen: Nurturing Relationships in Your Small Group (TrueColors)","description":"In Real Small Groups Don't Just Happen, small-group expert Neal McBride takes you on a tour of what it takes to build real community.

They were seeking the world that they knew and loved through children s books. In Winnie-the-Pooh Country, Mrs. Milne showed them the way to  that enchanted place on the top of the Forest [where] a little boy and his Bear will always be playing.  In Edinburgh they stood outside Robert Louis Stevenson s childhood home, tilting their heads to talk to a lamplighter who was doing his job. In the Lake District they visited Jemima Puddle-Duck s farm, and Joan sought out crusty Arthur Ransome to talk to him about Swallows and Amazons. They spent several days  messing about in boats  on the River Thames, looking for Toad Hall and other places described by Kenneth Grahame in The Wind in the Willows. Mud and flood kept them from attaining the slopes of Pook s Hill (on Rudyard Kipling s farm), but they scaled the heights of Tintagel. As in all good fairy tales, there were unanswered questions. Did they really find Camelot? Robin Hood, as always, remains elusive. One thing is certain. Joan Bodger brings alive again the magic of the stories we love to remember. She persuades us that, like Emily Dickinson, even if we  have never seen a moor,  we can imagine  how the heather looks.  First published in 1965 by Viking in New York, How the Heather Looks has become a prized favorite among knowledgeable lovers of children s literature. Precious, well-thumbed copies have been lent out with caution and reluctance, while new admirers have gone searching in vain for copies to buy second-hand. This handsome reprint, with a new Afterword by Joan Bodger, makes a unique and delightful classic available once more.

As a member of the Citizen Potawatomi Nation, she embraces the notion that plants and animals are our oldest teachers. In Braiding Sweetgrass, Kimmerer brings these two lenses of knowledge together to take us on  a journey that is every bit as mythic as it is scientific, as sacred as it is historical, as clever as it is wise  (Elizabeth Gilbert). Drawing on her life as an indigenous scientist, and as a woman, Kimmerer shows how other living beings asters and goldenrod, strawberries and squash, salamanders, algae, and sweetgrass offer us gifts and lessons, even if we've forgotten how to hear their voices. In reflections that range from the creation of Turtle Island to the forces that threaten its flourishing today, she circles toward a central argument: that the awakening of ecological consciousness requires the acknowledgment and celebration of our reciprocal relationship with the rest of the living world. For only when we can hear the languages of other beings will we be capable of understanding the generosity of the earth, and learn to give our own gifts in return.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=vmM9BAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Through the Looking Glass: A Search for the Self in the Mirror of Relationships (Seminars in Psychological Astrology)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=4r64YgEACAAJ&dq=Through+the+Looking+Glass:+A+Search+for+the+Self+in+the+Mirror+of+Relationships+(Seminars+in+Psychological+Astrology)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Second Chance: The Last Chance II","description":"What would it take to get one last chance?

Drawing from Hindu and Christian spiritual wisdom, biological medicine, psychiatric technique, and over twenty-five years of clinical experience, Dr. Bedi has created a highly effective and integrated treatment approach to problems associated with both medical and psychiatric illness. He explains the Hindu concepts of maya, karma, and dharma, and builds a bridge between psychological dis-ease and our intrinsic hunger for spiritual union. Each symptom is seen as a crucial whisper from our soul, and if we understand its message, it can lead us to psychological balance. Dr. Bedi guides us through the process of Kundalini diagnosis, showing how the use of life events, medical or psychiatric symptoms, relationship strengths and problems, and life goals and aspirations can help us determine our dominant and auxiliary chakras. Since our chakras are focal points where physical, emotional, developmental, and spiritual forces intersect, they provide a paradigm that usefully links physical, psychological, developmental, and spiritual dimensions. He explains how he has successfully helped many patients correct imbalances by learning to access and strengthen this energy. Throughout this book there are numerous examples of how Dr. Bedi's patients have discovered what each individual eventually has to recognize; that our fulfillment, satisfaction, wholeness, and harmony can be reawakened when we touch the spark of divine light glowing within.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Wq7Xj3_p3FwC&dq=Path+of+the+Soul&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Santa Anna: A Curse Upon Mexico (Brassey's Military Profiles)","description":"A clear and concise treatment of Mexico's foremost military hero","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=4ggYAAAAYAAJ&dq=Santa+Anna:+A+Curse+Upon+Mexico+(Brassey%27s+Military+Profiles)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sumi-e (Color books, 24)","description":"Mindful Artist: Sumi-e Painting teaches you to create your own beautiful, Japanese-inspired ink wash paintings while cultivating a mindful approach to making art. Centuries ago, Buddhist monks used black ink and brushes to practice mindfulness and create gorgeously harmonious works of art called \\"sumi-e paintings.\\" The popularity of sumi-e, or ink wash painting, continues to this day. Mindfulness remains an essential element of sumi-e painting, allowing artists to focus on their surroundings, live in the moment, and feel present thereby reducing their stress. Walter Foster s new Mindful Artist series encourages you to enjoy working in your favorite media to create art from a reflective point of view an inspiring, relaxing experience that emphasizes the creative process, rather than the end result. These books are designed to help you move past creative obstacles, like a perfectionist attitude toward making art or self-defeating concerns about your personal talent and abilities. These guides will not only help you stay mindful throughout the process, but also to find personal meaning in the artwork you create. Mindful Artist: Sumi-e Painting opens with an introduction explaining the links between mindfulness and sumi-e and how they enhance one another.

In all three, identically the same method has been followed: some forty volumes, mostly from the pens of Annie Besant and C.W. Leadbeater, recognised to-day as the authorities par excellence on the Ancient wisdom in its guise of modern Theosophy, have been carefully searched for data connected with the mental body; those data have been classified, arranged and presented to the student in a form as coherent and sequential as the labours of the compiler have been able to make it.Throughout this series no attempt has been made to prove, or even to justify, the statements made, except in so far as their own internal evidence and reasonability justify them. The bona fides of these veteran investigators and teachers being unquestionable, the results of their investigations and their teachings are here set out, without evasion or reservation of any kind, so far as possible in their own words, modified and abridged only where necessary to suit the requirements of an orderly and logical presentation of the subject-matter.The question of proof is an entirely separate issue, and one, moreover, of vast dimensions. To have attempted to argue or prove the statements made would have defeated the primary object of these books, which is to lay before the serious student a condensed synthesis, within reasonable compass, of the teachings from the from the sources named regarding the bodies of man and the planes or worlds to which these belong. Those who desire proofs must search for them elsewhere.The fact that, after some two and a half years of intensive study of the writings of the two authors named, no discrepancies or contradictions, beyond, [xii] literally, two or three of trifling moment, have been discovered, constitutes a striking testimonial to the faithfulness in detail of the investigators, and to the coherence of the Theosophical system.As in the two preceding volumes, marginal references have been given in order that the student may, if he wish, verify for himself any statement made at the original sources. The indices of the series of three books, together with the marginal references, thus virtually constitute in themselves a fairly complete index to everything dealing with the etheric, astral, and lower mental worlds in the writings of Annie Besant and C.W. Leadbeater.It is hoped that there will be added to the series in due time a fourth volume, on The Causal Body.As already mentioned, by far the greater part of the material presented in this book, has been obtained directly from the writings of Dr. Besant and Bishop Leadbeater. The works of H. P. Blavatsky are not included in the list of authorities quoted. To have searched the Secret Doctrine for references to the Mental Body and the Mental Plane would, frankly have been a task beyond the powers of the compiler, and would, also, in all probability have resulted in a volume too abstruse for the class of student for whom this series of books is intended. The debt to H. P. Blavatsky is greater than ever could be indicated by quotations from her monumental volumes. Had she not shown the way in the first instance, later investigators might never have found the trail at all, let alone made it into a path where others may follow with comparative ease and safety.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=_zE-yQEACAAJ&dq=The+mental+body&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Os carvoeiros =: The charcoal people of Brazil","description":"The Historical Dictionary of South American Cinema covers the long history of cinema in Portuguese-speaking Brazil and the nine Spanish-speaking countries.

Does this good news refute the notion of a permanently disadvantaged black underclass, or has one type of disadvantage been replaced by another? Some economists fear that many newly employed minority workers will remain stuck in low-wage jobs, barred from better-paying, high skill jobs by their lack of educational opportunities and entrenched racial discrimination. Prosperity for All? draws upon the research and insights of respected economists to address these important issues. Prosperity for All? reveals that while African Americans benefit in many ways from a strong job market, serious problems remain. Research presented in this book shows that the ratio of black to white unemployment has actually increased over recent expansions. Even though African American men are currently less likely to leave the workforce, the number of those who do not find work at all has grown substantially, indicating that joblessness is now concentrated among the most alienated members of the population. Other chapters offer striking evidence that racial inequality is still pervasive. Among men, black high school dropouts have more difficulty finding work than their Latino or white counterparts. Likewise, the glass ceiling that limits minority access to higher paying promotions persists even in a strong economy. Prosperity for All? ascribes black disadvantage in the labor force to employer discrimination, particularly when there is strong competition for jobs. As one study illustrates, economic upswings do not appear to change racial preferences among employers, who remain less willing to hire African Americans for more skilled low-wage jobs. Prosperity for All? offers a timely investigation into the impact of strong labor markets on low-skill African-American workers, with important insights into the issues engendered by the weakening of federal assistance, job training, and affirmative action programs.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=v-4WAwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Zanzibar Chest: A Memoir of Love and War","description":"A deeply affecting memoir of a childhood in Africa and the continent's horrendous wars, which Hartley witnessed at first hand as a journalist in the 1990s.

Thompson flies with the angels Hell s Angels, that is in this short work of nonfiction.  California, Labor Day weekend . . . early, with ocean fog still in the streets, outlaw motorcyclists wearing chains, shades and greasy Levis roll out from damp garages, all-night diners and cast-off one-night pads in Frisco, Hollywood, Berdoo and East Oakland, heading for the Monterey peninsula, north of Big Sur. . . The Menace is loose again.  Thus begins Hunter S. Thompson s vivid account of his experiences with California s most notorious motorcycle gang, the Hell s Angels. In the mid-1960s, Thompson spent almost two years living with the controversial Angels, cycling up and down the coast, reveling in the anarchic spirit of their clan, and, as befits their name, raising hell. His book successfully captures a singular moment in American history, when the biker lifestyle was first defined, and when such countercultural movements were electrifying and horrifying America. Thompson, the creator of Gonzo journalism, writes with his usual bravado, energy, and brutal honesty, and with a nuanced and incisive eye; as The New Yorker pointed out,  For all its uninhibited and sardonic humor, Thompson s book is a thoughtful piece of work.  As illuminating now as when originally published in 1967, Hell s Angels is a gripping portrait, and the best account we have of the truth behind an American legend.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=84o2ZGPzEVEC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"How to Buy and Sell Apartment Buildings","description":"Whether you?re a first-time real estate investor or a seasoned professional, The Complete Guide to Buying and Selling Apartment Buildings helps you map out your future, find apartment buildings at a fair price, finance purchases, and manage your properties.

Welch investigates the roots of fear in the human heart and the ramifications of living in the grips of anxiety, worry, and dread. Running Scared explores how fear inescapably takes root in all of our lives and how our race for the good life finds us all too often  running scared.  Welch encourages readers to discover for themselves how the Bible is full of beautiful words of comfort and peace for fearful people. Everyone is afraid of something, and Welch guides readers to see how Jesus enters in to fear. Within thirty topical meditations, Welch offers sound biblical theology, gospel answers, and moment-by-moment, thoughtful encouragement for those in a heart and mind battlefield of rampant, panic-stricken fear. This comprehensive primer on the topic of fear, worry, and the rest of God will have readers retreating to Scripture for invariable constancy, stalwart care, and robust comfort rather than human independence, control, and self-protectiveness. Running Scared affirms that, through Scripture, God speaks directly to our fears, including: Money and possessions People and their judgments Death, pain, suffering, and punishment Welch's lively text provides convincing evidences that humanity's struggle against active and dormant fears are countless. He presents the good news that God provides both the remedy and the cure for this malady in the person of Jesus Christ, the work of the Holy Spirit, and through powerful, life-altering promises in Scripture. Far more than merely another psychology \\"self-help\\" guide, Running Scared serves as a biblical road map to a life of serenity and security.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=xZsqEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Theory in Contemporary Art since 1985","description":"Theory in Contemporary Art since 1985 is a groundbreaking anthology that captures the essence and the edge of the contemporary art scene.

When Ludwig van Beethoven lay dying in 1827, a young musician named Ferdinand Hiller came to pay his respects to the great composer, snipping a lock of Beethoven's hair as a keepsake--as was custom at the time--in the process. For a century, the lock of hair was a treasured Hiller family relic, until it somehow found its way to the town of Gilleleje, in Nazi-occupied Denmark. There, it was given to a local doctor, Kay Fremming, who was deeply involved in the effort to help save hundreds of hunted and frightened Jews. After Fremming's death, his daughter assumed ownership of the lock, and eventually consigned it for sale at Sotheby's, where two American Beethoven enthusiasts, Ira Brilliant and Che Guevara, purchased it in 1994. Subsequently, they and others instituted a series of complex forensic tests in the hope of finding the probable causes of the composer's chronically bad health, his deafness, and the final demise that Ferdinand Hiller had witnessed all those years ago. The results, revealed for the first time here, are the most compelling explanation yet offered for why one of the foremost musicians the world has ever known was forced to spend much of his life in silence. In Beethoven's Hair, Russell Martin has created a rich historical treasure hunt, a tale of false leads, amazing breakthroughs, and incredible revelations. This unique and fascinating book is a moving testament to the power of music, the lure of relics, the heroism of the Resistance movement, and the brilliance of molecular science.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=m3FWrYtTSOoC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Franco and the Spanish Civil War (Introductions to History)","description":"Franco and the Spanish Civil War is a wide-ranging and insightful analysis of the origins, course, and consequences of the conflict and of Franco's role within it.

Many managers fall into the trap of assuming that only gifted individuals--readily identifiable \\"creative types\\"--can produce breakthrough thinking, and if you don't have an eccentric genius on your team, your efforts are doomed to mediocrity. Some even argue that creativity is an art that can't possibly be planned or managed without extinguishing the vital creative spark. Yet, say Dorothy Leonard and Walter Swap, today's most innovative, complex services, products and processes spring from well-led, well-managed group interactions. Blending their backgrounds in business and psychology into a fresh perspective, Leonard and Swap sweep aside conventional thinking about creativity to show how managers can actively shape group processes to enhance creative output. They offer proven strategies based on a deep understanding of human behavior for stimulating and directing the group dynamics that lie at the heart of innovative thinking. The book clearly outlines and analyzes each step in the creative process and gives practical suggestions for managing creative teams, including specific techniques for composing groups to maximize creative abrasion, re-channeling the tensions of conflicting points of view into new ideas and alternative options, and failing forward to success. Leonard and Swap explore how all aspects of the work environment, from leadership style to the promotion of passion to the use of space to maximize serendipity, can enhance innovation. Drawing on examples in companies that range from small startups to Fisher-Price, Intel and Hewlett-Packard, When Sparks Fly shows how sophisticated managers can galvanize groups to maximize their creative potential.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=0VXhKk_nNN4C&dq=When+Sparks+Fly:+Igniting+Creativity+in+Groups&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Godspell","description":"13 selections from one of the most popular musicals ever.

His wide cultural tastes, his apparent tolerance of Jews and Muslims, his defiance of the papacy, and his supposed aim of creating a new, secular world order make him a figure especially attractive to contemporary historians. But as David Abulafia shows in this powerfully written biography, Frederick was much less tolerant and far-sighted in his cultural, religious, and political ambitions than is generally thought. Here, Frederick is revealed as the thorough traditionalist he really was: a man who espoused the same principles of government as his twelfth-century predecessors, an ardent leader of the Crusades, and a king as willing to make a deal with Rome as any other ruler in medieval Europe. Frederick's realm was vast. Besides ruling the region of Europe that encompasses modern Germany, Czechoslovakia, Poland, eastern France, and northern Italy, he also inherited the Kingdom of Sicily and parts of the Mediterranean that include what are now Israel, Lebanon, Malta, and Cyprus. In addition, his Teutonic knights conquered the present-day Baltic States, and he even won influence along the coasts of Tunisia. Abulafia is the first to place Frederick in the wider historical context his enormous empire demands. Frederick's reign, Abulafia clearly shows, marked the climax of the power struggle between the medieval popes and the Holy Roman Emperors, and the book stresses Frederick's steadfast dedication to the task of preserving both dynasty and empire. Through the course of this rich, groundbreaking narrative, Frederick emerges as less of the innovator than he is usually portrayed. Rather than instituting a centralized autocracy, he was content to guarantee the continued existence of the customary style of government in each area he ruled: in Sicily he appeared a mighty despot, but in Germany he placed his trust in regional princes, and never dreamed of usurping their power. Abulafia shows that this pragmatism helped bring about the eventual transformation of medieval Europe into modern nation-states. The book also sheds new light on the aims of Frederick in Italy and the Near East, and concentrates as well on the last fifteen years of the Emperor's life, a period until now little understood. In addition, Abulfia has mined the papal registers in the Secret Archive of the Vatican to provide a new interpretation of Frederick's relations with the papacy. And his attention to Frederick's register of documents from 1239-40--a collection hitherto neglected--has yielded new insights into the cultural life of the German court. In the end, a fresh and fascinating picture develops of the most enigmatic of German rulers, a man whose accomplishments have been grossly distorted over the centuries.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=sgufggLomo8C&dq=Frederick+II:+A+Medieval+Emperor+(Oxford+Paperbacks)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Management: Leading People and Organizations in the 21st Century (2nd Edition)","description":"A review of management concepts and techniques in a traditional management-process format.

She is fearful at first, but Maddie quickly finds exciting things to see, smell, and do in this unusual place. As soon as her paws hit the warm cement, her curly tail starts wagging, and she feels the breeze on her whiskers. No sooner than she begins to enjoy the palm trees and colorful bugs, dark clouds and thunder blanket the sky. Hurricane Charley is what Maddie hears, as she and her family spend the next day indoors. There's lightning and more water than most pugs ever see, and then the electricity goes out. Her Dad has to light candles, and Maddie tries barking at the noises outside. All she really wants to do is to go home to her favorite bed. When Maddie awakes the next morning, she is surprised at what she sees: a break in the clouds, birds chirping, and finally the sun!

Examining three hundred years of cultural traditions, Katherine L. Morrison, a former American, now a Canadian, takes the reader through the historical, political, and sociological milieu of Canada and the United States to dispel misconceptions that they share near-identical social attitudes and historical experiences.To most Americans and much of the rest of the world, America and Canada differ little except in terms of climate. It is true that they share a common British heritage and immigration patterns, but there are subtle cultural differences between the two countries. These may appear insignificant to Americans, but they are not insignificant to Canadians. Comparing mythologies each of the countries share about the other, the author examines national views of their histories, from the common origin of both nations in the American Revolution, through the two world wars. She also examines the role of nature and images of place and home in Canadian and American literary writing, noting the disparate historical development of the two national literatures. Using specific works by recognized authors of their time, Morrison considers the role of religion and the church, violence and the law, and humor and satire, in the literature of both countries. The book also explores the role of women, race, and class in the literature of both countries. It concludes with a discussion of the tenacity of national myths, and draws some tentative conclusions.Now published in paperback in the United States, Morrison's broad-based approach to a largely unexplored subject will invite future study as well as improve understanding between Canada and the United States. Canadians and Americans will be of interest to cultural historians, American studies specialists, political scientists, and sociologists.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=o_hADwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Return to Paris: A Memoir","description":"Paris, 1947: Colette Rossant returns to Paris after waiting out World War II in Cairo among her father's Egyptian-Jewish relatives.

For sufferers in the developed world, this marked a true watershed moment: the end of the death sentence. But for many in the developing world, including in Southeast Asia, these new treatments remained far out of reach. In his early thirties, following the loss of his partner to an AIDS-related illness, Chris Beyrer wrote the first edition of War in the Blood. Three decades later, having served as president of the International AIDS Society, he believes we have arrived at an extraordinary milestone. For the first time, a patient has been demonstrably cured of HIV, new vaccine trials in Thailand have shown great promise, and the PrEP programme genuinely works. So why are over half of the estimated 38.8 million people living with HIV still not on treatment? War in the Blood is a labour of love, both a celebratory account of Southeast Asia and the story of our failure to protect those most vulnerable the world over  gay men, adolescent girls, sex workers, drug users, and transgender women. Beyrer offers an impassioned plea for our communities and governments  and our own hearts and minds  to stop denying the realities of sex, sexuality, and gender, and to take affirmative action.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=zzlOEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"God's life in us","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=KkOGAAAACAAJ&dq=God%27s+life+in+us&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Marking Time (Cazalet Chronicle 2)","description":"As England braces for war, Clary Cazalet withdraws into her books and journals, sweet-tempered Polly Cazalet agonizes over a secret illness in the family, and Louise Cazalet returns to boarding school","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=MIlPt_cA4YsC&dq=Marking+Time+(Cazalet+Chronicle+2)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Summer With the Leprechauns: A True Story","description":"An astonishing true story about one woman's journey to Ireland where she lived in a cottage with leprechauns.

Is who I really am enough?\\" It's courageous work to learn to live from our essential identity--loved, worthy, whole. But what if God is calling us to shamelessly recover the woman he created us to be? What if God is urging us to be--for the first time in our lives--brazen? The word brazen means without shame. Leeana Tankersley wants women to be just that--to unapologetically move from shame- and fear-based living toward lives that are based on love and belonging. With moving personal stories and spot-on observations of the longings we all experience--to know we are loved, to feel comfortable in our own skin, to be heard--Tankersley calls women to honor that voice deep down inside of them rather than bowing to outside influences that push them to become someone they're not. Gritty and overflowing with grace, Brazen will set women free to be truly themselves in a world bent on molding them in its image.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Qwo_CgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Renaissance of the twelfth century","description":"Examines the historical background and major cultural developments of the Mediaeval Renaissance","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=XOeCYCqdf0EC&dq=The+Renaissance+of+the+twelfth+century&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Lord of the Dark Sun","description":"After her ship is attacked and her crew fatally wounded, Ariana awakens on a dark and distant planet where she is forced into slavery, and she soon finds herself powerfully drawn to a prince in a barbarian's body who is her only hope for survival.

Drives and Controls on the first edition: 'This book is very readable, up-to-date and should be extremely useful to both users and o.e.m. designers. I unhesitatingly recommend it to any busy engineer who needs to make informed judgements about selecting the right drive system.' New features of the second edition: * New section on the cycloconverter drive. * More on switched relectance motor drives. * More on vector-controlled induction motor drives. * More on power switching devices. * New 'question and answer' sections on common problems and misconceptions. * Updating throughout.

Brown's Biblical Heritage Archive Collection. William Tyndale (1492? - 1536) played a monumental role in the establishment of the Authorized Version of 1611 (i.e., King James Bible). He was the first to translate Erasmus's Greek New Testament (NT) into English and then provided the world with the first printed English NT. He stands as the greatest of all English biblical scholars. While his first edition NT was published in 1526, his second revised and corrected NT was published in 1534, two years before he was martyred. Tyndale also completed the Hebrew-to-English translation for 15 of 39 books in the Old Testament, including the Pentateuch. Tyndale published the first edition of his English New Testament in 1526. Only two full copies have survived, both pocket size. It is believed there were 3,000 printed in Worms by Peter Schoeffer. The British Library bought the copy owned by Bristol Baptist College for 1 million pounds, declaring Tyndale's New Testament as \\"the most important printed book in the English language.\\" The second complete copy of Tyndale's 1526 New Testament was discovered in November of 1996 at the Wurttembergische Landesbibliothek (a state library) in Stuttgart, Germany. This German copy has a title page, which is missing in the British library copy. Apparently, the German library's director, Eberhard Zwink, was overseeing the library data transfer from hand-written hard copy records to computerized records. During this transition process, Zwink realized that one of the library's holdings was actually a 1526 New Testament by Tyndale. Taken together, several research studies indicate that 83% - 90% of the King James Bible (1611, Authorized Version) can be traced to Tyndale's English translation work; specific findings suggest that 83% of the NT and 76% of the OT in the King James Bible is Tyndale's translation (The Bible in English by David Daniell, Yale University Press; The King James Version Defended by Edward Hills, Christian Research Press). Within his small New Testament are words and phrases which have gone on to influence the world, and continue to do so today. A surprising number of Tyndale's phrases are still in common use today, including: 'under the sun', 'eat, drink and be merry', 'signs of the times', 'the salt of the earth', 'let there be light', 'my brother's keeper', 'lick the dust', 'fall flat on his face', 'the land of the living', 'pour out one's heart', 'the apple of his eye', 'fleshpots', 'go the extra mile', 'the parting of the ways', broken-hearted', 'flowing with milk and honey'.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=pFyExgEACAAJ&dq=Biographical+Description+of+the+Editions+of+the+New+Testament:+Tyndale%27s+Version+in+English&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"These Old Stone Walls","description":"There once may have been 250,000 miles of stone walls in America's Northeast, stretching farther than the distance to the moon.

Stone walls layer time like Russian dolls, their smallest elements reflecting the longest spans, and Thorson urges us to study them, for each stone has its own story.

Set in a dangerous near future world, The Book of M tells the captivating story of a group of ordinary people caught in an extraordinary catastrophe who risk everything to save the ones they love. It is a sweeping debut that illuminates the power that memories have not only on the heart, but on the world itself. One afternoon at an outdoor market in India, a man s shadow disappears an occurrence science cannot explain. He is only the first. The phenomenon spreads like a plague, and while those afflicted gain a strange new power, it comes at a horrible price: the loss of all their memories. Ory and his wife Max have escaped the Forgetting so far by hiding in an abandoned hotel deep in the woods. Their new life feels almost normal, until one day Max s shadow disappears too. Knowing that the more she forgets, the more dangerous she will become to Ory, Max runs away. But Ory refuses to give up the time they have left together. Desperate to find Max before her memory disappears completely, he follows her trail across a perilous, unrecognizable world, braving the threat of roaming bandits, the call to a new war being waged on the ruins of the capital, and the rise of a sinister cult that worships the shadowless. As they journey, each searches for answers: for Ory, about love, about survival, about hope; and for Max, about a new force growing in the south that may hold the cure. Like The Passage and Station Eleven, this haunting, thought-provoking, and beautiful novel explores fundamental questions of memory, connection, and what it means to be human in a world turned upside down.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=EYEzDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The living novel","description":"An astonishing novel that seizes the heart, and sets age-old conflicts against modern life. All the Living has the timeless quality of a parable, evoking a time and place with such beauty and power that it is unforgettable. It s a hot, dry summer and a young woman travels to Kentucky with her lover, Orren, to the isolated tobacco farm he has inherited after his family dies in a terrible accident. As he works through the drought, Aloma struggles to find her way in a combative, erotically charged relationship with this taciturn man. Her growing friendship with a local charismatic preacher further complicates her sense of lonely dissatisfaction as she grapples with the eternal question of whether it is better to fight for freedom or submit to desire. Excerpt: At first she could see his figure only as a dark shape and the sun firing on the watch on his right arm as he turned the wheel. Then when he was finally before her, braking and leaning in slightly under the shade of the visor to pull the keys from the ignition, she found the broad contours of his face and the color of his skin, much browner than the last time she had seen him, the day after the funeral three weeks ago when he came down to the school and sat beside her and set a question to her. He said, You ll come up? And she said, Yes, yes. And it don t matter if it s all out of order like it is? And she shook her head and took his blanched face in her hands and kissed him, and that had struck her later as an odd reversal, he usually being the one to reach out and pull her to him.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=mUj0PUcU33sC&dq=The+living+novel&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Between Worlds: A Reader, Rhetoric, and Handbook (5th Edition)","description":"Developed to meet the demand for a low-cost, high-quality history book, CENGAGE ADVANTAGE BOOKS: THE EARTH AND ITS PEOPLES, Fifth Edition, offers readers the complete THE EARTH AND ITS PEOPLES, Fifth Edition, text in an affordable format.

But who knows which books people steal? Who, for that matter, knows that authors ruin the book market by writing too much? Or why book critics are not critical? Or why librarians need to throw out more books? Who, indeed, knows the answer to that all-important question in our democracy: should presidents and presidential candidates write books? (The answer is no.) In this irreverent analysis of the book industry, John Maxwell Hamilton -- a longtime journalist and public radio commentator -- answers these questions and many more, proving that the best way to study books is not to take them too seriously. He provides a rich history of the book -- from the days when monks laboriously hand-copied texts to the tidal wave of Titanic tie-ins -- and gives a succinct overview of the state of the industry today, including writing, marketing, promoting, reviewing, ghostwriting, and collecting. Throughout, Hamilton peppers his prose with spicy tidbits of information that will fascinate bibliophiles everywhere. For instance, did you know that Walt Whitman was fired from a government job because his boss found Leaves of Grass, and its author, immoral? Or that the most stolen book in the United States is the Bible, followed by The Joy of Sex? How about that Dan Quayle's 1989 Christmas card read, \\"May our nation continue to be a beakon of hope to the world\\"? Or that Casanova was an ardent lover of books as well as women? Hamilton offers an inside look at the history and business of book reviewing, explaining why, more often than not, reviewers resemble \\"counselors at a self-esteem camp\\" and examining the enormous impact of the \\"Oprah effect\\" on the market. As the self-appointed Emily Post of the book world, he advises publishers, authors, and readers on proper etiquette for everything from book parties (\\"Feel free to build a party around a theme in a book, no matter how tacky\\") and jacket photos (\\"You should not show off your new baby unless [your] book [is] about raising kids\\"), to book signings (\\"Just because an author has given you an autograph does not mean they want to become your pen pal\\") and promotion by friends and relatives (\\"They should carry the book at all times on public transportation with the cover showing\\"). Both edifying and enjoyable, Casanova Was a Book Lover fills a Grand Canyon--sized void in the literature on literature. It is indispensable for book enthusiasts who want to know the naked truth about reading, writing, and publishing.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=M79HuG-HhzMC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Only Golf Lesson You'll Ever Need: Easy Solutions to Problem Golf Swings","description":"The Only Golf Lesson You'll Ever Need, Hank Haney, one of the most respected and soughtafter golf instructors in the world, shares the secrets he's learned by observing hundreds of thousands of students--from top PGA Tour pros to high-handicappers. He explains how intelligent observation of your ball-flight tendencies--the way your shot behaves in the air--provides the answers to helping you develop a consistent repeating swing that will lower your scores. You'll also pick up valuable pointers on how to precisely match your equipment to your game. Hank Haney believes that a \\"flawed swing\\" that still produces a good shot is a good swing. By focusing on the outcome of your swing first, rather than on the swing itself, he believes you can often avoid making the awkward and unnatural changes to grip, stance, posture and alignment that many golf instructors ask of their students. The Only Golf Lesson You'll Ever Need will help you straighten your hook or slice, add distance to your drives, identify and fix the flaws in your swing, and become a wizard around the greens. \\"I'm proud of the way my swing holds up ion all kinds of conditions and under the severest pressure. Both are a tribute to Hank Haney and his teaching. Hank knows more about ballflight and what controls it than anyone in the game.

London, 1664. Twenty years after the English revolution, the monarchy has been restored and Charles II sits on the throne. The men who conspired to kill his father are either dead or disappeared. Baltasar  Balty  St. Michel is twenty-four and has no skills and no employment. He gets by on handouts from his brother-in-law Samuel Pepys, an officer in the king s navy. Fed up with his needy relative, Pepys offers Balty a job in the New World. He is to track down two missing judges who were responsible for the execution of the last king, Charles I. When Balty s ship arrives in Boston, he finds a strange country filled with fundamentalist Puritans, saintly Quakers, warring tribes of Indians, and rogues of every stripe. Helped by a man named Huncks, an agent of the Crown with a mysterious past, Balty travels colonial America in search of the missing judges. Meanwhile, on the other side of the Atlantic, Samuel Pepys prepares for a war with the Dutch that fears England has no chance of winning. Christopher Buckley s enchanting new novel spins adventure, comedy, political intrigue, and romance against a historical backdrop with real-life characters like Charles II, John Winthrop, and Peter Stuyvesant. Buckley s wit is as sharp as ever as he takes readers to seventeenth-century London and New England. We visit the bawdy court of Charles II, Boston under the strict Puritan rule, and New Amsterdam back when Manhattan was a half-wild outpost on the edge of an unmapped continent.

Surrounded by the later pyramids of Sekhem-khet, Userkaf, Unis, and Teti, Djoser's famous Step Pyramid is still the tallest construction at Sakkara.

Whether parents adopted traditionally, as stepparents, or through donor insemination, surrogacy, or in vitro fertilization, Making Sense of Adoption will open the door to a lifetime of growth and understanding for adoptive families.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=B5SGEFptxocC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"British history in the nineteenth century (1782-1901)","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=P_Q13RZ_NkMC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Re-Inventing Africa: Matriarchy, Religion and Culture","description":"Culture for 500 years","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=KeZUhtDhujsC&dq=Re-Inventing+Africa:+Matriarchy,+Religion+and+Culture&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Streetwise Project Management: How to Manage People, Processes, and Time to Achieve the Results You Need","description":"Filled with a vast array of methods, tips, and advice, a comprehensive guide covers every aspect of project management, including resource allocation, quality control, and risk management, and discusses such important topics as working with teams and conflict resolution.

The Psychoanalytic Model of the Mind represents an important breakthrough: in simple language, it presents complicated ideas and concepts in an accessible manner, demystifies psychoanalysis, debunks some of the myths that have plagued it, and defuses the controversies that have too long attended it. The author effectively demonstrates that the psychoanalytic model of the mind is consistent with a brain-based approach. Even in patients whose mental illness has a predominantly biological basis, psychological factors contribute to the onset, expression, and course of the illness. For this reason, treatments that focus exclusively on symptoms are not effective in sustaining change. The psychoanalytic model provides clinicians with the framework to understand each patient as a unique psychological being. The book is rich in descriptive detail yet pragmatic in its approach, offering many features and benefits: In addition to providing the theoretical scaffolding for psychodynamic psychotherapy, the book emphasizes the critical importance of forging a strong treatment alliance, which requires understanding the transference and countertransference reactions that either disrupt or strengthen the clinician-patient bond. The book is respectful of Freud without being reverential; it considers his contribution as founder of psychoanalysis in the context of the historical and conceptual evolution of the field. The final section is devoted to learning to use the psychoanalytic model and exploring how it can be integrated with existing models of the mind. In addition to being a valuable reference for mental health clinicians, the text can serve as a resource for undergraduate and graduate students of philosophy, neuroscience, psychology, literature, and all academic disciplines outside of the mental health professions who may want to learn more about what psychoanalysts have to say about the mind. Important features include an extensive glossary of terms, a series of illustrative tables, and appendixes addressing libido theory and defenses. Drawing upon a broad range of sources to make her case, the author persuasively argues that the basic tenets of the psychoanalytic model of the mind are supported by empirical evidence as well as clinical efficacy. The Psychoanalytic Model of the Mind is a fascinating exploration of this complex model of mental functioning, and both clinicians and students of the mind will find it comprehensive and riveting.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=hj62CAAAQBAJ&dq=Arthur+Schopenhauer:+Germany+(1788-1860)+(Giants+of+Philosophy)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Statistical Modeling and Analysis for Database Marketing: Effective Techniques for Mining Big Data","description":"Traditional statistical methods are limited in their ability to meet the modern challenge of mining large amounts of data.

With an unbroken string of bestsellers in almost every country in the world, Robert Ludlum's books have been enjoyed by hundreds of millions of readers, and are widely acknowledged as classics in the field. Now, after the bestselling Covert-One novels The Hades Factor and The Cassandra Compact comes the third thrilling novel in the series - The Paris Option. A fiery explosion in the dark of night shatters one of the laboratory buildings in Paris's esteemed Pasteur Institute. Among the dead is Emile Chambord, one of the leaders in the global race to create a molecular - or DNA - computer. Unfortunately, Professor Chambord kept the details of his work secret, and his notes were apparently destroyed in either the bomb blast or the raging fire that followed. The scientific community does not expect a workable DNA computer to be developed for years. But suddenly U.S. fighter jets disappear from radar screens for a full five minutes, and there's no explanation. Utilities across the Western states cease functioning, and all telecommunications abruptly stop, with devastating consequences. This is not the work of a clever hacker, although Washington, worried about a panic, assures the public it is. Only the enormous power and speed of a DNA computer could have caused such havoc. Under the cover of visiting his friend Marty Zellerbach, who was severely injured when the Pasteur lab was destroyed, Covert-One agent Jon Smith flies to Paris to search for the connection between the Pasteur explosion and the forces now wielding the computer. Following a trail that leads him across two continents, Smith uncovers a web of deception that threatens to wreck havoc and forever reshape the world.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Pl9fzBKTscsC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Slime","description":"Over 30 delightfully gloopy, gooey, colorful DIY recipes will mesmerize youngsters by showing them how to make slime.

Might Is Right, or The Survival of the Fittest, is a book by pseudonymous author Ragnar Redbeard. First published in 1890, it heavily advocates social Darwinism, amoralism, and psychological hedonism. In Might is Right, Redbeard rejects conventional ideas of human and natural rights and argues that only strength or physical might can establish moral right (la Callicles). Libertarian historian James J. Martin called it \\"surely one of the most incendiary works ever to be published anywhere.\\" Leo Tolstoy discussed the philosophy of Might Is Right in his 1897 essay What Is Art?: \\"The substance of this book, as it is expressed in the editor's preface, is that to measure \\"right\\" by the false philosophy of the Hebrew prophets and \\"weepful\\" Messiahs is madness. Right is not the offspring of doctrine, but of power. All laws, commandments, or doctrines as to not doing to another what you do not wish done to you, have no inherent authority whatever, but receive it only from the club, the gallows, and the sword. A man truly free is under no obligation to obey any injunction, human or divine. Obedience is the sign of the degenerate. Disobedience is the stamp of the hero. Men should not be bound by moral rules invented by their foes. The whole world is a slippery battlefield. Ideal justice demands that the vanquished should be exploited, emasculated, and scorned. The free and brave may seize the world. And, therefore, there should be eternal war for life, for land, for love, for women, for power, and for gold. The earth and its treasures is \\"booty for the bold.\\" The author has evidently by himself, independently of Nietzsche, come to the same conclusions which are professed by the new artists.\\"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=mp7bsgEACAAJ&dq=Might+is+right,+or,+The+survival+of+the+fittest&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Brown Harvest","description":"A sinister parody of boy detectives borrows from the Hardy Boys and Krazy Kat to follow one youthful sleuth into a dark, forbidding adulthood.

In this unnerving collection drawn from her personal crime files, \\"America's best true-crime writer\\" (Kirkus Reviews) Ann Rule brilliantly dissects the convoluted love affairs that all too often end in violence. Expertly analyzing a shocking, headline-making case, Rule unmasks the deadly motives inside a seemingly idyllic marriage: a beautiful young wife, a rising star in America's top-ranked computer corporation, and a prosperous husband, the scion of a family building business. With an adorable son and a gorgeous home, the couple seemed to have it all. But a furtive evil permeated their days and nights, dragging them into a murky world of drugs, sordid sex, and con operations. In this realm, one of them would prove to be a virtual innocent, the other a manipulator with no conscience. Sudden, violent death brought their charade of a fairy-tale romance to a tragic end -- with a brutal crime that might never have come to light were it not for the stubborn detectives and prosecutors whose fight for justice spanned an entire decade. Empty Promises recounts several other cases where the search for love brought only lies and betrayal -- a cautionary primer, perhaps, for those who trust too much too soon. Powerful because they strike so close to home, the cases in Empty Promises will leave readers shaken by the realities of love gone terribly -- and fatally -- wrong.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=zyz7TTif_4UC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Every Inch A Cowboy (Silhouette Romance)","description":"And all Dana Westlake wanted was to be left alone to mend her broken heart.

Along the way he canoed through Belgium and France, booked passage to and across America, and finally famously settled in Samoa in the South Seas. The walking trip that Stevenson describes in Travels with a Donkey in the Cevennes (1879) was taken when the nascent author was still in his twenties and pining for a lost love. Accompanied by Modestine, the eponymous donkey he hired to carry his camping gear, the journey proved both challenging and charming.

We accompany them on their harrowing voyage across the Atlantic, through the rigors of the first New England winter and the threat of Indian attack as they desperately search for the home they eventually find at Plymouth. Once there, they must continue the struggle against brutal weather and disease. With masterly skill, New York Times bestselling historian Thomas Fleming gives us life-size portraits of the Pilgrim leaders. The Pilgrims' unique achievements - the Mayflower Compact, their tolerance of other faiths, the strict separation of church and state - are discussed in the context of the first year's anxieties and crises. Fleming writes admiringly of the younger men who emerged in that year as the real leaders of the colony - William Bradford and Miles Standish. And he provides new insights into the humanity and tolerance of the Pilgrims' spiritual shepherd, Elder William Brewster. On the first Thanksgiving, the Pilgrims are already aware that they are the forerunners of a great nation.

He agrees to travel incognito to a Parisian slum to save a noble family from ruin.

But given that the dynasty that was overthrown?the Qing?was that of a minority ethnic group that had ruled China?s Han majority for nearly three centuries, and that the revolutionaries were overwhelmingly Han, to what extent was the revolution not only anti-monarchical, but also anti-Manchu? Edward Rhoads explores this provocative and complicated question in Manchus and Han, analyzing the evolution of the Manchus from a hereditary military caste (the ?banner people?) to a distinct ethnic group and then detailing the interplay and dialogue between the Manchu court and Han reformers that culminated in the dramatic changes of the early 20th century. Until now, many scholars have assumed that the Manchus had been assimilated into Han culture long before the 1911 Revolution and were no longer separate and distinguishable. But Rhoads demonstrates that in many ways Manchus remained an alien, privileged, and distinct group. Manchus and Han is a pathbreaking study that will forever change the way historians of China view the events leading to the fall of the Qing dynasty. Likewise, it will clarify for ethnologists the unique origin of the Manchus as an occupational caste and their shifting relationship with the Han, from border people to rulers to ruled.

But this match comes with challenges: She's forty, and at twenty-six, he's barely old enough to rent a car. Worse, they only have two weeks together before Tess returns to her assistant-principal life in Virginia.

At the conclusion of each tournament, it is likely that you will see Serena Williams atop the women s podium and a member of the Big Four Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal, Novak Djokovic, and Andy Murray hoisting the trophy for the men. And while there is not a lot of variety in the outcome of these matches, the game of tennis itself has changed drastically over the decades, as developments in technology and conditioning regimens, among other factors, have altered the style of play. Underpinning many of these developments is science, and this book explains the scientific wonders that take the ball from racket to racket and back again. Each chapter explores a different facet of the game learning, technique, game analysis, the mental edge, physical development, nutrition for performance and recovery, staying healthy, and equipment and is organized around a series of questions. How do we learn the ins and outs of hitting the ball in and not out? What are the main technological developments and software programs that can be used to assist in performance and notational analysis in tennis? What role does sports psychology play in developing a tennis player? What is the role of fluid replacement for the recreational, junior, and professional player? What rule changes have been made with respect to the racket, ball, and ball-court interaction to maintain the integrity of the game in the face of technological change? Each question is examined with the aid of explanatory diagrams and illustrations, and the book can be used to search for particular topics, or read straight through for a comprehensive overview of how player and equipment work together. Whether you prefer the grass courts of Wimbledon, the clay courts of the French Open, or the hard courts of the US and Australian Opens, Tennis Science is a must-have for anyone interested in the science behind a winning game.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=z_7bDwAAQBAJ&dq=TENNIS&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hudson River Bracketed","description":"This early work by Edith Wharton was originally published in 1929 and we are now republishing it with a brand new introductory biography.

Bireley devotes particular attention to new methods of evangelization in the Old World and the New, education at the elementary, secondary and university levels, the new active religious orders of women and men, and the effort to create a spirituality for the Christian living in the world. A final chapter looks at the issues raised by Machiavelli, Galileo and Pascal. Robert Bireley is a leading Jesuit historian and uniquely well placed to reassess this centrally important subject for understanding the dynamics of early modern Europe.

R. H. W. Dillard asserts that  time is precious,  not only because it is fleeting but because its particulars are precious in their holiness. Dillard s concern is with the presence of the universal in the particular, or as he puts it in  Loading a Shoebox,  with  this day, / Another day like every day / Like no other.  Just Here, Just Now is as varied in its approaches to the spirit as it is in its poetic forms and subjects (which include serial murderers and the fall of the Soviet empire as well as personal memories of family, the death of a mother, and long letters to close friends). The collection moves from dark visions of love and loss in the first pages to meditations inspired by artists ranging from Henri Rousseau, Edgar Allan Poe, and Alfred Hitchcock to Thelonius Monk and Ornette Coleman. Many poems in the book s later pages deal directly with issues of meaning and belief, resolving the problems of the earlier poems through discoveries of love s presence even in loss and the mutable moment. As  Winter Letter to Bluefield  concludes:  It is true we lose the things we hold dearest / But equally true that because we hold them dear / We find ourselves which we otherwise had lost, / Find ourselves whole just now, just here.

She emigrated to France in 1922 and graduated from the French lyc e. After spending some years on the stage, she came to the U.S. and had a long and rewarding business career. Widowed in 1980 and retired in 1982, Evreinov decided to study the history of Russia, something which had fascinated her late husband. Equally fluent in Russian, French, and English, she was able to immerse herself in the primary sources available in the main branch of the New York Public Library, and in particular its Slavic and Baltic Division. Hence her shock when she began to research the first Russian nineteenth-century sovereign, Alexander I (1801-25), and noticed the enormous amount of data glossed over or not even mentioned in existing works on the subject. She soon understood the reasons. Two or three generations must elapse before historians can obtain the necessary scholarly detachment. Russian pre-Communist historians were still too close to the developments, still arguing the crucial question Alexander had raised: autocracy or a constitutional regime; their colleagues of Soviet days were operating under strict orders to defame the tsarist past. Western scholars of the first half of the twentieth century relied on the data provided by these two groups; later ones trusted the judgment of their predecessors. The general direction of the resulting texts is remarkably similar, predictably; but is it correct? Evreinov chooses a different approach. While not discarding the works above, she bases her investigations on primary sources. In foreign affairs, she studies the official correspondence of the major protagonists: heads of state, ministers, generals, and other statesmen; their memoirs, if available; international conventions and treaties; and all with exact quotes for every point. No less important are her analyses of Alexander's legislation in every field: religion, the press, serfdom, social services (including medical care for the poor), criminal justice (including the deportations to Siberia), as well as the large-scale immigration from various European countries. Quoting from hundreds and hundreds of laws, Evreinov paints a comprehensive panorama of early nineteenth-century Russia, a subject virtually ignored by Western historians. Many of the subjects are of relevance today, including the status of the various peoples who comprised the Russian Empire: the Belarussians, the Ukrainians, the Jews, the Asian and other minorities in European Russia, and the people of the Caucasus and Siberia. Succinct historical background notes introduce her analysis of the legislation. In every case she presents all the available pertinent data, thus enabling readers to form their own opinions. While the book is most scholarly, with over 2,000 reference notes, it is written in an unpretentious style which makes for easy, engrossing reading.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=VpdgPQAACAAJ&dq=Alexander+the+First,+a+Reappraisal:+The+Reign,+Book+One&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Backward Glances, Vol. 1","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=lfYpAQAAMAAJ&dq=Backward+Glances,+Vol.+1&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Alexander: Invincible King of Macedonia (Military Profiles)","description":"Alexander the Great (356-323 B.C.E.), who reigned as king of Macedonia for only thirteen years, set a flame of conquest that introduced the dynamism of Hellenism to the Mediterranean, Middle Eastern, and South Asian worlds. Re-creating their ossified cultures, he established a standard of leadership and military conquest that the most successful of Roman emperors, medieval knights, and steppe barbarians would never truly match. Julius Caesar wept that he could not surpass Alexander, while Napoleon could only dream of such invincibility. Alexander had the great fortune to be born the able son of Philip II, one of the most talented men of war and politics produced by the Hellenic world, who created for Alexander the foundation of the Macedonian state and army that would be the tools of his future greatness. Alexander's invincibility was the product of his profound genius - the perfection of body, boundless energy, imagination, daring, intellect, and vision in one man. He was a master tactician, strategist, logistician, diplomat, and statesman, with an ability to win the affection and quick obedience of others. Even his enemies fell victim to his valor and charm. His personal attributes and accomplishments were so far removed from those of ordinary men that he achieved almost superhuman status within his lifetime. Above all, he was the preeminent man of war.

Using a lucid style, Carroll first covers the foundations of the theory and mathematical formalism, providing an approachable introduction to what can often be an intimidating subject. Three major applications of general relativity are then discussed: black holes, perturbation theory and gravitational waves, and cosmology. Students will learn the origin of how spacetime curves (the Einstein equation) and how matter moves through it (the geodesic equation). They will learn what black holes really are, how gravitational waves are generated and detected, and the modern view of the expansion of the universe. A brief introduction to quantum field theory in curved spacetime is also included. A student familiar with this book will be ready to tackle research-level problems in gravitational physics.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=PTGdDwAAQBAJ&dq=Spacetime+and+Geometry:+An+Introduction+to+General+Relativity&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Marines of Autumn: A Novel of the Korean War","description":"War has been the inspiration of such great novels as The Red Badge of Courage and A Farewell to Arms, and daring feats of courage and tragic mistakes have been the foundation for such classic works. Now, for the first time ever, the Korean War has a novel that captures that courage and sacrifice. When Captain Thomas Verity, USMC, is called back to action, he must leave his Georgetown home, career, and young daughter and rush to Korea to monitor Chinese radio transmissions. At first acting in an advisory role, he is abruptly thrust into MacArthur's last daring and disastrous foray-the Chosin Reservoir campaign-and then its desperate retreat. Time magazine at the time recounted the retreat this way: \\"The running fight of the Marines...was a battle unparalleled in U.S. military history. It had some aspects of Bataan, some of Anzio, some of Dunkirk, some of Valley Forge, and some of 'the retreat of the 10,000' as described in Xenophon's Anabasis.\\" The Marines of Autumn is a stunning, shattering novel of war illuminated only by courage, determination, and Marine Corps discipline. And by love: of soldier for soldier, of men and their women, and of a small girl in Georgetown, whose father promised she would dance with him on the bridges of Paris. A child Captain Tom Verity fears he may never see again. In The Marines of Autumn, James Brady captures our imagination and shocks us into a new understanding of war.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=x7nsvKqGpQQC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Chemical Principles: The Quest for Insight","description":"Written for calculus-inclusive general chemistry courses, Chemical Principles helps students develop chemical insight by showing the connections between fundamental chemical ideas and their applications.

Reda Bhacker looks at the role of Oman in the Indian Ocean prior to British domination of the region. Omani merchant communities played a crucial part in the development of commercial activity throughout the territories they held in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, especially between Muscat and Zanzibar, using long established trade networks. They were also largely responsible for the integration of the commerce of the Indian Ocean into the nascent global capitalist system. The author, himself a member of an important Omani merchant family, looks in detail at the complex relationship between the merchant community and Oman's rulers, first the Ya'ariba and then the Albusaidis. He analyses the tribal and religious dynamics of Omani politics both in Arabia, where he looks especially at the Wahhabi/Saudi threat, and in Oman's sprawling \`empire', with particular reference to Zanzibar where the Omani ruler Sa'id b Sultan had his court from 1840. His aim is to consider all Oman's overseas territories as a single entity, without the usual misleading compartmentalisation of African and Arab history. Dr Bhacker finds that despite their prestige and influence in the region neither the merchant communities nor the government were able to respond to Britain's determined onslaught. Bhacker traces the local and regional factors that allowed Britain to destroy Oman's largely commercial challenge and to emerge by the end of the nineteenth century as the commercially and politically dominant power in the region.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=kmOKAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Theory of Eternal Life","description":"\\"Rodney Collins, in this inspired work of intellectual daring, explores varied texts ranging form the ancient to the modern.

But what does it mean? Matt Ridley s Genome is the book that explains it all: what it is, how it works, and what it portends for the future Arguably the most significant scientific discovery of the new century, the mapping of the twenty-three pairs of chromosomes that make up the human genome raises almost as many questions as it answers. Questions that will profoundly impact the way we think about disease, about longevity, and about free will. Questions that will affect the rest of your life. Genome offers extraordinary insight into the ramifications of this incredible breakthrough. By picking one newly discovered gene from each pair of chromosomes and telling its story, Matt Ridley recounts the history of our species and its ancestors from the dawn of life to the brink of future medicine. From Huntington's disease to cancer, from the applications of gene therapy to the horrors of eugenics, Ridley probes the scientific, philosophical, and moral issues arising as a result of the mapping of the genome.

We conduct a fifty-year followup of an episode in which such constraints would have been plausibly relaxed by a random allocation of wealth to families. We track descendants of those eligible to win in Georgia's Cherokee Land Lottery of 1832, which had nearly universal participation among adult white males. Winners received close to the median level of wealth - a large financial windfall orthogonal to parents' underlying characteristics that might have also affected their children's human capital. Although winners had slightly more children than non-winners, they did not send them to school more. Sons of winners have no better adult outcomes (wealth, income, literacy) than the sons of non-winners, and winners' grandchildren do not have higher literacy or school attendance than non-winners' grandchildren. This suggests only a limited role for family financial resources in the transmission of human capital across generations and a potentially more important role for other factors that persist through family lines.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=dO1NngEACAAJ&dq=Shocking+Behavior&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"To Gillian on Her 37th Birthday","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=usO5lAEACAAJ&dq=To+Gillian+on+Her+37th+Birthday&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"All Powers Necessary and Convenient","description":"A play first performed to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the hearings of the Canwell Committee in 1948 that purged the University of Washington of communists and any other unsanctioned political thought and activism.

Born in 1870 in Chiaravalle, Italy, Maria Montessori would grow up to embody almost every trait men of her era detested in the fairer sex. She was self-confident, strong-willed, and had a fiery temper at a time when women were supposed to be soft and pliable. She studied until she became a doctor at a time when female graduates in Italy provoked outright scandal. She never wanted to marry or have children the accepted destiny for all women of her milieu in late nineteenth-century bourgeois Rome and when she became pregnant by a colleague of hers, she gave up her son to continue pursuing her career. At around age thirty, Montessori was struck by the condition of children in the slums of Rome s San Lorenzo neighborhood, and realized what she wanted to do with her life: change the school, and therefore the world, through a new approach to the child s mind. In spite of the resistance she faced from all sides scientists accused her of being too mystical, and the clergy of being too scientific, traditionalists of giving children too much freedom, and anarchists of giving them too much structure she would garner acclaim and establish the influential Montessori method, which is now practiced throughout the world. A thorough, nuanced portrait of this often controversial woman, The Child Is the Teacher offers an unbiased perspective from an author who is not a member of the Montessori movement, but who has been granted access to original letters, diaries, notes, and texts written by Montessori herself, including an array of previously unpublished material.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=8xROEAAAQBAJ&dq=Teacher+and+Child&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Streets of Gold","description":"The facts, not the fiction, of America s immigration experience Immigration is one of the most fraught, and possibly most misunderstood, topics in American social discourse yet, in most cases, the things we believe about immigration are based largely on myth, not facts. Using the tools of modern data analysis and ten years of pioneering research, new evidence is provided about the past and present of the American Dream, debunking myths fostered by political opportunism and sentimentalized in family histories, and draw counterintuitive conclusions, including: Upward Mobility: Children of immigrants from nearly every country, especially those of poor immigrants, do better economically than children of U.S.-born residents  a pattern that has held for more than a century. Rapid Assimilation: Immigrants accused of lack of assimilation (such as Mexicans today and the Irish in the past) actually assimilate fastest. Improved Economy: Immigration changes the economy in unexpected positive ways and staves off the economic decline that is the consequence of an aging population. Helps U.S. Born: Closing the door to immigrants harms the economic prospects of the U.S.-born the people politicians are trying to protect. Using powerful story-telling and unprecedented research employing big data and algorithms, Abramitzky and Boustan are like dedicated family genealogists but millions of times over. They provide a new take on American history with surprising results, especially how comparable the  golden era  of immigration is to today, and why many current policy proposals are so misguided.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=r79BEAAAQBAJ&dq=Streets+of+Gold&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cosmic Adventure: A Renegade Astronomer's Guide To Our World And Beyond","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=kK-EtQEACAAJ&dq=Cosmic+Adventure:+A+Renegade+Astronomer%27s+Guide+To+Our+World+And+Beyond&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Roar and more","description":"Rhyming text presents the behavior and noises of animals such as the lion, snake, and kangaroo, in the author's first book originally published in 1956.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=BkRpBUOh_eMC&dq=Roar+and+more&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Star Trek Chronology: The History of the Future","description":"A revised edition of the official illustrated timeline of the Star Trek universe is presented in full color and follows the founding of the Federation through the most recent Voyager adventures.

Setting the creation of specific dances in socio-political and cultural contexts, Sally Banes shows that choreographers have created representations of women that are shaped by - and that in part shape - society's continuing debates about sexuality and female identity. Broad in its scope and compelling in its argument Dancing Women: * provides a series of re-readings of the canon, from Romantic and Russian Imperial ballet to contemporary ballet and modern dance * investigates the gaps between plot and performance that create sexual and gendered meanings * examines how women's agency is created in dance through aspects of choreographic structure and style * analyzes a range of women's images - including brides, mistresses, mothers, sisters, witches, wraiths, enchanted princesses, peasants, revolutionaries, cowgirls, scientists, and athletes - as well as the creation of various women's communities on the dance stage * suggests approaches to issues of gender in postmodern dance Using an interpretive strategy different from that of other feminist dance historians, who have stressed either victimization or celebration of women, Banes finds a much more complex range of cultural representations of gender identities.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=QYv7AQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Copperhead: A Novel of the Civil War (Nathaniel Starbuck Chronicles)","description":"The beloved Confederate Captain Nate Starbuck returns to the front lines of the Civil War in this second installment of Bernard Cornwell's acclaimed Nathaniel Starbuck Chronicles.

The internationally acclaimed book examines this issue at a crucial time in its theorisation, questioning the very cornerstone of sporting and medical ethics, asking whether sporting authorities can, or even should, protect sport from genetic modification. This book brings together sport studies and bioethics to challenge our understanding of the values that define sport. We already allow that athletes can optimise their performance by the use of technologies; without wishing to assert that 'anything goes' in sports performance enhancement, Andy Miah argues that simply being human matters in sport and that genetic modification does not have to challenge this capacity. Genetically Modifies Athletes includes examination of: * the concept of 'good sport' and the definition of cheating * the doped athlete - should we be more sympathetic? * the role of the medical industry * the usefulness (or not) of the terms 'doping' and 'anti-doping'. An important and growing field of interest, this book should be read by students, academics and practitioners.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=RnPaLFb11pMC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Great Western Train Robberies","description":"During the 1800s trains carried the nation's wealth throughout the east, but no one thought to rob a speeding train until 1866. In 1870 the first western train was robbed in Nevada and within hours a second train was robbed. Railroads made every alteration to their cars and changed every procedure they could imagine to thwart the robbers, but to no avail. Robbing trains became epidemic over the next five decades, even when the legislatures made train robbery a capital crime. A few of the hundreds of train robberies stand out as thrilling and dangerous affairs, and the greatest of these (15-20) are included in this book.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=b9vVCwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Myths and Tales of the Southeastern Indians","description":"Myths and stories of the Creek, Hitchiti, Alabama, Koasati, and Natchez Indians.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=mSBEsGu-SRUC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"7b","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=8Nw0AQAAMAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dora: An analysis of a case of hysteria (The collected papers of Sigmund Freud ; Collier Books Edition)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=x5yNtAEACAAJ&dq=Dora:+An+analysis+of+a+case+of+hysteria+(The+collected+papers+of+Sigmund+Freud+%3B+Collier+Books+Edition)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The dark frigate (Classics illustrated)","description":"Retelling of The dark frigate in comic book format.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=tm-knQEACAAJ&dq=The+dark+frigate+(Classics+illustrated)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Streetwise Complete Publicity Plans: How to Create Publicity That Will Spark Media Exposure and Excitement","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=gbdE3mbw8s4C&dq=Streetwise+Complete+Publicity+Plans:+How+to+Create+Publicity+That+Will+Spark+Media+Exposure+and+Excitement&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Neo-Tech Discovery","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=FLcEngEACAAJ&dq=Neo-Tech+Discovery&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The fatal decisions: [Six decisive battles of the Second world war from the viewpoint of the vanquished]","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=zulVnQEACAAJ&dq=The+fatal+decisions:+%5BSix+decisive+battles+of+the+Second+world+war+from+the+viewpoint+of+the+vanquished%5D&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Sky Is Full of Stars (Let's-Read-and-Find-Out Science 2)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Principia Discordia: How I Found Goddess and What I Did to Her When I Found Her","description":"One of the great books of our time, Principia Discordia is the official bible of the most relevant religion ever conceived, Discordianism.

Challenging the religious, philosophical and political constraints on personal freedom, Stirner criticizes all doctrines and beliefs that place the interests of God, the state, humanity or society over those of the individual. Anticipating the later work of nihilists, existentialists, and anarchists, The Ego and His Own upholds personal autonomy against all that might oppose it.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=5blvDwAAQBAJ&dq=The+ego+and+his+own:+The+case+of+the+individual+against+authority&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Treasury of Great Mysteries (2 Volumes)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=4A4HzQEACAAJ&dq=A+Treasury+of+Great+Mysteries+(2+Volumes)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Simple Treats: A Wheat-Free, Dairy-Free Guide to Scrumptious Baked Goods","description":"Professional pastry chef Fran Costigan shares her secrets on how to give dessers that special flair with this collection of dairy- and egg-free recipes.

Hardly a day goes by without the media focusing an often sympathetic beam on gay life--and, with AIDS, on gay death. Gay plays on Broadway, big book awards to authors writing on gay subjects, Hollywood movies with gay themes, gay and lesbian studies at dozens of universities, openly gay columnists and even editors at national mainstream publications, political leaders speaking in favor of gay rights: it seems that straight America has finally begun to listen to homosexual America. Still, Bersani notes, not only has homophobia grown more virulent, but many gay men and lesbians themselves are reluctant to be identified as homosexuals. In Homos, he studies the historical, political, and philosophical grounds for the current distrust, within the gay community, of self-identifying moves, for the paradoxical desire to be invisibly visible. While acknowledging the dangers of any kind of group identification (if you can be singled out, you can be disciplined), Bersani argues for a bolder presentation of what it means to be gay. In their justifiable suspicion of labels, gay men and lesbians have nearly disappeared into their own sophisticated awareness of how they have been socially constructed. By downplaying their sexuality, gays risk self-immolation--they will melt into the stifling culture they had wanted to contest. In his chapters on contemporary queer theory, on Foucault and psychoanalysis, on the politics of sadomasochism, and on the image of \\"the gay outlaw\\" in works by Gide, Proust, and Genet, Bersani raises the exciting possibility that same-sex desire by its very nature can disrupt oppressive social orders. His spectacular theory of \\"homo-ness\\" will be of interest to straights as well as gays, for it designates a mode of connecting to the world embodied in, but not reducible to, a sexual preference. The gay identity Bersani advocates is more of a force--as such, rather cool to the modest goal of social tolerance for diverse lifestyles--which can lead to a massive redefining of sociality itself, and of what we might expect from human communities. Reviews of this book: \\"Perhaps no one since Leo Bersani in 'Is the Rectum a Grave?' has written so convincingly against the danger of homosexual assimilation as Leo Bersani in Homos...One of the strongest elements of [this book] is Bersani's attack on things which promote a \`denial of sex,' whether it be sex acts themselves or, more importantly, the context in which those sex acts are made possible...Homos is a profound piece of imaginative literature.\\" DD--Dale Peck, Voice Literary Supplement \\"In Homos, Leo Bersani effectively attacks some sacred cows of gay cultural theory. Most obviously, he argues against the tenet that gay and lesbian identities are socially constructed and so ultimately (indeed, preferably) dissolvable...Refreshingly, [Bersani] also does not skate round sensitive questions such as the status of sadomasochism within gay sexual practice, and the tortuousness of the political liaison between gays and lesbians...Bersani emerges as our most persuasive advocate of homosexual identities that offer and require social resistance--he terms this 'anticommunitarianism'--but also as perhaps the only writer in the field who convincingly brings together psychological and sociological accounts of sexuality.\\" DD--Richard Canning, New Statesman & Society \\"Bersani engages with questions which the gay movement cannot ignore.\\" DD--Times Literary Supplement \\"In his provocative and sure-to-be-controversial book, Homos, Bersani argues for the need to preserve the 'otherness' that he maintains is the essential core of homosexual identity.\\" DD--David Wiegand, San Francisco Chronicle \\"Homos is one of the most interesting books to appear in lesbian and gay literature--in fact its vision is so broad that it places lesbian and gay readers centre stage in what could be a revolution.\\" DD--Our Times \\"Leo Bersani, one of the most interesting, original and sophisticated of...literary historians, has written primarily on Modernism, from Baudelaire to Beckett and Genet, using Freud's metapsychology as a way of penetrating into the radical implications of their thought...[His] work...[is] a surprise and a revelation, both careful and highly original...It is deeply exciting to engage with Bersani's ideas. They allow us to open up traditional psychoanalytic theory, so that it is no longer a mere therapeutic strategy, and consequently a device for social control and homogeneity, but instead a larger perspective for understanding and valuing those possibilities and differences that can constitute human experience.\\" DD--Kenneth Lewes, Psychoanalytic Books \\"Homos is an extremely persuasive analysis of the \`anticommunal' freedom made possible by \`perverse' sexuality...Bersani's argument is at once subtle, even brilliant.\\" DD--Peggy Phelan, Contemporary Sociology","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=iTBh_6QC_kkC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Best Easy Day Hikes Redwood National and State Parks (Best Easy Day Hikes Series)","description":"Redwood National and State Parks are home to some of the world's tallest trees: old-growth coast redwoods, living to be 2000 years old and growing to over 300 feet tall.

The fifteen stories begin with characters in childhood, and progress into adolescence, and finally into maturity. The final story,  The Dead  is considered one of the most extraordinary stories ever written in the English language. Many of the characters within this collection reappear in Joyce s later work. Dubliners is a remarkably modern work, yet the most accessible of all of Joyce s writing. Authored in his early twenties, the short stories were completed in 1907, but were not published until 1914 due to many passages in the narratives that were considered too provocative to print. The stories in Dubliners were initially commissioned by an Irish farming magazine to depict quaint and brief tales of Irish life. Three stories were published before the magazine editor deemed the material unsuitable for the readership. Those appear among this extraordinary collection of 15 stories, which include: The Sisters, An Encounter, Araby, Eveline, After the Race, Two Gallants, The Boarding House, A Little Cloud, Counterparts, Clay, A Painful Case, Ivy Day in the Committee Room, A Mother, Grace, The Dead. With an eye-catching new cover, and professionally typeset manuscript, this edition of Dubliners is both modern and readable.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=itL9DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Mercenary and the New Mom (Follow that Baby) (Silhouette Intimate Moments #908)","description":"Follow That Baby DADDY'S HOME  A grizzled stranger was standing at her newborn's crib, and Sabrina Jensen was prepared to do anything to protect her precious child.

The advocates of the 'knowledge economy' have to date focused almost exclusively on how managers can increase the internal productivity of their knowledge assets and intellectual capital. The important next step is understanding that a large and rapidly increasing proportion of the value of business transactions is in knowledge itself. Once this is recognized, managers must devote their attention to how to maximize the value of that knowledge to customers, and tie that directly to developing enduring and profitable relationships. Developing Knowledge-Based Client Relationships guides the reader to understanding the increasing importance of information and knowledge in business transactions and client relationships. It then goes on to present in an extremely practical fashion what knowledge organizations can do to enhance the value of the knowledge they deliver to clients and use that to develop profitable relationships. This is done by presenting underlying theoretical framework, a variety of tools for structuring relationships and presenting knowledge to clients, and numerous case studies and examples of firms which have implemented these concepts successfully.

While recognising and at times reinforcing this stance, the essays in this collection show that there is still much to be learned about the cultural context of early Judaism and Christianity by analysing ancient texts which either use 'magic' as a category for purposes of deviance labelling or promote behaviour of a broadly magico-religious variety. Through sustained engagement with texts ranging from Exod. 7-9 and Acts 8 to the Testament of Solomon and the Late Antique alchemical treatise known as the Cyranides, this volume focuses chiefly on materials that challenge the familiar boundaries between miracle and magic and medicine; yet it also heightens awareness of the way unsuspecting use of a sick sign (e.g. 'magic') can impede critical understanding of texts and their respective contexts of production and reception.

Yet by century's end, it had become the marvel of modern Europe, home to the finest minds of the day and their breathtaking innovations in architecture, politics, science, the arts, and economics all of which continue to echo loudly today. Adam Smith penned The Wealth of Nations. James Boswell produced The Life of Samuel Johnson. Alongside them, pioneers such as David Hume, Robert Burns, James Hutton, and Sir Walter Scott transformed the way we understand our perceptions and feelings, sickness and health, relations between the sexes, the natural world, and the purpose of existence. In Crowded with Genius, James Buchan beautifully reconstructs the intimate geographic scale and boundless intellectual milieu of Enlightenment Edinburgh. With the scholarship of a historian and the elegance of a novelist, he tells the story of the triumph of this unlikely town and the men whose vision brought it into being.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=s-1la7xunmkC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"300 Years of Kitchen Collectibles","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=CRMpPwAACAAJ&dq=300+Years+of+Kitchen+Collectibles&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Latigo","description":"This is a personal story about my brother Latigo Jim, The Cowboy, who loved Rusty the wonder horse and lived in Libby Montana.

Childs offers a sophisticated and insightful analysis of the social and ideological context of black-white interracial relationships.\\" Heather Dalmage, author Tripping on the Color Line \\"A pioneering project that thoroughly analyzes interracial marriage in contemporary America.\\" Eduardo Bonilla-Silva, author of Racism without Racists: Color-Blind Racism and the Persistence of Racial Inequality in the United States Is love color-blind, or at least becoming increasingly so? Today s popular rhetoric and evidence of more interracial couples than ever might suggest that it is. But is it the idea of racially mixed relationships that we are growing to accept or is it the reality? What is the actual experience of individuals in these partnerships as they navigate their way through public spheres and intermingle in small, close-knit communities? In Navigating Interracial Borders, Erica Chito Childs explores the social worlds of black-white interracial couples and examines the ways that collective attitudes shape private relationships. Drawing on personal accounts, in-depth interviews, focus group responses, and cultural analysis of media sources, she provides compelling evidence that sizable opposition still exists toward black-white unions. Disapproval is merely being expressed in more subtle, color-blind terms. Childs reveals that frequently the same individuals who attest in surveys that they approve of interracial dating will also list various reasons why they and their families wouldn t, shouldn t, and couldn t marry someone of another race. Even college students, who are heralded as racially tolerant and open-minded, do not view interracial couples as acceptable when those partnerships move beyond the point of casual dating. Popular films, Internet images, and pornography also continue to reinforce the idea that sexual relations between blacks and whites are deviant. Well-researched, candidly written, and enriched with personal narratives, Navigating Interracial Borders offers important new insights into the still fraught racial hierarchies of contemporary society in the United States.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=qneQV-XhInIC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"More Great Southern Mysteries: Florida's Fountain of Youth, Ghosts of the Alamo, Lost Maidens of the Okefenokee, Terror on the Natchez Trace and Oth","description":"Presents bizarre and unexplained happenings from the Southern United States, including ghosts, sea monsters, lost planes and empty ships, and a mystical circle of stones","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=w8DWAAAAMAAJ&dq=More+Great+Southern+Mysteries:+Florida%27s+Fountain+of+Youth,+Ghosts+of+the+Alamo,+Lost+Maidens+of+the+Okefenokee,+Terror+on+the+Natchez+Trace+and+Oth&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Lady of the Lake","description":"One is his first love.

(AM-131)","description":"Toric varieties are algebraic varieties arising from elementary geometric and combinatorial objects such as convex polytopes in Euclidean space with vertices on lattice points. Since many algebraic geometry notions such as singularities, birational maps, cycles, homology, intersection theory, and Riemann-Roch translate into simple facts about polytopes, toric varieties provide a marvelous source of examples in algebraic geometry. In the other direction, general facts from algebraic geometry have implications for such polytopes, such as to the problem of the number of lattice points they contain. In spite of the fact that toric varieties are very special in the spectrum of all algebraic varieties, they provide a remarkably useful testing ground for general theories. The aim of this mini-course is to develop the foundations of the study of toric varieties, with examples, and describe some of these relations and applications. The text concludes with Stanley's theorem characterizing the numbers of simplicies in each dimension in a convex simplicial polytope. Although some general theorems are quoted without proof, the concrete interpretations via simplicial geometry should make the text accessible to beginners in algebraic geometry.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=9FjQCwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Warrior in bronze","description":"International bestseller Michelle Paver sets the stage for an epic final battle in this riveting conclusion to Gods and Warriors, the Bronze Age adventure series Hylas has returned to his homeland, and the fate of the world rests on his shoulders: He must find the prophesized dagger of Koronos and keep the Crows from wielding it in battle, or they will rule the land forever.

So said Winston Churchill after reading T.E. Lawrence's 'Seven Pillars of Wisdom'. The book, a mixture of autobiography and military history, tells the story of the almost 'Boy's Own Adventures' of Lawrence as he helped the Arab leaders in their revolt against the Ottoman Empire from 1916. The escapades were given global attention in 1962, when the movie 'Lawrence of Arabia' was released. Very little Hollywood spin was needed. For the truth was extraordinary enough. Find out about sun-baked negotiations in the desert, near misses, friendship, tragedy and fierce desert battles. It is an autobiography that reads like fast-moving military fiction. Thomas Edward (T.E.) Lawrence (1888-1935) was a British archaeologist, writer, diplomat and army officer who became known as 'Lawrence of Arabia' through his role in the Arab Revolt (1916-1918). He was working in the British Army's intelligence unit in Egypt and - during missions in Mesopotamia and Arabia - liaised with the Arab forces that were fighting the Ottoman Empire. Lawrence worked closely with Emir Faisal, leader of the revolt, even taking charge of some military actions. Back in Britain after 1918, Lawrence joined the Foreign Office, then the Royal Air Force. In 1926 he wrote the autobiographical 'Seven Pillars of Wisdom', about his participation in the Arab Revolt. He also wrote 'The Mint', about his time in the RAF. Lawrence died in a motorcycle accident in Dorset in 1935. His public image was later to receive a huge boost when David Lean directed the 1962 movie 'Lawrence of Arabia', starring Peter O'Toole and Alec Guinness.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=aKZwEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The master of Ballantrae: A winter's tale (The novels and tales of Robert Louis Stevenson)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=XXU6nQEACAAJ&dq=The+master+of+Ballantrae:+A+winter%27s+tale+(The+novels+and+tales+of+Robert+Louis+Stevenson)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Electricity and electronics basic","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=plvYPAAACAAJ&dq=Electricity+and+electronics+basic&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sons of God: Daughters of Men","description":"\\"Everything recorded in the pages of Genesis did happen, but it is not what we have been led to believe.

Both tragic and absurd by turns, Brothers is a fascinating vision of an extraordinary place and time.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=vayN7p_10qgC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Trees to know in Oregon (Extension circular)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=r5H-RQAACAAJ&dq=Trees+to+know+in+Oregon+(Extension+circular)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"History of Ideas on Woman","description":"Thirty discourses and treatises on the subject of women, by influential thinkers ranging from Plato, Aristotle, and Augustine to Freud, Beauvoir, and Friedan, are accompanied by critical analyses","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=85GrQwAACAAJ&dq=History+of+Ideas+on+Woman&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"More Dematiaceous Hyphomycetes","description":"Key to genera; The genera; Substratum index; Plants, including fungi; Other substrata.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=faRiQgAACAAJ&dq=More+Dematiaceous+Hyphomycetes&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Second to None: A Documentary History of American Women. Volume 2, From 1865 to the Present","description":"At the beginning of the twentieth century it was still necessary for women to ask lawmakers, \\"Are women persons?\\" The rights and treatment of women in their homes, workplaces, and government were issues that men in power often preferred to ignore. But women refused to remain silent. This volume of Second to None, like volume 1, presents a multiplicity of voices, demonstrating that there is not a representative American woman, but many women worth remembering. Here are women who are shapers of history, as well as its victims. In diaries, letters, speeches, songs, petitions, essays, photographs, and cartoons they describe, rejoice, exhort, complain, advertise, and joke, revealing women's role as community builders in every time and locale and registering their emergence into the public spheres of political, social, and economic life. The documents also demonstrate the value of gender analysis, for women's differences in age, race, sexual orientation, class, geographical or ethnic origin, abilities or disabilities, and values are shown to be as important as their commonalities. Volume 2 contains 122 selections, ranging from a tract by Elizabeth Cady Stanton to the testimony of Anita Hill. Both volumes include section introductions that set the historical stage and comment on the significance of the selections.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=sq5oAAAAIAAJ&dq=Second+to+None:+A+Documentary+History+of+American+Women.+Volume+2,+From+1865+to+the+Present&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Embedded Microprocessor Systems: Real World Design, Third Edition","description":"The less-experienced engineer will be able to apply Ball's advice to everyday projects and challenges immediately with amazing results.

The trip was an exploration of a continent which was already showing signs of the holocaust which was to come.

Bringing together his work as a fine artist with the instincts and references that color his passions of tattoo and graffiti art, JK5 has an expansive, textured, and highly individual visual vernacular. Whether as a painter, illustrator, calligrapher, or designer, JK5 is preoccupied with the collision of personal and revelatory themes with profound pop-cultural iconography, resulting in a powerful and readily identifiable style. This creatively designed monograph features work that extends from paintings on canvas to plastic vinyl toys, from storyboards for animation films to collages and scratch cards, and from outlines for tattoo work to a vast collection of sketchbooks-each completed with such regularity that they serve as a kind of artist diary, recording his changing preoccupations and varying visual interests. Edited by the artist-with contributions from fellow artists Mike Giant and Kenzo Minami-and designed to reflect the varying and tactile nature of the work, this is an artist's book that will exist as a unique and collectible object in its own right as much as a record of the remarkable output of one of the most prolific voices in contemporary art.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=cQpwDwAAQBAJ&dq=Subconsciothesaurusnex&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Halloween Night","description":"Trick or treat!

In addition to this combined theory and application approach, the author discusses the critical importance of differing fabrication materials on the performance of ICs at different frequencies.

One of the last acts of her life was to approve the 'specimen page' from the printer. She did not live to correct her proofs and what, if any, changes she might have made is a matter for conjecture. The book, as she wrote it, must now stand as the last prose work to come from a great writer of the last century and a wise, witty and compassionate woman. 'I trust', she wrote, 'that I have hurt nobody.' Dame Edith was much more than one of the leading English poets of her lifetime. Long, long before the age of television introduced the synthetic, professional 'personality', she was a personality without the inverted commas, and thus became a familiar figure to a public far wider than the readership of her poetry, criticism and essays. With her remarkable brothers, she stood for certain important and lasting I qualities in the artistic life of the nation-for the war against philistinism, for a progressive outlook that in its day seemed, and was, rebellious, and yet for a spirit of continuity and tradition in art that has become apparent to the layman only in the perspective of time. This sense of tradition and respect for the past was by no means incompatible with a degree of eccentricity-which gives Taken Care Of its remarkable and unique flavour.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=j3EDGa6THCIC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Legacy of Soviet Dissent (BASEES/Routledge Series on Russian and East European Studies)","description":"During the 1970s, dissidents like Sakharov and Solzhenitsyn dominated Western perceptions of the USSR, but were then quickly forgotten, as Gorbachev's reformers monopolised the spotlight. This book restores the dissidents to their rightful place in Russian history. Using a vast array of samizdat and published sources, it shows how ideas formulated in the dissident milieu clashed with the original programme of perestroika, and shaped the course of democratisation in post-Soviet Russia. Some of these ideas - such the dissidents' preoccupation with glasnost and legality, and their critique of revolutionary violence - became part of the agenda of Russia's democratic movement. But this book also demonstrates that dissidents played a crucial role in the rise of the new Russian radical nationalism. Both the friends and foes of Russian democracy have a dissident lineage.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=w42vBt6dxpcC&dq=Legacy+of+Soviet+Dissent+(BASEES/Routledge+Series+on+Russian+and+East+European+Studies)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Druid Priestess, New Edition","description":"In the tradition of Marion Zimmer Bradley's Mists of Avalon, Ellen Evert Hopman weaves Druid history and spirituality into an engaging love story.

Their motto: Don't run over him get over him! Their mission: Track down and expose your straying man. And they won't stop until female domestic justice is served. Debbie Sue Overstreet and Edwina Perkins-Martin have never encountered a problem that couldn't be fixed with a strong margarita, a whole lot of hairspray, and an ear for gossip. They've learned that you'll only find a straying spouse or solve a crime by keeping your senses alert. After all, every red-blooded Texas woman knows ears are more than just a place to hang your diamond earrings! Newcomers stand out in Salt Lick like a preacher in a liquor store, and all ears and eyes are on Paige McBride and Spur Atwater. Paige arrived in town with nothing more than two hundred dollars in her pocket and a Cadillac SUV packed with designer clothes. Her oil-rich daddy has cut her off without a penny and now it's time for her to get one of those real jobs. The Domestic Equalizers know that Paige and her Barbie-doll looks are gonna stir things up. Soon every cowboy, trucker, and even one of Debbie Sue's ex-boyfriends, a rodeo star, is knocking on Paige's door. And, at just about the time she turns up to start her job tending the best cutting horses in Texas, the horses start disappearing from all the local ranches. Paige discovers she actually likes her work. After all, horses are more loyal than most men. But she doesn't like Spur, the new town veterinarian. Besides being movie-star good-looking, Spur's an exfootball star. Women of all ages love the new vet, and suddenly, more cats and dogs are getting sick than ever before. Working on the ranch means Paige can't avoid the man, and all those disappearing horses bring her together with the Domestic Equalizers. Edwina and Debbie Sue think that Spur and Paige make the cutest couple whether they're too bull-headed to realize it or not. But finding themselves knee-deep in the muck of a horse-thievin' and husband-cheatin' escapade is a whole other issue. No doubt about it, hearts are definitely going to get broken, but if these gals have anything to do with it, the hairstyles around town are still gonna look great!","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=mjbtmijG72oC&dq=My+Heart+May+Be+Broken,+but+My+Hair+Still+Looks+Great&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Point of Return: A Novel","description":"Set in the remote, northeastern hills of India, The point of return revolves around the father-son relationship of a willful, curious boy, Babu, and Doctor Dam, an enigmatic product of British colonial rule and Nehruvian nationalism.

For Dr. Dam and Babu, this has meant living as strangers in the same home, puzzled and resentful, tied only by blood. As the father grows weary and old and the son tries to understand him, clashes between ethnic groups in their small town show them to be strangers to their country as well.

The authors draw on years of experience using scripts in their own clinic, and include many case studies that show how scripts have worked. The book defines scripts as an audiotape or written word, phrase, or sentence that enables young people with autism to use speech to start and continue conversations. At first a child is taught to play the recording of a word for an adult, and then get a reaction from the adult. (e.g., if he plays the script juice, the adult will give him a sip of juice or if he plays the script ball, the adult will play ball with him). Later on, the child is taught to play the script and then say the word himself (and get the reward from the adult). As the child becomes better at talking, scripts are lengthened to become phrases --want juice or play ball --- and then sentences. And once the child can read, scripts are written instead of recorded. As the child masters sets of scripts, the adult begins to diminish (fade) the prompts. If the script was recorded, words are gradually deleted from the recording. (e.g., if the script started out saying, Where is mom? they will re-record it so it just says Where is and then Where ---? At this point, the child should fill in the blanks.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=KP_uAQAACAAJ&dq=Teaching+Conversation+to+Children+With+Autism:+Scripts+And+Script+Fading+(Topics+in+Autism)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Scooby-Doo! and the Howling Wolfman","description":"While on a trip to the mountains, Scooby and his pals learn about the problems at Lone Wolf Ranch and so set out to put an end to the mystery by finding the hairy wolfman and recovering the missing golden horseshoes.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=YYyNMQEACAAJ&dq=Scooby-Doo!+and+the+Howling+Wolfman&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"It's My Time...","description":"It is truly a time of change to reinvent yourself and start to really think about what will make you happy.

In recent years, the Federal Vision has been surfaced in the American conservative Reformed and evangelical circles. It has strong hermeneutical, theological, and practical attachment with Calvin. Although Calvin was a covenant theologian, he firmly maintained the evangelical distinction between law and gospel, especially in his exposition of justification by faith alone (sola fide) and salvation by grace alone (sola gratia) with a balanced emphasis of believers' covenantal obedience. Moreover, we will find out that Calvin not only applied the distinction between law and gospel to soteriology but also in the depiction of redemptive history. In Calvin, the distinction between law and gospel was foundational for the depiction of biblical vision of eschatology in the Garden of Eden before the Fall and under the Old Covenant. However, the exponents of the Federal Vision deny any validity of the distinction between law and gospel in hermeneutics, theology, and practice while they identify themselves with those of Calvin. In that sense, we may identify the Federal Vision not with the Protestant Reformation and Calvin but as consistent monocovenantalism in which they deny the distinction between law and gospel and apply that monocovenantal principle consistently to their understandings of hermeneutics, soteriology, the doctrine of double predestination, and sacramental theology.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=kgJKDAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Healed Without Scars Study Companion: A Personal Healing Journal","description":"\\"Enables readers to further apply the truths and principles of Healed Without Scars to their lives in order to find personal wholeness and freedom from emotional pain\\"--Provided by publisher.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=TepTGwAACAAJ&dq=Healed+Without+Scars+Study+Companion:+A+Personal+Healing+Journal&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Understanding Sonet/Sdh and Atm: Communications Networks for the Next Millennium","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=JwNuPwAACAAJ&dq=Understanding+Sonet/Sdh+and+Atm:+Communications+Networks+for+the+Next+Millennium&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Regional Innovation Systems: The Role of Governances in a Globalized World","description":"First published in 1998.

And yet, with an eye toward the French Revolution and its regicides and deicides, he shows how inevitably the course of revolution leads to tyranny.

This inspirational and scientifically sound book reveals how teens can lose weight by understanding their changing bodies and addressing their health needs from the inside out. The Teen Weight-Loss Solution offers the stories of real teens coping with the heartbreaking physical and emotional consequences of obesity. Dr. Schwartz reveals that the trigger for budding weight problems in teens can often be traced to the beginning of puberty, when their bodies are overloaded with hormones that impact mood, energy, motivation, and weight gain. Teens feel condemned to exist in their fuller figures and cannot understand the hormonal correlation between their emotional havoc and their expanding bodies. Dr. Schwartz's weight-loss solution teaches parents that they must look beyond the notion of managing their teen's weight problem with an old-fashioned forced diet and address not only body weight, but the whole individual. Parents must make the hormonal connection to obesity for their teen and help their doctor devise a plan that will help their child manage his or her health by monitoring diet, exercise, and lifestyle choices. Dr. Schwartz also reveals a revolutionary step-by-step, dose-by-dose plan for how natural hormones and supplements can be used to help achieve optimal balance of a teen's raging hormones for improved mood, energy level, and weight loss. The Teen Weight-Loss Solution offers new hope and a tried-and-proven plan that parents can implement today to start teens on the path to both a brighter future and a lifetime of health and self-confidence.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Sih6HAAACAAJ&dq=The+Teen+Weight-Loss+Solution:+The+Safe+and+Effective+Path+to+Health+and+Self-Confidence&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Approaching Authority: Transpersonal Gestures in the Poetry of Yeats, Eliot, and Williams","description":"This study, using the example of Yeats, Eliot, and Williams, examines the principal gestures of Modernist poetic speakers attempting to identify, mediate, and project cultural authority. To effect this mediation, the poetic speakers must engage in \\"transpersonality\\"; by association with the objects of presences in the poem, they must translate their finite egos into mediating voices detached from the concerns of unique selfhood. However, complete transpersonality brings silence: the fact of utterance presupposes a unique perspective, never the totality of perspectives that an atemporal authority possesses. So, rather than the speaker's elevation to a position of authority, the necessary result of the transpersonality is instead that the speaker approach authority in calculated acts of mystification.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=TdIzDx7tgxUC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"50 Strange Stories of the Supernatural","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=_NpuOM54T-AC&dq=50+Strange+Stories+of+the+Supernatural&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Shopping Guide for Caring Consumers","description":"The seventh edition of this popular guide offers consumers a means of easily identifying products not tested on animals--from personal, health care, and household products to office supplies.

Hypersexual City: The Provocation of Soft-Core Urbanism suggests this attention to women s invisibility in sociocultural space has overlooked the complex ways in which women already occupy space, albeit mostly as an image or object to be consumed, even purchased. It examines the occupation of urban space through the mediated representation of women s hypersexualized bodies. A complex transaction proliferates in the commercial urban space of cities; this book seeks to address the cause and consequence of the increasing dominance of gendered representation. It uses architectural case studies and analysis to make visible the sexual politics of architecture and urbanism and, in doing so, reveal the ways that heterosexist culture shapes the spaces, behaviour and relationships formed in neoliberal cities. Hypersexual City announces how examining urbanism that operates through, and is framed by, sexual culture can demonstrate that architecture does not merely find itself adrift in the hypersexualized landscape of contemporary cities, but is actively producing and contributing to the sexual regulation of urban life.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=RTMlDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Patient's Guide to PCOS: Understanding--and Reversing--Polycystic Ovary Syndrome","description":"A comprehensive guide to polycystic ovary syndrome, from a leading authority on the condition One in ten American women of childbearing age is affected by polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) to some degree, and many suffer from serious symptoms, such as infertility, early miscarriage, chronic pelvic pain, weight gain, high blood pressure, acne, and abnormal hair growth.

Ex-musician Chris Klick is no slouch. And no sleuth. He prefers to sit on the porch of an Idaho cabin and be one with nature, but groceries and some of life's finer things have to be bought with cash. When a chance to earn a fee by restoring missing royalties to other musicians comes along, he levers up his six foot four frame and has at it. So what's he to do when a beautiful woman with a mystery comes calling? When Nicole Russell invades his privacy and presents her story - a missing husband and a mislaid $50,000 - Klick jumps right in with his missing person skills. He's got to ask why, if the husband did a bunk, he took along Nicole's Labrador retriever? Luckily, for backup Klick's got an even taller friend, the former basketball star Lyel. Lyel, although \\"dependently wealthy,\\" is independent as hell and still a player who loves a challenge. Ridding nearby Snow Lake of its tangle of corruption while helping Nicole recover her money seems like sport. Unfortunately, the other side is playing for high- and deadly-stakes....

Using cross-cultural and interdisciplinary methodology, Oden investigates three biblical issues--the clothing of Adam and Eve, Jacob's name change to Israel, and ritual prostitution and Deuteronomy--in light of extra-biblical evidence. He also challenges scholars' assumptions of Scripture as monotheistic and proposes treating biblical narrative as myth rather than as historical fact.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Kb2Eaj46Ln8C&dq=The+Bible+Without+Theology:+The+Theological+Tradition+and+Alternatives+to+It&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Just Rewards","description":"The conclusion to the extraordinary tale of Emma Harte, the original Woman of Substance, and the powerful Harte clan...","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=x-mAxQEACAAJ&dq=Just+Rewards&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Fire Cops: On the Case with America's Arson Investigators","description":"From the big cities to dense forests to disasters at sea, authors Michael Sasser and Charles W.

These enigmatic, elusive images have had a profound and compelling impact on our visual reality, both feeding into and drawing from mainstream America's fascination with the subversive, the disowned, and the disillusioned. This innovative volume, a visual response to Chris Carter's dark, uneasy creation, collects the works of more than sixty cutting-edge artists. Representing a cross section of contemporary visual arts, these photographers, painters, scultptors, graphic designers, and digital media artists have produced works that reflect their personal interpretation of The X-Files: as a cultural phenomenon, as a new chapter in television history, as an engrossing cosmic conspiracy. Many pieces are accompanied by a statement from the artist, explaining the inspiration behind his or her contribution--ranging from an episode to a line of dialouge, form a particular incident to a theme within the entire series. Illustrated with video stills from the episodes, this volume shows the strong influence of The X-Files imagery on the artistic mind. In this introduction to this powerful collection of images, acclaimed writer William Gibson noted that The X-Files \\"is a disturbing and viscerally satisfying expression of where we've come from, where we are today, and all those places we simultaneously yearn and dread to go.\\" Starling, beautiful, and thought-provoking, this unusual volume expands the creative vision of The X-Files, and of contemporary art itself.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Y542HAAACAAJ&dq=The+Art+of+the+X-Files&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Backdoor Blessings","description":"Discusses problems that turn out to be blessings in disguise, including sibling rivalry, school traumas, in-law problems, and changes of employment.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=GRO58gPKX98C&dq=Backdoor+Blessings&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"There Ain't No Justice - Just Us","description":"Based on an actual wildcat strike that occured in 1979, There Ain t No Justice, Just Us tells the story of a middle-aged college professor, and former seventies radical, who finds himself caught in the web of a mid-life crisis and a decaying marriage. In his search for a more authentic identity, he winds up leading a wildcat strike in a gritty South Chicago factory. Along the way he encounters a variety of leftists and African-American and Mexican industrial workers who lead genuine, if impoverished, lives. The wildcat strike becomes the psychological gauntlet through which the characters must pass to achieve personal integration. The professor s quest for internal wholeness leads to a love affair with a radical feminist attorney and activist. In the end, the professor must choose between authenticity and love, or continuing his sedate, middle-class life.

W. Robinson takes the reader on a journey through Romans 8:117 using Conceptual Metaphor Theory and Conceptual Integration Theory. Robinson delineates the underlying cognitive metaphors, their structure, their function, what they mean, and how Paul s audiences then and now are able to comprehend their meaning. He examines each metaphor in the light of relevant aspects of the Greco-Roman world and Paul s Jewish background. Robinson contends that Paul portrays the Spirit as the principal agent in the religious-ethical life of believers. At the same time, his analysis demonstrates that the conceptual metaphors in Romans 8:117 convey the integral role of believers in ethical conduct. In the process, he addresses thorny theological issues such as whether Spirit and flesh signal an internal battle within believers or two conflicting ways of life. Finally, Robinson shows how this study is relevant to related Pauline passages and challenges scholars to incorporate these methods into their own investigation of biblical texts.

But history shows that some of the most effective branding campaigns are born when companies work with ad agencies to develop a business strategy that has a big, creative idea at its heart-what CEO of Euro RSCG Bob Schmetterer calls the Creative Business Idea. In Leap, Bob Schmetterer shows advertisers how to combine advertising creativity and bottom-line realities to develop winning business strategies and winning ad campaigns. He analyzes some of the most creative business ideas in history, showing how successful advertising and marketing strategies do more than simply communicate the brand-they define it. Advertisers know how to create demand for an existing brand, but Schmetterer argues that the next challenge for advertisers is to help their clients apply creative thinking to their core business strategy before they launch a branding blitz. Leap is about connecting the left brain and the right brain to develop solid business strategies that are also creative, fresh, and exciting. It's about mixing business's cold fixation on numbers with the warm heart of art and creativity to build revolutionary brands. It's about connecting with and listening to the client, understanding the business and the product, tapping into the client's passion for the product, and transmitting that passion to the consumer. It's about what happens when the business makes creativity part of its core strategy-enabling it to move beyond self-imposed boundaries and expand the limits of its reach. With a wealth of examples from Volvo to Purdue, Schmetterer shows ad agencies and managers how to help their clients develop the big, creative idea that will transform their businesses-and perhaps their industries. It's time for companies to make the Leap that synthesizes business and creativity to reap the full rewards of profitable innovation. BOB SCHMETTERER is Chairman and CEO of Euro RSCG Worldwide, a one of the world's top five global advertising and communications agencies with clients such as Intel, Peugeot, Air France, Orange, Abby National, MCI, Danone Group, Reckitt Benckiser, Volvo, and Yahoo!","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=zGsjNQEACAAJ&dq=Leap:+A+Revolution+in+Creative+Business+Strategy+(Adweek+Books)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Charlie Brown Christmas - 1st Edition (Adapted from a Bill Melendez production)","description":"Since its top-rated debut on CBS in December 1965, A Charlie Brown Christmas has been one of America's most beloved television shows. Year after year, fans of all ages tune in to the Emmy-winning Christmas special that has earned a permanent place in the nation's popular culture. This collector's treasury contains the entire script of A Charlie Brown Christmas, illustrated with full-color stills from the animated film. Producer Lee Mendelson and animator Bill Melendez pay tribute to the program with personal memories and reflections about the show, including charming anecdotes about their long friendship and working career with Peanuts creator Charles M. Schulz. Offering rare, behind-the-scenes insights, they also share memories of the late, great jazz pianist/composer Vince Guaraldi and provide never-before-published background sketches, storyboards, production sheets, and other materials that bring the making of the show to life. A Charlie Brown Christmas: The Making of a Tradition also brings the sound of the show home with the piano/vocal musical scores for Guaraldi's \\"Christmas Time Is Here\\" and \\"Linus and Lucy,\\" two songs that have become standards of American popular music. As the very first Peanuts special, A Charlie Brown Christmas brought Charlie Brown, Linus, Lucy, Snoopy, and the rest of the gang to television. In addition to breaking the mold by using jazz music (which exposed millions of people to jazz for the first time and inspired a generation of jazz pianists), A Charlie Brown Christmas broke new ground by using real children for the voices instead of adult actors. Schulz, Mendelson, and Melendez created these and other innovations that made A Charlie Brown Christmas a unique and timeless work of animation art. A Charlie Brown Christmas: The Making of a Tradition celebrates this award-winning and history-making show with warmhearted memories, fascinating trivia, and colorful animation art that will delight fans of all ages.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=EQZCPgAACAAJ&dq=A+Charlie+Brown+Christmas+-+1st+Edition+(Adapted+from+a+Bill+Melendez+production)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Edmund's Used Cars: Prices & Ratings : 1998 (Edmundscom Used Cars and Trucks Buyer's Guide)","description":"A reference for anyone looking to buy a used car gives ratings and standard prices for cars, pickups, sport utilities, and vans, as well as useful information about safety data and options.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=0E9FHwAACAAJ&dq=Edmund%27s+Used+Cars:+Prices&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Honoring Sergeant Carter: A Family's Journey to Uncover the Truth About an American Hero","description":"Allene Carter's father-in-law was a decorated veteran.

Throngs of fans jam into air-conditioned multiplexes to escape for two hours in the dark, blissfully lost in Hollywood's latest glittery confection complete with megawatt celebrities, awesome special effects, and enormous marketing budgets. The world is in love with the blockbuster movie, and these cinematic behemoths have risen to dominate the film industry, breaking box office records every weekend. With the passion and wit of a true movie buff and the insight of an internationally renowned critic, Tom Shone is the first to make sense of this phenomenon by taking readers through the decades that have shaped the modern blockbuster and forever transformed the face of Hollywood. The moment the shark fin broke the water in 1975, a new monster was born. Fast, visceral, and devouring all in its path, the blockbuster had arrived. In just a few weeks Jaws earned more than $100 million in ticket sales, an unprecedented feat that heralded a new era in film. Soon, blockbuster auteurs such as Steven Spielberg, George Lucas, and James Cameron would revive the flagging fortunes of the studios and lure audiences back into theaters with the promise of thrills, plenty of action, and an escape from art house pretension. But somewhere along the line, the beast they awakened took on a life of its own, and by the 1990s production budgets had escalated as quickly as profits. Hollywood entered a topsy-turvy world ruled by marketing and merchandising mavens, in which flops like Godzilla made money and hits had to break records just to break even. The blockbuster changed from a major event that took place a few times a year into something that audiences have come to expect weekly, piling into the backs of one another in an annual demolition derby that has left even Hollywood aghast. Tom Shone has interviewed all the key participants -- from cinematic visionaries like Spielberg and Lucas and the executives who greenlight these spectacles down to the effects wizards who detonated the Death Star and blew up the White House -- in order to reveal the ways in which blockbusters have transformed how Hollywood makes movies and how we watch them. As entertaining as the films it chronicles, Blockbuster is a must-read for any fan who delights in the magic of the movies.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=xPGPXu2MokkC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Devil's Other Storybook","description":"Twenty short stories display Satan's vanity and other failings as well as his unflagging gusto for dirty tricks.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=rvxOckU0QpYC&dq=The+Devil%27s+Other+Storybook&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Unsentimental Reformer: The Life of Josephine Shaw Lowell","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=af9uRQAACAAJ&dq=Unsentimental+Reformer:+The+Life+of+Josephine+Shaw+Lowell&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Choosing & Caring for a Shelter Dog: A Complete Guide to Help You Rescue & Rehome a Dog","description":"Cut through the noise and make better college and career choices This book is about addressing the college-choosing problem.

The young men of that group, many of them university students or graduates, volunteered for immediate service abroad and were sent to England to be trained to fly with our allies and to fight with them until the United States could organize squadrons of our own. Grider and Springs, after completing their training, were assigned to Number 85 Squadron of the Royal Air Force, then commanded by William (\\"Billy\\") Bishop, in May 1918. Grider was killed in air combat some twenty miles behind enemy lines on 18 June 1918, but before he was shot down he gave his diary to Springs, his closest friend. Springs apparently added two months to the diary, then published it with Goerge H. Doran in 1926. It was also published serially in LIBERTY MAGAZINE and in a paperback edition in 1951.

But maybe, just maybe, they are everywhere-on your lap at this very moment, in the walk-in closet, in the grand oak tree just outside your window, in the shower, the cellar-mumbling, grinning, stumbling about, screaming--but only a chosen few of the living have been blessed with the awful gift of being able to see them, hear them, interact with them, tormented by them. That's the awful gift that Abner W. Cray opened two decades ago, and it's a gift that, even today, keeps on giving: it possesses him, seduces him, makes his life (if it can be called a life) much, much more than a nightmare because, he knows, he's not asleep--he is mortally and eternally awake.

It was Beard's view that the founding fathers, especially Madison, Jay, and Hamilton, never made such a miscalculation. Indeed, these statesmen placed themselves among the great practitioners of all ages and gave instructions to succeeding generations in the art of government by their vigorous deployment of classical political economy.In this new printing of a major classic in American historiography, Louis Filler provides a sense of the person behind the book, the background that enabled Beard to move well beyond the shibboleths of the second decade of the twentieth century. While the controversies over Beard's book have quieted, the issues which it raised have hardly abated. Indeed, one can say that just about every major work in the politics and economics of the American nation must contend with Beard's classic work. Beard's work rests on an examination of primary documents: land and slave owners, geographic distribution of money, ownership of public securities, the specific condition of those who were disenfranchised as well as those who were in charge of the nascent American economy.The great merit of Beard's work is that despite its incendiary potential, he himself viewed An Economic Interpretation in coldly analytical terms, seeing such a position as giving comfort to neither revolutionaries nor reactionaries. Attacked by Marxists for being too mechanical, and by conservatives as being blind to the moral purposes of the framers of the constitution, the work continues to exercise a tremendous influence on all concerned. The fact that Beard wrote with a scalpel-like precision that gripped the attention of those in power no less than the common man is, it should be added, no small element in the enduring forces of this work.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=8Ks0DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Dynamics of Biblical Parallelism","description":"For years scholars of biblical poetry have defined parallelism as the simple correspondence of one verse, phrase, or word with another.

Berlin's examination of the grammatical, lexical, semantic, phonetic, structural, and psychological aspects of parallelism yields an elegantly simple model that reveals the complex workings of this phenomenon.

It is iconoclastic, crosses disciplinary boundaries, and finally it is calm and compellingly reasonable. The book was widely read on both sides of the Iron Curtain and the result was serious revision in both Western and Soviet strategy and doctrine. As a result, both sides were better able to avoid disaster during the Cold War. The strategic concepts still apply: defense, local animosities, and the usual balance-of-power issues are still very much with us. Kahn's stated purpose in writing this book was simply: \\"avoiding disaster and buying time, without specifying the use of this time.\\" By the late 1950s, with both sides H-bomb-armed, reason and time were in short supply. Kahn, a military analyst at Rand since 1948, understood that a defense based only on thermonuclear arnaments was inconceivable, morally questionable, and not credible. The book was the first to make sense of nuclear weapons. Originally created from a series of lectures, it provides insight into how policymakers consider such issues. One may agree with Kahn or disagree with him on specific issues, but he clearly defined the terrain of the argument. He also looks at other weapons of mass destruction such as biological and chemical, and the history of their use. The Cold War is over, but the nuclear genie is out of the bottle, and the lessons and principles developed in On Thermonuclear War apply as much to today's China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea as they did to the Soviets.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=EN2gtPTjFd8C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Kittens For Dummies (For Dummies (Pets))","description":"Everything you need to take care of your feline friend Cats are the purrfect pets: they re relatively easy to care for, a blast to play with, and sure to win the heart of every member of your family with their loving nature and sometimes sassy demeanor!

She provides the basis for a new research program on a more complete characterization of scientific reasoning, problem solving, and causality. Long acknowledged for her empirical work in the field of cognitive development, Koslowski boldy criticizes many of the currently classic studies and musters a compelling set of arguments, backed by an exhaustive set of experiments carried out during the last decade. Theory and Evidence describes research that looks at the beliefs that people hold about the type of evidence that counts in scientific reasoning and also examines how those beliefs change with age. The primary focus is on the strategies that underlie actual scientific practice: two general sorts of research are reported, one on hypothesis testing and the other on how people deal with evidence that disconfirms a given explanation the process of hypothesis revision. Koslowski argues that when scientific reasoning is operationally defined so that correct performance consists of focusing on covariation and ignoring considerations of theory or mechanisms, then subjects are often treated as engaging in flawed reasoning when in fact their reasoning is scientifically legitimate. Neither relying on covariation alone nor relying on theory alone constitutes a formula for success. A Bradford Book.

In this volume, fourteen theorists explore the significance for literary and cultural studies of the new paradigm of chaotics, forging connections between contemporary literature and the science of chaos. They examine how changing ideas of order and disorder enable new readings of scientific and literary texts, from Newton's Principia to Ruskin's autobiography, from Victorian serial fiction to Borges's short stories. N. Katherine Hayles traces shifts in meaning that chaos has undergone within the Western tradition, suggesting that the science of chaos articulates categories that cannot be assimilated into the traditional dichotomy of order and disorder. She and her contributors take the relation between order and disorder as a theme and develop its implications for understanding texts, metaphors, metafiction, audience response, and the process of interpretation itself. Their innovative and diverse work opens the interdisciplinary field of chaotics to literary inquiry.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=gpLeBQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Boy Apprenticed to an Enchanter","description":"Eean, the fisherman's son, vanquishes the evil Zabulun with the aid of the king's horses, Bird-of-Gold, and Merlin the magician.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=O_0cAAAAIAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dead of Night: A Novel","description":"Injected by a prison doctor with a formula designed to keep his consciousness awake after death, a condemned serial killer experiences unforeseen, contagious side effects and emerges from his grave to begin a murderous rampage that is combated by two small-town cops.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=01VJPV2ekHQC&dq=Dead+of+Night:+A+Novel&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Immortal Longings: Meeting Jesus Along the Way","description":"This book takes a personal approach to spirituality by exploring Jesus through his personal life and relationships.

We work furiously to conquer each individual disease, but we never think to ask: Is aging itself necessary? Nature tells us it is not: there are tortoises and salamanders who are spry into old age and whose risk of dying is the same no matter how old they are, a phenomenon known as  biological immortality.

In 1984, having spent seven years in and around advertising, Wolfe established Beatkit \\"TM,\\" the world's first ever anti-brand. It was a brand without a product and was intended to be a shining example of what was sick and wrong in a culture gone mad with consumerism. From 1984 to 2000 Beatkit \\"TM\\" sought to expose the dark nature of consumerism, consumption and disposal, all of which escalate the fundamental crises of contemporary life: using up of natural resources, ecological ruin, cynicism, and alienation. Wolfe used and reused images such as the Bionic Cat and the Removerinstaller until they had achieved the abstract presence of the Nike swoosh. Perhaps the real magic in his work is that it draws us in but delivers nothing.

As a result of this unique combination of natural features, Kansas attracts most of the eastern bird fauna and many of the western and southern species, as well as those northern birds that either winter on the central plains or pass through during their migratory flights. The number of bird species recorded in the states is 424a total that places Kansas among the top five birding states in the country.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=IPRJAQAAMAAJ&dq=Bird,+Kansas&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The America You May Never See","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=t4nW_MGsNesC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Torture Taxi: on the Trail of the Cia's Rendition Flights","description":"A story of how the CIA's darkest secret of the War on Terror - the 'extraordinary rendition' programme - was exposed.
