Deitch's artwork is clever, original, somewhere between Virgil Partch and Harvey Kurtzman -- far above the amateurish efforts one associates with fanzines. Anyone familiar with the loonier aspects of record collecting will find much amusement in these cartoons (The Cat berates one guy searching a huge pile of records with, &quot;That's the 'A' master which is relatively common!&quot;). Deitch also drew some interesting covers, reproduced here in full color. Anyone into vintage comics, records, and/or jazz will dig this.The packaging is a bit overkill. The width of the book is huge, but there is a lot of white space on the inside pages. A smaller size would not have detracted from the artwork, and would have made this a more affordable book. Also, nobody seems to have proofread the copy, as there are quite a few typos."},{"Title":"The Cat on a Hot Thin Groove: The Complete Collection of 78rpm Artwork from the Legendary Record Changer Magazine","review":"This book gets seven stars.

However, it still hasa very interesting storyline that is very very detailed :D"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great Expectations is one of Dickens's later novels, a work of his artistic maturity. The narrative is symbolic rather than realistic. Although, as in most of Dickens and in Victorian literature in general, the plot relies heavily on coincidence, it is acceptable here because the events are true to the internal, psychological, logic of the story.Great Expectations tells the story of Pip, a boy who starts as an orphan who moves on to apprenticeship in the business world of nineteenth-century England. Along the way, he falls in love with a girl from a wealthy family, and gains a mysterious patron.The book is heavy on character development and descriptive detail, but relatively light on action and suspense. The orphan Pip, the convict Magwitch, the beautiful Estella and her guardian, the embittered and vengeful Miss Havisham, the master lawyer Mr. Jaggers and Wemmick his secretive assistant - all play their part in this story which is a memoir, a mystery, and a romance.Great Expectations never loses sight of the social mishaps of the time and is often on the teacher's list in literature classics. Most people who read it will like it and will be able to identify with the characters, but impatient readers will drown in the details, extended descriptions and explanations, and deep characterizations."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Dickens is to me the most obvious of writers. Most of his novels are to various extents semi autobiographical. Most are populated by people with amusing names who, aside from the main characters, seem to be caricatures more than humans who think and feel with any semblance of subtlety or complexity. Most are deeply concerned with social injustice and class struggle. Most are filled with plot twists, and almost all are very enjoyable reads. Dickens is nothing if not a master storyteller who loves to manipulate the emotions of his reading public. His stories are theatrical more than novelistic. It is no wonder he is the most popular author of the Victorian age, and maybe second only to Shakespeare in the history of English literature.GREAT EXPECTATIONS and DAVID COPPERFIELD are my 2 favorite Dickens novels, probably because they both have more overtly autobiographical elements than his other works. I also love BLEAK HOUSE. GREAT EXPECTATIONS is the story of Pip.. of his rise and fall, and ultimate redemption. This novel gives us a clear window into the heart and mind of Dickens himself. The story itself held my interest from beginning to end, had important themes to explore, and despite it's lack of introspection in examining personality issues, made you care about the main characters. Dickens was one of the great writers but he is not my favorite novelist of that period. I prefer George Eliot's style as a novelist. To me, Dickens power was in connecting emotionally with his audience and it must have been some experience hearing him tell his marvelous tales in person."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This is an excellent coming-of-age book with which many people will be able to relate. I will admit, the beginning was rather grueling, but looking back, I am glad I finished the book. Dickens has a fabulous vocabulary and an excellent sense of people. The characters are dynamic and quite various. I would recommend this book to other scholars."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This book is a masterpiece of fiction. Until you read the book you don't realize just how influential this story is in western literature."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great Expectations didn't meet my expectations. I was a little bored throughout the begining and middle of the story. I think what kept me reading on was the desire to read a \\"classic\\" (I usually read biography or history).I continued reading because I wanted to find out if Magwitch would meet his daughter. In addition, I was interested in Pip's strong desire to be a gentleman. Other than help his friend in business and dawdle about thinking about an emotionally deadweight chic, Pip didn't seem interested in obtaining a job or taking real advantage of his opportunities. I'll give Pip credit for helping his friend attain stature in business, and eventually going on to operate with his friend after losing his unearned wealth. But the lazy part is 19th century gentleman, huh?Maybe Dicken's purpose was to show the benefits of wealth and the slothfullness of one who didn't have to work himself to attain it. Maybe it hit me at the wrong time, as my fiancee just took a hike and left me after I just sold my house (and now have no place to go). Trust you me, I won't be wasting my life away like Ms. Havisham though. I haven't reached gentlemanly status and need to continue working . . . .I've only read Charles Dicken's Nicholas Nickleby and Oliver Twist in addition to \\"Great Expectations\\". Of these, I thoroughly enjoyed Nicholas Nickleby. In the future, I'll look for Kates and Madellines and not Estellas. Great Expectations was a tougher read for me as these characters just simply didn't entice my interest too much. Of course, maybe I needed a brighter read . . ."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I first read this novel for a class. Years later, I picked it up again and reread it. It's excellent.

Miss Havisham is the most interesting of all, still in her wedding gown after all these decades. A must read.

At parts of the book it was good but then there were those parts where I didn't like it in all books there are usually those parts. I though it was easy to understand.For the major themes I didn't always understand it all. Some parts I never really caught on to were at the beginning when he was a little kid then he had grown up I never caught on to that right away. But when I finally did it was good and interesting to find out.I do think Charles Dickens did bring the story alive. I think also he should have had so many characters because then it was hard to understand who was who and where did they come from. At some points I wish he would have had explained himself more then what he did. I got mixed up so much with all the characters it was hard to keep track of them because they were in the story and then they were gone then all of a sudden they came back. But out of it all it was a good book."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Astonishingly this book joins passion and soul with dreams, i bought this book since i saw the movie and i just tought i needed to go deep inside, as a personal review, i've always enterteined the vogus idea to get an analogous life experience so this story might be great for those who dream with going ahead, this story is also helpful to find out for certain that you can see your dreams comming true from where you're least expecting."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Although I rated this book four stars, I wish there was a three and one-half star rating- that's what I'd really like to give it. Dickens is one of my favorite novelists, and normally I am passionately enthusiastic about his books, but I could only manage to get slightly warmer than lukewarm about this middling novel. Overall, it wasn't bad- it is, in fact, one I wouldn't mind rereading in future. However, I didn't think it was quite as good as many of Dickens' other works. The plot, while not bad or boring, was not as suspenseful and intriguing as that of &quot;Oliver Twist&quot;, as slowly but enjoyably developing as that of &quot;David Copperfield&quot;, or as wonderfully tantalizing and gripping as that of &quot;Bleak House.&quot; The characters, while not hopelessly mediocre or bland, were not nearly as likeable and were much more forgettable than those of other Dickens novels. Although Pip was not a bad protagonist, I did not enjoy or like him as much as I did, say, Oliver Twist or Esther Summerson. Likewise, his character development, while interesting, was not, to my mind, as good or as interesting as that which is undergone by David Copperfield, a hero who I liked better than, and with whom I could sympathize more than with Pip. Estella and Miss Havisham, while interesting, did not add much to the plot, and when it comes to criminals those of &quot;Oliver Twist&quot;, are, in my opinion, more memorable, and in many ways, more sympathetic than Magwitch. While not a thoroughly forgettable or bad book, I wouldn't reccommend it to first time Dickens readers- it may discourage them from reading more. Wait until you've read one or two of his better novels, such as &quot;Oliver Twist&quot; or &quot;Bleak House.&quot; Then come to this one- only don't come with expectations that are TOO terribly great."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"A classic!

His nagging sister and weakling of a brother-in-law are raising him. He doesn't have much, yet is compelled to help an escaped convict with food and drink. (More out of fear than compassion, mind.) He knows no other way of life, so he doesn't expect anything... until he meets Miss Havisham. Miss Havisham is an old recluse who still mourns after the man who broken her heart on her wedding day. One day, she invites Pip over to \\"play,\\" and that is where he meets young and beautiful Estella. The pretty girl intrigues and irritates him in equal parts. Proud and cruel, she makes him feel like a nobody. And that is how his desires to become a gentleman emerge. So imagine his surprise when a secret benefactor grants his biggest wish, a stranger with \\"Great Expectations.\\" Pip soon moves to London, abandons his old acquaintances for new ones, and reunites with mean girl Estella, now older and more beautiful. Will he be good enough for her now?Great Expectations is my favorite Dickens novel. Granted, I have only read this one and Bleak House (I've also read A Christmas Carol and another novella of his), but it is my favorite one of the two. This novel contains beautiful storytelling, lots of irony and Dickens's signature eccentric characters and hilarious dialogue. This is my second time reading this after over a decade, and I enjoyed it more the second time around. (I enjoyed this as much as the other novel I read at the same time as this one, which, to my surprise, brought up Dickens and Great Expectations.) Pip is a wonderful character. He does, however, get on my nerves when he wants to be around people that to me aren't worth it. Estella is such a snob, a total beyotch, but I can see why Pip would want her to think well of him. One thing I've always found interesting is that Dickens always depicts lawyers as greedy and callous. Bleak House illustrates this even more. Perhaps Dickens disliked lawyers. Could his father's stay at a debtors' prison have to do with this? Well, one thing is clear: Great Expectations is a beautiful novel, one of the best out there, even with its altered ending. I've read both endings and like them both (though I prefer his original ending). Two endings are great because they give you a choice. Anyway, a great summer reread. I have A Tale of Two Cities and look forward to reading it soon."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I love listening to audiobooks while I work out and have a special fondness for the classics, so I was very excited by the excellent reviews this audio version received. I had read that each disk contained 90+ brief tracks, which is fine with me as I have never had a problem importing audiobooks into iTunes. Well, there is always a first time. I don't know what iTunes uses to find CD info or track names, but not a single disk came up identified as Great Expectations, nor did the tracks have any type of logical naming system. I had to type in a name for 93-94 tracks on every single disk (eg. disk01track01, etc).The audiobook itself is quite good of course, thankfully. I just need to warn those who plan to import for their iPod that it will not be a simple process. Better have a couple of hours to type. Had I known this would be a problem, I would not have purchased this version."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"As usual with Dickens, improbable coincidences abound. They are artfully presented however and Dickens does offer one or two surprises.For one thing, the novel is quite violent. Dickens graphically describes one character dying from burns. He presents a ruffian or two. Even one of the better gentlemen manhandles his maid.Also as usual with Dickens, we find a full cast of memorable well-defined characters. Mr Jaggers, the lawyer to beat all lawyers, and his assistant Mr. Wemmick who never mixes business and home matters, except under exceptional circumstances. We find Miss Havesham a wealthy but bitter spinster left at the altar years before. We meet Joe Gargery, a wise well-meaning blacksmith who lovingly raises Pip, the novel's main character, taking him on as his apprentice. Pip leaves him when fortune mysteriously smiles on him. An unknown benefactor gives our hero a substantial income so that he may fulfill his Great Expectations and become a gentleman of means and of leasure.And there you have Pip in a nutshell: he leaves a loving home, a kind man and a good position to become a man of the world, a man about town, in short a bit of a parasite.But then to become a man of means is for Dickens to have attained heaven on earth and he only lets the truly good enjoy their fortune. Jaggers is rich and cannot be called good, at worst he is amoral, but he is a man of action. On the other hand the thoughtless and ungrateful Pip doesn't deserve heaven. Not just yet.Vincent Poirier, Tokyo"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"My only real complain about this bookis that Orlick seems to be an annoying intrusion. Both of the \\"Great Expectations\\" movies I saw deleted the role of Orlick, and I can't say I missed him. Along with \\"Oliver Twist,\\" \\"Great Expectations\\" was one of my father's favorites.Onto the text. Pip (who is still a child and a literary reincarnation of Oliver Twist)) has a frightening experience in a graveyard when the escaped convict Magwitch (kind of a literary reincarnation of Fagin) threatens him and demands a file and some food. When Pip goes to get these things, we meet his sister who is not so nice to him. Though her husband Joe is. (Undoubtedly, this tense marriage reflects Dickens's divorce.) Moving on, Pip delivers the file and food to Magwitch who is of course grateful. sadly, Magwitch is captured, but he remains grateful to Pip.Later, Pip meets the tragic Miss Havisham. Havisham was left at the altar, and she never quite forgave the male sex for this. Interestingly, she has no concept of time. She has friends who visit her on her birthday, they do not mention it. Havisham trains her adopted daughter Estella to hate all men. Pip continues to visit Havisham and Estella for sometime. Soon, some good news comes from lawyer Mr. Jaggers. Pip learns that he is to be trained as a gentleman. Pip knows that Jaggers is Havisham's lawyer, so he assumes this gift is from her. (Why not?)Pip is accompanied by Herbert Pocket who is the son of Miss Havisham's cousin. Herbert tells Pip of Havisham's tragic past. We are permitted some sympathy for her. Pip (who is falling love with Estella) knows that Estella resembles someone, but he can't quite place who.There is a sad, but true to life scene when Joe comes to visit Pip, and because this kind man is not so educated, he turns out to be an embarrassment to Pip. In a scene of self sacrifice, Joe decides to let Pip go his own way.Later there is a disturbing scene between Havisham and Estella. While we may feel sorry for Havisham, she tried to plant her hatred in Estella, and naturally, Estella could only take living for hate so long. The real drama is still to come. Pip finds out that his benefactor was indeed Magwitch. (The man from the graveyard!) While we may share Pip's horror to some extent, we later learn that Magwitch is a sympathetic character. Basically, Compeyson was a kind of Uriah Heep who manipulated Magwitch. To make matters worse, it is punishable by death for Magwitch to be in England.I don't want to give away the ending, but this is easily one of Dickens's greatest books."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"After reading a bunch of these reviews, I've come to the conclusion that this book should not be pushed on high school students or younger. It's almost sad to read a review from someone who just read the cliff notes. Come on now, do we really need to hear from you?

The character of Miss Havisham is genius, and a character like none I have ever met before in literature. The images of her sitting corpse like in her decaying house will stick with me for all time. Everyone should read this book for this fascinating character.While the first part of the book delighted me with wicked satire, and dark humor, the last quarter of the book was too morally right for me. Every character saw the error of his ways, and strove to be a better person, and here the book lost much of the original feel it had going for it. I suppose maybe in Dickens' time, he couldn't get away with a book that did not have a morally uplifting ending.However, I say this is a must-read for the characters of Miss Havisham and the beautiful Estella alone.

I admire Pip because he is very young and the fact that he has to travel,work, and take care of his sick sister, he is a very good rolemodel. I also admire him because if a ex-convict came up to me, I would be so scared that I would run away. The fact that he trusted Magwitch with a lot of things really amazed me. Pip has gone through a lot of things with his family and his own personal life in a considerable amount of time and I admire him for that.

The resulting work, Great Expectations, was published weekly from December 1, 1860 to August 3, 1861. This was his second semi-autobiographical work, but where David Copperfield was a confident expression of faith in middle class values, Great Expectations offers a bleaker view of whether those values will lead to happiness. In fact, Dickens own marriage had just come to an end after many unhappy years. Indeed he had recently changed the name of the magazine from the more bucolic Household Words. Despite, or because, of this ambivalence, Great Expectations became one of his greatest achievements.Pip, a boy of the marshes, is being &quot;raised by hand&quot; by his shrieking harridan of an older sister and her seemingly doltish husband, the blacksmith Joe Gargery. One day, while visiting his parents' gravesite, Pip is accosted by an escaped convict who demands that he bring him a file and some &quot;wittles&quot;. When the convict, Abel Magwitch, is later captured, he accepts the blame for stealing the file and food before being carted back to prison.Shortly thereafter, Pip is invited up to Miss Havisham's manor house to play with her beautiful ward Estella. Miss Havisham's life came to a halt when she was jilted at the altar, all clocks are stopped at the hour of her betrayal, the feast lies rotting on tables &amp; she wanders about in the decaying wedding gown. Estella is to be the instrument of her revenge upon men.Eventually, &quot;Great Expectations&quot; are settled upon Pip when a secret benefactor sets up a trust in his name and sends him to London to be educated and become a gentleman. Pip assumes, and Havisham allows him to believe, that she is his benefactress and that he is being elevated to a position that will make him worthy of Estella.As Pip rises in society, he leaves Joe behind, despite the many kindnesses Joe had shown him growing up. He becomes a shallow arrogant middle class climber. So he is stunned when he discovers that he is actually benefiting from the secret wealth of Magwitch, who made a fortune in Australia after being transported. Moreover, Magwitch's unlawful return to England puts him and Pip in danger. Meanwhile, Estella has married another, a horrible man who Pip despises. Eventually, with Magwitch's recapture and death in prison and with his fortune gone, Pip ends up in debtors prison, but Joe redeems his debts and brings him home. Pip realizes that Magwitch was a more devoted friend to him than he ever was to Joe and with this realization Pip becomes, finally, a whole and decent human being.Originally, Dickens wrote a conclusion that made it clear that Pip and Estella will never be together, that Estella is finally too devoid of heart to love. But at the urging of others, he changed the ending and left it more open ended, with the possibility that Estella too has learned and grown from her experiences and her wretched marriages.This is the work of a mature novelist at the height of his powers. It has everything you could ask for in a novel: central characters who actually change and grow over the course of the story, becoming better people in the end; a plot laden with mystery and irony; amusing secondary characters; you name it, it's in here. I would rank it with A Tale of Two Cities, Oliver Twist and David Copperfield among the very best novels of the worlds greatest novelist.GRADE: A+"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Now I'll admit that when all is said and done I am a newborn to the world of so called classic literature. So when I was assigned to read Great Expectations for English class, I'll admit to being a little more than skeptical. However once I began to read the novel I discovered something. The novel wasn't that hard to understand. While it did take a while to get fully immersed in the novel, once you were in you really wanted to see the novel to its resolution. The prose was easy to understand, and the plot crossed generations easily. Maybe classics just have a bad reputation with the younger generation, but Great Expectations went a long way to helping to shorten that gap. I think the driving force that leads me to recommend this book is the fact that we all have great expectations of life, and that we all dream of improving our status in the world. People will always share a common bond, and in this novel Dicken's truly shows us that."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I got bogged-down fairly early in this book and almost decided to stop reading it. Fortunately for me, it soon re-kindled my interest (no pun intended), and only got better as it progressed. This was my first foray into Dickens, and if his other works are as entertaining as this one is, I anticipate a world of wonderful reading ahead. Be forewarned that some of this book's reviews give away too much of its plot (I made the mistake of reading them first). Do yourself a favor: Just trust that Dickens deserves his legend and dive-in. I can't imagine that this famous classic will disappoint you."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"The setting is good. The beginning of the book was dry and hard to get through. However once the first quarter of the work is finished the story just takes you along with it. The plot is interesting but the spin at the end is terrific. A must read..."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"If Pip had been a real young man rather than a book, I could have warned him stay away from that girl and all the trouble that came with her. And had Pip been a real young man, he would have been equally as receptive to that advice as the book is. In short, \\"Great Expectations\\" is not a book but rather, in a very direct and almost literal way, it IS its main character."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I am a high school English teacher who has taught 9th, 10th, 11th, and 12th grade English. Of all the novels I've ever taught my students these 12 years I've been in Education, this novel, Great Expectations, by Charles Dickens, is by far the best! It is easy to read and understand, and it holds students' attention until the very end. The plot is like a roller coaster and all the characters seem to be connected in some way. The end of each chapter leaves the reader in suspense and anxious to continue reading. Although the setting of the novel takes place in 19th century England, the novel's themes and the characters' experiences seem to relate to all social classes, races, and both genders. Even my students at an inner-city high school in Atlanta rush home to read ahead to find out what will happen to Pip next!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Yet another success by Charles Dickens, this book is sure to warm hearts of both children and adults everywhere. This book is another classic, telling the great story of a once simple orphan boy named Pip. I greatly enjoyed this book, with Charles Dickens' enticing use of imagery, it is sure to keep anyone reading. This book could make one cry, and smile. And to me, for it to cause any sort of such emotion, it has to be a truly lovely book to read. If you want a cozy, enticing book to read by the fire on a snow day, go ahead, and read the powerful story: \\"Great Expectations.\\""},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"\\"Great Expectations\\" by Charles Dickens is a very haunting novel. While the book portrays England as dreary, in a strange way it makes England seem like a nice place to live in. 1800s England as depicted in the novel has a lot of poor people. But the people seem nicer and more innocent minded then people are these days. Even the bad guys in the story seem more innocent minded then people these days.The book begins with a young child called Pip visiting his parents grave only to be stopped by an escaped convict who asks him for food and a file. Pip goes and gets these things secretly to avoid getting in trouble with his sister. Later on the convict is captured and before he is led away, he lies that he stole food from Pip's aunt's cupboard to Pip's uncle Joe and this saves Pip from getting in trouble for taking the food. After that, Pip gets a strange opportunity at a house called Satis House owned by a Miss Havisham. She pays his aunt to have Pip play with a beautiful girl called Estella. Later on, Pip is told by an aquaintance called Mr. Jagger that he has great expectations. He tells him that a secret benefactor has provided for Pip to be educated. Pip, jumps at this opportunity. He goes to live in a rented room and is educated all the time not knowing who is providing him with the sums to be educated. He continues to think about the beautiful girl Estella who shuns his advances.\\"Great Expectations is a very haunting novel. With the book, I got a full view of what life was like in England in the 1800s. The character Miss Havisham is really scary. Her house with its room where there is a decaying wedding cake is almost like a haunted house. The book contains no supernatural elements though and that's what is so amazing, that Charles Dickens manages to make it scary without putting ghosts or monsters in it. Miss Havisham was clearly a woman with a lot of potential who ruined her life because she couldn't get over a romance that went sour. I felt bad for her and hope people learn from her example.The character that really caught my attention was Estella. I have had experiences in my own life where I had a crush on a girl who didn't have a crush on me and so I knew what Pip was going through and related to his character in this respect. Its when they're young that men are haunted most by those feelings for a girl or a woman, it is clear though that Pip needs to move on and find another girl to get in a relationship with.All in all, Great Expectations is a good fast read even though it is not an adventure novel, which makes the novel even more amazing."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Just a wonderful enthralling read! I enjoyed this so much! I read this in high school but decided to read it again. I just did not appreciate the story line or the characters back as a teenager. I am so glad I decided to re-read this again! I am now going to work my way through more of Dickens novels. His character development is wonderful! The story line has twists and turns to keep the pages turning! You just don't know what you are missing by not reading this novel! Yes, I recommend!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"There are few if any authors who could create such a variety of wonderful characters as Dickens has done in his many novels and short stories. They touch you and remain with you - even becoming icons. This is true in all Dickens novels, and it is no less true in this work. How bizarrely wonderful is Miss Havisham with her tattered and yellowed bridal gown and half century old wedding cake? Who else could come up with such a marvelous character?"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I'm not going to say much about the story, because you probably already know it. I first discovered the book over 40 years ago in high school.But I really appreciated this edition. As a forward, there is an overview of the book, pointing out things to help you understand them when you read them. It also clarifies some of the points made. It doesn't say anything about Pip suffering from depression, but I think he does, which contributes to his low self-esteem.Then at the back of the book, there is a section of notes, including the original ending. There are also notes on some of the words used or articles mentioned in the book.All in all, this was a wonderful read and look forward to reading it again."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great Expectations is hailed as a one of the great masterpieces in literature and for good reason. However, it does drag in the beginning and current audiences may not be able to fight through to reap the rewards this book gives out. Also, the language used in the book is not used currently in use and may throw off some readers. Midway threw the book I was enjoying Great Expectations, but disappointed in the pace and flow and ready for it to quicken. But it did and I was enthralled with the final 200 pages."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This is one of my favorite Dickens books, detailing a lifelong love story between Pip and Estella. So sometimes the circumstances aren't realistic - so what? TV shows these days aren't either. Pip is a likeable character, and the various other characters represent real forces in our society. This is a great novel."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Each time that I read Great Expectations I'm left wondering whether or not Pip would have been happier if he had never been made the gift of \\"great expectations.\\" More importantly, would he have been a better man if he had remained apprenticed to his blacksmith brother-in-law Joe rather than having been sent to London to be trained in the ways of a gentleman?Great Expectations is a Dickens cautionary tale in which the author warns his readers of what can so easily happen to a person when given the opportunity to \\"better himself\\" by leaving his home, family and friends behind for education and fortune-seeking in the big city. As soon as word reached the local townspeople around whom Pip had spent his early years that a fortune was soon to be his, Pip found himself treated with respect and awe by the very people who had had little time for him in the past other than to chastise his behavior and relationship with the sister who was raising him \\"by hand.\\" Their \\"boy\\" became \\"sir\\" overnight it seemed.But sadly, after arriving in London and seeking to impress his new friends and colleagues, Pip decided that those who loved him most were an embarrassment to his future prospects and he only occasionally felt any guilt about his lack of contact with them. It is only when Pip's future prospects shockingly take a turn for the worse that he seeks the comfort of the family that he left behind.Along the way, Dickens fills Great Expectations with some of the most memorable characters in British literature history. There are Miss Havisham, the spinster who never recovered from being jilted at the altar; Joe, the blacksmith and Pip's brother-in-law who never stopped loving Pip as a son no matter how much Pip neglected him over the years; Estella, the beautiful young woman whom Pip has loved since they were small children but who has been raised by Miss Havisham to give her heart to no man; Herbert, Pip's best London friend, a truly good man who both benefits from Pip's help and who eventually offers Pip a new future of his own; and, of course, Magwitch, the colorful escaped criminal whom Pip meets in the first pages of the book.This is one of those books that I read every few years because re-reading it is like visiting an old friend after too long an absence. As the old memories come back, it's like I've never been away."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"First of all (as I like to say!) I'm no smarter than you and I thought this book was great, that said, this book is not THE easiest to read in that it does take a while for things to get really interesting. I rated it 5 stars because it is excellent but you need to have some patience with this book, in the end it is much worth the effort....and keep me updated!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I don't know what you guys are talking about. If you're a serious reader - and I expect you are if you willingly attempt this book - then there shouldn't be a problem getting into it. Dickens is far easier to read then Dostoevsky or Tolstoy or even Hawthorne or James.You have to understand that you can't skim the classics. If you do, then you miss out on subtle prompts and hints. In fact, any good book should have some buried clues, clues that if you don't pick up, the plot will be confusing or pointless. That's what makes these kinds of books great, the challenge and the reward, plus the wonders they do for your vocabulary.If you want books you can skim over before bedtime and still pick up the plot and characters, that's fine, not everyone needs to be a serious reader. However, don't go around bashing great books that you shouldn't be reading, because you might turn off somebody who will really enjoy it.If you have a real problem with the book, mention the plot, or accurately describe why you don't like the writing style."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great Expectations is truly one of Dickens' best works. It is long but there is so much to offer - rich, memorable characters, universal themes, exciting adventure, unrequited love, murder, mystery, and revenge. The plot touches heavily upon social class distinctions, education, economics and crime and punishment. Issues that still resonate with the modern reader today.Great Expectations, famously, begins in a cemetery where the orphaned Pip is visiting the graves of his parents. There he encounters an escaped convict from a nearby prison ship who is to change his life though Pip will not understand fully how until many years later. As the book continues he meets many surreal characters with perhaps the most memorable being Miss Havisham, the crazed jilted bride, whose manipulations in regard to Pip and her adopted daughter,Estella, break Pip's heart and leave Estella a shallow, empty woman. Another one of Dickens more famous characters appearing in Great Expectations is Pip's guardian, Jaggers, the successful and possibly compulsive obsessive, attorney. Less well known but equally memorable appearances are made by Pip's loyal friend Herbert Pocket whose unusual family provide comic relief and social satire, Pip's brother-in-law the kind but uneducated Joe Gargory, Mrs. Joe, Pip's shrewish sister who is raising Pip \\"by hand\\", Jagger's assistant Wemmick who neatly divides his home life and his work life plus a host of others. Life in 19th century England - both London and it's small towns - are masterfully kept alive by Dickens' sure contemporary descriptions."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"My first complete Dickens book was \\"A Tale of Two Cities.\\" Since that was an idealistic romance novel, this book rather surprised me with its portrayals of the darker side of human nature. Instead of heart-wrending sacrifices, I found painful ingratitude. Instead of perfect heroines, I found scheming, insensitive women. This book was not anything I expected with regards to characterization and theme. However, I would have to say this book exemplifies human nature much, much better. It was not a very entertaining read at all, but the craftsmanship and word employment simply could not be better. This book may not turn one's daydreams on paper, but it is a solid, landmark work of literature."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"My daughter had to read \\"Great Expectations\\" for 9th grade English,she was short of time and a slow reader. This unabridged version really filled the bill. She could listen while being otherwise engaged or read along with the book. The Actor/reader is the same one who read all of the Harry Potter books. Well read and helped keep her interest."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I wanted to revisit this \\"classic\\", having read it in high school and remembering it fondly. I was not disappointed, for I found the story more applicable to my life now, ten years later, than at the time of my first reading. Back then, it seemed a good yarn - lots of fun characters, intriguing plot twists - a grand adventure. Upon rereading, I was able to absorb the story while thinking about my own \\"coming of age\\", and weigh the morality of Pip's universe. At the same time, my original impressions were not misguided - the moral/societal questions Dickens explores are layered into the fun characters and strong plot development.In addition, there are some interesting \\"reading group\\" questions at the back, as well as some interesting commentary by various authors since the time of the original publication. For that reason, I would recommend this edition."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Above all what I loved about this book was how all the characters came together and were somehow related in some surprising way. The book was very well written. I had to read this book for school and I'm glad that I was forced to or I might never have chosen to read this book. The language was very understandable unlike some other books I've read from that time period. I really recommend it."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"One of the great novels in the English language. It would be presumptuous of me to add more. Most readers would benefit from reading this book. My first time was forty years ago. Great novels should be spaced out in one's life and reread at specific junctures."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This book was not as interesting as some other books that I have read. Some of the chapters were confusing and is in need of some clarification. But then again, there are many unseen connections that are made. But overall, it was interesting and much like a soap opera with some dull moments."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great Expectations is the most amazing book I have ever read. Charles Dickens' eloquent language enthrawls you and keeps you reading on. I have seen how some people find this hard to get through; I was 12 when I read it and I understood it perfectly and loved it. Others think it is too long - this just gives you more to enjoy. I also had to read it because I was told to (for school) and I just read with enjoyment without focusing on every little detail like others have (which in my view is the reason for their disliking.) This book is a classic which must be read. Words cannot describe the quality of the book. Take my advice - purchase a copy and READ IT!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This book at the beginning seemed to me a little boring but as i read on it got really interesting. So much irony and so many twists is what really kept me on the edge of my seat. This is one of those books that you look forward to the end but when it comes you sit back and wish there was more. It really makes you think about yourself, society, and the world. I HIGHLY recommend this book."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"There really aren't words for this book. The characters were as lifelike as possible, the plot was intreeging, and the writing was supperb. I am only 12, but I found this book to be one of the best I have ever read."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great Expectations is one of the best books I have ever read. Dickens provides the reader with a great story and a wonderful mistery. His presentation of the identity stuggle within Pip is, at the lack of a better word, marvelous.Everytime I thought I had the story figured out, I was presented with a jaw droping event that got me even more interested.I would recommend this book to anyone! It's worth taking on your next trip to the beach. Cheers!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Being a fan of Charles Dickens novels I can honestly say Great Expectations is his greatest work. The characters are unforgettable and the story which starts out slow in the beginning grows very quickly. The book is about life, living and the disappointments that come with it. The novel seems to have a very sad and uneasy tone throughout it. And if you have right version of the novel you will be able to read Charles Dickens original ending for this novel. Its very sad and disappointing to the reader but you cant help saying to yourself that the ending fits."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"O.K. lets face it. im in fourth grAde. this is a very good book,but its hard.im akmost half way tttthrough it. its been a challenge."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"After several futile attempts, I was literally forced to read this novel for school. I found that the reason I had such difficulties beginning it, was due to its monotonous and dull beginning. Once past that section, Great Expectations dramatically lifts. I found the whole idea of a women stopping her clocks and living in darkness due to unrequited love a little morbid, yet also slightly romantic, and I found myself disliking the main character with a vengence. Not his best, certainly, but still okay."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"A word I hear spoken often today is: boring. I hear that word coming out of the mouth of many teenagers. We live in a society that is so bombarded with continual stimulation, that we expect to be entertained at every turn and get bored too easily if &quot;forced&quot; to read a classic book like Great Expectations. Many high school students would rather be doing something else than reading so it doesn't surprise me when I see all the reviews by teenagers who said they hated the book. I recommend that they read it again in 20 years after seeing the world."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Although Great Expectations is better-written than most contemporary novels (Miss Havisham alone makes the book worth reading and demonstrates Dickens' wonderful skill with characters), I fear that GE is most people's only contact with Dickens because it's short enough to assign for school. (So is A Tale of Two Cities, a great story, but not much like other Dickens works.) If you can stick with them, I recommend even more highly Dickens' Bleak House, Our Mutual Friend, David Copperfield, and Little Dorrit--they're long but they are great, well-written stories with fully developed characters and (sometimes mysteriously long) plot and description that turns out to be crucial (you get a hint of that in GE). Don't give up on Dickens; his works are classics for good reason."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"In my opinion, Charles Dickens remains the writer who defined the art of characterization in the 19th century. This novel contains a bevy of characters that the readers will find unforgettable. The haunting figure of Miss Havisham has stayed with me since my 10th grade literature class (almost 30 years ago) and my recent rereading of the novel brought her horrid existence into full view again. The plot has twists and turns and although I found myself having to stop reading and letting certain episodes sink into my understanding, the beauty and scope of the writing is truly remarkable. As a young student of Dickens, I resisted the long descriptions and difficult dialogue and I don't remember loving the book when I read it the first time. As an adult, however, my admiration for the novel is undeniable."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I read Charles Dickens's book Great Expectations. This book is about a young boy named Pip. Pip lives with his older sister Mrs. Gargery who is married to a black smith named Joe. Early in the book Pip meets an escaped convict that was on the run. He may not know it yet but the convict will have a lasting affect on him. When Joe finds out about the convict he asks Pip to help the police catch him. After a quick battle the convict and his partner are caught. Later in the book Pip meets Miss Haversham whose cold ward Estella Pip adores. An unknown person pays for Pip to go to London and become a gentleman.Charles Dickens is a wonderful writer. The Great Expectations is a great example of Dickens writing power. Moby Dick and other books are just as well done. I enjoyed reading the Great Expectations it was a long and detailed story of adventure and affection. I hope you enjoyed reading it too."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I can only agree, a great book that is very nicely done and is easy to read. I like it, it is simply a classic everyone should have read!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This seems to be a very nice copy of the book, it is easy to read in its big font and looks nice aswell. :)"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Yes, Dickens was paid by the word when writing this.Yes, this is a big bookYes, if you were forced to read it in school, you probably hatedYes, if you read it on your own at or after age 25... you probably loved it.I for one, thought this book was great, sure it was wordy, but it was not wordy in that \\"what the heck is he trying to say\\" way that gets many other wordy books (Crime and Punishment - though I blame the translators for that one).Short Summary: This is the story of Pip, starting from a young age after his parents and many younger siblings are deceased and he is being raised by his militant sister and her lovable but slightly dense husband, Joe. Pip has very little hope of a future other than an apprenticeship with Joe as a Blacksmith. Suddenly... doors start opening for Pip, and opportunities present themselves to him. He accepts but never knows who or why strings are being pulled in the background to open these doors for him. We follow Pip through his life as he accepts these opportunities, and they lead him down a strange but wonderful path of self discovery, maturity, and opening his eyes to the real world.The reason this book is so effective is because Pip is so real. We follow him through his blunders and successes, we dread his putting his foot in his mouth, saying the wrong things to Biddy, or Ms. Haversham, and we rejoice when he commits selfless acts and hate him when he commits selfish ones. It is my personal opinion that this book will have more of an affect on the late twenty year olds and up because by then you have suffered a bit, and made some of the same mistakes as Pip, you have wandered through finding your way in the world, and the confusion of who you are, wishing you were something else, loving what or who you cannot have, and figuring out what path to put your life on.The rest of the cast of characters is quite a collection of multifaceted, entertaining, and interesting people. Ms. Haversham is a favorite of many, so strange, so tortured, so heartless, and so intriguing... then we have Dear old Joe, so Simple, and mild, and encouraging. Joe's love is unconditional and unwavering. Biddy, is so loyal, so kind, and so honest, then you have her polar opposite, Estella. There are so many other characters that are interesting, fun to read about and that you will have strong feelings for one way or another.I highly recommend this book, even though it is over a century old, the language is not difficult to read (very little work required) and the plot and characters are stellar. True there are no explosions, but a book can be engaging with out them. Give it a try."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I agonized through this book in HS and have recently breezed through it. About 30 years have passed in between.What I was most struck by in my second reading was how relevant the story was to our own times. Child abuse and emotionally damaging relationships, celebrity lawyers, prison reform, the dangers of easy credit, how easily a person can dispose of their past identity. Dickens wrote about this 140+ years ago but he could have been writing about the present day. Yes, a reader has to warm up to the 19th century language, but once that happens, the characters and their emotions are so authentic and fully developed. I found myself so annoyed at Pip in the middle of the novel, I almost put it down. How could I possibly care about such an obnoxious young man. But I did care and cared more and more deeply as the book wound down. Pip's transformation was convincing because the reader sees how it occurs in small increments. In the end I took a deep breath and thought to myself, well, Pip, you finally grew up. It may not be the best book to force teenagers to read, but I hope mature readers will take it up and find the treasures inside."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This is an incredible masterpiece of storytelling. Charles Dickens is witty and intelligent. He creates characters that you are able to warm to and he is able to sculpt a brilliant plot. Without putting in any spoilers i will let you know that the main character PiP, definitely got what he expected ! and he learnt something in the process - that character is far more valuable than status - even the status of being a gentleman !!\\""},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I was brought kicking and screaming to this story thanks to high school English Lit requirements but it ended up being my favorite of the term.

This is a classic to add to your home library."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I can't give this book enough praise. I read David Copperfield after, which was supposedly Dickens' most belove character, but I enjoyed GE much more. You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This is Charles Dickens' version of the poor kid fantasy. This is almost a fable, I would say. This is the kind of story that you hear over and over growing up in poverty. It is almost in the category of Robin Hood, but this is the real thing in the flesh and blood. The old man in the cemetery scene still plays over and over in my mind. I should have read everything written by Charles Dickens by now, but yet I haven't. I started A Tale of Two Cities a little while ago and I have it on my night stand. I think that I'll get back to it tonight. I don't know who beats Dickens in superb phrasing and style. He is the Master.Richard Edward Noble - The Hobo Philosopher - Author of:\\"Honor Thy Father and Thy Mother\\""},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Love it....Love it!

I'll speak to the edition itself, because formatting of Kindle books (especially free ones) can be very hit and miss. The illustrated Kindle edition by Top Five Books is easy to navigate, formatted well, free of errors, and contains a variety of illustrations. It is free, and there is nothing about this version that recommends choosing an alternative."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great Expectations is widely regarded as one of Charles Dickens' finest works and I have to agree; it is one of my favorites, second to A Tale of Two Cities. The story of a young boy's growth to manhood, and his rise to unexpected prosperity and subsequent fall, is strongly written and captivating. Great Expectations captures the attention from the first page and, unlike some of Dickens' other works, it never has a dull moment. Like all of Dickens' works, it is peopled with a large cast of unique and quirky characters whose relationships to each other, as the story unfolds, end up being as intertwined as a plate of spaghetti. Some of the scenes and characters in Great Expectations are downright bizarre; the scenes involving Miss Havisham and the Pocket family felt distinctly Alice in Wonderland-ish in their weirdness.What makes Great Expectations so strong is the main character, Pip. He is that rarity among Dickens' characters, one that has depth and more than one dimension and mood. He tells his own story and, as an adult reflecting back on his own childhood and adolescence, he reveals his own youthful selfishness with a poignancy that surely every listener can connect with. Haven't we all been Pip, selfish and unappreciative of the goodness of others and unworthy of their admiration?I did not listen to this particular audio edition, although I know that Brilliance Audio produces top-notch audio books and Michael Page is an excellent narrator. I highly recommend the edition I listened to, produced by BBC Audio. It is a no-frills production, but the narrator (Martin Jarvis) is outstanding. He truly has a gift for voices (I especially loved his rendition of The Aged), and adds color and personality to the story."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I enjoyed reading this book in high school and also enjoy watching one of the old B&W; movie versions if it happens to come on TV.

I thought it was an extremely good story. The characters (my favorites being Orlick and Trabb's Boy) are brilliant and subtley funny. The story is creative and unpredictible, and overall, it was absolutely supberb. The only reason this book doesn't get 5 stars is because it tends to drag a lot of the time, and Dickens overlong descriptions are a bit grating on the nerves, but I DO understand why people would have liked it like that in the 1800's. They liked their books long and juicy. It's a bit dated but Great Expectations is well worth a read if you have the patience. Even if you are impatient, you can not miss this great story and its wonderful characters, so at least see one of the many great movie adaptions.

It has all the classic Dickens-style plot twists, with some great surprises, as well as some pretty contrived coincidences (also classic Dickens).I only took off a star because the ending was changed from how i remembered it.

I had gained a sort of superiority to the man and his works. I would dismiss it as all sentimental unbelievabilities. But I decided to not be so proud and read one of his books. On a recommendation from one of my professors, I started with Great Expecations. What I found was a deeply engrossing, funny and humane book that captivated me for the week and a half that it took to read it. Much of it was very realistic (barring, of course, the unrealistic coincidences, that are actually, in their own way, quite comforting) and believable. Dickens went a long way to get into the mind of his narrator, and it works beautifully, as we struggle with Pip in every decision and look back with him at the bad decisions that he made. The themes of the novel (pride, isolation, friendship, hopeless love, etc.) can easily be translated into our own society, putting ourselves in the shoes of the characters as we deal with our mistakes and try to do the right thing. A very amazing book."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"There is no doubt that Charles Dickens' \\"Great Expectations\\" is a masterpiece. The intricacy of its plot has rarely been matched. Its characters are unforgettable. It speaks powerfully to what it means to be human.Pip is the perfect picture of flawed humanity. He is essentially well meaning, but his vision always seems to get cloudy at just the wrong time. Throughout the book, Pip falls prey to his dreams and infatuations. In the process he ignores those who truly love him. Only in the end does he learn, in catastrophic terms, the importance of love. Only then is able to accept it.\\"Great Expectations\\" is the story of Pip's learning process. Along the way we encounter some of Dickens greatest secondary characters: the fierce Mr. Jaggers, the self-centered and mentally unstable Mrs. Havisham and her heartless prodigy Estella, and Pip's great friend Joe.I give a special recommendation to this Bantam Classic edition of the work. Its introduction by John Irving is one of the greatest pieces of criticism ever written.Though not my favorite Dickens novel, I give \\"Great Expectations\\" a heartfelt recommendation."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great Expectations succeeds beyond almost all novels of its time in exploring the roots of character and moral behavior. Charles Dickens makes the case for there being the potential for good in everyone. Evil and sin follow from a combination of being self-absorbed and selfish. What is remarkable about the way these themes are handled is that they are clearly based on an assessment of human psychology, long before that field was established.The book is also remarkable for its many indelibly memorable and complex characters. Miss Havisham, Pip, Magwitch, Mr. Jaggers, and Estella are characters you will think about again and again in years to come.The book also surrounds you with a powerful sense of place. Although the England described here is long gone, it becomes as immediate as a nightmare or a dream that you have just awakened from.For a book about moral questions, Great Expectations also abounds in action. The scenes involving Pip and Magwitch are especially notable for way action expresses character and thought.Great Expectations also reeks of irony, something that is seldom noticed in more modern novels. Overstatements are created to draw the irony out into the open, where it is unmistakable. Yet the overstatements attract, rather than repel. The overstatements are like the theatrical make up which makes actors and actresses look strange in the dressing room, but more real on the stage when seen from the audience.At the same time, the plot is deliciously complex in establishing and solving mysteries before that genre had been born. As you read Great Expectations, raise your expectations to assume that you will receive answers to any dangling details. By reading the book this way, you will appreciate the craft that Mr. Dickens employed much more.This is the third time that I have read Great Expectations over the last 40 years. I found the third reading to be by far the most rewarding. If you like the book, I encourage you to read it again in the future as well. You will find that the passage of time will change your perspective so that more nooks and crannies of the story will reveal themselves to you.If this is to be your first reading of the book, do be patient with the book's middle third. It may seem to you that the book is drifting off into a sleep-inducing torpor. Yet, important foundations are being lain for your eventual delight.Mr. Dickens wrote two endings for Great Expectations. Be sure to read both of them. Which one do you prefer? I find myself changing my mind.Give love with an open heart, without expectations!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"All right. I admit it. The book starts out slow. Dickens, though I love the man, writes in such flowery and long winded language at times. What takes many authors a line or two, Dickens will devote whole pages.And I almost put the book down for that exact reason. I'm very happy I did not.With so many detailed threads in the story, the depth to the characters--when they all start to blend together a few chapters in, the result is page-turning.The story centers around a young boy--well, almost young man-- named Pip, and revolves around his growing into age. You cannot help but love the boy. Much of Pip's worry and concern I could relate to--falling in love with a girl who refuses to return your sentiments and only plays with your heart, growing up and leaving home for the first time, and discovering your true relationships with others and yourself, as shocking as they may turn out to be.I felt as if I was side by side with Pip through it all, and that made the novel a wonderful experience for me. I recommend the novel for the young because so much relates to them, and also for the older readers--because you can experience it all again.A wonderful and heart warming tale. Just get through those first chapters.The book is timeless, with the basic story line being one that has affected almost everyone sometime in their life; falling in love with somebody who does not return the feelings. Pip, the main character, falls in love with an exotic and beautiful girl, Estella, but of course she does not have any feelings for him. So Pip does everything he can to win her approval, and most importantly her heart. It is hard to skip around in the book. While some passages might seem as if they have nothing to do with the story, they do. Everything in the story is tied together somehow. Skimming the book is not going to help. Certain events and people the reader thinks are insignificant or forgot completley, will appear over and over throughout the book. I am glad that i decided to read Great Expectations, despite the negative remarks from peers. I found out that most of them never made it past the first few chapters, so they missed out on the good parts. The only reason I did not give the book a higher score is that parts of it are slow and dry, but stick with it, you will not be upset. --This text refers to the Mass Market Paperback edition."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Dickens, for whatever reason, never crossed my path in high school, and in the years since I have found myself intimidated to pick up one of his books. This year I resolved to get over that and selected 'Great Expectations' to be my first venture into Dickens' famous fictional worlds. And what joy! As it turns out I had no reason to be intimidated because Dickens is imminently readable and highly enjoyable.This novel is told from the point of view of Philip Pirrip, nicknamed Pip, who begins his tale as a young boy visiting the graves of his parents when an escaped convict happens upon him and threatens him into helping him get food. This experience will have a huge impact on Pip's life, although just how huge is left to be discovered until much later in the novel. Pip soon finds himself in the service of an eccentrically, manically wounded old woman and her beautiful but cold-hearted charge Estella, whom Pip is doomed to fall for and spend the rest of his days pining for. He begins to feel oppressed by his poor life, anguished that his miserable situation will never be good enough to win Estella's heart. And so it seems to be a blessing when a mysterious benefactor takes Pip away from his home to make a gentleman of him in London. Certainly Pip is pleased to have been \\"rescued\\", but over the course of his teaching a curious thing happens to him: he begins to lose the humanity that had made him such an upstanding young man in the first place. He forsakes relations with his loving family, judges his best friend as a great guy doomed to failure, and slowly allows his finances to spin out of control as he begins to spend more and more of his unnamed benefactor's money.'Great Expectations' is, ultimately, a journey of self discovery. Pip rises in society and leaves his life behind him without realizing just how much it had been worth to him. When he reflects on all that has happened to him and wonders if the inaptitude he had sensed in his friend \\"had never been in him at all, but had been in me,\\" it is a thoughtful discovery that really makes you think about what is truly important in your own life. What makes someone a success? Is it the amount of money in their bank account? Or is it the friendships they forge? Does someone need to be educated to be happy, or can they just be satisfied with what they have? Dickens pulls you along through Pip's story with a great deal of wit and a dash of cynicism that, refreshingly, serves to enlighten the reader rather than depress them. It is an intelligent and heartfelt novel that has become a classic for all of the right reasons, and is one that remains relevant to modern readers -- the true test of a classic, in my opinion. As for myself, I have been thoroughly enchanted by my first experience with Dickens, and look forward to reading many more of his books in the coming year."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great Expectations was my first book by Charles Dickens, and I still believe it to be my favorite. It is a very powerful book that connects with people's lives all over. The main character,Pip, grows up in the home of a blacksmith. With both of his parents dead, he lives with his overreactive sister and her husband, Joe Gargery. Pip soon meets Miss Havisham and the beautiful Estella that lives with her. He longs to be a gentleman, but the social class division leaves Pip a blacksmith apprentice, and Estella a lady. However, one night, Mr. Jaggers (a lawyer)comes to Pip and informs him that he is a man of great expectations. Pip has no idea of who his benefactor is, but heads to London to start his eventful life as a gentleman.Great Expectations is a amazing book in many ways. Three of these ways are: the themes, the characters, and the writing. Themes in this book are very important. They can easily relate to us today, and these main ideas are crucial lessons through literature. Next, the characters. Dickens creates such perfect characters that they will stay in your mind and you will begin to link people you know to people in the book. Such characters include Miss Havisham, Joe Gargery, Mr. Jaggers, Magwitch, Herbert Pocket, and many others. These people in Great Expectations make the book enjoyable to read. Lastly, the writing is awesome. Sentences are easily read, and the suspense keeps you reading from cover to cover.Great Expectations will always be one of my favorite books, and I strongly recommend it to anyone who is looking for a challenge, and a excellent read."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"An outstanding book that I read this year was Great Expectations. This was a wonderful classic written by the magnificent author Charles Dickens. Charles Dickens wrote a book that truly captivated the power of human love. He showed us that life can be very difficult, and you have to work very hard in order for you to succeed.In the beginning of the book, a character named Pip lived on a forge near some marshes in England. His family was generally poor. He lived with his older sister and her husband named Joe. Joe was a fairly poor blacksmith. One day, Pip was walking on the marshes. Suddenly, a strange man came up to Pip and threatened him. The strange man was a convict who was put to die on the marshes. He was handcuffed and chained. He told Pip that he would kill him if he didn't bring him a steel file and something to eat. Pip then ran back to the forge and brought the convict a steel file and some food. This vivid occurrence haunted Pip for the rest of his life.After the incident on the marshes, Pip met a lady named Miss Havesham. Miss Havesham was a very weird lady. She always wore her wedding dress in her house. She never left her house. Miss Havesham had a very beautiful adopted daughter named Estella. She was an arrogant woman. While looking at her, Pip fell in love with Estella.One day, a mysterious man came to Joe's forge. This man was sent by a secret benefactor who was residing in London. The man didn't give his name. He told Pip and Joe that someone in London was requesting him. The secret benefactor wanted Pip to come to London so that he could become a gentleman. Pip was very excited when he heard that he could work in London. Pip and Joe agreed upon the proposal. Later in that same week, Pip left Joe's forge to travel to London. There he could be a gentleman with a bright and bold future.While in London, Pip encountered many strange mysteries. Pip finally met his secret benefactor. Read the book to find out who the secret benefactor was...Overall, Great Expectations was an outstanding book. It really captivated the vast stretches of life. Great Expectations really made me feel quite sad. I felt very sorry for Pip. He had a very difficult life. He had change his personality forever once he became a gentleman. I would recommend this book to anybody who enjoys reading classics. I have read other excellent books by the wonderful author Charles Dickens. I have read Oliver Twist and The Christmas Carol. They were also excellent books."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I am 15 and reading is my least favorite thing to do. If I ever read, it's only for a few minutes. Not with this book, I read it all day, and so far have read it several times. I don't know about this edition however, b/c it is for younger readers. I am also sure that whatever edition you get will be great. This book shows tons of emotions, and is guided by the narrator, Pip. It is a superb book, that once you pick up you will never put down.Pip is raised by his sister and brother-in-law, both named Joe, b/c of his parents being dead. Pip has many scary and shocking experiences throughout this novel. It really shows how much Pip changes throughout the novel, from being poor to being a gentlemen, and at last realizing what really matters.Pip is an interesting and exciting character, who really makes the best of this book!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"How nice to reread an old classic as an adult, instead of in the classroom. A wonderful novel of Pip who comes into his \\"great expectations\\" via an unknown benefactor -- who he believes to be Miss Havisham. We see how the influence of money and position affect Pip's relations with his family and former neighbors, and not necessarily for the better. There are lots of surprise twists and turns in the plot, especially about Miss Havisham and her adopted \\"daughter\\" Estella and her true parentage.As always, a Dickens novel is peopled with wonderful and unusual characters that eventually all play a part in telling the story. I noticed another reviewer said there were two endings. The version I read had only one ending and I don't know which one it was. I will have to search out another version to see which I liked best."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"First of all (as I like to say!) I'm no smarter than you and I thought this book was great, that said, this book is not THE easiest to read in that it does take a while for things to get really interesting.

Popular modern fiction is so often shallow, and as such seems a waste of time. Which is why I read Great Expectations, it has stood the test of time. I never read it in the past because I assumed that the prose would be somewhat archaic and difficult, but I was wrong, I found it very readable and surprisingly funny, which I also didn't expect. The funniest bits in my opinion are Pips first meeting with Miss Havisham and later his discription of his proceedure for doing his personal accounting, which I certainly identified with."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I did not want this to end!

And you absolutely forget that it is all one person reading. The wonderful descriptors Dickens so artfully paints in complete portraits and scenery with words, flow effortlessly, almost musically so that the it unfolds in the listeners mind as sure as one were reading Dickens' words. I found myself taking the long routes home as I listened in the car on commutes. I would be pleased to purchase any other set read by Michael Page, particularly from this period. Now if we could just get Page to record any of Wilkie Collins' work..."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"\\"Great Expectations\\" is a thoroughly engaging novel. We find a set of interweaving story lines that rival today's best movies ('Crash' comes to mind. Sorry! I digress, already.) Anyway, as usual, the protagonist and narrator, Pip, bears all the innocense of Dickens' best characters. He is able to observe all the qualities and idiosyncracies of the good, the bad, and the ugly in Victorian England. As another orphan character, he is \\"brought up by hand\\" by his strict and nasty sister with the help of his brother-in-law, Joe Gargery, a benevolent blacksmith. The plot moves quickly as he comes upon an escaped convict who coerces him to get him food and a file. He finds the experience all too much, for he is in a no-win situation. He manages to escape this escapade with grace, but not the situation his sister places him into. She forces him upon the company of Miss Havisham, an old, bitter woman who has never recovered from being jilted early in life. Through her he meets a young woman, named Estella, and falls hopelessly in love. Through Havisham's patronage, he becomes an apprenticed gentleman as well as Joe's apprenticed blacksmith; then he obtains wealth from a mysterious benefactor. From these experiences, he acquires a gentleman's demeanor as well as a gentleman's appetite for money.\\"Great Expectations\\" is a worthy classic book experience. The characters are drawn well, especially Miss Havisham. (The images Dickens uses for her and her surroundings are among the most memorable of the novel.) It defines what true wealth is, and juxtaposes well the pompous and the hypocritical characters with the genuine and good. 'Great Expectations' demonstrates, more than it preaches, about the virtues presented. Also, the plot lines run together in a way that is so skillful, it hardly seems contrived. There is also some good irony and suspense thrown in for good measure. \\"Great Expectations\\" is a decent and enjoyable reading voyage."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great Expectations by Charles Dickens is a timeless 19th century novel that addresses issues in life that remain relevant today. In particular, it explores the modern individual's personal development through experiences that span from youth to adulthood.In Great Expectations, Dickens employs several techniques to effectively portray the personal development of the main character Pip. The title, Great Expectations, is significant because it reveals that the plot focuses on Pip's aspirations in life. The novel is a first person narrative, with an older Pip retelling and commenting on past events that had an influence on his social development. This element allows the reader to observe how a young Pip reacted to events in his life and how an older and more mature Pip interprets these events years later. A recurring theme throughout Great Expectations is the class system of Victorian England and the significance of social status. Pip struggles with the issue of social status throughout the novel and must come to the realization that social status is not connected to one's real character.In his novel Great Expectations, Charles Dickens combined aspects of his own life, with his knowledge of human behavior, to create a realistic portrayal of an individual's personal development. The novel's portrayal is so clear and its content so relevant that it continues to be read and analyzed over a century after it was first written."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"As young men and women, at some we must make the choice to stay in the community and be a humble fish in a little pond or strike out on our own in the big city.There are many ways to do this and Pip, the main character, does it scornfully although he does not know it at the time. Like so many people, he is lured by the bright lights, \\"sophisticated\\" culture and big money of the big city. He has no problem leaving behind a simple world where he is cared for via an unknown benefactor for an unknown reason. He guesses at whom the benefactor might be and what their intent is, but he gets it all wrong. He falls from the path of moral righteousness and has no idea what his life really means. Dickens masterfully crafts together this story. I think that Joe represented good Pip and Orlick was the alter ego. Additionally, I was kicking myself for not seeing a couple of plot twists, but I was so engrossed that I didn't see them coming. I hope the same thing happens to you.I wonder if F.S. Fitzgerald was influenced by Dickens because there is a fantasy like worship of the rich, followed by a downward spiraling degradation. Although F.S.F writes about the rich with outright contempt, Dickens neutrally accepts them more as a vehicle for the story.Anyway, I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Charles Dickens' novel Great Expectations explores the side of human nature that many do not like to read in novels. In the United States, in the 21st Century, people would rather read about romantic-style plots where all turns out well for the protagonists. Dickens, however, chooses to illuminate what man can really be capable of: betrayal, duplicity, unfaithfulness, and a handful of other negative characteristics.Definitely an interesting novel, Great Expectations will undoubtedly have its audience intrigued and constantly pondering.I would highly recommend this masterpiece."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Unlike many of the reviewers who wrote so passionately about this work it is not a book that has played a significant part in my reading life. The great narrative drive, the tremendous skill in creating vital characters, the richly descriptive and often ironic language are aspects of Dickens genius.But somehow the world of Dickens dark and gloomy and Victorian and so British reality never really appealed to me. This says nothing however about the quality of the work and its great gifts to the reader. The book is the portrayal of a society, and of a moral education. This is a book about the formation of a character through experience, about learning from life's difficulties and disappointments to become a better person. It is about ' recognition' not only of one's own true and better self, but about what is important in life. This book as Dickens himself has had enormous influence on Western literature. I think of two very different writers, Kafka and Salinger both of whom clearly had Dickens in mind in certain points of their writing. Pip, Magwitch , Joe Gargary,Miss Havisham, Estella are living characters in the heart of Western literature. The book then I believe is far greater, far more than my own reading has given me of it. Not always apparently does the reader do justice to the work."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"i was a assigned this book to read over the summer between 8th and 9th grade for my honors english (it seems as though many students are assigned this book going into 9th grade honors english. is it some sort of nation-wide standard?)... at parts the language can be thick and a little harder to decipher than most the language of most authors people my age are used to reading... this is only a slight hindrance, though, because about half way trhough the book (assuming this is your first dickens book, as it was for me) you get used to it and you seem to be talking like pip in real life!!!!!!!

Eventually, apprenticed to Joe Gargery, blacksmith, he comes into a fortune, and is convinced his benefactor is Miss Havisham, intending him to become a gentleman so he can marry Estella. Miss Havisham's intentions for Estella, of course, differ markedly from this. Dickens includes a rich cast of characters: the guilty and regretful Pip; the cold and cruel Estella; the warm Herbert and Clara; the kind-hearted and faithful Joe and Biddy; the capable Jaggers; the split-personality Wemmick; the nasty Orlick; the single-minded Magwitch. Great Expectations is a much easier and funnier read than the only other Dickens book I can remember reading, and this books immediate predecessor, A Tale of Two Cities, and I noted the echo of the knitting women at the gallows in Estella's actions.

In my opinion, GE is a glorious (not glorified) soap opera chronicling the wildly fluctuating vicissitudes of Philip Pirrip's (Pip's) eventful life, from an orphaned, tormented child apprenticed to genial blacksmith Joe to, by a turn of ironic fate, a wealthy \\"gentleman\\" of leisure. As been often noted, Dickens created worlds, if not universes, in his novels, and GE is certainly no exception. In this review, I will try to avoid detailing the plot, which is already well-known. Instead, I will comment upon Dickens's use of backstory and flashback to flesh out most of the major characters in the novel.Even the most colorful, flamboyant characters in GE are not one-dimensional or stereotypically good or evil. We learn how Miss Havisham's marital jilting by Arthur compelled her to become a spectral recluse in her gloomy estate. We learn how Miss Havisham's misanthropic upbringing caused her frosty ward Estella (whose name suggests a blazing but distant star) to become an inaccessible man-hater. We learn how Magwitch, Pip's surprising benefactor, became a convict through cynical ad hominem prosecution in the barbaric English court system, was transported to the penal colony that was Australia, and how he acquired the money through hardship just to help the orphan Pip, who showed him mercy at the graveyard, and why he risked arrest in London to see his gentleman. We learn that Estella's mother, servant to Mr. Jaggers the lawyer, was convicted of murder but saved, after a fashion, by the lawyer and how she had to sacrifice her daughter so that she could become a lady. We even learn about the somewhat schizophrenic Wemmick, Jagger's clerk, who is sullen and joyless at work but positively animated and exuberant when he is at home (The Castle) with his elderly invalid father The Aged. Through these backstories, we find out that no Dickensian character is ultimately utterly despicable, or demonic, or flawless, or saintly. They are all achingly human, trying to live life the best they can.Since GE is primarily about the growth and development of Pip, we witness his human complexity most of all. In a paraphrase of a comment made by his friend Herbert, Pip is intelligent and naive, curious and hesitant, loyal and perfidious, snobbish but introspective, a false gentleman (through wealth) and a true gentleman (through re-discovered contrition, feeling, and love). Dickens's revelation of the humanity that still lurks in the most wretched of us is encapsulated nicely by Pip's caretaker and brother-in-law, the brawny but forgiving Joe, who says about his abusive father, \\"Whatsumever the failings on his part, dear reader, remember that he was that good in his heart\\". This noble, some may say Christian, sentiment, elevates GE beyond its busy, coincidental melodramatic soap opera plottings and trains its sharp focus on the multifaceted levels of the human condition."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Compared to other Dickens' books I have read, this one is the most bizarre and strange story, and it took a little bit of adjustment to get into it. But it didn't take long to lose myself in the magical, grand drama by this literary wizard. As usual, this book has rich background materials, the marshes, deprivation, violence, mysterious and dark past, turns and twists, surprises and over the top coincidences, vengence and forgiveness...The first person perspective by the protagonist is candid and often humorous as well as insightful about the conflict and frustration of an underprevileged person with aspirations in the society where status of a person is not very mobile.

Brought back so many childhood memories and thrills !! Worth reading over and over !"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I enjoyed reading this novel mostly because of the rich text and language Dickens used to display the imagery. Dickens wrote this piece in such detail that allows the audience to fully engage in the text, relate to Pip and his struggles, and bring a deeper thought to the way we treat our individual social statuses. As citizens of the United States, we are obligated to work our way to \\"the top of the food chain\\". The majority of the time, we are not given a high status, by blood or other means, to build a superior reputation for ourselves. Therefore we must have the will and determination to make our personal goals become reality. In Great Expectations, Pip's struggles and adventures are great examples of how the audience can relate to the story line and setting throughout the novel to our own personal lives.I thought that Dickens' creatively demonstrated that an individual's social status is not what determines the rights of respect and standards on a person's character. The ability to prove our greater meaning in this world is not something that the government can label us on. As humans, we have the right to make mistakes and errors in life, but out of the morals and standards in which we uphold allow us to make those mistakes result in a learning experiences. Pip strives to become a better man throughout the novel for various reasons. However, Great Expectations allows us to see the connection between the book and real life. In both situations there are/ will be countless obstacles getting in the way of ambitions we set. When Pip decides to leave Joe behind and pursuit his ambitions of becoming a true gentleman he made a decision, much like Dickens himself, to benefit his own life. With any decision there must be great responciblity and will.Personally, I strongly believe that anyone can improve their well-being within a reasonable manner. Only with dedication and support from relatives or friends can one truly achieve their goal. Sometimes our goals don't have the exact result we wished for, but we should be grateful for what we have and work hard for what we want to improve. What I have learned from this book is that no matter what your status is in school, work, at home, or in society as a whole, we all have the ability to make something greater of ourselves. Each individual has the capability to achieve all of ambitions in life we wish to imagine."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"If you're like me, you were forced to read some Dickens in High School and found him to be pedantic and to sound archaic. What a pleasure it is to read him now. GE gives you a terrific story, wonderful use of language and insight into the lifestyle and prejudices of Victorian England. Unlike Jane Austen, this one works for the mature male reader. At this low price, it's a must read. Go for it."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"A pleasure to read. I am really enjoying it To be cliched, it is a classic and I would reccomend it to anyone. Great characters, some mystery, humour and emotion."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This is the first Dickens book I've read and I enjoyed it very much - have just bought more of his novels. The few illustrations in this version are lovely and do really add to the pleasure of reading this book.This version has both endings (the one 'official' that Dickens added after the fact once a friend pointed out that the original ending was to dismal and the 'original' ending). I tend to prefer the original ending, but you would have to read the book to see for yourself...Would really recommend reading this book!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Well written and the drawings are wonderful. The story itself is well written and put in a time period which was a difficult time for children who didn't have much finances or many options to obtain employment they would enjoy. the thoughts through the boys eyes are amazing after all the situations he gets into. even a little trouble could be a really big deal back then."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Can't believe I had never read this, not even seen a movie based onthis book! How shocking. I had no good excuse not to get it, as it was freefor Kindle at the time.

This is not really a romance, though there isa complicated love in the main character's life. This book reminds me of the broodingclassics like Heathcliff.

I enjoyed getting the feel of what it was like in the old days of Britain."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I am making my way through Charles Dickens...not in any particular order...the first few I've picked are mostly familiar through TV or film adaptations that I've enjoyed and/or on the recommendations of friends.\\"Bleak House\\" was my first read, finished last month. \\"Great Expectations\\" is my second read.What can I say? I am just so enamored with Dickens's story-telling and character development that I have a fear that when I am done reading his canon I'll have to declare a 13-way tie for first place. We'll see.Between Bleak House and Great Expectations I *almost have a two-way tie for first place, in no small part because they are such different types of books...Bleak House was a universe of characters and subplots; Great Expectations fewer characters and not as much intrigue, although the last 1/4 to 1/3 of the book is riveting. And some good comedy also.But I am going to put GE at #1 and BH at #2...while I loved Bleak House as I read it, and have a few favorite characters, \\"Great Expectations\\" will *stay with me* much much longer I think...Bleak House is brilliant (really brilliant) for its commentary on the period and for its settings and for its intricacies; Great Expectations is brilliant because it is simple and timeless.I'm not nearly vain or clever enough to think I'm the first to recognize this, but three neat things about Great Expectations are: 1) it's a novel which illustrates the old warning \\"Be Careful What You Wish For...\\", 2) it is the complete opposite of \\"Catcher in the Rye\\" - an earnest, non-cynical first-person narrator who meets so much kindness along the way, and fewer \\"phonies\\" (although there are a few), and 3) it's such a personal novel that anyone who dares wonder what they could possibly learn about human nature by reading such an \\"old\\" book NEEDS to read it for that very reason.The characters are just so memorable...if I had to pick a favorite, I think it would be Wemmick...you probably work with him and don't even know it: he's the man (or woman) who is competent at work, works for an insufferable boss, and has a completely different home life than work life. His care of \\"The Aged\\" is a remarkable example for any of us in caring for our parents.The love stories are also very touching - especially the ones that turn out for the best...but no spoilers in this review.And the story of Pip's unrequited love is so true to life...and although I think it would have been worse for Pip to lose Estella had she been more than just beautiful outside but also beautiful inside, Dickens wrote beautifully and agonizingly of the highs and lows associated with unrequited love as only one who has experienced it can truly identify. One of the worst and most painful aspects is not the fact that you aren;t chosen but that they chose *that* person. And all you can think is: anybody...anybody but *them*.A memorable book and must reading.Now on to another Dickens novel! :-)"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"It is one of the magnificent books in history that everyone should have. Thats why I decided to have this one. It is Dickens at its best. :)"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"It is one the novels I love most. I love it very much! Wish Amzaon provide frequently this kind of excellent novels by free."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Contentment in life is a struggle; in \\"Great Expectations,\\" by Charles Dickens, a young boy is faced with disappointed expectations of ambition and desire for social self-improvement. Set in the mid-nineteenth century in Kent and London, England, social class is portrayed as utmost importance. For young orphaned Philip Pirrip-Pipp- life is a struggle of realization of the real world and place in life as well as culture. Through traumatic events, mishaps and altered expectations to the truth, Pipp learns that social improvement is irrelevant to one's real worth.The reoccurring motif in, \\"Great Expectations,\\" is in direct relation to the major them of self-improvement through social class. Through characters, places, and infatuations, this motif is prominent. Miss. Havisham, Estella, the Satis House, and Bently Drummle all introduce different levels and perceptions of social class of the 1800's. Bentley Drummle represents the grotesque side of high class, Miss. Havisham and Estella are the quintessence of the highly educated, lavish and greatly respected side of the upper class, and the Satis House is merely the embodiment of the riches young Pipp adores and idolizes. Each character not only adds to Pipp's life long obsession of social well being, but life lessons learned in his battle for fulfillment."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Charles Dickens was one of the most popular writers of all time, creating some of the best-known characters in English literature. In the book \\"Great Expectations\\", the protagonist and narrator, Pip begins the story as a young orphan boy being grown up by his sister. I like this book, because Charles Dickens takes you right inside the Pip's mind and you live through the events and discoveries of his life with him. Pip is passionate, romantic and somewhat unrealistic at heart. That makes the novel interesting. Of course, you cannot forget the great love story (Pip and Estella). The other characters Magwitch, Miss Havisham, Joe Gargery, Miss Joe, Estella, Mr Jaggers and Mr Wemmick are all unique and special in their way and they add to the novel's richness. Another thing I really liked was how all of the characters are interrelated to each other in ways that you may not discover until you get to the end of the novel. This novel will make you sometimes laugh and sometimes make you feel sad, but it is always entertaining. Latif Dose simplifies the texts. The language is very clear. There are not old English words and this gives the reader much pleasure while reading the novel. I think most young people would like this novel because it's not as hard to read as an other classic books. I recommend Great Expectations to anyone who wants to read a good, classic book because Great Expectations has a little bit of everything in it, mystery, romance and suspense. You cannot easily find all of these properties in other novels, which makes &quot;Great Expectations&quot; a special and a classic one.. That makes this novel very different. It is probably one of the top ten English novels of the 19th century. Some of the passages are beautiful. I cannot forget Pip's response to Estella when she says \\"You will get me out of thoughts in a week.\\""},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"There is really no need to recount the plot of this classic - I think most people who are thinking about reading it already know it is a story of poor boy done good and has wrong assumptions about how he comes about it. But despite the storyline being well-worn, there is till so much to get from this story. What comes across most clearly is the theme that nothing comes without strings-attached - Pip's great fortune, that at first looked like manna from on high, turns out to cause more trouble than it is worth.Dickens is a joy to read - his description is masterful, and his ability to paint pictures of his eccentric characters is unsurpassed - the contrasts between the charming Mr Wemmick and the slimy Mr Jaggers; the amazing Miss Havisham; the self important Pumblechook (who I could not stand! Is there any character in literature so annoyingly self-deluded?). My absolute favourite is Joe - his convoluted ways of attempting to pass information onto Pip, his attempts to spare Pip from his evil sister and his localised venacular. The only disappointing characters are the two main ones - Pip comes across as insipid, uninspiring, and frankly undeserving of the fortune that he falls into. Estella is so sketchily drawn that you never get any feel for her, and I think that given how much complexity Dickens manages for some of the minor characters, he could have afforded more to Estella.However, this is a great read. Don't read it just because you fell you \`have to read a classic' - read it because it is a well written story with the right balance of humour and pathos."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I don't think I'd be giving away much of the plot if I were to say that the story revolves around Pip, a young, middle class orphan who has dreams to be a wealthy, respected gentleman, but has no hope of this as he is a rural blacksmith apprentice. His prospecs change, however, when a mysterious, anonymous benefactor offers to make Pip's dream a reality. I won't give away the ending, but the novel supports Dickens' belief that the middle class is the class to which people should aspire.The plot of this story wasn't to my liking. Dickens' attempts towards the end to wrap all the subplots into one neat little package annoyed me...similar to plot twists in modern Hollywood movies--things so outrageously convienent that it makes one want to roll his eyes. The manner in which things are written, however is fantastic. While the main characters are rather boring, the minor characters, (especially Biddy, Herbert Pocket, and John Wemmick) were much more interesting. Thankfully, Dickens focused on them enough to flesh them out and make them memorable. I would recommend this book, not because I enjoy the plot, but because the writing style is superior and because I, being lower middle class, enjoyed the positive viewpoint Dickens extended concerning my class."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"What have I missed all these years? I'm ashamed to admit that this is the first Charles Dickens' I've read and I'm 40! Heavens forbid! Don't make the same mistake.......read this book now!I've spent the past week being thoroughly entertained by Pip! No wonder Dickens' is considered such a great writer....this book will have you laughing out loud, and being inspired by the incredible depth of understanding Dickens has for the human condition at all levels of society.....and he manages to do so while weaving a story about one young boy's transformation and maturation...and the tradeoffs for every choice in life.Once you pick this book up, you won't want to put it down until you finish. It's that good!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Dickens, along with Dostoevsky, stands atop my list of novelists who could most accurately portray the subtleties of human emotion and passion. &quot;Great Expectations&quot; is simply a masterpiece of 19th-century fiction, and is pure Dickens. In this semi-autobiographical work (a trademark of Dickens' writings), the life of a poor young boy, Pip, is followed from his humble beginnings to his rise into the middle-class, due to the mysterious aid of an unknown benefactor. His pursuit of Estella, a beautiful young girl raised to break the hearts of men by her jilted caretaker, Ms. Havisham, is a classic of literature that has been repeated countless times since. The tragic, gradual break between Pip and his family (particularly the humble but caring Joe) is heartwrenching. Pip's eventual realization of the insincerity of the middle class, and his love for Joe, brought tears to my eyes.&quot;Great Expectations&quot; is a wonderful, moving book that has been copied and satired again and again, from Mishima's &quot;Forbidden Colors&quot; to South Park. An important and unforgettable novel!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"A great story about a young man who has lost his mother and father and is being raised by only his older sister, Charles Dickens' &quot;Great Expectations&quot; is a story of diversity, poverty, and growing up.

As Pip grows up, he must strive to understand what is going on, and why it is going on.The book is very long and almost covers Pip's entire life. The book is enriched with humor that we can all relate to. Short episodes make up the majority of the book.

And even I have to appreciate this classic. Charles Dickens knew what he was doing, okay? Great Expectations is a classic, and there's a reason it's a classic. For the plain and simple fact it was well written, with an interesting plot and a good twist. Just because something doesn't contain profanity, sex and violence doesn't mean it should be presumed boring. A basic summary - it tells the story of life, obsessions and social status. As far as I'm concerned, it isn't boring. Just wake up to yourselves, teenage world. Virginia Andrews isn't the extent of reading pleasure."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I find myself surprised at the comments provided by earlier reviewers. One critic gave &quot;Great Expectations&quot; one star because he/she failed a test. Why should Dickens be blamed for that? Another said there was no structure (in a Dickens novel???). Another, that there was &quot;little direction and less power.&quot; That there was no theme and no plot. Perhaps I am seeing things that aren't there but, whatever the shortcomings are, it is not in plot, themes, or characterization. It is the story of the orphan Philip Pirrip, known to everyone as Pip, from the age of about seven to the age of twenty-three, with a brief section at the end that takes place about eleven years later. Pip is being brought up \\"by hand\\" by his loud and quarrelsome sister and her kind and quiet husband, the blacksmith Joe Gargery. Young Pip is soon asked to serve in the home of Miss Havisham, who appears to be half mad since the day, years earlier, when she had been left at the alter by her old lover. Miss Havisham is raising a young girl named Estella to be heartless in her treatment of men when she grows up as a form of revenge against all men. And, Pip naturally falls in love with her. After a few years, Pip finds himself wealthy due to some unknown benefactor (who he mistakenly thinks is Miss Havisham and who he also believes has planned to have Estella marry him when they are older) and he now has \\"great expectations\\" made of him. He plans to become a gentleman and he leaves the kind and devoted Joe to live in London, Pip hoping to leave behind his humble past of which he now feels ashamed. After a few more years, he discovers that his unknown benefactor was Abel Magwitch whom he had helped when he was seven. Magwitch had been convicted and deported to Australia where he became a wealthy sheepman. Even though Magwitch was forbidden to return to England, he does so just to see the young man he had been helping to become a gentleman. Through problems with the law trying to arrest Magwitch, problems with Magwitch's past, the loss of the fortune and of Pip's great expectations, and through illness, Pip discovers the basic goodness in Joe, the devotion of Magwitch and of Pip's close friend Herbert Pocket, and what really is important. He discovers the value of family and of close friends and confidants. Estelle, who had married a cruel oaf, also learns her lessons and finds that she may have a heart as well (in the more common of the two endings of the novel). This is a great novel."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This book could have made a wonderful short story, but as a full length novel it lacks both and entertaining plot and characters that one can truly empathize with."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"the book was ok but i didn't like it that much so, yeah"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"i had to read this in my freshmen english class. i found the chracters of estelle and pip to be profound and astounding. you can't help but love ms.havisham and her antics. great book for any teen 13-17."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"i had to read this book for freshman honors. it drags a lot, but it has it's moments. the story was unpredictable and the characters were well described.

They are going back to the classics. I never received the Great Expectations.The computer said it was sent but never showed up on my Kindle.

I took us the whole second semester to finsh this book, doing most of the reading at home. While most everyone was engrossed in the storyline, it was like pulling teeth to actually read! I really enjoyed the story, but I would raher just remember the story than refresh my memory by rereading it because, face it, the story is just too long!P.S.Since I feel this is such a great story, instead of reading the book, might I recommend watching the movie?"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"In the first twenty or thirty pages, I was pleasantly surprised by Dickens's humor and had great expectations for his storytelling and prose-writing talent.I mean he is hailed as one of the greatest literary giants of English literature, as well as one of the most popular novelists of his time.But alas, my great expectations were dashed mercilessly, and I found myself - not unlike how Pip finds himself in the last portion of the novel - banging my head against the hard, boundless boredom that permeated the first 300 pages of non-drama, non-action, and non-story whose only saving grace was that it was not endless.In the beginning, Dickens sustains the story with action, and there's nothing wrong with that as it makes the story more engaging. But aside from that in the first interminable and insufferable two stages of \\"Pip's Great Expectations\\" that span exactly 300 pages, I was thoroughly disappointed in Dickens. Other than Pip getting rich all of a sudden, NOTHING happens: no desire, no real conflict, no gaps, no turning points.As far as the story is concerned, the 300 pages is crap.I said it. Don't gasp.The story finally, finally, finally picks up when Pip finds out the identity of his benefactor, goes through rather inexplicable mental ordeals about accepting the truth along with free money and sentimental outbursts with his \\"dear friend\\" Herbert about pretty much everything, followed by an incredibly maudlin confrontation with the guilt-stricken Ms. Havisham and a final showdown with the villainous Orlick into whose clutches Pip idiotically falls with a stupid letter that gives him little reason to risk the whole grand escape plan he and Herbert hatch for the next day.My conclusion: this book is overrated.Why is it that academics pick these boring books that can't tell stories as part of the western canon? I love reading classics, thanks, but THIS?The book displays a glaring lack of storytelling talent, psychological insight, and restraint. His prose is dense, sprawling, and unseemly as sentences are connected by ugly semicolons and don't flow beautifully at all. The scenes are more told than shown to the detriment of the flow of the story, and characters burst out into mawkish sentiments left and right.Yuck.People are irresistibly drawn to anything related to themselves. I have a sneaking suspicion that the academics who bill this book as \\"most fascinating\\" and \\"greatest and most sophisticated work\\" see THEIR prominent characteristic in it.Cloying, verbose, mediocre at best in the story composition, and irresistibly boring for the first 300 pages, it's \\"most fascinating\\" in the perplexing literary status it garnered over the years, \\"greatest\\" in its unnecessary length,and \\"most sophisticated\\" in the exquisite boredom it creates at that threshold pitch that is above sleep-inducing but below engaging.I won't be reading another Dickens in a long time.Read something else and save your time."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I'm a senior in high school and was asked to read this book for my AP English 12 class.

The major themes were the only thing that really helped me understand the book. I really didn&#65533;t like this book very much because I couldn&#65533;t really relate to it, therefore, I couldn&#65533;t understand it. I think that we should have read a book that was more modern and practical."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This is my least favorite book. I was forced to read it for freshman honors English, or I would have stopped reading it. It has a good plot, but because Dickens was paid by the word, he added too many useless details. I really didn't enjoy dinner scenes that lasted for 17,000 chapters without revealing anything remotely important. However, the way the characters intertwined was fascinating. If you want to get the interesting part of the book, read the cliff's notes. I've also heard it's a little less mind-numbing on tape. Only read the book if you're going to be quizzed on it the next day. I don't know if all Dickens is this bad, but I'll not read any more of his books until I'm forced to for my next English class."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great Expectations was not that great of a novel. I found it to be dull and a bit on the boring side. Charles Dickens wrote a novel about a boy who had a hard life, and in the end he was happy....Big Deal!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This book is not a book most people should read. I wouldn't call it horrible but it is intensly boring. Dickens takes a whole chapter to say something anybody could say in a sentence. Im in the eighth grade and am required to read it. At times i dont have a clue wats goin on but i get the basic gist of the story and plot. I only recommend this for reader lovers, highly advanced people in litereture and who can understand something not written in english."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This book was very dull and boring. I was made to read it in English and I soon realized not far in that it was very boring. It's not a good book for highschool readers. It is written in very dull and boring text. I mean the theme is great and all but the language and storyline stinks. I would not ever read this book again and if I had a choice to get this book or nothing i wouldn't get anything. It isn't a book to buy but for some odd reason is still have the one left from school. This book is quite possibly the worst book i ever read. If you are really interested in this book then go see the stupid movie or rent i from the library."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Do not read this book. It is a form of painful torture! If you have to read it for school buy the Cliff Note. Or if your instructor is on to that kind of thing, at least listen to the audio book. At all costs do not read this book! Take it from someone who knows."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"You won't be needing a bookmark with this novel- more like a pillow! I read this my freshman year of high school, maybe I was just too young to understand it and appreciate it, but I could not read the whole thing without falling asleep. After reading half the book, I read the cliff notes and actually found them more interesting than the novel itself. Unless you are suffering from insomnia, I wouldn't buy it."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I had to read GE for my freshmen honors English class, and I thought Lord of the Flies was bad! Dickens takes 1 paragraph to convey an idea that could have been said in 1 sentence! Many of the vocabulary is just out of our time, and take the fun out of the story. Unless you have heaps of time and patience, I recommend that you stay away from this &quot;book&quot;."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"One of the best books I've read to date. Not at all boring unlike many other books of this time period. Can be quite humorous and the plot is masterful. The characters are masterfully portrayed, especially Joe and Pip. It's not even difficult reading! Are the majority of reviewers 16 year-olds that were forced to read it?"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This was a pretty good book. Some parts of it were hard to understand, but most of it was ok."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"An overall enjoyable read. The book is very well written and Charles Dickens has written excellent descriptions. I'm fascinating at the people who come here and rate it low, ah well, they obviously cannot read great literature. If you don't like books like this, go back to your &quot;Star Wars super adventure novels&quot;"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great Expectations By: Charles DickensGreat Expectations is about a boy named Pip who comes into great property and is searching for the benefactor of his fortunes. I didn't care for the ending much because I was thinking something great should happen, but then there's a big let-down. It was hard for me to keep my attention on the book. Everything is explained with such great detail, and half of the things explained don't need to be. If you enjoy reading books that are very detailed, this is the book for you!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This is truly a masterpiece. It is an inspiring tale of a departure from innocence into the cruel realities of the real world. Although not totally enlightening, it is entertaining and leaves one on the edge from chapter to chapter."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"\\"Great Expectations\\" by Charles Dickens is a story of a boy named Pip and his experiences growing up. The story begins with Pip visiting his parents' grave sites. Here he meets a runaway convict and begins a new journey. The convict persuades young Pip to get food and a file for him. Pip does and the convict is thankful, but later is captured and confesses that he alone stole the food. Pip is sent for by Miss Havisham, a middle-aged woman whose whim it is to live in the bridal dress she wore on the day she was jilted by her lover. She hates all males and sends for Pip to enjoy the sight of him being tormented by Estella, a proud, beautiful young girl. Pip falls in love with her. Pip's sister dies before he comes of age, and Pip receives money from an unknown benefactor. During this time he learns about himself, his love for Estalla, and the unknown benefactor. This book is about a young mans life who has a few unique experiences and what he learns.Charles Dickens uses imagry that takes the form of real objects. The detail and words he uses gives more meaning and detailed images. It allows each situation to be clearly seen. The imagery also comes from the analogies and metaphors. It gave the book more life, more meaning. The visualizable images, metaphor and other kinds of figurative language set up great results thought the entire text."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"OK... I know how Dickens is supposed to be this wonderful author, but lets just face it - Its boring! Its not his fault, when he wrote everyone wrote like that, but these days its just too hard to follow.. The plot was really good tho.. almost like an old soap opera, with twists and turns everywhere.. Now if he could have written the same story in 200-300 pages instead of 500, maybe people would enjoy this book more!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great Expectations by Charles Dickens is a great mix of humor, thrills and suspense. You never know what will pop around from the other side of the page. Pip gives us an insight to the way people really are and, what they should be."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This book is great it has many twists and turns and always leaves you thinking. I would definetly recommend this book!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This is worth the time to read. It's actually a bit amusing to see if you can follow the bread-crumb trail and predict what'll happen next. (Usually, you'll be right.) I offer this warning: * Do NOT read the abridged version! * In tightening things up, they usually cut out the best parts."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Read the review from the high school student who thinks he's a martian, and I think you'll agree that most of the bozos who give this novel less than five stars are full of snot."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"You said no one who is still is high school will understand this book. That is not entirely true. I am in seventh grade. I not only loved the book, I understood it too. I have done character analyses (for instance: Bentley Drummle had a troubled childhood) and critisized Pip's character. My mom insists that he's a &quot;loser&quot; - but, then again, she never did have that much insight into character. The poor guy is in love so he can hardly see straight! Anyway, I don't pretend that I'm average, because I'm not. But I enjoyed it and understood it."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"It's just too, too bad that no one reads this anymore. It is a timeless story of a young man (love-stricken from young childhood) growing to adulthood by means of a mysterious benefactor. Mr. Jaggers, John Wemmick, Biddy, Matthew and Belinda Pocket, Bentley Drummle, the Aged Parent, and Miss Skiffins are just a few of the absolutely marvelous characters that Dickens created for his story. And how could I forget Estella Havisham, the object of Pip's (christened Phillip) affection? Mr. and Mrs. Joe get a fair part of the story, and they are both delightful - one, because she is so horrible, and the other, because he is so good. A few of the more minor characters (the aformentioned Miss Skiffins is one) such as Trabbe's boy and The Avenger are superb even though they may only speak a few words. If I could give it ten stars, I would!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This is Dickens' 3rd last novel, and nothing indicates that he was running out of steam. While this lacks (in my opinion) the energy of &quot;Dombey and Son&quot; (1848), &quot;David Copperfield&quot; (1850), &quot;Bleak House&quot; (1853), or &quot;Hard Times&quot; (1854), it is still a phenomenal piece of literature. Pip is an interesting creation. First we see him as a small child who is victimized by his sister. His brother in law Jo (while not too bright) never approves of Pip's abuse. It is interesting that Dickens wrote this troubled marriage scene soon after his own divorce! It is also painfully tragic when Pip starts to make his way into the world and he has to realize that the kind hearted but simple Jo has to take a back seat to his success. Jaggers offers some welcome comical touches. It is interesting that Pip becomes victimized by a legitimate colleague Orlick and as it turns out, the old thief was his benefactor. (In my opinion the old thief was a literary reincarnation of Fagin.) To this day, I have never forgotten the chills when I discovered that the old thief in the early part of the novel was his benefactor. So we have domestic quarrles, true to life tragic events, strong images, comical touches, and surprise events!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I reallly liked this book, though it made me tired to read it and I could not have any distractions while I read, I am really glad I did. This book was a good challenge if you stick to it. The book all comes together at the end if you keep reading. The characters are really deep. My teacher says the best thing about Great Expectations is it has a twisted plot line and the worst thing about Great Expectations is that it has a twisted plot line. Overall, I enjoyed the book, except the last two chapters. I believe Dickens got tired of writing the book and desided to end the book."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This book is superb. Everything about it is very real to life (unlike much of Dickens' other novels). Though it may be hard to comprehend, it doesn't take a genius to understand the themes of this book. I'm not going to spoil it for anybody, but believe me, the themes plays into everybody's life, including love, money, and heritage. I also recommend Catcher in the Rye if you're into the types of books that make you stop and ponder."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I had to read Great Expectetions for school, at first it seemed like the worst book ever written, it was boring, confusing, and seemingly pointless. But, of course that was before I finished it and fully understood what Dickens was tying to convey. the whole book is a mystery, only in the very end do you finally find everything out. Note: if you are going to read the Cliffs Note version of the book (which i highly recommend you do) do not read the character summaries, because that will kill the whole book for you. Believe it or not, this is probabaly the only classial book with enough suspense to compete with the modern thrillers. Oh, and by the way, if you don't have to read it for school, I highly recommend you listen to the audio tape."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Those who have known the whole constitution of true art will assign to its realm Great Expectations. What I say may not convince you of its quintessential nature, but hopefully it will open your mind to possibly the greatest novel of all time."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Those who have known the whole nature of true art will surely assign to its realm Great Expectations. What I say may not convince you, but please, do yourself a favor, and read the book. The Bible, Tolkien's books, and Great Expectations are the greatest I have yet to encounter."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"After having a very diffiult time enjoying A Tale of Two Cities, which I found to be unappealing, austere, and excessively verbose, I was prepared to denounce this book as well. However, it is far too good to heap words like &quot;boring&quot; upon simply because it is long and involved. The autobiographical narration lends it a personal quality far more appealing than that of A Tale of Two Cities, and above all Dicken's empathy for his characters is apparent. The branching subplots weave together seamlessly as the novel progresses (Unlike some people I'm not going to spoil the ending for everyone). Even if you've been turned off by Dicken's before, give it a chance."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"From start to finish, awesome. From the moment I opened it, until I finished, I was entranced. Read it in one sitting. Without a doubt, my favorite book of all time."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"&quot;Great Expectations&quot; as well as other Dickens novels like &quot;Oliver Twist&quot; were written with a purpose. Dickens was so against some of the evils of his time that he had to do something to speak out against them. And he did. He represents in the lives of his characters the thousands of children forced into inhumane working conditions. And that is just one of wrongs he set out to correct. Carefully read, Dickens provides countless details of English life with its evils and triumphs. I have read several of his novels and always find them inspiring as well as educational."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I am not going to bore you with excerpts from the text. But I'll say this, Great Expectations is one of the most compassionate novels a person can read. The complexity of the plot adds a certain greatness which undoubtedly entices the attention of the reader. The story itself teaches us to never give up hope and that our destiny does not depend on our social status; but rather, the quality of our character."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I had to read this book twice: once in the ninth grade and once in college. While I think it is better suited for the college level, I can't say that I found it much more enjoyable the second time. The story revolves around the coming-of-age of Pip, the main character. Raised an orphan, Pip acquires a mysterious benefactor who funds his attempt to become a gentleman. There are some interestingly eccentric characters, and the book relies more on the characters themselves than the plot. However, this is an example of Dickens' wordiness becoming too cumbersome; it simply couldn't maintain my interest throughout the book."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great Expectations is a very interesting book to read, from the beginiing scene with Pip at the graveyard to the touching ending of Pip with Estella, Charles Dickens has described wonderfully the plot and all the characters involved and how they all finally fit into place. A very good book to read ...."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Blantantly predictable, (I mean, you knew old Havisham was going to burn, didn't you?) Clunky plot, inevitable morality tale, and still the most bloody wonderful story ever! I would watch Great Expectations on the big screen, I'd watch the mini-series, I'd pay to see it live on Broadway - and none of that would compare with reading it again."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"My English teacher from my freshman year in high school didn't like this book, but I loved it! I thought Pip was pretty cute when he was a little boy, and I really didn't see any change in him when he became rich like my teacher said. This is a great book, and it's the only book I liked that I ever read in English class along with 'Anthem' and 'Of Mice and Men'. Like most books it goes slow at first, but you get into it more and more. Although I really, really do like this book, I refuse to see the movie which stars Ethan Hawke and Gwenyth Paltrow, because just by looking at the commericals and the pictures from the movie, I could tell that it's not like the book at all and for that, I know that I would hate it. As a matter of fact, my friend told me that it wasn't. So, I refuse to see the movie, but I was able to see an older movie of the book and I liked it, because it was like the book and that's what I like. This is a wonderful book and I wouldn't mind reading it again! A must have for any literature fans who like to sit back, relax, and well...read. : )"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I had to read this book this year for my English class. At first I was interested, when Pip was a child, but I quickly became sick and tired of it's boring nature. I am in the honors program in my school, and we only had about 2 and a half weeks to read it, but it seemed like 2 and a half years. I was disappointed most because this massive plot builds up, and I was waiting for something to happen, but nothing really did. Furthermore, it was a bit hard to understand, especially since my mind was drifting, becuase it is hard to pay attention to this book."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This is definitely one book that I'll read again and again throughout my life. If I had to pick a favorite character, it would probably be Estelle because even though she was cold and distant and VERY conceited, she still had a heart of gold. It was lonely Miss Havisham who made Estelle the cold-hearted person that she was. I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in reading about interesting characters that continue to develop throughout the story."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I've been out of college for awhile. Being away from literature and into the &quot;Real World,&quot; I had almost forgotten what reading a good book is like. I picked this up and literally couldn't do anything else until I finished reading it!

For a younger reader the language can be difficult, so I helped him as much as I could. I thoroughly enjoyed the story though! I like Dickens' since of humor as well as the way he kept you hanging on wondering just how this was going to end. As we get farther and farther away from the lifestyle of the 1800's I think it is important to look back and see what life was like before technology. I also enjoy the British take on things. I don't always &#34;get it&#34; until I re-read it a time or two, but the humor is there. (SPOILER ALERT!) I actually thought the ending was sad until my son pointed out that in class they considered the fact that when Pip &#34;saw no shadow of another parting from her,&#34; could mean that they were never seperated again. Duh! Like I said, old language and another time!!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I loved this book. However unlike others, this one keeps things somber.

The plot revolves around the rise of a young man, Pip, in society due to a mysterious benefactor.

How did I get through high school without reading it? My hs English teachers chose the heartbreaker, David Copperfield, so it's not my first Dickens. I can see that Dickens can tell a story. Who wouldn't love this book? It's the Harry Potter of its time."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This is such a good book in so many ways. It's funny, I couldn't get through it as a kid, but now I've really enjoyed it. Charles Dickens writes these characters that seem so alive. He describes them so well, their little mannerisms, that that part alone fascinated me. Pip's perception of them felt really spot on for a kid. He was definitely put upon to some degree, but much of what he felt was horrible behavior toward him by the adults was really stuff that's common to every kid. It reminded me of how I felt sometimes toward relatives and friends of my parents, all of whom I like now, and I both laughed and felt horrified to realize it. Anyway, very very enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This was a Book Group choice, but I really enjoyed reading it. I had seen TV productions before, so it was great to read the original and see how it compared.

A wonderful novel of Pip who comes into his \\"great expectations\\" via an unknown benefactor -- who he believes to be Miss Havisham. We see how the influence of money and position affect Pip's relations with his family and former neighbors, and not necessarily for the better. There are lots of surprise twists and turns in the plot, especially about Miss Havisham and her adopted \\"daughter\\" Estella and her true parentage.As always, a Dickens novel is peopled with wonderful and unusual characters that eventually all play a part in telling the story. I understand that there were two endings of this book published. The version I read had only one ending and I don't know which one it was. I will have to search out another version of this book to see which I liked best."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"My grandad recommended I read this. I will admit to being very skeptical on the first few pages. I had to read and re-read some of the passages quite a few times to undesrtand what was being said through the old english slang. However, once I passsed that, I found it to be a touching and very interesting story.It is filled with some of the greatest characters ever created in literature.Along the way you will find many truths applicable even in today's society and Dickens expresses it in way unique to him.Dickens has created one of the most beautiful novels ever written: Great Expectations. It's a must read for any book lover and it is by no means overated.This is one you would want keep as part of your collection. It is simply a treasure."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I loved this book. When my teacher first told us we had to read it I thought I would be bored. Boy, was I wrong. It was a little hard to get past the dialect, but what a great story.

I do not think that even if it had, the novel wouldn't have brought me pleasure later, when I grew up, but my past experience with it would have certainly impeded taking the book in my hands again. There is little doubt that in many cases high school stifles the willingness to read literature (not \\"bestsellers\\", however) when young people are confronted with such serious and complex works as \\"Great Expectations\\".The situation with \\"Great Expectations\\" is similar to that when a high school student is forced to read a fairly technical textbook on contemporary physics: there are chances that he or she will like or even be enthralled by some ideas in the book, but inability to follow and understand details (although symbols might be recognised) will almost certainly produce a negative opinion of it in the end.\\"Great Expectations\\" is one of the greatest novels I have ever read. Often humorous, with a carefully planned structure and set of heroes, wonderful narration and an unmatched appeal to senses, it reveals a story of unrequited love, an affair which now stands out as one of the most painful in classical literature. The complex relationship of the principal heroes - Pip, a touchingly honest and faithful young gentleman, and Estella, his beautiful and highbrow tormentor, are at the heart of the plot. But such original figures as Miss Havisham, Mr Jaggers, Mr Pumblechook, Joe Gargery and Biddy supply a rich background - each of them being a perfect example of a character in literature. For, as Alphonse Daudet noted, \\"It is the business of the novelist to create characters, not to write fine prose\\". Though Dickens' fine prose is also above all praises.But \\"Great Expectations\\" is much more than a simple romance - it is a great life lesson. Why do people \\"destined for each other\\" often end up being apart? What makes us break other people's hearts? How long will true love last? What obstacles surmount?"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"What can I say that hasn't been said already? &quot;Great Expectations&quot; is a tremendous novel from the introductory paragraph to the final sentences. The plot is deep and intricate, and there's even a surprising plot revelation occuring late in the book about the origin of Pip's wealth and opportunity in life. The characters are all well-defined and inherently interesting, and such major characters as Pip, Estella, Joe, Miss Havisham, and others vividly live in the mind. Even minor characters such as Mrs. Joe and the Aged Person are memorable and amusing. The novel's storyline, beginning with Pip's early childhood and ending in his late middle age, is epic in breadth. &quot;Great Expectations&quot; treats the reader to a delightful plot and scene for all of its five hundred pages.Even better, however, is the brilliant prose Dickens gives us in the novel. It is humorous, moving, touching, witty, clever, and always perfectly phrased. Never for a single second does the reader feel bored. Like many great works of literature, there are plenty of moments where the writing is almost awe-inspiring in its beauty and language. With a talent as great as Dickens, one could write about almost anything and it would be tremendous reading. When paired with the brilliant plot of &quot;Great Expectations,&quot; it feels almost heaven-sent.Many readers see the term &quot;classic&quot; on a novel and feel that it becomes a type of chore, and add it to a laundry list of literature that somebody felt would be good for them. &quot;Great Expectations&quot; is a classic, but it's not at all the literary equivalent of medicine. It's a delightful treat, and a quick read despite its length. I can't imagine reading this and not treasuring it. It is, quite simply, fantastic."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I studied this book for 2 years in high school and never really read the book itself until a month before my super majorly imprtant exam. Up till then, i was surviving on cliff notes and whatever my tutor said. I had tried to read the book at least a hundred times but fell asleep after the first page.I give this book 4 stars for the fact that dickens is such an AMAZING writer. i'm not saying this coz its a classic. after studying this book for 2 years, you get to know the structure, the language, the relationships between the different plots and sub-plots. and i was BLOWN AWAY by the BRILLIANT way dickens tied everything together. SIMPLY AMAZINGI admit, it IS a tiring read. but like what another review said, Great Expectations was meant to be read chapter by chapter, one per week or soemthing like that. the book i read came with a timeline which shows the publication of each chapter.I do recommend this book. just make sure that you're really really awake when you're reading it. pay attention to the details e.g. how the atmosphere reflects the different characters stuff like that. Read it once. and read it AGAIN. i swear the 2nd time you read it, everything will become clearer. Read it a third time and you'll notice how Dickens pulls the novel off. pretty intriguing."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I know lots of people will flay me for saying this, but this book has a lot of repeat value. I could read it every year, for five years at least without getting bored doing it. I had read the abridged version in school, and a year ago i had seen the movie (featuring gweneth paltrow and ethan hawke). I liked these so much that inspite of knowing the story i bought the unabidged version and was plesantly surprised how much i enjoyed it. Both the movie and the abridged version concentrate only with Pip's relation with estella. The book is infact much wider in its scope. For example Pip's relation with Mr.Pocket fills more pages than that with estella.Charles dickens surely spins a superb yarn of pip, his ambitions, desires, weaknesses, and pureness of character which is so entirely credible and believeable that it seems like an autobiographical account told in the third person. This inspite of the novel containing eccentric characters like miss havisham difficult to find in actuality. Another important contribution of this novel is to portray the relation between pip and estella. Its extremely difficult to say what exactly it is. Infatuation? No. It was the very soul of his existance without which he could not exist. It lasted from childhood till the end. Love? Unlikely. He was torturing himself in her company and this can hardly be called love. Hatred? No. Vengence? No. On miss havisham's part maybe but not on that of pip or estella. There's no answer forthcoming. Just when we thought we were intelligent and mature enough to understand relationships Mr. Dickens comes along to tell us to start from kindergarten once again.I found Mr. Dickens style of writing quite modern. Of course there's an influence of the times he lived in but the novel has a very modern tang. In fact if the means of transport were cars instead of horses, there was electricity instead of candle light and so on, making only such cosmetic changes the novel would definitely seem to be written very recently. I just realised - the movie proves this."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I must admit, this review is slightly prejudiced. I am a high school student, and I read this book for fun. I had tried to read Dickens before, but found myself having a hard time ploughing through the complex vocabulary and intricate parlor dialogue of Hard Times. But I decided to take another stab at Dickens, perhaps with something a little more palatable. All of Dickens' novels, I realized at the end of Book I!!, are VERY, VERY SLOW -- AT FIRST. Then Dickens decides to play on his own soporific introductions!!!!! There is a crucial turn in events for Pip, and the book takes off. Every few paragraphs, there's another handhold so to speak, to keep the reader's suspense and to keep the plot building. Both the language and the many interwoven plots are delectable and unavoidably magnetic -- your hands just can't seem to put down the book, no matter what you do. This book has it all. It also helped me understand why I hated reading the Odyssey for English. (Translations always lose some of the vivacity and fullness that the author has pumped his or her very original work full of, and it is this fullness that made the work so great in the first place.) It is a long read, and you have to be willing to be patient with the beginning. But it's definitely worth it. And the more you read, the easier it gets. After reading this book, I feel inspired to read all of Dickens' works!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"When I found out I had to read Great Expectations, by Charles Dickens for school, I was extremely dissapointed. I had already read A Tale of Two Cities, and absolutely hated it. Students in other classes had read Great Expectations and not liked it either, so I figured I would not enjoy it either. But I decided I would read it anyway, because it is considered to be one of the best books of all time. The books starts out fairly slow, and it takes the reader a few chapters to get used to Dickens's writing style, for he uses an abudance of description. He was paid by the word so he had incentive to do so. For those who are able to survive the first few chapters, they will enjoy an extremely lovable book and not be dissapointed. The book is timeless, with the basic story line being one that has affected almost everyone sometime in their life; falling in love with somebody who does not return the feelings. Pip, the main character, falls in love with an exotic and beautiful girl, Estella, but of course she does not have any feelings for him. So Pip does everything he can to win her approval, and most importantly her heart. It is hard to skip around in the book. While some passages might seem as if they have nothing to do with the story, they do. Everything in the story is tied together somehow. Skimming the book is not going to help. Certain events and people the reader thinks are insignificant or forgot completley, will appear over and over throughout the book. I am glad that i decided to read Great Expectations, despite the negative remarks from peers. I found out that most of them never made it past the first few chapters, so they missed out on the good parts. The only reason I did not give the book a higher score is that parts of it are slow and dry, but stick with it, you will not be upset."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Dickens takes you on a ride that will keep the reader enthralled throughout. Prepare to be sucked into the story and become very attached to the wonderful (yet dreadful) characters of this novel."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"AAH! This book bored me to tears... literally. Thanks to Charles Dickens and his array of b****y women and the rest of the babbling morons, I never want to see that book again. It was thrown across the room many times in the course of my reading. Being forced to read that garbage didn't help much either. I don't understand why honor english students have to be tortured with his 500 pages of nothingness. I had to get the monarch notes to be able to understand it all! It made me feel like an idiot and maaaaaaybe if it was understandable and shorter.... it would actually be good. MAAAAAAAYBE!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I think Great Expectations was a very long, boring book that didn't have a plot. Dickens seemed to drag the story on and on. If the book wasn't as long, it might have been better. I heard somewhere that Dickens got paid by the word and that is was there's a lot of extra, stupid words in it. I also think that it was twisted because everyone was realted to each other."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"the book was boring, poopy, i didn't like it at all, had to read it for school, not a good time"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Dickens was actually a good writer, but he never could come up with a decent ending. His stories were well written, and the characters were interesting, especially in this book. This story follows the life of a young boy as he grows up and tries to make a place for himself in the world. He meets some interesting characters that, at times, get the better of him. He also falls in love with an unattainable woman. The story carries on without a climax, without a point, without resolution, and, ultimately, without an ending. It just abruptly stops. I think this was the best book I read by Dickens, which isn't saying much."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I thought that this was a pretty good book. In the beginning I wasn't sure if I would like it becuase it was kind of different but I continued reading it and I ended up enjoying it. Some of the parts in the story were kind of hard to read. There were so many characters to remember and to keep track of. One of the characters went by two different names so that got confusing. Another thing that got difficult while reading was the dialect that Dickens used while writing the book. I like the way Dickens wrote this book. He doesn't tell you about everything that is going on, so you have many questions about things and at the end everything is answered for you. It doesn't turn out how you would expect."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I found most of the book a good read. I was suprised by who Pip's benefactor was but that's what a good book is suppose to do. Intregue you, suprise you.... I didn't enjoy the ending though I thought with all that went on in the book that there would be a different approach to the ending."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I thought this book was a really good book. I liked it because it was very exciting and interesting. I thought it was difficult to read though because of all the characters in the story. I thought that there was way to many characters and there didn't need to be that many. Dickens also used a lot of long and hard words which I didn't understand that well. That made the story even harder to read. It was also very long and I think that Dickens could have taken some parts out. It got kind of boring during the middle of the book but at the end it was all worth reading. I think Dickens is a very good writer and I would like to read some more of his novels. He thinks of neat stories that no other author would think of. Overall, this was a very good book."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I must confess that this was the first book I've read from Charles Dickens and did'nt liked it.I believed that he would describe more profoundly the rigid class difference in the british society of the end of XIX century."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This book got to me fast and in great condition, and at a great price!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"The Great Expectation was a great book. I thought that it was a little hard to read. But I just read the part over that I didn't understand and I eventually understand it. Another thing that confused me is that Charles Dickens uses a lot of names for his characters. He should of just stuck to one name per character so that the readers wouldn't get confused. He also had some unrealistic plot in the story. Otherwise this was a great story how a boy becomes a gentleman and learns how to act. I would recommend you to read this book if you want to keep guessing."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great Expectations was a mediocre book. I was not impressed. I had to read this book for my 9th grade honors English class. It was too long and boring. I see were Dickens was trying to go with the suspense, but it just made the book monotonous and boring. The uncanny coincidences just did not seem real. It's ok to use a coincidence as a tool of suspense, but this was just overkill. Every chapter was boring. I got tired pretty quickly of pip wishing he were with Estella for the whole book. Also, the book seemed to stray away from the main point for chapters at a time. Who cares about Wopsle's stupid plays? This could all be summed up in a couple of page short story. In conclusion, this is another swing and a miss for Dickens. STAY FAR AWAY FROM THIS BOOK! If you want to read a good Dickens story, read \\"A Christmas Carol\\" and nothing else written by Charles Dickens."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I had to do this for school.

It is a required reading for English, mostly to show the difference between Flat and Round characters. Well it worked! Most of the characters in this book are flat! Ugh.I can't get over how the plotine doesn't even move normally. Its like when you want to drive somewhere and you hit a million and one detours. Eventually you'd say, \\"Screw it! Who needs food?\\" But nooo... Dickens just kept on driving around. I think only ONE subplot was actually straightforward, and that would be Miss Havisham and her ex lover.Basically, I got halfway through this book, then fled to Sparknotes. I wasn't going to read it. I was just going to make sure I knew enough to pass the test I had to take on the garbage.Ironically enough, those of us who used Sparknotes got better test grades than those who actually read the book. That say something about how much sense it made..."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This book by far is the worst piece of shi--garbage I have ever laid my eyes on. The story has a skeleton, and a little bit of meat (and I like meat), but mostly, it's just fat. Especially the second stage of Pip's expectations, which finds Pip devoid of any characterizations beyond \\"I'm rich and you're not,\\" and \\"Oh, how I do love the lady Estella.\\" It's enough to make you vomit. Mr. Dickens should have made this a much shorter novel, or maybe even a short story. It still would have been boring, but maybe not as boring."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"A guy I work with read this book and it seemed like he was reading it for three years!

I decided to read Great Expectations because I thought it has a lot of excitement. When I read it, it turn out okey but when I'm in Chapter 6 it is boring and hard to understand. So I give it up. Maybe I don't understand this book because I am too young. Maybe I will read this book again in 9th grade."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I was forced to read Great Expectations because my Accelerated English teacher made us. I do not think the novel was very well thought out and was much too indecisive in many parts. Dickens did not seem to know really what he wanted to do with the plot. He even made two endings!!! He was much too descriptive and that made the story even more boring than its story line made it in the first place. I have heard that many people think this was his greatest book and that makes me wonder if they have read anything else by him because I do not think anyone could get much more boring!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Well I read this book with some great expectations and I shouldn't have.

I can not with in any honesty recomend this book to anybody but I would eagerly recoment Dickens."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I had to read this for a high school summer reading list. It was the worst reading experience I ever had, and I love reading books. I cried several times trying to plug through the long-winded (obviously Dickens paid by the word) presentation.

This book might be great as an adult (which I'll gladly never know), but definitely not as a 16 year old.

Written originally in different volumes and distributed to an excited Victorian republic, Dickens was able to make his audience care and feel for his odd, moving characters. He was the Stephen King of his day; a clever businessman who distributed mediocre books to the public. That Dicken's fever passed on from one generation to the next is fine, that this made Dicken's books classics in schools is a shame. But let me get to the actual book at hand! Yes, many characters in Great Expectations are original and interseting. Overall, however, Great Expectations is wordy (!), and painfully convoluted. It is often difficult to get through, and geared towards a certain audience only. This is not to say that everyone will dislike Great Expectations, but we live in an age (good or bad) of gritty realism. Authors like James Joyce and F. Scott Fitzgerald wrote with and still show a heavenly pen, Dicken's stories are what turns so many young people against reading. Anyone who wants to live in a former era, Great Expectations is a must; for anyone who wants a powerful, sophisticated read PLEASE put Great Expectations in the incinerator."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This book was a large disappointment for me. I had seen the movie, and hoped that the book would be good. However, I was wrong. In fact, this book turned out to be one of the worst I have ever read. The book has too much description, not even important to the story. Dickens lost my interest in the book from the very first chapter, just a plain description of main character Pip's history of his family and town. This chapter drags on for too long, as does the rest of the book. As an example, the character Estella's rudeness towards Pip is repeated so often that it becomes annoying. I got the point of Estella's bringing up and lifestyle early on in the novel, and this did not have to be repeated so often. This book could very well have been interesting, but Dickens did not do a good job writing it. His continuous decscrptions of such landscapes as rivers and trees are irrelevant to the story, and caused me to drift away from it. I do not reccommend this book to anybody, and advise you to avoid it. I, as well as many other people I know, could not even finish this book. It brought no interest to me, and it is too long, considering that it contained nothing attention-grabbing and no excitement. However, if you do insist on reading this book, please just get the cliffnotes. It is not a book worth buying."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"when I read this book. Honestly, after I liked &quot;A Tale of Two Cities&quot; I was expecting more from Dickens. Maybe Dickens wrote in the style of his time, which was to be very detailed, but it really doesn't translate well to today. I don't mind long books (I'm reading War and Peace now) but this book went into extreme detail about the most meaningless things.This story was essentially a Victorian soap opera. Theres all sorts of unknown parents, secret coniving, mysterious benefactors, and worst of all, many unrealistic characters. This book was so contrived and unnatural that I really don't see how it's attained &quot;classic&quot; status.If you don't mind meticulous attention being payed to the minutia, which is Dickens's style, then I'd recommend &quot;A Tale of Two Cities.&quot; If not, there are many other authors much better than Dickens that you can read."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Pip craves the approval of Miss Havisham and the love of Estella, who basically treat him like dirt. Even when he's with them he's miserable and knows it. Pip also knows that he's being an ungrateful snob towards Joe and Biddy, who've done nothing in his life but love, respect, and protect him. This because he cannot help but view them through the eyes of the rich and vindictive Miss Havisham and the beautiful but really darn mean Estella. Despite all this, Pip is a likeable character with whom it is easy to identify and sympathize. Eventually he confronts the superficiality of his expectations and embraces his true nature. In the process he transforms both Miss Havisham and Estella into feeling human beings, understanding and remorseful of the pain caused by their previous conduct."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"...this book and I are! I had to keep reminding myself that this story was fiction, otherwise I probably would have gotten much more emotional about it than I did.

Being so young, it was nearly impossible to grasp the depth and breadth of this genius piece of work. This story is amazingly broad in character development. Through the novel, one is able to follow the life journey of Pip, and his ties to those closest to him in life. He &quot;changes, and changes again,&quot; and can never fully recover from what he learns. There's no going back. This book will forever remain one of my favorite. It's one that leaves you wondering how a person could have the talent to create such a touching, masterful work."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"People have enjoyed the adventures of Pip and friends (or enemies, as the case may be) for decades! Though quite confusing at times, Great Expectations was a well thought out novel. This book required more concentration than most, with a cast of characters that would fill the world many times over. I had trouble reading it in the normal haphazard fashion I usually take; a chapter here, a few pages on the way to school, because of all the details put into it. I know this classic was written with money being paid per word, but I found much of the long, rambling, descriptions to be the one major fault of the novel. I think that the one reason people accept and cherish these lengthy descriptions is because Great Expectations is one of the &quot;classic classics&quot;, so to speak. People expect it to become tedious in places, filled with descriptions of anything from a desk drawer to toenail clippings. But overall, I found this to be a touching book, about mangled love, childhood, and life in general. A great read for anyone with patience!!-LJ"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I think that this book was superb, not just because it's a classic but because of it's morals and it's story of young Pip and how he goes through many many adventures and many wonderful happenings in his life.

Take every detail in and you will never regret the time you spent because it is entertaining and absolutely thrilling. There are a lot of twists and turns in the plot as well as the emotions in the characters and it literally brought tears to my eyes."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I read this book in 5th grade and I loved it! I still do. It is the best book. I think it is not boring at all and is very very very funny!!!! I think that everyone will like it once they get into it!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I think that two clarificifactions need be made to edify those who thought this book &quot;sucked&quot;, and that the characters were &quot;insane&quot;. Dickens is exaggerating! For example, there are hardly any people in real life like Jaggers, who do everything in such a business-like way. And yet he is very interesting and highly entertaining. And for everyone who thinks there were too many details: try to imagine just a bleak straightforward account of Pip's life. A good novel shouldn't just be a summary. And if you think it's wordy and too descriptive, try IVANHOE (another great book). Regarding the alternate ending: YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE FOCUS OF THIS BOOK IS NOT PIP&quot;S LOVE FOR ESTELLA. Who gives a damn whether he marries her or not? The focus of the story is on Pip's aspiring to such expectaions, and being drawn away from his family and humble origins, until he discovers the true treasures of life. I loved this book, and if you do not think it ranks as a classic, then what does?"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great Expectations is the story of a young boy, Pip, and how he struggles to reach the experiences of Estella, the girl he loves, as he grows up and matures. This novel, written by Charles Dickens, explains the disappointment of loving someone without response, and being unsatisfied with one's life, because of having such high expectations that one cannot meet. I liked the way that the author portrays the characters and the setting to give a resemblance of the theme. I was interested throughout the story, for it is gripping and unpredictable. I sincerely recommend this book to anyone who enjoys novels that one can relate to with a deep meaning. Also, to anyone that likes a challenge Great Expectations is an ideal book."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"When a game of leap-frog goes awry, young Pip Maplethorp's father is killed.With the family crumb-winner out of the picture, Pip is forced to travel to London where he finds employment as a Governess to the Lingus family (whose daughter, Constance, taunts him with cries of \\"you're lost - lost in a Fog of Lag !\\"). On day, while gathering pond scum, Pip meets and befriends Dr. Wetherbee. This chance meeting provides the book with one of it's few moments of comic relief, as Dr. Wetherbee repeatedly strikes Pip about the face and head with a cricket bat that he affectionately calls \\"Trevor\\". I won't ruin the book for you by telling you what Pip sees behind the potting shed that makes him no longer desire to be a Pediatrist, but I will tell you that, after reading that chapter, I never looked at pudding the same way again. I predict that this book will have resurgence in popularity and soon everybody will be saying, \\" Is that your Dickens in your hand?\\""},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This is Dickens' greatest novel, and one of the best of all time. Full of some of his most memorable characters, such as Magwitch (convict with a heart -- or liver), Miss Havisham, Pumblechook, Jaggers, Wemmick and more. From the opening graveyard scene to the final confrontation between Pip and Estella, you're hooked, laughing and crying. Pip is the Dickens character with the most psychologically realistic growth, and is therefore the author's most sympathetic hero. Wonderful plot, wonderful description, an absolute must. I highly recommend the Bantam paperback because the introduction by John Irving, &quot;The King of the Novel&quot;, is just as extraordinary in its own way. It's a superb, personal, passionate defense of Dickens that has affected me as much as any of Irving's best novels."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"While reading the reviews that others had written, I was amazed at how many people did not like this book. Maybe if you weren't so rushed into reading this book, you might actually enjoy it. Some of the reviews may stop you from reading this book, but I am telling you to read it. It is very descriptive, has a wonderful plot, and a great author. Ignore the other reviews because this book is clearly a classic and will ALWAYS be a classic."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Yes, it's hard to believe. Not a page is wasted. There are no digressions and few apparent digressions; the story - admittedly a long story - is swiftly and cleanly told, and it contains all the character growth, suspense, and frippery that one could reasonably ask of any story. This is DESPITE the fact that the book has all the virtues of any Dickens novel. The languge is, as usual, witty and a delight to read - in fact, more so than usual: it turns out that first person narration suits Dickens. All of the charcters are memorable - in fact, more so than usual: it comes as a great surprise to hear that this is the Dickens novel with the fewest characters, if you actually number them. The usual quota of gorgeous incident is there: in fact, more. And so on. It's hard to imagine a more nearly perfect book. -And there's one other thing I should mention. \\"Great Expectations\\" probably has a special personal appeal to many different sorts of people, but I would like to especially, from personal experience, commend the novel to graduate students. I hope they'll see what I mean."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"An undeniably solid book. I can certainly identify with Pip, but it was, at times, drab.

As a result, his stories still resonates powerfully after so many years. On the weak points, Dickens tends to rely on remarkable coincidences to tie the plots together, and the psychological studies of his characters are not as sharp and profound as those of Dostoyevsky or Henry James. I also found the contrived happy ending very unsatisfying."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This book is an incredible read. The main character really absorbs the attention of the reader.

This book should be made mandantory for all students to read while they are still in high school."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"More high school students should read this book. I loved this book, and I read last year as a freshmen. If you think about it, high school students can relate to this book just as they can relate to books written now. Even though it is written in older times and with &quot;big words&quot; doesn't mean one should not read it and say it is boring and stupid. Many high schoolers can relate to Pip when he was bored with being a blacksmith because he got tired of doing it, because alot of times high school students sign up to do stuff that it turns out they don't like or that they are tired of because they thought they would like it or their parents made them do it. Many high schoolers can also relate to when Estella makes fun of Pip, because they argue with siblings or that guy/girl who sits next to you in biology class that you don't like but they still talk to you. Then when Pip gets his chance to finally become a gentleman, many high schoolers finally get their chance to do something they want. Once you read the first few chapters of Pip's childhood and up to when he gets to become a gentleman, you are hooked. I personally loved this book. It was one of the only books I read in my freshman year of high school, and now I am glad that I read it. It was wonderful."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This was a great book because of the way that he made it seem that you were there.Also because of the way he kept you on the edge of your seat, and the way that all the characters are all familiarized to each other makes the book good but hard to understand,except the way that he wrote it in Old English made it hard to read."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I first read this book when I was 12 or 13 - ten years later I decided to read it again because I remember loving it so much. It was just as good the second time round.While not his best book (of the ones I've read David Copperfield takes that prize) it is a thoroughly enjoyable read with larger than life charcters and, in places, Dickens' trademark subtle, sarcastic humour. Add a great storyline and you've got a great book.I cannot believe that so many younger people are panning this book. Not being full of adrenalin-packed scenes does not make it boring! Get an attention span!One more comment - while the recent film with Hawke and Paltrow was a good film in its own right, it lacks so much when compared to the book."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I am 16 years old and this was my summer reading book. I thought it was pretty good. Just because you have to read it for school, don't just discount it as a worthwhile book. Yes, it is long, but it DOES have a point.

But take your time and enjoy the story."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This review comes from a 15 year old male. I found this to be a rather good novel.

Email me your comments, peace."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great Expectations has been one of the first of many novels I happen to touch upon fashioned by Charles Dickens. I set forth to reading it with a mind not interested but curious. Zeal may be the one motive that takes me through the first part of the novel. Fleeting moments of ambivalence of good and evil throughout the novel can always be found in one's life. As have been articulated, I find myself in Pip's reaction to what his fate and destiny has brought him. Pip's oscillation between compunction and remoselessness, egotism and selflessness is the cardinal element upon whcih the story is built .On the other hand, the plotting of the novel is superbly constructed, with the lives of countlss characters interwined with one and other. Miss Havisham, I reckon, is one of the best of them. This is one great novel that you should not miss. Miss it and you shall lose what is more valuable than Pip's expectations."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"There are two main sorts of novel - those that end quite happily and satisfactorily, with everything essentially \\"working out\\" for the better and most great problems resolved. The second kind is quite the opposite, an about-face, and of course \\"Great Expectations\\" would fall into the latter category. It's only main tender-bellied spot for me to prod with critique would be the fairly obvious plot unfolding, even to someone unfamiliar with the story as I was.As so often happens with \\"classics\\", in the end the main characters end up being one another's long lost aunts or cousins, fathers, daughters, stepmothers, caretakers, lovers, or perhaps the cause of misery to one or many, of course all unbeknownst and hidden until you happen to stumble in on their story. That's not really giving anything away, for those that are worried. And it is not to say that Dickens was unoriginal with this one, because it's a fantastic read, but that he's had better - even in the form of \\"Oliver Twist\\".Those that like the happy ending shouldn't really be too interested. Those who like ..., intrigue - um, stay away too. The heart of this pup is dialogue and the torture of internal thoughts and personal dissatisfaction. The protagonist is poor, so desperately wants to be a gent and have \\"expectations\\", ... The guy doesn't get the girl. No real living happily ever after. But I don't see why that's necessary."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great Expectations\\" by Charles Dickins is a really good book. I personally do not like to read but i truely enjoyed this book. Although the beginning is very slow and Dickins takes forever to get to the point many times, i found myself unable to put the book down at times. Great Expectations is a good book about loyalty, trust and fate. It also teaches you to remember your true friends and do not let wealth go to your head. The story is centered around an orphan boy named \\"Pip\\". Miss Havisham is the woman who looks after and takes care of Pip. One day Pip is at the gravesite of his parents and the convict, Magwitch, asks him to help him out. Pip does help the convict out not knowing what Magwitch will do for him in the future.One day at Miss Havisham's house Pip meets Estella. He falls in love with her but she does not return the feelings. In fact she is cruel and plays with Pip's emotions. Despite the way he is treated by Estella, Pip never gives up on on trying to win her over.Later on, Pip is told that he has come into a great fortune from an anynomous benefactor. After he comes into all of this money he goes to London, England to study and become a gentleman. While he is in England he becomes somewhat \\"stuck up\\". He treats his old friends like they are not as important as his new friends.While in England he finds out that Estella has married a man who he cannot stand. He also meets up with the convict, Magwitch. Magwitch tells Pip how he is Estella's father and how he is the secret benefactor to his new found wealth. In gratitude, Pip tries to help Magwitch escape from England, but while escaping the police catch them and arrest Magwitch and put him to death, while Pip's money is taken away from him.Pip goes back to Miss havisham's house and becomes friends with his old friends again. He also meets up with Estella there and after awhile the two marry.This book is well written in the way that everyone can relate to the subjects in some way.I really enjoyed reading this piece."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I still wonder why this book is a perennial reading requirement in junior high schools across the country. I had to read it way back when, and it almost turned me off from books in general. This is not to say it's a bad book, because, on the contrary, it's great, but don't have great expectations of an exciting contemporary read. To enjoy this book and appreciate the beauty of fully-fleshed characters, come-alive scenes, and intricately woven plot, you absolutely must keep in mind that this book was written in a different time, before the Hemingway revolution of sparse prose. As you read it, expect long verbose passages and miles between exciting scenes. But stick it out, and in the end expect a great read that stays with you a lifetime.

It is a well done Dickens-style (obviously) story of a young boy raised in a poor environment by his sister--his only living relative--and her husband, a blacksmith named Joe. After visiting a very rich and eccentric woman by the name of Miss Havisham, the young boy named Pip is approached by a lawyer and is told he has &quot;great expectations.&quot; And that he is to move to London to be bread as a gentleman, when after a certain period he is to inherit a large sum of money. The story goes on to London where he is brought up, and leads to some very interesting twists. The tale is well told, and enjoyable if you are fond of Dickens (while I appriciate Dickens.. I admittedly do not like &quot;A Christmas Carol,&quot; so keep in mind that if that is the only Dickens you have been exposed to, give him a try through one of his major novels.) The character of Pip is a very sympathetic one, and his faults are all to scarily human. This novel covers great, surprise, assumption, and other noteworthy themes. A good classic read."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I liked this book because it kept me wondering what was going to happen.

The book never had me. I don't think it ever actually tried to have me. It's premise centers around a boy named Pip and his life in 19th century England. It's only too bad that Dickens spends far too much time showcasing his prolific skills of writing in the English language and less time on any sort of a solid base for this specific novel. The reader feels absolutely no connection to any of the characters, most notably Pip or Joe. The one bright part of the book is Miss Havisham, who Dickens spends enough time with for us to empathize with her for her lonely life.The biggest problem of course, is it's lack of commitment to any sort of theme. A great novel, as many would claim this is, must possess the language and have something to say. It seems, especially at the beginning, that Dickens is taking his stand against early Industrial Revolution labor practices. However, the book never really delves into that in any way shape or form. When Dickens chooses to describe Joe's house or some other hovel, he persists to use the same kind of language as when he describes, for instance, Miss Havisham's or Wemmick's house. This book, on the whole, is as dry as Spanish sherry and is simply not meant for anyone who wishes to extrapolate anything of meaning from the books they read."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I must admit that beyond my initial attraction to the novel's title I made several attempts over a period of years to settle into the story but could not get past the first several pages. There are many things to throw off potential readers to aged classics like this one, not the least of which is Dickens' choice of character names such as Pumblechook, Wopsle and Magwitch, which I at first found absurd and annoying. However on a recent attempt I made it as far as chapter 10 (of 59 total) when it dawned on me suddenly and unexpectedly that I was hooked and that there was no turning back.The unabridged version is not something one can breeze through in an afternoon, especially considering that it requires the development of a certain skill to absorb Dickens' narrative style, much as it is with the often difficult prose of Henry James. Some parts read very fast while others are tortuously overwritten creating a virtual standstill as the eyes glaze over and one starts to look for good reasons not to throw the book against the wall and pull out tufts of hair from one's head in frustration - a good editor would do this book no injustice but I am not going to recommend the abridged version because most parts are not to be played with. But as is the case in life, our accomplishments must be earned, and so I will make this promise to those contemplating reading this work: make the effort, put forth the time to read this novel, which is not a short one, and before long it will grow on you and you will come to treasure your time spent with it, and even savour its pages as the story unfolds and comes to an end.It would be so much easier for the many students who are assigned this book to take the low road and read only a study guide and then rent one of the movies of it and then definitely not ace the class, but the intelligent ones could pull off a pass; but they would be cheating themselves of something that one cannot put a price on- a well told story with vibrant characters who share in our capacities to be hurt, to feel joy, to be knocked down and to live life, for what are stories if they are not reflections of ourselves, our desires, our fears, our untold secrets, our ability to connect to other souls and grow or be cut off and wither.Let me tell it to you straight. Dickens is a master storyteller. He has created a legacy that has been surpassed by only a few and is a standalone in terms of sheer narrative prowess. Modern writers, especially screenwriters (like myself, eventually) would do themselves no harm if they took Dickens' work to heart and used it as a model for their own for here there are no pyrotechnics, no stretching of rehashed plot ideas into the thinness of an overblown balloon, no exaggerated or contrived formulae, granted there is no small measure of coincidence in his stories, but here there are real characters with beating hearts and flesh, fully capable of a misstep and fall, part of a story that is relevant and timeless and enriching, even necessary to the human spirit if we are to grow and thrive and not kill one another with the evil and savagery that we are all capable of.As Nicole Kidman said during her Oscar acceptance a few years back: \\"art is important,\\" and for Dickens' contribution I am grateful and would be doing a disservice if I did not write this ditty for those that may listen. To Kidman's remark I would like to add that without art, life would no longer be tolerable and not worth living. It even convinces one to stick around for a little while longer. Those who do not feast on classics like \\"Great Expectations\\" are paying a very heavy price, one that not even Mr. Gates can well afford."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I spent a whole term going over this book in freshmen English class. It is an overall good book, full of interpritations. There are many symbolisms and allusions. However, it is important to remember that this book was originally a serialization, as it came out every week in the paper. There are some parts when Dickens drawls on with his plans, events, ect. However, there are scenes that are very fast paced and action filled. The overall plot is a young, naive boy of about ten lives with his sister and her simple husband named Joe. However, Pip is given a secret benefactor and is thrust in the life of nobility. Pip is tangled in his probelems of leaving Joe behind and his encouters with the shallow (and I mean SHALLOW) Estella and the wicked Miss Havisham. Dickens is a master with characters and the languege, but he doesn't describe any everyday events. For example, Pip goes to study law, but thats all we know. In my opinion, it gives the characters this higher than life importance, and less real. But, if you take this book slowely, maybe a chapter a night (instead of the five I had to do), you will definately enjoy this book."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"&quot;Great Expectations&quot; seems to be a term used to describe a young man with expectations of becoming a Gentleman. This is the story about a young boy named Pip who though considered poor, was raised as an apprentice in a respectable trade. When his parents died when he was very young he was brought up by his older sister and her husband Joe Gargery the blacksmith. Joe although a little slow, acts in many ways as a loving father and friend to the boy, and is more noble than any of the other characters in the whole book. His older sister however isn't as nice, and in the modern day world probably would have been brought up on charges of child abuse. (If this book was ever remade into a modern day movie I couldn't think of anyone else I'd rather see playing Pip's older sister than Kathy Bates. I pictured her every time the character is mentioned.)Pip then comes into some money by a mysterious benefactor, and becomes an ungrateful little boy who looks down upon those he used to associate with and puts on airs. At this point, in my opinion Pip becomes a very unlikable character for most of the remainder of the book. He believes Miss Havisham who is a mysterious mean old wealthy lady is his benefactor and falls in love with her adopted daughter Estella. I believe this makes Pip look very shallow, since the only redeeming quality she seems to possess is her looks.Pip moves to London and is entrusted to a lawyer named Jenkins and his assistant Wemmick to teach him how to become a gentleman. The lawyer Jenkins, while unloving, is likeable, and in his own way noble. Wemmick who leads a double life is one of the best characters in the book. (I believe there are many people who would like to keep their work life separate from the home life, and can relate to this character.)Jenkins hires a tutor for Pip to teach him how to act like a gentleman. It seems that all the gentleman in this story do however is spend money. Pip and the tutor's son Herbert who becomes Pip's best friend then proceed to work themselves into debt.A pirate which Pip met in his childhood comes back into this life, and brings many changes. (The pirate Pip meets reminded me of the sea captain from &quot;Treasure Island&quot;, or the main character in the &quot;Count of Monte Cristo&quot;.)In the end Pip tries to redeem himself, and in some ways does.There are some plot twists and mysteries to solve. Some work out well and are pleasant surprises, others just seem unnecessary to the story."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"GE is one of the better books that I read in my illustrious high school education. The book threw me a little because of all the words Dickens used to describe every character right down to the tiniest little thing. Pip and Joe is a good pair of characters to have in this book, because they are so different and so alike at the same time. They both like to work with metals and Joe is a blacksmith and pip is his apprentice. They are different in the way that they act. Joe takes the brutal ness of pips sister, and pip does not. When pip starts to work for Ms. Havisham it shows his torture that he has to take from Ms. Havisham in the way of verbal bashings. Thought Ms. Havisham does not beat him unlike his sister does, she is a very cruel and malignant women. Then one-day pip meets Estella, she seems like a nice girl but in fact she is a very cruel women just like her grandma. This is the beginning of pips crush and then turns into a passion. Dickens then goes into the part of the story where pip finds out why she wants Estella to hate men. He finds out that she was left at the alter by her ex. This set a fire in her and that is why she hates men. Then pip returns home one day from work at Ms. Havisham's house and he finds a lawyer there with Joe and some one gave him enough money to get a good education and a home. So he takes the money and pip goes to school in England and the story pretty much lost its importance after that, but pip does find out that the person who gave him the money was from the Escaped convict, he owned his own farm in Australia and he was rich from that. These are just some of things that happened in the book, to find out some of the finer details I urge to you read the book for yourself. It will give u a better insight into dickens writing also."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great Expectations was the greatest book that I've ever read.

He ends up being sent away to England to become a young gentleman, and strays away from the love of his life. A great deal of scandal goes on, and if I tell you anymore than you'll know what happens, but I will tell you this.

I can tell you I loved this bok, and I'm sure you will too."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I hated a Tale of Two Cities but I loved this novel. This typical Dickens, great characters, several plot twists, and a lot of description. For any one who has read everything by Dickens, I'd suggest &quot;Titus Groan&quot; and its follow up &quot;Gormenghast&quot; by Mervyn Peake. They are fantasy novels but are extremely Dickinsian (though original enough to keep from being derisive) and in my opinion equal to any thing Dickins wrote and in better prose."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Sorry for the nasty mean review. Totally uncalled for, caught me on a bad day. Everybodys different and everyone has their own opinions and just because someone else doesn't like something is no reason to put them down.

But anyway, if thats the way they feel then I guess thats just the way they feel and nobody should write such nasty reviews or get mad for such a petty, stupid reason anyway. So, anyway, this is one of Dickens best, as I've said before."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Of all English writers,Charles Dickens is the champion of the genre of \\"Bildungsroman\\",a department of fiction writing pertaining to growth and development of the protagonist. Dickens's writings are darkly underlined by an all-dimensionsal illustration of aperson's character and by an uncanny portrayal of childhood. \\"Nicholas Nickleby\\",\\"David Copperfield\\" and \\"Great Expectations\\" have gone into the literary folklore as novels containing some of the finest amd most vivid passages ever composed on children's psyche and indignified lives. Perhaps the author's this ability to paint children's woe stems froms his own abusive and disruptive boyhood and perhaps in several of his fancy's infants,Dickens was actually trying to reflect his very own horrible childhood. \\"David Copperfield\\" is undoubtably his most personal and in certain fractions autobiographical novel but in \\"Great Expectations\\",employing a compatible first person narrative method,Charles Dickens conjures up a very much real life character who,like David Copperfield,narrates the story of his life as he progresses through his childhood,errors of judgements and unseeming expectations to a tragi-joyous adulthood;as he stives on in life with a plethora of illusions;as he realises the moments of truth one by one.\\"Great Expectations\\" is young Pip's story,a trajectory of his yearning to excel and drift away from the \\"oncommon\\",a desire to be loved and respected in society, a not-so-uncommon craving to grow up and establish himself. For an orphan living in the country marshes in England and brought up \\"by hand\\" by his sister Mrs. Joe Gargery,Pip's on;y genuine friend in his early boyhood was Jor Gargery,the blacksmith---also supposed by the central character to have been made to \\"marry her by hand\\". But a sudden and apparently misfortunate meeting with a fugitive from the nearby Hulks---and the consequent burden of guilt his troubled conscience has to bear---a visit to the queer Miss Havisham's and an unexpected deliverance of all his miseries all consire to Pip's rise in life. The mysterious London lawyer and master defender of criminals Mr. Jaggers arrives one day to inform Pip that if he would,then he is entitled to excercise a proposition of going to London and studying and doing all he can to rise up in life and be an established gentleman with no cost from his side---a mere boyish fancy of Pip till that moment. so marches on our gentle little gentry class boy to the city on te back of the notion that it was Miss Havisham who was actually his benefactoress and who had destined him and her adopted daughter,the cruel,unforgiving and heartless Estella,to be together. And thus begin young and inexperienced Pip's trysts with harsh realities of life.In a novel that essentially figures around human expectations and failures through the tame medium of words,Pip's story is massively apt for the enlightenment of this theme. Pip is found to be a real-life character leafed out of life's own text book and not an imaginary effigy of fairy-tale gratifications,which David in \\"David Copperfield\\" in some stretch is. He's an ordinary person with extraordinary aspirations but as he moves on in life,he learns about himself and this personal growth is exquisitely and relistically portrayed by Charles Dickens. Indeed it's in a great city like London where truth dawns upon Pip,truth that demolishes all ethereals about life,about riches,about Miss Havisham and EStella,and most important truth of them all,the truth about himself. Pip runs into debt,makes several mistakes,is broken down and broken apart by an illusory love and endures fits of remorse,which punctuate his entire existence arising out of a marked ingratitude towards Joe and Biddy,his friend from his old school. His only means of moral salvation from this quicksand of sin is te hearty relationship with Herbert Pockets,his best friend and companion in all his catastrophes. Actually in Herbert and his father,also the tutor of Pip,Charles Dickens creates two characters dissolved in innocence and ignorance with no big aims for money. When all of Miss Havisham's near and distant relatives are coaxing her to milk her fortune,the Pockets are the sole remaining figures to brush aside such ideas. This is one of Dickens's numerous tricks as a writer to subtlely show that goodness can still be glimpsed in an otherwise sadly denudating world.Charles Dickens is believed to have gone through his work \\"David Copperfield\\" thoroughly before writing \\"Great Expectations\\" but even so on certain occasions,the reader does decipher resemblance between these two high acclaimed novels. The shape of Pip's path i life doesn't bear that great degree of difference with these two popular fictional characters are often found to merge. Miss Havisham is reminiscent of Betsy Trotwood's resentment towards the male society,only more elongated and elaborate;in Pip's detest of Drummle and his love for Estella,the reader catches a fair glimpse od David's own contempt towards Uriah heep's lust for Agnes;Mr.Pockets and his family's fiascos and innocence bear a certain kinship with those of Mr. Micawber's;and Pip's deep friendship with Herbert reminds the reader of David's relationship with Traddles. These similarities could blot Dickens's claim to unprecedented imagination power or may strangely prove that life of one is often intertwined with aanother's. The first person narrative technique used to describe Pip's story in this book too isn't without some strong criticisms. The opinions and witty contemplations formed by Pip of people both is his marsh country as well as in London from an early stage in his life render the reader musing as to how his innocent and delicately humorous conjectures could suddenly be transformed into something satirical and concrete. Are his views constructed on the spur of the moment or are they being built now as Pip stares down the years and pens down his history? If the latter be more inclined towards the truth,then it definitely distorts Pip's authenticity as a writer and his memoir is left somewhat ineffective with misleading overlapping of the past and te present.Certain detractions are not so difficult to eke out from \\"Great Expectations\\" really but flaws are a regular parameter of any work of literature. The genius of Charles Dickens is never in doubt in this book as the reader discerns the author's accustomed mingling of humour and dark pictures in a book that promises life as it is. Dickens's obsession with wit and humour is revealed in the features of Mr. Pumblechook and Mr. Wopsle and in incidents such as the latter playing Hamlet on the stage. That when perceived from te swift flow of narration perfectly complimented by the dialogues and conversations and punctuated by moods of reflections makes the book instantly appealing. The caricature of the marsh country is another point of revelation of the author's informed and classy state. The world of Dickens is one of individual identities and aspirations,where all characters find their own proper places. And this world isn't a big one but a narrowed and trimmed realm of compulsive non-overlapping characters all fuctioning significantly in the due course of Pip's realisation of the world and its intricacies.The most beguiling factor in providing Pip's tale a touch of realism and in turn making the novel more touching and endearing is the evident defects in his character. He feels remorseful at his ingratitude towards his poor and \\"common\\" family;he is exasperated at the return of his \\"old convict\\" years later and in his refusal to address him not as Magwitch,his real name,but as Provis,his assumed name,he subconsciously admits denial of his own humble past. Pip isn't mature enough to handle his own humble past. Pip isn't mature enough to handle his own present either,and time and again has to rush to Herbert and wemmick,Mr. Jaggers's assistant,for solace and help. As illusions fade one by one and emotions of al sorts jumble up together in Pip's life,he's found to portray at least fractions of our own lives. \\"Great Expectations\\" is vastly a cofession of a dilapidated soul whose expectations in life are not without unforseen twists and turns. This is an immensely moving tale of a young man's ineptitude and discontentment told in restrained sentimentality,empathic ruminations and glittering descriptions. This classic is a gem for any literature lover,where Charles Dickens;s authority as a writer is amazingly deft."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Dudes. You gotta read this book. It's totally awesome.Charles described the people and places so well, it's like its real and your there with everybody.Pip and Estella's love story might be the greatest love story in history. Greater than Rhett and Scarlet. Greater than Romeo and Juliet. Greater than Spiderman and Mary Jane. Yes, it's that good.Sure, there are plenty of movies, but none do it justice. Its like the Scarlet Letter. You've gotta read it."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"It's not worth it, even with the low price of 1.99. You're better off getting the free version. The only thing you're going to get is a couple of illustrations and there is no link for a free audio book like it says there is."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I simply loved this book. The characters are so rich, and the story so intricate and well written, I found it engrossing from beginning to end. I loved how the author explored Pip's journey of the desire and love, which really lives in the heart of everyone. This is a \\"must read\\" for those wanting to catch up on all the classics. I have not read much else of Dickens' work, but this story is a masterpiece."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"As I complete my reading effort of Charles Dickens' Great Expectations I feel both satisfied and enriched. This book is outside of the genre I usually read and I am greatful for having taken that leap into the unknown. The satisfaction came from a story that was not only told well but one that ended well. There, in my humble opinion, is nothing worse than experiencing a story only to find that the ending is not truely a completion. Each character and plot line is seen through to its end! The enrichment came from an insightful journey through the trials and tribulations as well as the successes and failures of these well developed characters. This adventure turns from a tale of successes and achievents to one of self realization and personal fulfillment through Mr. Dickens' skilled hand.Nothing is perfect. The story starts slowly. The reader must stick with the book to understand the fact that the beginning of the story was not simply necessary, but a foundation that supports and grows the story like no other introduction could. Some of the descriptions of places or things I found to be exporbitant. This leads to great character development but also to some tiresome chapters. As with any work of literature written durring the time period this book was written, the language is trivially dated or old.I would, and do recommend this book to my friends as one that will not simply pass the time but provide enjoyment!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I read this book when I was a kid and I still remember Pip and Estella. Amazing depiction of characters that stick with you and linger even after finishing."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I was an avid reader, but somehow things changed in my life, but thanks to my Kindle I am getting back to reading. With the Kindle reading is now convenient. Sorry for the plug, but it is true. I have read many of the \\"classics\\" in high school and college literature classes, but somehow missed this one, among others. I did watch the movie many years ago with my wife, and it was good, but of course, the book gives you so much more.Do be warned, this is not a high adventure action-packed read. It is simply a good story well-told. I was surprised to read so much to get so little, in the sense of reading many pages to find out so few or minor details. I continued to read as much and as often as I could to get through this book. It is a great story even if I think it could have been written in half the pages.It is classic for a reason, do yourself a favor and read it if you had not. I hope many high school students do not have to read this book, as it is something beyond their typical capabilities because it does not move quickly and is not too exciting. I think it is more a college level read."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Much easier to read and get into than A Tale of Two Cities. Dickens has such a sense of humor and an honest look at life. I liked the characters and I couldn't put it down towards the end. Did you know that there were actually two endings to this book? SparkNotes discusses the two endings in detail so if you've already read it and want to see what the other ending was, check out the SparkNotes."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Sometimes I wonder what is wrong with reviewers when they give great classics, like this one, low ratings. I guess it's just a case of \\"too each his own\\". I'm sure there are some books that I would think were terrible that others rave about. Having said that, I loved this book. I don't know why it took me so long to read it. I've been reading a lot of classics lately - mainly classics that my son is reading or will have to read for homeschool this year. For some reason I thought this book was on his list, but later, after I was in the middle of the novel, realized it wasn't. No matter. I'm very glad that I read it. I was surprised by how involved I became with the characters and the book when I was reading it. I couldn't put it down. I thought a book by Charles Dickens was going to be dry and boring. How wrong I was. I actually found myself grieving with the characters. I would be happy with them and angry with them when they did something that was, in my opinion, wrong or ill-advised At one point I actually found myself having a down day but couldn't put my finger on it until I realized I was at a point in the book where Pip was depressed. Some of the language and unusual expressions that are used in the book can be difficult, but, if you are a fairly well read person, you should be able to do fine. Great book!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I'm not sure how I got through school without reading it and I'm sure I would not have enjoyed it as much in my student days. However, it truly is a wonderful peek into human nature at its worst and at its best."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This being the first novel by Dickens, i didn't know whether i would like it or not. I was pleasantly surprised at how much i did like it. Usually the books that they force you to read i don't enjoy. Although this was never forced on me during high school, i know it is a popular book on high school curriculum. I found that i loved it and has become one of my favorites. I really liked the storyline and thought the characters were enjoyable. I will definitely have to pick up more of Dickens' works.SPOILER: a lot of people didn't like the new ending that Dickens wrote, saying it is too happy and that the original depressing ending was superior. I actually didn't like the original ending and didn't find the newer one to be too joyous. I read the new ending as Pip being doomed to always love Estella, making it more depressing than the original. Anyway, that was my take."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Dickens could put in some really cool surprises for the plot through his books, and this one is no different. When Pip learns who his benefactor is... whoo! I suppose some of the surprises could be predicted if you read enough, but it still makes for an interesting story, and especially good for the time it was written in.I remember reading this many years ago. This may not appeal to people who do not like 'old-fashioned writing', and yes, this book is different than many of the 'easy' novels you will find today, it is still a solid and die-hard classic with a cast of good characters and a story with enough twists and turns to keep it good. Charles Dickens wrote many fine books, and this is definitely one of them."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This book truly shows how well written a novel can be.I read this book for school, for all those who are having to read this book for school, I reccomend reading it beforehand because not doing so means finding the book dull and unnatractive while answering all the tedious questions that can ruin a book."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"my 14 year old daughter needed to read this book for one of her classes. she didn't think she would like it, but she ended up loving it. my 17 year old son is also reading it now and he also really likes it."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I love listening to it. It is beautifully done. Voices are expressive and understandable."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Some audio books are unlistenable, with inept hammy actors mucking up the text. I recently had that experience with one of my favorite books, HUCKLEBERRY FINN, which was so appallingly read by a horrible ham, I would have thrown the CDs out the car window if they hadn't belonged to my local library.This GREAT EXPECTATIONS is probably the best \\"book on CD\\" I've ever heard. Michael Page reads Dickens' great novel beautifully, giving each character exactly the right voice without ever sounding phony, hammy, or exaggerating or over-emphasizing anything.Page makes every sentence perfectly clear and delivers each line of dialog just right. His virtuosity in scenes with several characters talking at once is truly wonderful. I've never heard of Page before -- is he an actor? -- but he certainly deserves an award for his brilliant performance reading this novel, one of the crown jewels of English literature."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"My biggest complaint concerning many audio books is that they're poorly narrated--often in monotone, or with one character's dialog sounding much like the others. Not here though--this version is expertly narrated. Like other Dickens audio books, it is probably a little advanced for young children on a long car trip, but most teenagers should be able to enjoy it unless they're dolts."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I highly reccomend this book to anyone interested in reading the classics. I first read the story in high-school and immediatly fell in love with Dicken's eloquent style. His descriptions of Pip's surroundings, emotions and experiences never fail to capture my imagination and tug at my heart. Dickens can be very tough to read, but also very rewarding because you know that you are enjoying a piece of literary genius. Great Expectations provides a nice into into his style and prepares readers for his more challenging stories.The story is long, and detailed but extremely captivating. The characters are complex and the mystery will keep you turning the pages. Even if you've never considered reading Dickens before, read this one!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Hopefully, the review by Nick of Cleveland won't scare lovers of classic audiobooks from this masterpiece by Charles Dickens and Brilliance Audio.My wife and I have listened to audiobooks for years. Our interests have spanned multiple genres, including mystery, fantasy fiction, sci fi, humor, and classics. Bar none, this performance by narrator Michael Page ranks as our gold standard of audiobook narrations. The text and characters come alive exactly, I'm sure, as Dickens intended.Very, very well done!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great Expectations is an amazing novel that truly upholds the style of literature found during the Victorian period.

It's a timeless classic and one everyone should read!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Without a doubt this has to be one of the greatest novels of all time. I won't say it's the best just because once a work of art attains greatness I find it quite incomparable to other great works. Great works are ones which have fully succeeded in expressing the emotions and convictions of the artist, and without a doubt Great Expectations acheives this. Unfortunately I only hold this view of the book containing the original ending, which was not the originally published ending. (spoiler) The original ending at first seems sad and frustrating, but one can't help but to feel satisfied in knowing that through suffering Estella had gained a heart, which is much more than she would have gained through a cold and heartless relationship with Pip. The happy ending which was published is almost a fairtale ending and it perverts the themes which make the novel so relevant to reality. I must admit, like Dickens' friends and publisher, the original ending was hard for me to swallow, but as I dwelt on it and how it related to the novel, no other ending seemed appropriate, especially not a happy one."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Well, i have read all of the previous reviews, and it is apparant that people either love this book or hate this book. I was 15 when i first read this book, and have since read it again and it is probably my favorite book of all time. Yes, it is rather boring at times, and yes, it has a long, involved, and confusing plot, and yes, Charles Dickens gives very tedious descriptions of everything. But the morals and meanings portrayed in this book far outshine the faults. If you cannot find them, then it will most likely be boring and dull. If you can, it will probably become one of your alltime favorites."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I was quite disappointed reading this book after having read David Copperfield. Although both books bear some resemblances, the plot in Great Expectations is much more condensed and simpler. The story is again the orphan-boy-who-gets-away-from-home-in-search-of-a-happier-life. The plot, however, is much less intricated than it is in David Copperfied. There are fewer characters (and fewer pages!) in this book. That caused me an impression that the story is not as feasible as it is in David Copperfield. Some things seem to be rather unreal or fantastical. There are some qualities, however, that remain the same as they are in David Copperfield. The narrative, the characters descriptions and their surprising behaviour keep the reader up to the last page. So this is my advice: if you are one of those who tried to read David Copperfield but gave up because thought it was too boring or long, Great Expectations is an excellent book for you. And maybe, after you have finished it, you'll be willing to read a much better one: David Copperfield."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"i have read the book twice once last year for my teachers book report and this year for the 9th grade merit english classes. These reviews on here only describe parts of dickens story so if you do have to read this for 9th grade read it don't take the short cut because the teachers will know and when you have a test on the book you will FAIL!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"All right. I admit it. The book starts out slow. Dickens, though I love the man, writes in such flowery and long winded language at times. What takes many authors a line or two, Dickens will devote whole pages.And I almost put the book down for that exact reason. I'm very happy I did not.With so many detailed threads in the story, the depth to the characters--when they all start to blend together a few chapters in, the result is page-turning.The story centers around a young boy--well, almost young man-- named Pip, and revolves around his growing into age. You cannot help but love the boy. Much of Pip's worry and concern I could relate to--falling in love with a girl who refuses to return your sentiments and only plays with your heart, growing up and leaving home for the first time, and discovering your true relationships with others and yourself, as shocking as they may turn out to be.I felt as if I was side by side with Pip through it all, and that made the novel a wonderful experience for me. I recommend the novel for the young because so much relates to them, and also for the older readers--because you can experience it all again.A wonderful and heart warming tale. Just get through those first chapters."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"From the many rave reviews of this book, I was expecting to read a literary masterpiece.Howver,my expectations were negated, just like Pip's. This illogical story has some exciting and entertaining parts to it,as well as old fashioned humor, but as a whole it is slow and tedious.

I read it when I was a child, and having been re reading it ever since. It is told through Pip, the narrator. His voice is clear and realistic.The reader feels for him as if he were a real person. Miss Havishman is a sad character and her disappointment in love is very understandable. Mr. Jaggers the lawyer is sharp as most lawyers ought to be and are. I felt for Magwitch, Pip's benefactor. And I understood Pip's feelings towards him when they meet again after many years, Estella is not my favorite character, but she learns to be a better person. Charles Dickens is, needless to say, a timeless writer, one of the very best. Eugenia RenskoffDifferent Flags"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Charles Dickens, Great ExpectationsDickens tells an intriguing yarn, creates suspense and amuses us with a range of eccentrics, friendly such as Wemmick or Herbert Pocket, or macabre as with Pumblechook or Jaggers. As in David Copperfield, he gives us strong and often threatening women, like Betsy Trotwood, and here Mrs Joe. Both of these semi-autobiographical novels begin with a shock to a child that reverberates through the rest of the action. Both are seen from the dual child-adult perspective; both belong to the Bildungsroman genre. Both have been repeatedly adapted for stage, screen and radio drama, and yet both have their weaknesses of characterisation and narrative tedium.Several decades ago it was not unusual to find a Dickens novel as a set text for public examinations. Today this would be unheard of: \`Too long, Sir!' \`Boring, Sir!' I recall attempting to \`teach' Nicholas Nickleby to secondary modern school pupils in the Sixties. Then that outmoded method of \`reading around the class' was still in vogue. The lads enjoyed that and were doubled up laughing as Nickle Arse and Queers went about their business. Those who say they still love Dickens today, are probably thinking of one or more of the excellent BBC adaptations rather than the text of the book itself. Reading a Dickens novel today, except as a Simplified Classics text, is no mean feat.It has taken me several weeks to get through Great Expectations, reading it in bite-sized pieces, often as a Book at Bedtime treat. That is probably the best and most appropriate method, since like most Victorian novels it was designed for serialisation, which also of course accounts for the repetitiveness and the prolonging of tension by ending each Part on a cliff-hanger. It is not easy for the modern reader to read with the eagerness and innocence of his Victorian counterpart. The sheer thickness of the books and the at times plodding nature of the narrative demand a time and patience that for most of us today is in short supply.Nevertheless, I am pleased to have made the effort, and was for the most part captivated by the narrative and relished the sheer exuberance of the language, as when Dickens allows Pumblechook or Joe Gargery to indulge in their respective bumbling monologues. True, I got tired of Pip's continual self-analysis as he expounds on his guilt in rejecting the advances of good friends like Joe, Biddy and, later, the convict Magwitch aka Provis. I cringed, too, at the moral miracles of a converted Miss Havisham, kneeling before Pip. And the fire was an unconvincing contrivance. As for the cooked-up non-serial happy ending, the less said the better."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I read this book when I was in high school.

Periodically, I try to stretch myself by taking on works that I might not otherwise gravitate toward. Sometimes I am rewarded; that is how I discovered Hemingway and Vasily Grossman (much to my delight). However, I generally read for pleasure and will never be considered an erudite literary critic; in other words, you won't find me reading Shakespeare.I recall reading A Tale of Two Cities in high school and to my recollection, enjoying it. With that in mind, I was determined to give Charles Dickens another shot, with the knowledge that if it were to my liking, there would be a wealth of material at my disposal. That is how I came to read Great Expectations.The novel centers on young Pip, an orphan taken in by his domineering older sister and kind, blacksmith husband. Pip is destined for a life as an apprentice blacksmith, a member of the English lower class, until an encounter with an escaped convict radically changes the course of his life. For you see, young Pip harbors \\"great expectations\\" and a life far beyond that set before him. With the help of an anonymous \\"sponsor\\", Pip begins his journey toward life as a gentleman.When reading Dickens, Tolstoy, and even more so Shakespeare, the first hurdle is becoming familiar with the language, the style of writing and the idioms and terms used by writers of the era; even more so with Dickens, where he routinely spells words phonetically when spoken by Cockney British commoners. Somewhat offputting at first, the reader soon becomes comfortable with the style and is amply rewarded and entertained.Having read numerous novels from the period, I was well familiar with the British class system on the mid-19th century, but nowhere is its rigidity more apparent than in this work. Within days of attaining a sponsor, young Pip completely removes himself from his former friends and relatives (both geographically and socially), even expressing embarrassment for having been associated with them. There are several story threads that work themselves together nicely near the end of the novel.Having become reacquainted with Dickens, I fully expect to sample more of his work."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"First of all (as I like to say!)

The reviewer wrote of Dickens and this work &quot;The very title of this book indicates the confidence of conscious genius. In a new aspirant for public favor, such a title might have been a good device to attract attention; but the most famous novelist of the day, watched by jealous rivals and critics, could hardly have selected it, had he not inwardly felt the capacity to meet all the expectations he raised.&quot; T.A.M. then went on to state that they felt the book did in fact live up to its title.Unfortunately I am not permitted to type in the whole web address so that you could more easily find this review, but if you are interested, go to The Atlantic Monthly's website and under the section entitled &quot;Books and Critics&quot; type in &quot;greatexp.htm&quot; at the search engine.

Hating &quot;Great Expectations&quot; is kind of like hating Beethoven, Shakespeare, or Monet: O.K., it's not your taste, but it's really a waste of time to say &quot;IT SUCKED.&quot;Dickens's novel is one of the all-time champs. Unforgettable characters, beautiful writing, and a depth of understanding of human nature rarely equaled in English or American fiction. As they say in theory class, it works on many different levels. If you hated &quot;G.E.,&quot; well, then, you probably wandered into the Literature aisle by mistake. You probably also don't like &quot;Wuthering Heights,&quot; &quot;Jane Eyre,&quot; &quot;David Copperfield,&quot; or anything by Hardy or Austen, if you've bothered.Otherwise, if you love literature and haven't read &quot;Great Expectations,&quot; consider your education incomplete."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This has to be my favourite Dickens novel. In fact, I would go so far as to place it alongside Flaubert's &quot;Sentimental Education&quot; and Dostoevsky's &quot;Brothers Karamazov&quot; as one of the great novels of the 19th century. I am astonished by the number of one and two star reviews even though they do appear to come mainly from high school students being &quot;forced&quot; to read the novel for English class. Judging by the spelling mistakes and grammatical errors which proliferate these submissions, Dickens is not the only thing that they've had trouble staying awake for. In addition, it is ridiculous to suggest that Dickens's novels were so lengthy because he was &quot;being paid by the word.&quot; His books initially appeared in serial form as books were very expensive in the Victorian era and he understandably wished to avoid precluding large sections of his target readership from being able to sample them. The fact that some current &quot;readers&quot; find this novel &quot;too long and boring&quot; is, I believe, a sad reflection on our media saturated society where a two-second attention span is rapidly becoming the norm."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Why, in God's name, do high school teachers insist on stuffing this complex novel down the throats of their teen-aged students? Because the initial chapters are narrated by, Pip, a little boy we watch become a young man? Because there are pirates and bad guys in it? Because there's a sort of love story? I'm sure some high schoolers understand GREAT EXPECTATIONS but the majority of them... I don't think so.GREAT EXPECTATIONS contains many complicated, adult themes and issues that adults will surely appreciate. A virtual encyclopedia of human emotions--fear, child abuse, anticipation, disappointment, love, jealousy, manipulation--this greatest of all of Dickens' novels has everything. And all these ingredients are woven into an incredibly entangled plot, full of twists and turns. On top of all that, the novel is also a virtual encyclopedia of the layout and attitudes of Victorian London.Holding it all together is Pip's incredible perceptions into his world and his emotions. Never before had there been a character so aware of his feelings and, still, because he is human, he allows these emotions to sometimes compel him to do the opposite of what is right and best. Pip does sometimes behave like the child and young adult he is, but that doesn't mean this novel is suitable for anyone of that age.Rocco Dormarunno, author of The Five Points"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great expectations is an extremely wonderful book!this book starts talking about a boy named Pip.he is trying to live up to everybod's expectations of him while trying to live his own life.Pip was born an orphan.his older sister adopts himand thats how his sister is admired for bringing him home and raising him. she was married to joe her husband. this story really starts off when Pip meets the convict on the old church graveyard on the hill of the marshes.The convict told Pip to bring a metal file,pork pie and a meat bone. The convict was very thankful. from that day on Pipd id not tell anybody about that day. His sister later on dies and he meets a girl named estella. estella was adopted by miss Havisham. Pip loved her but miss Havisham taught her to hate all men.This book is a wonderfully good book. I would recommend this book for children ages 13-21. It is an arduous book for some readers but it is aninteresting book to read. I love books that Charles Dickens writes. He is an awesome writer. If you like to read about romance, deception, horror and drama then this is the book for you."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"English not being my native language, I never had to read Dickens in high school. I decided to try Great Expectations as my first introduction to the great English author, on the recommendation of a friend of mine. And I was not disappointed!That said, I had a bit of a difficult time at first getting used to Dickens's use of language, and I found the first part of the book a little hard to get into, but I didn't have to struggle too much or for too long: after a short while the characters came alive for me and the story became so absorbing, that I could not put the book down. The novel has a fantastic, very tight plot, and the characters are memorable. This always works for me as a reader!Great Expectations was my first Dickens read, but it will certainly not be the last."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"** This review is a synthesis of the three Charles Dickens books that I've read:A Tale of Two Cities (Penguin Classics),Great Expectations (Penguin Classics), andDavid Copperfield (Penguin Classics). The rationale for reviewing in this manner is to provide a foundational point of reference for those new to Dickens' work.In the last two years I have read, in this order, Tale of Two Cities, Great Expectations, and David Copperfield. All three of these books were exceptional reads, and if you are thinking about dipping your toes in the waters of Charles Dickens you can't go wrong with any of them. However, notwithstanding the fact that these three books are all in the upper echelon of world literature, I have no difficulty in distinguishing between them and coming to the conclusion that they are properly ordered, from \\"most best\\" to \\"least best\\": David Copperfield, Tale of Two Cities, Great Expectations.It seems generally to be the case that, for those who have read just one of Dickens' books, Great Expectations is the book most people have been exposed to. And most people who read Great Expectations love it. The genre is probably best described as romance meshed with individual tragedy among numerous characters. However, perhaps the strongest part of the book is the manner in which the secondary characters present a contrast to the primary story. I liked the book very much, but I think it suffers from two flaws not present in the other works reviewed here. First, the characters are not as believable as in the other two works. Second, the plot follows an unlikely path, especially in the end. Concerning this second point, it should be noted that Dickens struggled with the ending of this work, and I think it shows.Tale of Two Cities ranks second in this group in my mind. This book is a combination of political intrigue, romance, and personal triumph. I rank this book above Great Expectations for the sole reason that the characters in this book are so strongly developed. I don't think I have been exposed to more memorable characters in any book I've ever read. The story is interesting, too, because it takes place against the backdrop of a historical event, the French Revolution. I think Dickens had an easier time writing a convincing plot in this story than in Great Expectations because he had the aid of a real historical event.Great Expectations and Tale of Two Cities are both excellent books, but David Copperfield is simply the best piece of literature I've ever read. To be sure, I'm only 24 and have only read 10 pieces of classic literature since my high school years. However, David Copperfield so outdid anything I've read that I feel more than comfortable in recommending it as certainly one of the best books of all time. Dickens did a remarkable job of capturing a wide variety of human emotions and mindsets. He was aided in this by two things. First, the length of the book gave him space to fully develop his sentiments. Second, the book is written in a first-person autobiographical voice, which I think made capturing sentiments much easier than in attempting to narrate them in the third-person. Further, because the book chronicles David's life from childhood through middle-age the reader is exposed to a wide variety of human thoughts. The characters, for the most part, are more believable and the plot is generally good; I took offense to only one chapter in the whole book.Now, if you haven't read any of Dickens' books, I don't recommend starting with David Copperfield. I would start with Great Expectations and work through a couple others before David Copperfield. In terms of the plots, David Copperfield is much more similar to Great Expectations than Tale of Two Cities. So if you loved Great Expectations I think you will be well satisfied with David Copperfield. The plot from Tale of Two Cities is the odd-ball of this trio. In any case, all three of these books are great pieces of literature... enjoy."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Many people scoffed this book back in my freshman English class, because it was Dickens, and Dickens meant \\"boring\\" to them. However, shrug off the normal tendencies to stereotype an old-time classic to be a bore, one can find a true delight in this beautiful story of a young man struggling with an impossible love, the pressures of money and society, and, of course, himself. It is an excellent, absolutely enriching read."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This is certainly one of my favorite books. It's about a boy named Pip who struggles to find his own identity. While struck with unfortunate circumstances, Pip remains resilient and continues his struggle in becoming a \\"gentleman.\\" Truly a Brittish classic, it has been called the unofficial autobiography of Dickens and it can be easily called one of his best works. The novel is filled with symbolism and characters that come to life as you read the pages. This book still graces my shelves and I look forward to reading it again. I recommend you pick it up and rea it too."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Perhaps the greates novel I have ever read. Not only enjoyable but contained relevan lessons for my life - you can't escape who you or where you come from by changing your circumstance."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Like several of the people on this review page, I had to read this book for a 9th grade English assignment. Unlike most of the people in my class, I read the whole book and liked it. The book is about a young English boy named Phillip \\"Pip\\" Pirrip living in 1800s England. He is the son of a blacksmith and then is invited to play at an old woman's house. The impression Pip gets from the old woman and her daughter is that Pip isn't good enough. From then on, he grows up and tries to get better for his life after getting a fortune, but things go downhill from that as he gets deep in debt and becomes ill. This book is by no means perfect and has plenty of flaws. The book is way too wordy and could probably be half as long as it is and still get a good point across. I also felt that the ending of the book was a little strange, but overall it was an okay book and I was not bored with it at any point."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"...the defect of almost all the movies (except, perhaps, the 1989 version with Jean Simmons as Miss Havisham (!)) is that the movies emphasize Pip's pursuit of Estella to the exclusion of almost all else. In truth, the core of the story is Pip's class strivings and his inability to distinguish the valuable from the shiny and superficial. Read the book and you will appreciate the character Biddy who is the polar opposite of Estella in every way, and the way, to paraphrase Othello, Pip \\"threw a pearl away richer than all he yearned for.\\"Some of Dickens' characters and coincidences are a little stretched, but they nevertheless are woven together very nicely in the fashion of a good suspense novel. Great Expectations is divided into three volumes, each representing a phase of Pip's Expectations. The structure is strangely like \\"The Monkey's Paw\\": The first expectation (wish) is for riches; the second expectation finds the granted wish not exactly what the protagonist thought it would be; and the third and final expectation leaves the protagonist trying to pick up the pieces.As another reviewer commented, do get an edition that includes the original ending. It is only a few paragraphs but it wraps up this morality tale in a way that is appropriate to the entire theme of the story. If you wonder where the \\"new, happier\\" ending was substituted, just look for the place in the very last chapter where Pip suddenly changes direction and makes a lie of what he has just told his family.If you feel that you cannot sit through the novel, then at least get the 1989 film version (though it is out of print--you will have to pay a little more than you might like) and watch it for probably the accurate representations of the various characters, if not some of the stellar performances of the most acclaimed 1946 version. If nothing else, you will see something very rare for any actor or actress--the opportunity to define two characters in the same classic. In 1946, Jean Simmons' Young Estella defined \\"beautiful but cruel\\" for a generation, and in 1989 the same Ms. Simmons revealed the pain but even greater cruelty of Miss Havisham."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This is another book which is forced upon unsuspecting high school students. With many younger reviewers giving this classic 1 and 2 stars shows that this novel will not be appreciated by most studetns. If you hated this book in high school I recommend picking it up again after college.This novel follows the protagonist Pip, from inncocent boy, to dreaming adolecent, to proud gentelman, and comes full circle to the disullusioned adult. Tha characters he meets along the way are some of the most memorable in english literature, especially Miss Havishham, Estella, and Magwitch. Dickens also treats us, about half-way through, to perhaps the best twist of any novel I've ever read.The only thing I at first disliked about this novel were the bizarre coincidinces which caused seemingly unrelated characters to actually have close histories with each other. But I reconciled this for myself in the following way: A major theme of this novel are the machinations of characters to control other characters. Well we must not forget that there are meta-machiantions above this by Dickens himself, and for that all readers can be thankful."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Charles Dickens' Great Expectations portrays the life of the protagonist, Pip, and how he begins as a mistreated orphan and transforms into a gentleman with a mysterious benefactor. Set in the mid 19th century, Great Expectations is a novel with a surprising plot that keeps its readers guessing. Its' intriguing story line and interesting characters keep the story light-hearted and humerous, but Dickens' dreary descriptions and gloomy details bring also a sense of sadness and compassion to the novel. Aside from the novel being time consuming, indepth, and in great detail, Great Expectations is a classic novel that all should read."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Though someone stated you have to be over 21 to appreciate this book (and I am 21 now) I first read this story when I was 14 years old, in 8th grade, and understood (and loved) it right away. Why? As an adolescent struggling with popularity (the modern, teenage equivalent of the English class system) and unrequited love, I immediately identified with Pip. Furthermore, the romantic atmosphere was completely intoxicating, from the vast marshes to the city of London; though the narrator describes it as disappointingly crowded and dirty my sense of the city from this book was much more elevated. I also admit I was helped by the updated Classics Illustrated comic book version of the book, which I peeked at now and then while I was reading Great Expectations--despite my aversion to revealing the ending before I reached it in the text (eventually, I succumbed to my temptations). If you can find this (probably) out-of-print illustrated version of the story--not sure what the status of Classic Illustrated is these days--make sure to buy it. But to return from my digression, the novel is where it's at. Dickens' impeccable imagination creates an vivid sense of place, an unforgettable cast of characters (including the ultimate romantic ideal: Estella), a rich and textured story, and an immortal message of aspiration, disappointment, and dreams. This story really fired my imagination as a teenager, so I encourage those youngsters who may be dissuaded from reading it to pick it up--I'm not guaranteeing you'll like it but if you read it before you're forced to you just may find something valuable in it. As for the rest of you \\"grown-ups\\" if you haven't read this masterpiece yet, get off yer asses and take a trip to the local library. It'll make your day."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I have absolutely no doubts whatsoever that Charles Dickens, if he lived today, would still classify as an author's author. He's a master of all the things that make for great writing and storytelling. Dickens has an ear for dialogue most authors would kill their own mothers to possess. He also is a master of creating vivid scenery, another sign of excellence essential to great writing and one which many authors lack. Finally, but not least in importance, Dickens knows character development. He REALLY knows how to develop intriguing characters, to the point where many of his books spawned figures that have become literary archetypes. Not bad for a guy who grew up in extremely adverse circumstances. He even spent some time in a factory sticking labels on bottles after his father's imprisonment for debt. Most people wouldn't recover from such poverty, but Dickens did. He went on to a successful career in journalism before settling down as an author of serial novels. This format, which allowed Dickens to write and release his stories piecemeal, made him a great success with the public. The anticipation for the latest chapter or two of his stories often led to near riots. Not many writers can elicit such a response today.Many consider \\"Great Expectations\\" a seminal work by a master. Millions have read it, most unwillingly, but most consider it one of Dickens's most accessible stories. It's a tale about a youngster named Phillip Pirrip, known throughout the story as Pip, and his rise from relative obscurity to the heights of wealth and privilege. As the story opens, we see Pip lamenting the passing of his parents in the local cemetery. Their deaths resulted in Pip living with an older sister and her blacksmith husband Joe. Life is tough in Pip's village. His sister wields a heavy hand against her younger brother, relatives like Uncle Pumblechook berate him, and they live in a place where convicts often escape from barges floating on the river nearby. In fact, Pip has a frightening encounter with one of these prisoners at the beginning of the book. His actions, undertaken at the command of this felon, result in a series of incidents that lead Pip to the home of the local recluse, a dour old woman by the name of Havisham. This woman, as rich as a lord but as unhappy as one could ever be, takes a liking to Pip and keeps him around for entertainment.It is during his tenure as Havisham's court jester that Pip comes into contact with several important figures that feature prominently in the story's later episodes. He meets the cold yet beautiful Estella, Havisham's adopted daughter, and falls in love with her. He also makes an initial contact with the old lady's lawyer, the highly successful Mr. Jaggers, and an odd young man named Herbert. All play an integral part in what is to follow, namely the announcement (through Jaggers) that Pip has suddenly come into fortune, or great expectations, that require him to move to London in order to train as a gentlemen. In London Pip spends time with Jaggers, his assistant Wemmick, Herbert, and even Estella. He spends his money, helps his best friend in covert ways, and wonders who in the world set him up with this money and property. Jaggers makes it clear that he isn't supposed to dig too deep concerning the origins of the fortune. Instead, he is to wait until the day when the individual responsible steps forward. When that happens Pip's world as he knows it nearly collapses. He must move heaven and earth to avert disaster while at the same time coming to terms with who he is and what his future holds.\\"Great Expectations\\" is, in a word, great. It contains all of the hallmarks one associates with Dickens. The characters, everyone from Wemmick to Jaggers to Havisham to Joe, sparkle brightly as fully formed individuals living and laboring under very real problems. Atmosphere is divine: Pip's village and London come to life under the writer's pen. Even the author's penchant for examining social ills moves to the fore in a chapter that looks at the horrific conditions in London's main prison. Another real plus is the humor. If you haven't read Dickens, you don't know what your missing in the humor department. This author has an amazing sense of what is funny, and it is nowhere more apparent than in the scene in which Pip and Herbert take in a play starring one of our hero's relatives. This short chapter along with the ones describing Wemmick's abode are absolute masterpieces of hilarity, and they're actually bright spots in what is otherwise an occasionally dark piece of writing. And last, but not least, there is the downbeat conclusion. There are actually two conclusions to \\"Great Expectations\\". Make sure you pick up a copy that has both of them.About the only thing \\"Great Expectations\\" lacks is length; it's one of Dickens's shortest novels, which is probably the reason millions of teachers assign this book to their students. That's unfortunate because most kids want nothing to do with this book once it's forced upon them when in fact they could actually benefit from reading it. Why? Because \\"Great Expectations\\" teaches us a lot about love and identity, two things that matter quite a bit (or should matter) to young people. The teachers ought to assign something like \\"Hard Times\\" and let those who want more seek out \\"Great Expectations\\". The prevailing opinion on this book is that it is semi-autobiographical. It doesn't really matter whether the story is about the author's life or not. What is important, I think, is that this story attains a perfection that few books ever reach. That's why it's a classic, I guess. If you haven't read Dickens before, you should start right here."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great Expectations, 1860-'61, Dickens's second to last completed novel is the first tome I have ever read and is one of the best books I've ever read.The story centers upon Pip who is orphaned and lives with his mean sister and her kind husband Joe. The book's classic opening is when Pip meets an escaped convict and he forces Pip to give him food and then later is caught. Little did Pip know that this occasion will live on and he will be reminded of it in a very unexpected fashion later in the bookYoung Pip is then sent to Satis House to meet the very mysterious and eccentric Miss Havisham who, jilted at the altar spends the rest of her cursed recluse life in her rotting, yellow wedding dress in Satis House. Pip also meets Estella, a beautiful, yet very cold and proud girl brought up by Miss Havisham to hate men as revenge for her fiance's betrayal.Great Expectations is the story of Pip's life and of all the surprises (there's a lot of 'em folks) hopes: some lived some smashed, and of course, Dickensesque eccentrics who populate the book.Great Expectations is the first tome I have ever finished and I must say that it was worth it. Since I didn't have the book for a while, it took me about three months to read it but have no fear, for this is a pretty quick read with many twists and turns along the way.This book is often considered Dickens's masterpiece. Well, I don't really know about that but it has to be close to that. It certainly was a great read and I think you will agree."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I've taught this book in 9th grade for years because it is a curriculum requirement. During that time, I have raved about the incredible abilities of Dickens to create memorable characters, plot fascinating fiction, make the lives of ordinary people in England memorable, write incredibly descriptive passages . . . .The time has come to tell the truth. While it may be a great *work of literature*, Great Expectations is a tough book to like.There is much to appreciate - in the intellectual sense of the word - about GE, from carefully drawn characters to an infinitely detailed plot. Without exception, students love to play *connect the characters* as the novel progresses. They discuss the unrequited love between Pip and Estella, Biddy and Pip - they love the relationship between Joe and Pip. They are fascinated and repulsed by Miss Havisham and her house. They are shocked by Magwitch, and enthralled by his sacrifice. Truly, this has all the makings of a 9th grade *hit*! So what's the problem? Language,length, and format.The language is off-putting. So much is colloquial to the time and difficult to bring current. Joe's dialect (along with the convict's) is VERY difficult for my deep south students to imitate when reading aloud, and sometimes even difficult for them to decipher at all. Sentences can go on (and on and on and on and on) so that the end hardly seems connected to the beginning. While common when Dickens was writing, these patterns are a bit difficult for a modern audience.Length and format are a problem that go together. Originally published as a serial, this novel was presented a chapter or two at a time, with a wait between installments. That allowed a reader to digest the events in a chapter, contemplate the relationships, discuss them with friends and build up anticipation for the next installment. By virtue of that style, many side-stories are included that have little bearing on the overall plot. Likewise, there is much detail included that seems almost irrelevant when one is reading the novel in full. Those are the very things that fostered interest in the serial, and yet in a novel, they seem extraneous and confusing. At the end, the novel seems (just a bit) overwritten (and perhaps that is because it wasn't originally a novel).In summary, my feelings about this novel are mixed. The story itself is fascinating, but I find myself eternally dreading that time of year when I will yet again introduce it to another crop of unsuspecting students . . ."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"In this delightful edited version of Dickens immortal tale, Hugh Laurie reads.

I must have read it many times since, and everytime I read it, I am filled with array of emotions, and a deep respect for the author. Pip, the hero, is a character that embodies hopes, disappointments and dreams of every boy. As he narrates his life, we grow with him, see many people come in and go out of his life, and we feel with him his emotions and predicaments. Life is full of surprises, unexpected twists and turns, and this novel is a great chronicle of the possibilities of fate. But most importantly, this is a story of pining... and a novel worth pining for.Miss Havisham, the old lady, epitomizes eccentricity, while Estella in her cold abandon represents every heartbreaker. This story is about pining, about love, about friendship (especially Pip and Joe, and later Pip and Herbert), about relationships, and most importantly about what one feels and lives by. Like all Dickens novels, this is a very well written story, and is much more engrossing than any of its on screen versions. This is a story that must be read at leisure and it must be failing of the reader to try and compare it with some cheap paperback that one can scram through while watching a movie and munching chips and cola.

Do not touch it if you like literature!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"In honor of Charles Dickens' 200th birthday, I re-read one of the first of his novels that I experienced originally over 30 years ago. After having read some eight or nine other Dickens novels, revisiting Great Expectations was a somewhat different experience this time around.Like David Copperfield, this is a first person narrative. Being inside the mind of the central intelligence and narrator, the reader can only know what he knows. Therefore, there are fewer narrative threads and multitudes of characters to weave into a complex tapestry than there are in other great multi-layered novels such as Bleak House and Little Dorrit. The jovial wit and exuberance of Pickwick becomes saturated with a world weariness and verges on cynicism in most of the novels of the second half of Dickens' career. As one of his last completed novels, Great Expectations fits within this pattern.Pip is not quite the bland, colorless character that Oliver Twist or David Copperfield are. True, the structure of the plot almost demands that he be a passive recipient of much of the action. His fate is mapped out for him by the anonymous benefactor from his youth and it is not until well into the second half of the novel that he actively seeks to steer the course of his life with each subsequent piece of knowledge he acquires. Pip is not quite an innocent. From an early age, he is consumed by guilt over unknown sins he feels he has committed. He does fall prey to vanity and he descends easily into spendthrift habits and enjoys his unearned prosperity with shameless hedonism. His greatest sins seem to be pride and vanity, leading to the snobbery that fuels the snubbing of his faithful and saintly brother-in-law Joe. To his credit, he is self-analytical and examines these shortcomings as soon as he realizes he possesses them.The sentimentality that often mars even the greatest of Dickens' novels is muted in this one. Pip is fully aware that he is no angel and there are few \`catch phrases' as often appear in his other novels to signal the reader to be moved. On the other hand, the coincidences are piled a little too high for my taste and the evil Orlick subplot seems to be one adversity too many for this plot which can sustain its own weight on the saga of Pip, Estella, Miss Havisham and Magwich.As much as any novel, in Great Expectations Dickens captures the torture of a male's infatuation with an \`unattainable' female beauty, especially one so willing to inflict heartache. This novel still reaches across the centuries with an emotional power that is timeless and universal. Regarding the so called happy ending that Dickens revised as a concession to public sentiment, the ending for this novel is not quite so clear cut as one might expect in a Dickens novel. The last sentence, in particular, includes a double negative that in no obvious way equals an unequivocal positive. By doing this, Dickens is able to sustain the tone of the novel leading up to it and not betray the thematic thread he has followed for almost 500 pages. Despite its shortcomings, Great Expectations possesses a power never surpassed in his novels."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Anyone who loves the english langauge language will enjoy this book. Dickens is a master of description bringing to life the colorful characters. So, if you haven't read Dickens for years, pay him a visit ."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I had great expectations, because I had listened to a very good Charles Dickens recording by Martin Jarvis earlier (Hard Times), and Great Expectations was also good, even if it did not make me laugh quite as much as the Hard Times audiobook."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Read this when I was about 10yrs old, then saw the movie at an old theatre. I've probably reread at least a few times later. Never gets old, its like replaying an old classic.I remember reading the other books in print and it didn't have any guides or history or word translations. Used a dictionary and encyclopedia to figure certain things out.I purchased the BN classic and it provides a bit more history that one would have known, unless you've done a research paper on it. Other helpful insight & information one may not know during that time period or era. BN does a pretty good job."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great Expectations by Charles Dickens is one of the greatest novels I have read. First, I admit, I have difficult transitioning to Dicken's novels. They are written in English, but not in the version of the langauge I speak. However, after reading for a while, I am able to adjust to his style.This novel is great for many reasons. First, it helps me to understand the poverty and hardships faced by the poor in England during his time. Whenever I read one of Dicken's novels, I am always left with an attitude of gratitude. Additionally, in this novel, nothing works out the way I expect or want it to. I wish that Pip would not have acted as he did once he came into his great expectations. I wish that things could have worked out differently with Miss Havisham and Estella. But, the ending is well done. The twists are what I enjoy most from Dicken's novels. I highly recommend this novel."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"As background information, I am in the process of reading most of Dickens 22 novels. I bought the Penguin Popular Classics version of the novel. It is very basic and comes in a simple green cover. It contains no introduction or analysis, just the text plus a very brief historical sketch of Dickens. It seems to be an excellent value for the money and I bought three Dickens novels in the series. I was a bit disappointed in that one book seemed to fall apart as I read it: the binding seemed very weak and cheaply made. It was marginally okay for the present book which is just 400 pages, and the book did not fall apart, but did seem damaged after one read. Another Dickens novel, which was 700 pages long, fell apart with at least 50 pages coming loose. After this bad experience, I bought other versions of Dickens's works - Wordsworth Classic versions and the regular Penguin Classic versions, the ones with the photo on the covers.Charles Dickens, who lived from 1812 to 1870, is the best know male English writer of the 19th century. He authored 22 novels plus numerous short pieces. Most of his writing was first written in serialized form, later published as single novels.A young Dickens at the age of 12 had the unenviable job of attaching labels 10 hours a day at the Warren's boot blacking factory. That experience shaped much of his writing career. Still in his teens he became a law clerk, then later in his twenties a journalist. The last job as a reporter led to the serialized writing of his novels. His works were social commentaries with larger than life characters, or colorful caricatures, living in the slums of London. He was a critic of poverty, social injustice, and the slow moving court system. Those themes permeate most of his novels and it is present her in Great Expectations. This is a novel set in London and the countryside close to London. It is a story of a young boy who wants to grow up and become wealthy and to be a gentleman. Those are his \\"great expectations.\\"Without giving away critical plot elements, it is the story of a young boy called Pip, whose parents are dead, and who lives with his sister and her husband Jo who is a blacksmith. They want Pip to learn the trade and be a blacksmith as well. They live in a small town near marshlands near London. His ambitions are grander and he wants to escape to London and become a gentleman. Will Pip find happiness? Will he succeed? Action shifts back and forth between the small town where Pip first lived and the city of London. It involves Pip, lawyers, accountants, Pip's new friends, his love interest, etc.The novel is not used by Dickens for any pressing social issues, although one might argue that it shows how Pip's ambition blinds him to his true friends. But mostly it is pure entertainment. The book is a classic but has a choppy feel that one can attribute to the way it was written. It was written as a series of dramatic stories for popular serialization which were then combined to make a single novel. I enjoyed the read and would highly recommend the book.Having read 10 of Dickens's novels I still rate David Copperfield as best, and ahead of the present book, both as a work of literature and for entertainment value. In many ways the two novels are similar, but the plot is far more interesting and realistic in David Copperfield, and Dickens has many more interesting characters in that book, and as a bonus it is almost twice as long."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I have loved this book since I first read it in high school.

I have also become a great admirer of the work of Frank Muller, who has recorded countless works, both popular novels and classics (including Moby Dick, the brave soul!)When Mr. Muller sank his teeth into Great Expectations, he created a performance with the perfect combination of innocence, humor, irony and adventure. He had me laughing out loud despite being stuck in terrible rush hour traffic.The actor manages to become the characters to the point where you forget only one man is reading all of the parts. He has created convicts you could easily picture, and almost smell. His portrayal of Joe Gargery makes you love the character for his heart of gold. His portrayal of Wemmick's \\"castle\\" and the \\"ancient\\" was so hilarious I was almost in tears.Of course, Dickens had quite a bit to do with it too.I realize there are countless recordings of this great work, and I'm sure this won't be the last I will ever hear. But I will always remember Frank Muller's rendition with great appreciation and a broad smile."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great Expectations is a novel that will keep you interested all throughout. It follows the interesting story of a boy named Pip throughout his many life experiences and different phases of his expectations. The plot is connected in a unique way throughout the book, and mysteries are solved and connected with it. Through his beautiful writing and interesting plot, this novel is arguably Dickens's greatest work. The language does require your full attention to understand it, and it is a very long book, but the writing is so great that you don't really notice to much.The tone of the novel is pretty dark and gloomy, but there is a constant sense of hope throughout. With themes of social class, guilt and innocence, and ambition we see Pip grow as a person and learn about the struggles and trials in life. There is also a bit of a love story that occurs that puts some fey real emotion into the story.I would reccomend this book to younng adults and adults who have the ability to understand the writing. I would reccomend that a person read it when they are looking for a good book, but have plenty of time to read and really take the story in. You need full attention to read it, but it is well worth the time it takes."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Of all the Dickens novels I've read, this one is certainly the most atmospheric and perhaps the most true to life. In terms of art, this is probably his supreme achievement. The plot isn't as convoluted as it is in Bleak House. The action is more dramatic. The female characters, particularly Estella, are more believable and (in the case of Miss Havisham, for instance) more intriguing. The sentimentality and the overall length are under tighter control. The humor still abounds. The language is easier to read but no less descriptive. No, it's not a perfect work -- there are still cloying and annoying characters and incidents, and far too many ridiculous coincidences -- but to me, at least, Great Expectations is Dickens' greatest achievement."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"The book \\"The Great Expectations\\" was probably originally intended for middle-class adults in London. Today however the book is read and understood by both children and adults. Some things about the book that made it worth reading was first and most obvious the story line. Also the book seemed to go really fast. The story started with action wich made the book more enjoyable to read. Also it didn't get bogged down very much throughout the entire story. Another good quality of the book is that it didn't contain much romance, which can also slow a good book down. The main point of the book that affection, loyalty, and consience are more important than social advancement, wealth, and class, could have a strong affect on certain communities. Since this sort of theme has been around for a while and will continue to be around for a while gives the book credit for being a classic. Also the fact that this book is fairly old and is still being read to this day makes it a classic. The book was written in great detail. All the characters were fully described and all served a purpose. That also made this book very interesting. I would recommend this book to middle school students, and to adults as well as anyone in between. This book and the main idea was not difficult to understand. Also it is enough of an action and \\"turn around\\" book that it keeps the readers attention even to the end."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great Expectations by Charles Dickens was a very good novel in my eyes. The main character Pip believed, as a true Victorian, that a gentlemen is made solely of financial aspects and physicall possessions, and he is oblivious to moral aspects of the positions. Upon recieving his great expectations, he moves to London for a further education, and to become what he thinks is a gentlemen. Through Pips life he learns that his life as a gentlemen is not what he thought it would be, and his views of a true gentlemen start to change. With thanks to Dickens and Great Expectations, we realize that sometimes even a convict may be more genteel than a traditional gentlemen. He may start as a poor orphan boy, like Pip, or labour as a blacksmith, like Joe. truly, what matters is the heart and inner worth that make a genuine gentlemen, and social prestige has not a bit to do with it."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Although one of the first Dickens books that I've read, it is still one of my favourites. The scenes with Miss Haveisham's ghost wedding banquet are haunting and have stuck with me for years. We see how Pip saw this abandoned wedding banquet, and then we follow Pip and his subsequent relationship with Miss Havisham as he grows up. Miss Havisham, for some reason has resolved to take out her considerable vindictiveness on little Pip, and we see how this moulds little Pip's character. We also see the positive effect that a prisoner (Joe Gargery) has on Pip. The tone of this novel is quite gloomy throughout, but it does end on a positive note. Although gloomy, it does have Dickens' usual warmth and humour displayed throughout, and of course his wonderful characters. This is a book that will stay with you for a long time."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"great expectations is just that. i am not much of a classics fan, preferring contemporary writers. i decided to read this after reading john irving's \\"trying to save piggy sneed, in this book irving finishes with an essay on dickens where he says that great expectations was the book that made him want to write. being a big irving fan, i decided to read great expectations and i have to admit i was blown over by dickens' writing style. the humour, the characterisation, the verbal jugglery, the pompousness, the joy of writing were all apparent and absolute fun. the best thing about the book is that it hasnt aged one bit.dickens writes with rare moral courage and compassion for the failings of his characters, he creates a vividly colourful world populated by extraordinary characters too bizarre to be real, yet makes us trust in them, and slowly makes us sympathise with them and eventually grow to love them. the strength of this book is not in its plot but rather in the style of writing.a thoroughly enjoyable book if you love a colourful writing style."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I have to read this book for highschool, and even though I'm not through with it quite yet, I think it's a lot better than I expected. Charles Dickens threw in a few parts that I thought were kind of exciting. In the beginning, you really have to get used to different spellings of words, like &quot;skilful&quot;, for example, but after you get into the book more, you catch on.The main character, Pip, goes from being a boy raised by his sister, to becoming a gentleman. In his journey, he meets several different people, like Ms. Havisham and Estella, for example. There are many different things he must go through before he is told he has an opportunity to become a gentleman. Now I just have to see how it ends!I'd recommend it to people who are older than highschool, just because I think you'd enjoy and understand it a lot more! But if you're a real bookworm, you'd like it. :)"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"&quot;Great Expectations&quot; is an extraordinary novel of a young boy's journey to adulthood. We meet Pip as he describes his sister who &quot;raised him by hand.&quot; However, despite his misgivings about his sister he still feels very fondly towards his brother-in-law Joe Gargery. He meets many extraordinary characters along the way one of them being the classic literary figure Miss Havsiham. Miss Havisham had a broken heart and she raised her daughter Estealla to view men the same way she did. As Pip grows up and moves out on his own he becomes the only person to know the true identity of Estella. The other important character in &quot;Great Expectations&quot; is a criminal. He had threatened Pip in the marshes when he was a young boy and came back from New Zealand many years later to see Pip again. All though the criminal meets his untimely demise we still grow close to the character and miss him when he goes. This book gives an excellent view of not only a young boy's thoughts and emotions but outlook as well. It takes you on a journey that provides you with many lessons that can be carried throughout your life. Despote the magnificence and brilliance of the author's writing it is still a very difficult book. Dickens gives an amazing outlook on life and he deserves the recognition he has gotten, even since his death. &quot;Great Expectations&quot; is a true classic and deserves to go down in literary history."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Absolutely one of my favorite books ever written... superb, intense and emotional, this books is highly reccommended to anyone who likes literature. Follows the coming of age of Pip, who is realized so fully that the reader cant help but identify with him, and come to feel as if he knows him. Anything by Dickens is bound to be something special, but in my opinion this one takes the cake."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This is a great story of Pip (Philip Pirrip)'s obsessive love for a woman who neither loves him nor seems in any way the typical heroine. As he strives to become a gentleman, aided by an anonymous benefactor's money, he succeeds only in alienating those who love him best and most honestly. Appearances, as in most Dickens novels, are deceiving, and those who are wealthy in a material sense are not those who are wealthy in the emotional sense and vice versa.The language and sentence structure are both complex; if you have any difficulty in understanding this sort of English you'd do well to wait awhile before reading GREAT EXPECTATIONS, because Dickens' brilliance is in the wording. This is less humorous than many of his other stories; however the humor is there if you look for it and listen for it in the phrasing.Dickens provided two endings for this book, and, frankly, I don't care much for either...but read the book, read both endings, and decide for yourself."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This is a story that only Dickens could tell, and no Hollywood screenwriter can capture the same. Dickens created characters that can not be placed in another time. Pip is a blacksmith apprentince and meets up with a man in a graveyard named Magwitch. He helps Magwitch out and then Magwitch takes the blame and gets sent to Australia to pay for Pip's crime. Pip is then invited to play at Miss Havisham's manor with her ward Estella. And Miss Havisham uses Estella to despise any man. Since Miss Havisham was betrayed by her husband to at the altar by not showing up, she feels it's her life's duty to make all men suffer. So Estella makes Pip feel horrible for his hands and only allows him to get close enough to toil with him. You feel so sorry for Pip and how he is tormented by Estella. All the while he gets money from an unannounced bennefactor that turns his life around. And he moves to London to become a gentlemen. A great story about friendship. Dickens created quite a story that nobody can quite capture the same."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"After having finished the novel and feeling uncertain as to what was meant by the ambiguous ending, I did some research in some critical journals. Lo and behold, I came to find that the sentence, as published in this edition, is NOT what was supposed to have been written. Doubtless it is a (large) typographical error, but it changed the entire ending of the novel. Shameful to have happened, particularly for a book that markets itself towards classrooms and reading groups.The only good thing that developed from this experience is that through my research I discovered an alternate ending that Dickens had originally intended to use. Reading about the controversy between the two endings was interesting. Aladdin's nonsensical third ending was not. Further, it makes me wonder what else in the story was horribly wrong......Great novel, but don't buy it from Aladdin. I won't be buying anything further from them in the future."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I had thought of reading this book many times and am glad I finally gave it a read.

The notes in the Oxford Classics edition are much better (more thorough and more informative), and so is the introduction. George Bernard Shaw's introduction to this Modern Library edition is an intelligent piece of criticism, but it's also very partial and shortsighted. There's nothing terribly wrong with the Modern Library edition, but it's not the best one. I have used this for a class I was teaching, but next time I'll be using the Oxford Classics instead (unless something better comes along in the meantime)."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This is a great classic.

As Pip comes into a small fortune, and becomes a \\"gentleman\\" he learns the value and true meaning of friendships and life. But the journey is a long one, with many lessons to be learned along the way before he can find his true self. Dickens has given us a wonderful story, with rich details of the setting and characters that grow and are among the most interesting and magnetic to be found in literature.I don't need to go on and on about the book itself(although I could easily go over my allotted word count here), if you haven't read it yet ,just know you are in for one heck of a literary treat. It is a story that will transport you to another time and place, and you may not want to come back. I will however, talk about this marvelous audio book. Michael Page is the reader, and what a reading he gives. Just curl up and listen to this master storyteller. Every voice, every nuance is captured. There is no doubt who is speaking as he gives each character the personality and cultural characteristics as Dickens intended. He even does the women wonderfully, without going over the top. In my mind Miss Havisham has always sounded just the way Page portrayed her, Estella as uppity as ever,the humble Joe, along with all the rest.If you are a fan of this book, this audio edition will give you a fresh read and new appreciation of this fascinating book. If you are experiencing it for the first time, you can't help but to become enthralled. Great to take on long drives or for younger readers to be introduced to classic literature in a most entertaining way.Enjoy the read...for the 1st Time or the 50th time!....Laurie"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Read this book in high school many years ago and probably did not understand the story fully.

Pip's parents die when he is young making him an orphan. Pip is \\"brought up by hand\\" by his sister, who treats him with scorn. His sister's lack of love, however, is tempered by her husband Joe, a blacksmith. Joe is a simple, uneducated man and Pip's only \\"friend\\" during childhood. Pip commiserates with Joe about his sister's verbal thrashings, trying to make the best of his unhappy upbringing.Early in the story, Pip has an encounter with a convict in the cemetery among the marshes near his home. Unbeknownst to him, this man would be the source for his \\"Great Expectations\\" later in life.One day Pip is invited to the home of Ms. Havisham. Ms. Havisham is a single, eccentric, old woman who stopped living in the real world many years earlier when she was spurned by her lover on her wedding day.Ms. Havisham has adopted the beautiful Estella, and from the moment Pip meets her, he is infatuated with her beauty. Estella represents wealth, education, success, and opportunity--things Pip values but thinks he will never have.Dissatisfaction within himself grows as he wants to be more in life than a partner with Joe in the forge. Pip becomes unhappy not only with himself, but also with Joe, who represents what he does not want to be--uneducated and simple. Failing to appreciate Joe's moral character, Pip's world view begins to change as he sees education as something to be attained--the sure way out of his wretched life and the means by which he could woo the object of his unmerited affections, Estella.Pip's life changes dramatically when he is visited by a well respected and fiercely admired lawyer, Mr. Jaggers, who brings him an unusual message. Mr. Jaggers tells Pip he is to receive \\"Great Expectations,\\" but the benefactor is to remain anonymous until and only if they choose to reveal their identity. Pip mistakenly assumes the benefactor is Ms. Havisham, and the manipulating, self serving woman does nothing to dissuade him from his incorrect assumptions.The story takes Pip to London where he lives a life of excess and discards many virtues from his childhood. He no longer wants anything to do with Joe and believes his future course has been immutably set--that he is to marry the beautiful Estella. He shares his indulgences with his new friend, Herbert, whose acquaintance he had made years earlier at Ms. Havisham's place. The two of them rack up excessive debt as Pip sees himself as \\"a man in waiting\\" for all his fortunes to come to pass.Things are not what they seem, however. It is eventually revealed that the benefactor is not Ms. Havisham but the convict, Mr. Magwitch, whom Pip had met in the cemetery many years earlier when he was a young, impressionable boy.Pip is confronted face to face with the despised convict, hounded by the remembrances of him torturing him in the cemetery, dreams that lingered, causing him much consternation. But now he has to accept the undeniable truth that his turn of fortune is not because of Ms. Havisham's provision, but the despicable convict's desire to make him a gentleman. The convict wants his life to be redeemed for something good and chooses Pip to be that vehicle.Through a series of events, Pip acknowledges the inexcusable way he has treated Joe and wants to make amends. Before he can accomplish this, however, other happenings complicate his life. The convict, now in England, needs Pip's protection. Pip must make a way for Magwitch to leave England without being discovered.While Pip hides him with a trusted friend, Pip comes to realize that the convict he had earlier despised has more redemptive qualities than Pip has within himself. As he makes provision for the convict's escape, Pip sees Magwitch change for the better, and in so doing, Pip also changes. Instead of hating the convict, Pip grows to love him. The self centeredness of Pip's indulgences is replaced with care, not only for the convict, but in growing degrees, for others.In the process of trying to escape, the convict is attacked by his long-time archrival and enemy. As a result, Magwitch is severely injured, discovered by the authorities, put on trial and convicted, but dies from his injuries before his death sentence can be carried out. Magwitch's estate is turned over to the authorities to make restitution for past wrongs. Pip is left penniless and obligingly accepts that his Great Expectations and source of income have dissipated into nothing. Meanwhile, Estella marries someone else--a man whom Pip despises.A few years earlier, Pip had secretly made arrangements for his friend Herbert to have a small expectation out of his \\"Great Expectations,\\" amounting to a sizable sum of money. When it becomes known to Pip that he will lose his \\"Great Expectations\\" to the authorities, his only thought is for his friend. Pip returns to visit Ms. Havisham and requests, in a show of repentance for the wrongs she had done to him, a sum of money that Pip could again secretly provide to Herbert.Herbert wisely uses this money to successfully buy into a business venture. He later marries and moves overseas in his business pursuits--none of which would have been possible without Pip's anonymous provision to Herbert.Pip credits this as the only redeeming thing he has accomplished, reflecting on all the other things he did or didn't do that could have been used for good.Pip falls ill following the death of his convict friend, Magwitch, and Joe comes to England to care for him until he is well. Joe surreptitiously leaves early one morning when Pip is sufficiently recovered, and when Pip wakes up, he discovers Joe has paid off all his creditors. Pip immediately returns home in penitence to confess to Joe all his past wrongs, realizing that Joe is a better man than he. He recognizes in his now humble state that his \\"Great Expectations\\" deceived him into using it as a source of pride against Joe.Upon arriving home, Pip's expectations are not what he envisioned. His sister who raised him by hand has long since died as a result of an attack on her by the evil Orlick. His childhood friend and confidant, Biddy, has just married Joe. In the end, redemption works its way for good. Joe and Biddy are happily married and the sore memories of Pip's sister are forgotten.Pip returns to London and within a month, leaves England and joins Herbert's firm, Clarriker and Company, overseas. Pip lives abroad with Herbert and his wife, and after successfully making partner, eleven years later, returns to his boyhood home in England. He discovers Joe and Biddy now have a son who reminds him of himself.Before bidding Joe and Biddy a final farewell, Pip makes one last trip to the Havisham place, the old woman having died many years earlier. Pip discovers Estella in the garden, a chance meeting since she no longer lives there. The old house and brewery have been torn down and sold off except for the garden enclosed by the ivy covered wall.Years of a stormy, failed marriage have softened Estella's vindictive, prideful nature, and she confesses that \\"suffering has been stronger than all other teaching and has taught me to understand what your heart used to be.\\"The reader is left to ponder whether Pip and Estella ever marry because Pip says, \\"I saw no parting from her.\\"In the end, Pip learns much about what matters--wisdom he would not have possessed if he had stayed working at Joe's forge. As a middle aged narrator looking back, there is sadness but sweetness about what he has lost because of what he has gained. Perhaps the reader is the real winner, having seen redemption on so many levels within each character. In the end, if we are honest, we can identify these shortcomings in ourselves. If Pip can work out his \\"Great Expectations\\" to bring redemption, perhaps we can, also--that is, again, if we are honest. Our sinful nature will always be there, but if we look for good, God will not disappoint us. Maybe \\"Great Expectations\\" will not only find us, but redemption will be there, too, just as it was in Pip."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This was my first time to read a Dickens book i thought i wouldn't like it but once i got to know all the people and there ways which were very funny ways at times, i really enjoyed the book and couldn't but it down i love the sweet friendship Pip and Herbert have in the story but the best thing was Joe how could you not love Joe in this story!!!! he wasn't the smartest person but he was the best person..!!!,Im not sure which ending i like most but i thought they were both good in there own way.. ;)"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This particular book is just the right physical size, as are the type and font, to make it easy to read, unlike any paperback version you are likely to find.To enjoy Dickens is to enjoy his preposterous characterizations, clever and cutting wit, wonderfully complex story lines, and of course his trademark maudlin interludes or devices.The latter make a pretty rich broth making one of his books go a long way. His use of language too causes one to undertake his novels fully prepared to spend time parsing his sentences and consulting a dictionary in order to satisfactorily comprehend his writing.In other words, Dickens can never be read lightly even though, strictly speaking, his work might be considered light reading.'Great Expectations' is particularly worthy of close reading for, whether intentionally or not, it harkens back to 'The Odyssey' by Homer. Yes, that's right, apart from being a truly ripping yarn, the gist of which you can doubtless cull from other amazon reviews, this is a book in which Dickens examines or, more accurately, lays bare the inner workings of the (male?) human psyche.Humans are raised upon a diet of myths of human perfection, a list of which is endless; superhuman athlete, heroic military personnel, idealistic politician, anointed prophet, perfect mother, exalted leader, etc. What Dickens does in this great book is discuss the contradictions that lie within us all that make us heroes one moment and cowards the next; paragons of virtue on the one hand, and unprincipled thieves on the other; selfless benefactors today and greedy self-servers tomorrow.Most of us believe ourselves to be endowed with above average amounts of courage, generosity, and charity, etc. In addition to pointing out such conceits, Dickens proceeds to demonstrate how we maintain these notions while acting in radically contradictory ways to them.This brings me back to Homer's 'Odyssey,' and also to the works of Wm. Shakespeare which are the West's most revered examinations of man's psyche. It strikes one that this book is Dickens' effort, successful and brilliant effort, to do as they have. Granted, the latter's work is sentimental and written to be broadly popular; however, this accessibility in no way can hide the fact that Mr. Dickens addresses fundamental human truths/traits in this book.Based on amazon reviews, this book is evidently assigned to many 9th grade English classes. What a shame, as it is doubtful that such a young person has yet had a broad enough experience of the personal contradictions that allow us to tick. Perhaps Freshman classes would be better served by 'The Great Gatsby,' 'Catcher in the Rye' and similarly glib works, leaving sublime works such as this for later years. (It could be argued that early exposure might arm one against future bad behavior...the point Dickens makes though is that we can't avoid ourselves.)"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Loved reading this classic again.

It was rewarding and fun to see in my mind's eye, and take pleasure in, the huge banquet of tasty and very often humorous nuggets offered. Many are in passing, like when Pip is in Wemmick's guest bedroom, with the head of the bed so close to the flagpole that he feels as if he's spending the night balancing the pole on his forehead."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This classic book is a wonderful and engaging read.

For those of you who claim not to understand this work, may I suggest a return to Winnie the Pooh?

At the time I hated the book with a blue passion. Basically becuz I didn't understand it. Just recently, I decided to give it another chance (fifteen or so years later) and could not put it down. Although Pip is the main character, I found my sympathies lying with Estella. So young, so beautiful... so hardened. Ms. Havisham, in her greedy bitterness, deprives Estella the chance of real emotion, real love. Although I believe Ms. Havisham realizes what she has done near the end of the story, it is much too late for Estella. The re-written ending, although it pulled at my heart-strings, didn't work for me. The original ending is the only logical, perhaps realistic, ending in light of the events that occur within the story. For you kids who are forced to read it, try it again in a few years. I know your perception will have changed."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I had to read Great Expectations for a class project. I looked at how many pages it was and froze; &quot;How am I ever going to finish this book?&quot; I thought. After about 30 pages I was hooked and read it in a week. The language is old, so if you're young read it with a dictionary, it helps a lot! Dickens did a great job of tieing everything together at the end, and you know he must of had some master plan on what was going to happen!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great expectations is not only a great story filled with mystery, drama and action. Great expectations is a book that points out the personality flaws in all of us. It examines relationships and how they function between individuals.

No wonder it is described as a timeless classic! I loved this book because it had such a greta plot, with all the relations surfacing at the end. The relationship between Pip and Estella is particularily interesting, especially the change at the end. This is a treasurable addition to any collection."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"A book that captivates the ideals of entertainment, Great Expectations is a novel that cannot be put down. Having previously read &quot; A Tale Of Two Cities &quot; for an English topic, I was dissatified with the quality of work that Dickens produced and did not understand the hype surrounding his works and the popularity of sales. Great Expectations has changed my view entirely, as Pip, the protagonist will always be a person that can be related to and felt for. The life of the protagonist experiences many facets of human education, and the outcome is satisfing to himself and to the reader. Dickens has created a true exploration of people and how and who we are. Each chapter ends on a twist and torments the reader into further readings. The life of Pip and the events and characters that involve him work fluently and emphasis this theme. Dickens commonly gives subtle hints of information for the reader to use in working out the complexities of the novel, sometimes leading in the right direction, and other times, in a misleading direction. This keeps the reader informed and eager to process all the facts to conclude their own opinions. The ending is truely &quot; warm-hearted &quot; and acts ideally to conclude the novel. A splendid book not to be neglected from any book collection."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This may be Dickens' finest novel, for while it may lack some of the comic character that animates his other masterworks, it has a focus and coherence unseen elsewhere in his serial novels. Filled with memorable images and the pain of unrequited love and self-reproach, Dickens has invented a superb comment on wealth, on youth, and on life in general. (Youths forced to read it in high school may not understand the pain of looking back until later in life.)"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I, too, languished through this in High School. I, too, vowed never to pick up Dickens again. Then something happened. This is not bragging: it just happened. I grew up. Any intelligence I had mellowed into understanding, a very different faculty. Saddened, changed, I picked up Dickens again. And at last, I understood. Great Expectations isn't a classic for its language, plotting, style or wit. Like all Dickens' work, it is faulted in these areas. It's a classic because of Dicken's passion, which along with Bleak House pours onto the page and if you are at the right time of life, into your heart. So to all the reviewers here who find him problematic, wait a bit. Read a little about the nightmare world he lived in, the choked waterways slimey and poisonous with oil, feces and dye...the dangerous, airless shacks stacked up on each other, the rotten food...when it could be had at all. If you can, too, research a little into the social mores of the day, because what Dickens says about Victorian manners is quite true: virtue was often toggled to wealth in an absurd attempt to justify those unworthies clawing their way to the top of the &quot;Beehive&quot;. Try Dickens again later, when you have grown old. He's a ripping good yarn, but you must forgive him...he sees people as tiny valiant miracles amidst a roiling world of injustice, farcical posturing, physical danger, ignorance and want, and he needs to tell you about it. He often jokes about it, because the society he was writing for was very touchy and required its medicine to be sugar coated. It is only after you've put a Dickens book down that the images--minus the wit--pour over you and like the smoke curling through a Dickens novel it occurs to you you cannot breathe..."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Charles Dicken's novel, Great Expectations, teaches a lot to the reader. The best thing about the story is Dicken's development of plotting and characters. It is about a person who experiences grown and shattered expectations from childhood to teenagehood to adulthood. &quot;Great Expectations&quot; basically means what is &quot;expected&quot; in life: a job, a career, money, marriage, etc. Pip helps a convict, Magwitch, in the beginning, to escape by bringing him a file to file the convict's leg iron. In the second stage of Pip's expectations, Pip has always been thinking that his secret benefactor is a certain Miss Havisham (whom he met in childhood), because he thought that her daughter, Estella, was destined for him. At the end of this stage, the benefactor appears, and Pip finds that it is the convict whom he had helped so long ago!! He is filled with repugnance. And Estella also gets married to his most despised enemy. And he is deeply in debt. Pip's great expectations are shattered to pieces by all of this. Later, Pip has to deal with it in the third stage of his expectations, and the story ends with all the people around Pip married, but with Pip still single. But Estella's husband had done so much evil gambling, and he also died in a horse accident, leaving room for relief from Pip. So, the story isn't exactly a happy ending, but it's better than nothing. This is a GREAT book!!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Almost every negative review about this book was made by a 15 year old 9th grader. I also had to read this book when I was in ninth grade and I had no clue what was going on. Those kids might not want to admit it, but it was above thier understanding, I am proof of that. I decided to read this again and even though I was indifferant to it the first time I read, and realized it to be the literary genuis that it truely is. It has an amusing story line of the events that surround a young boy's life and how he copes with his coming into fortunes and life in general. But Dicken's masterful writing makes more than just a story line, it is also a social critique of Industeralized Society. For existance, Joe represents how life was before the Industerial Revolution. He was kind, hard working, morally upstanding, and happy, amoung other desirable qualities. Whereas Estella, for example, represented how it was during the Industerial Revolution. She was greedy, self-centered, controlling, and unhappy. This is also evident in Pip. At first he had the traits of the former, but once he got his &quot;Expecations&quot;, he exhibited the traits of the latter. Another part of his critique was the differance between the rich and the poor. There are other important ways in which he portrays them, but for lack of time the poor people were happy, whereas the rich were unhappy. Dickens is also great at describing setting and characters, so as some might see that as boreing, I see that as giving more depth to the story. He makes it seem like the reader is actually in 19th century London and meeting such interresting characters as Jaggers, Mr. Pocket, and of course honorable Joe. Anyone concidering buying this that is in high school, I reccomend not buying this because you will not undersand it, hence dislike it. But anyone who is already out of high school, or someone who read it in high school I would reccomend this book. Dickens is well know in literary circles for his genuis, but for some reason I cannot explain, in popular culture he does not come close to the popularity of Shakesphere, even though he was writer and Social Critic."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"The way he describes everything from the eerie feeling he has in Ms. Havisham's room, to the smell of hay in the streets of London. Also the way everything connects together with the things you think are not important, an the way the book, sort of calms down at the end and explains everything that happens. This was a very hard book to read, so I would recomend Cliffs Notes with this, bot do NOT read the cliifs notes seperate! It ruins everything! Even if you hate classics, this is still one great book, I hate classics too, but still, it's very good. I had to read this for a freshman honor class exam, so not that I read this by choice, but i'm glad I did."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"It took me a little while to get into the story and get to know all the characters, but once I did I couldn't put the book down.

A fine work."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This is a novel of bitterly dashed hopes and people who still cling to their broken dreams, allowing them to rob the present of meaning. Pride and greed are shown to delude even the best of people, causing them to believe what they want, rather than the obvious facts. The characters are over-the-top, yet still drawn sympathetically, and are some of the most memorable figures in the whole of literature. This is Dickens' best work."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"One could not expect to get a decent review on this book from American youth who lack the culture, knowledge, and discipline to enjoy anything that is not a video game. Understanding Dickens, one must remember that he wrote his book in chapters which were printed as excerpts in popular magazines of the time. Compiling these excerpts together results in a lenghtier novel. Appreciate the author's ability to develop characters, to visually put the reader into 1800 Victorian England, and Dickens as a social justice advocate for the poor. If you're looking for extensive sex, violence, and meaningless dialogue and plot, watch American Television."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This book was on my reading list for 9th grade, and it was my first Dickens novel ever. It took me about 3 days to read, and it was kind of a fluctuating thing. Some parts of it I couldn't put down, while other parts I dragged myself through. On the whole, I thought it was a good book, but not one I would read over again for a while. Dickens' use of figurative language is exquisite, but sometimes I found it hard to understand at first. The way almost every character described is tied some way into the tale is fantastic. You always have to pay attention, for you never know when that character might turn up again. This is such a tragic story already that I wish it would have ended a little better. I know it broke my heart. All in all, I would only recommend this book to someone who is in the mood for a complex tragedy."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Even though I'm only in High School, this book had a deep impact.

And I enjoyed it immensely. I can't say that the plot was especially thrilling -- nor the ending particularly satisfying. And yes, it is long, and if you just want to find out what happens, you won't find it to be of much interest. But what I like about the books is the attention to characters and details -- even ones that are almost irrelevant to the story -- but which kept kept me smiling and reading. In particular, his friend who is a clerk who has made his house TRULY to be his castle, complete with moat and drawbridge -- and who has an Aged Parent that had me laughing like crazy. The unexpected irony -- when Pip describes things to be such and so, but when it is clear to the reader to be much different -- I found to be wonderful. I felt that Dicken's had painted very strong visual elements -- by the end of the novel, I had very strong visual images of most of the characters and settings. I'm pleased to say that I have read a Dicken's novel and I truly enjoyed it."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This was the worst book that I have ever read in my entire life.

I think its awful that I was forced to read what amounted to an 18th century serial out of a tabloid.The reason the book is filled with so much meaningless drivel is that Dickens was paid for each installment and the longer the series lasted the longer he had a steady job, At least thats my theory. I just wish I could ask the dead author some questions like Why didn't you let Pip grow the Hell up? That poor me, I'm a country peasant with no friends act got real tired real quick. Second question Where in his warped imagination did he get Ms. Havishom? News flash! Anyone who did so many terrible things because a man left her was mentally unstable before she met the jerk which explains why he left her.

I have taken great joy in reading Nathaniel Hawthorne, Mark Twain, and even Tolkien. At least Tolkien went on and on, it was with purpose and there was a point.

I remembered why I don't read Dickens."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"In this coming of age documentation, you will find disappointment at every turn. Dickens' tedious descriptions and constant indecision on how the plot should turn makes the novel lose it's potential merit.Thousands of scholars and other readers have lauded Great Expectations as the finest Dickens' work of all time. The fact remains that it appears Dickens could not decide whether to make this a tragedy or an &quot;all's well that ends well&quot; happy-go-lucky type of story. This is proven by his change of the original ending. However, any reader could give testimony of feeling &quot;yanked, strung along, or thrown about&quot; from page one as they wonder just what Dickens wants them to think about Pip and his less-than remarkable life. Should we sympathize, feel disgust, be concerned? Does he deserve Estella's scorn or is he a victim of circumstance?The more you read of this cryptic novel the more you grow to understand that Dickens doesn't know what his novel is about, either. The entire book seems to vary by the chapter. And the fact that the plot has a potentially good story behind it that Dickens doesn't care to elaborate on makes the entire thing a bit more tedious for the take.The fact remains that Dickens is a fabulous story-teller. He has accurate, unjaded descriptions, refreshing, occassionally bitter, sometimes triumphant plots, and enough suspense to keep you reading throughout the night. It's just that none of that takes place in Great Expectations.Holly Burke, PhD.Clinical Psychologist, Abnormal Psych.

But there are other great stories that Dickens has done such as \\"A Christmas Carol\\" and \\"A Tale of Two Cities\\" and I am unsure why this one is always required reading.The story itself is mildly interesting and the characters and dialogue are unrealistic. There were many times that I felt like I was visiting an insane asylum.Dickens is labeled as a classic author, and often that gives reader's pre-conceived notions that his novels must be good.

I was forced to read this novel in 11th grade and I couldn't finish it. Must be because I play too many video games, right?I'm a freshman in college now, and I still hate Dickens. Don't write me off as a slack-jawed Gen-Xer though, because I've read some pretty heavy stuff (Faulkner, Montaigne, Steinbeck, Salinger, Dumas, Hemingway, Vonnegut, Tolkien) and loved it. I eat up Mark Twain; &quot;A Connecticut Yankee&quot; was a page-turner for me, and &quot;Huck Finn&quot; is my all-time favorite book. I just don't like Dickens' writing style, which he shares with most other Victorian novelists: unnecessary verbosity, obvious pomposity about the self as a masterful writer. I agree that Dickens is one of the great storytellers of all time, and he may have had the greatest imagination for character development since Shakespeare. But his writing style turns me off."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I am currently being forced to read this book for my Honors English class in high school. I've already read it once before for a different class, so I know what I am talking about when I say this book is the ultimate cure for insomnia.I honestly try to appreciate what is *supposed* to be fine literature, but &quot;Great Expectations&quot; is about as entertaining as watching kale grow. First off, the fact that this book has two endings inspires a bit of skepticism in me. I've never heard of an author so indecisive that he would put two endings in a novel. It creates a generally unsatisfying conclusion, as you're at a loss for which ending to &quot;accept&quot;.Aside from which, this book has enough useless passages to fill a hundred pages or so. It seems that, basically, Dickens didn't quite know exactly what to write about, but felt the urge to *write* *something*. So he wrote &quot;Great Expectations&quot;, following the traditional poor-boy formula of his previous 15 or so books.I find it especially hilarious that none of my teachers have ever even read the bloody novel, but it's &quot;good&quot; according to the curriculum. In the words of someone from a certain other Charles Dickens book, &quot;Bah! Humbug!&quot;.Don't judge Dickens by this book, however. &quot;David Copperfield&quot;, for example, even though it follows the same &quot;poor-boy&quot; formula, is worlds better than this.As much as I'd love to say, &quot;Oh, it's a classic, everyone should read it!&quot;, I personally don't think so."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great works of English literature from the 1700s and 1800s shared one thing in common; twists and turns in the plot lines that are never fully exposed until the last lines of the book. Chief among these twists are reversals of fortune both good and bad. So goes this work of literature. Though read by many as children, I would consider it more worthy of young adults, as the text can be quite boring for anyone below their teens. Basically, the plot revolves around Pip, a boy who grows up poor in the care of his sister and apprenticed to a blacksmith; a blue collar job by any standard. But he comes into an inheritance which he gladly accepts, leaving behind his previous life. A second theme of this story is his awe and obsession over Estella, a pretty girl who he meets first when young and poor when she does not even see him, and later one when he is rich when she cannot look past him. This is the probably the part of the book best remembered; a boy infatuated with what he cannot get, only to re-encounter it on later on in life as something he might not want anymore.As a book, it is shorter than most of Dickens' work, and much easier to read. But it has less historical meaning, and to me, less exploration of social ills than his other works such as Oliver Twist and Great Expectations. The book focuses more on personal travails, and how relationships between individuals all depend on the where the individuals came from. The book is interesting enough, but not that exciting, and I would not consider it as a mandatory work for all students to read."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I liked this book, I really did, I promise. But in my opinion, Dickens's other novel &quot;Nicholas Nickleby&quot; is much, much better.So before you buy this book, check out &quot;Nicholas Nickleby&quot; as well.

That doesn't mean that it will be better in all people's opinions."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great Expectations, by Charles Dickens, was a very strong novel. I enjoyed it, but found parts of it confusing and difficult to read. It is a very &quot;deep&quot; novel which has twists and turns throughout. In the begining, Pip was an orphan who went to live with his sister (who was mean) and her husband (who was an OK guy.) Later, he goes to the home of Miss Hauisham. She is a lady who is kind of crazy because of a past situation. Her lover left her years ago. Here is where Pip meets her daughter, Estella, who is very beautiful ( and who was always moody and was spoiled.) Pip falls for Estella (I guess he can put her personality aside.) Later on, Pip becomes wealthy but he can't figure out who left him the money (He thinks it was Miss Hauisham.) It ends up that a man named Able left him the money. When Pip was young, Able asked him for food. Pip got it for him and Able was convicted and he was forced to move away. After he moved he became wealthy and because of Pips heart and help, Able left him a fortune. As for the end... you can read it for your self and find out the suprises. My only complaint is that there are some confusing parts (as I said above.) Overall, I really enjoyed this book and reccommend it for people who like Dicken's work. To be honest, when I first got this book I did not want to read it. I figured I would just rent the movie with Gweneth Paltrow, and base my report on that. It is SO DIFFERENT. The book and the movie are not alike. I decided to read it and so I did. I reccommend this book for people who like Dicken's work. He really did a great job with this one."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great Expectations must have been what the readers of Dickens' serial publication must have had when they first read it, and I have to wonder if they were as disappointed as I was after slogging all the way through to the skewed, disjointed, and extremely contrived ending. This was written as a serial, not a novel, and I think Dickens (and his readers) would have benefited from a rewrite before publication in novel form.If ever there was a novel that set out to have no meaning, no core, no arc, and most of all, no satisfaction, it must be Great Expectations. The novel's title clearly states Dickens' perspective and intention; that great expectations in life will be met by great (and bitter) disappointment, and the greater the expectation, the greater your disappointment in life will be. The idea that a woman jilted at the altar will spend her life grooming a young girl to make other young men's lives miserable, is a contrived, almost paranoid idea from a male's perspective. Mrs. Havershim's great expectations for life were dashed, because instead of moving on to meet a better man, she chooses to become a shut-in and ruin a young man's expectations for life. However, if it seems that Dickens is building towards some kind of message about not having overblown expectations and then being bitter if they don't work out, the reader is to be disappointed. Dickens goes out of his way not to make this point or any point, but to make a grimly sad tale bereft of any kind of compass or solace for either the characters or the reader.Pip, the protagonist, survives his encounter with the damaged Estella, who had been deliberately damaged by Havershim to be \\"unable to love\\". The ending, in which he encounters her again briefly and is glad she is able to have the heart to \\"understand his heart as it was\\", is unbelievable, pompous and drowning in its own self-pity, all at the same time. It also feels as if Dickens took a perfunctory way to get out of a story that had meandered its way away from him.Great Expectations must be the most disappointing, overblown \\"classic\\" novel I have ever read, not because it doesn't have a happy ending, but because of the way that Dickens has created his characters and shapeless mess of a story, and presented it in the most abrasive fashion possible. I was relieved at the end to have finished it, not satisfied, not sad, and certainly not edified. There is nothing to learn or grow from in this novel; it has made me less of a Dickens fan. And that is the most disappointing result of reading it."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I'm surprised that this book is a requirement in highschool. I had to read it in my upper division English Lit class in college and I just couldn't get into it. There are way too many retarded characters on which Dickens spends too much time, Pip gets more annoying with every page, especially his love for Estella who is one of the most disgusting characters in the book. I've read Jane Eyre before this and it was a real page turner. This is plain boring."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great Expectations has a few interesting characters. I'll give it that. Magwitch and Miss Havisham are definitely original and entertaining. But everyone else is pretty bland.Pip's love for Estella is rather pathetic. Why he would love such a despicable person is beyond me. This fact alone makes Pip difficult to relate to, and thus not a very good choice for the point-of-view character.But the one thing that absolutely ruins this book is the clutter of coincidences. One of the first rules of fiction writing is NO COINCIDENCES. And Dickens goes out of his way to break this rule. Over. And Over. And Over.Really, it is not a very good book. Please do not wasted your money on it (although there are a LOT of pages, so it could last you months as toilet paper"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I can't understand how anyone can stand to read this dribble. A &quot;Book&quot; consisting of 50 pages of people standing around talking reads more like a court transcript than a &quot;great novel.&quot; If you own this book, burn it."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great Expectations by Charles DickensOne of the most popular books ever written by Charles Dickens was Great Expectations. It is considered to be his greatest work to many critics. I read the book and found that it was probably the most boring book I had ever read in my life. Overall the book had a pretty well thought out plot. To me though the book was a classic and masterpiece only when it was first became published. People now in the present are not very easily satisfied with a book with a good plot and are well written. People now are just more interested in books that have a lot of twists and turns in the story. They want be able not know what is going to happen next in the story. The book Great Expectations even though it was such a boring book it did have some very interesting parts. Also the book was overall well written by the author. One strength that the book had was the fact it had such interesting characters. The author had well character development throughout the book. All the characters in the book were described that you tell each character apart because of their personality or physical appearance. The main character Philip Pirrip also nicknamed Pip was very well described as a character. The author told everything possible about Pip so throughout the book you saw the main character grow into man and also grow as person in general. When Pip when through something you almost felt like it was you in the book. Also another strength in the book was the great setting descriptions. It was so good because when you were reading the book you could actually picture the setting in your head. The book had very little strengths because I was forcing myself to actually read it. If it had actually been actually interesting I would have finish the book in one day instead of a three weeks. The only reason that I actually read was the fact I knew had to do a report on it. The book had many faults for a classic book. The main weakness of the book was the chapters that were pointless and just there to take up space. The book seemed was written to just tell a story of boy without any really interesting parts. I was somewhat disappointed in the fact that the book was considered a classic book because a classic book to me is book that can interest anyone and any age. The book had great plot and well-written characters but I thought that the book could have been shorter. It could have been shorter and would still have the same impact on a reader. The reader will eventually find out that the book Great Expectations is just a book to read when you have nothing else to read. Think this book just wasted my time. I hated every minute that I spent reading this book. In scale of one through to ten I would give it a four. The book is fairly good but the book is simply too long to tell a simple and boring story of a boy named Pip. I wouldn't recommend this book because I think that the reader will be truly bored. Probably the main target audience of this book was of young adult. The book is good for that age range because of the somewhat difficult and confusing vocabulary. The book Great Expectations is just a book to be read when there are no more books to read."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"this book basically bored me to tears, it's one of those books that you really have to be into from the beginning to get the story at all, like harry potter or lord of the rings. main point = if you're not a charles dickens fan, the amazon description doesn't amaze you, and even you've read it before and reallllyyyyy disliked, then this book is not for you."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"In my opinions, the book is alright, but not the greatest book ever as other people like to say. The writing is beautiful and clever, but I think that the characters and plot are really all pretty stupid and unrealistic, especially Mrs. Havisham; that would never happen and I don't believe it's possible to wear the same clothing without bathing for all those years. The clothing would be torn apart and you would smell horribly. The cake would've been gone, too. And the aged one in Mr. Wemmicks apartment who gets happier the more violently you nod at him? A convict wants to give all his money to Pip because he scared him so much he got him to do what he wanted? I could go on some more, but I'm bored, 3 stars for the writing."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I love to read great books like BRAVE NEW WORLD by Aldous Huxley or FAR FROM THE MADDING CROWD by Thomas Hardy.

I read THE RISE AND FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE by Gibbons and gained much knowledge from doing so. I LOVE TO READ.But GREAT EXPECTATIONS was a GREAT DISAPPOINTMENT! I was somewhat amused until chapter ten where I felt the book became psycho-babble. I was also disappointed in TALE OF TWO CITIES. I could not endure the first two chapters!

He could have summed the book up a lot. He usedlong word that some times were had to say.The characters were pretty good to follow by with the different names. Pip was easy to follow as he aged. I thought that Mrs. Joe was a big meaniey. Joe was the nice guy and Estella was a snob in the beginning but shaped up in the end."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"For some reason I missed Dickens when I was a child, so I decided to catch up on one of the great works of the English canon. I'm sorry -- I know that by critical accord he's one of the finest and most influential of all English writers. And I understand the important work that he did in publicising social justice causes such as child labour. But I find his prose ornate and contrived, his plot slow-moving and predictable, and his characters implausibly one-dimensional.

I suggest finding a good summary. The movie was relaly good. Way better."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"As a student, I was expecting to read a literary masterpiece. I don't like long books like Great Expectations but this book went into extreme detail about the most meaningless things.The novel grabs you fast and has a story with many surprises and twists along the way.Theres all sorts of unknown parents, secret coniving, mysterious benefactors, and worst of all, many unrealistic characters. Miss Havisham, Pip, Magwitch, Mr. Jaggers, and Estella are the characters that you should think more about them understand them.If this is to be your first reading of the book, be patient with the book's middle third,because the real and important events starts very late;The story centers around a young boy--well, almost young man-- named Pip, and revolves around his growing into age. Much of Pip's worry and concern I could relate to--falling in love with a girl who only plays with your heart, growing up and leaving home for the first time, and discovering your true relationships with others and yourself.It is a darker work, but it has some exciting and entertaining parts to it, too. If a ex-convict came up to me, I would be so scared that I would run away. The fact that Pip trusted Magwitch with a lot of things really amazed me.Actually there are great descriptions with wonderful dialogues and I'd recommend this book to anyone who wants a good, but an illogical read."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Do not give this book as a gift. It will disappoint. I am still looking for a high quality illustrated version of Great Expectations. However, I can vouch for the vendor who offered a low price and shipped promptly."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I thought this book was a little hard to understand with the way they talked. Some of the words the use you don't normally hear everyday or the way they phrase some of their sentences makes it harder to know what is going on. I liked this novel though the story was great in how all the events that took place connected to something else in the end of the story.My favorite parts in this book were when Pip was finding more and more about Estella and her family because it kept you wanting to read more and more of the story so you could find out what happened. The major themes of the story were kind of hard to understand because some of them are hidden in the story and Dickens doesn't come right out and say what's happening and sometimes he drags out the seen and makes it really easy to lose interest or just get confused.Dickens didn't really bring the story alive for me because I didn't really understand some of the parts in the book, but I did like the story."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"HOW I JUDGE A CLASSIC: I don't give extra brownie points to classic books. I ask myself, \\"If this book were published today by some unknown author, what would I think of it?\\" Perhaps this isn't a fair way to judge a classic, but that's the method I use.PROS OF GREAT EXPECTATIONS:- It has outstanding character development.- It's a story about people and relationships.- Good, authentic dialog.- A nice moral story.CONS:- Painfully slow pacing.- Long-winded writing style, long paragraphs.- Few characters that are that agreeable.CONCLUSION: Have low expectations when you read \\"Great Expectations.\\" Modern books have much faster pacing and are more easy to read. For those who love the classics, they will love this book. I, however, preferred \\"A Tale of Two Cities.\\""},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Like many other reviewers, I have been dragged into reading this book by a literature class. The story line is mildly interesting, but most of the book contains fluff that is pointless and you just have to suffer through. The language is also very difficult to understand and not a \\"skimmable\\" book, by any means. If you really insist on reading this book, I would suggest getting the SparkNotes or the Cliff Notes.

The narrator, who is also the main character, addresses you directly and colours the whole story with his own amiable personality. Indeed, one can imagine that the novel, published in instalments in that long bygone era before radio, television and other non-printed media, was conceived to be read out loud in the family parlour.The characters are straightforward, captivating and likeable. Totally removed from any realistic complexity, they are all the more memorable: nave, honest Pip; distant, cold, condescending Estella; devoted, loyal, simple-minded Joe; mysterious, ethereal Miss Havisham; etc.The plot, convoluted, wholly implausible and a tad predictable, evokes harsher but so much simpler times. Though by no means a cliff-hanger, the work is suspenseful and the reader's interest is expertly sustained throughout.Extremely well written, peppered with tongue in cheek humour, this archetypal novel is strongly recommended to any audience, particularly in audio form."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I needed to purchase 3 books at one time for my daughters high school assignment, I was given a \\"short\\" notice.

Charles Dickens, develops a plot that portrays true life in the 19th century. Pip undergoes several events that reveal the true motives of life, the happiness in true love and the curse of wealth.The audience can easily relate to the overall theme of Great Expectations, the familiarity of the sycophant, ambitous characters enable the reader to apply the concepts to their own life.

Personally, I enjoyed this novel very much, its is a great book to read becasue it reminds a person of the immense value of the simple, loving things in life."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Thirteenth of Dicken's four major novels, Great Expectations has the most dramatic and gripping start that unfolds a story that drives eagerly forward, full of emotion and humor and many unforgettable characters. As a kid, we had this book on our Literature List and every time we had to write down the answers of Literature tales, it was rather strenuous and boring as this meant to be a part of education. However, when it came to conduct a teaching class in literature, Great Expectation turned out to be an adventure. Unlike Oliver Twist and David Copperfield, Pip is not really a hero and also it does not end a Happy ending but Pip is being stripped of his wealth and his position in society. Pip is sent to London to be educated as a gentleman, he is impressed by the wrong people for the wrong reasons. He neglects and abandons the honest, hardworking folk who care for him and his pride is hurt when he learns who his mysterious benefactor is. Pip express guilt for his behavior who have a violent nature and crude ways but altogether he is courageous too. Pip, his father surname being Pirrip and his Christian name Philip, that's how he is called \`Pip' , has a fascination for Estella but is brought up by Miss Havisham to wreck revenge on all male sex and break hearts. Herbert Pocket is a character who has frankness was amiable and cheerful who became a friend of Pip. Dicken's novels have a central theme \`rags-to-riches' tale of a poor, underprivileged boy who is finally accepted into society. Strangely, this one has a different end. A nice read and great pick for Classroom Literature workshop."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"When i first red the book in the highschool i've looked through like Pip.

If not, he's very lucky..."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"It's a shame that most people resign this book to their \\"having already been read\\" list as a result of this novel being assigned coursework in junior high or high school. Dickens was a master of depicting subtleties of human relationships and personalities. Great Expectations illustrates this gloriously. Whatever can be said of Pip, is that he is abashedly a hopelessly human character. I sincerely can't imagine a young reader to identify with the maturity of these character's substantive familiarities with one another. Please don't write this book off, because you feel as if you already know the plot line and story because you read it young, I guarantee, read as an adult, this celebrated novel will take on a whole new light when you have been out in the world and experienced the complexities of the human condition."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I respect the point of view of the reader who said that he/she can't add much to the opinion of countless generations who read this classic for the past 150 years. Classics last this long because they're masterpieces, and hence this work deserves five stars.The only thing to add in my point of view, is that I won't be surprised to learn that Dickens wrote this story especially for school boys who are really struggling to identify themselves and determine what is really important in life. No wonder this is one of the most required readings in middle school. In other words, adults won't find in it a mature story like the one in Steinbeck's East of Eden, or the taboo-sex theme of Nabokov's Lolita. This is about a young boy who goes on a long journey and ends up finding himself and realizing what really gives him happiness in life.As for the ending, there are two endings; published and unpublished, and I like the published more. Don't read further for I will give the ending away, unless you've read it already, but in the last paragraph Pip says that the mist of the evening when he held hands with Estella reminds him with the morning mist when he left the forge. The way I see it is that Estella will go through the same journey that Pip went through when he left the forge and went to London, the journey that was initiated by Estella's father and that helped Pip to be a better man. Now Estella will go through a journey initiated and guided by Pip in order to make Estella a better woman. Magwitch hurt Pip in the beginning but Pip helped him so Magwitch gave him all his money. The money was gone but was left was more important than money: The journey and experience that made Pip a better man. Estella was mean to Pip, but Pip loved her, and destiny put them both on a crossroads at the end of the novel, but because Pip loves Estella and because she is Magwitch's daughter, Pip decided to walk with her in a journey that will make her a better woman.Magwitch and Estella, father and daughter, never met. But there was a link between them; Pip, who became a better man because of the father, and who will now pay him back by making his daughter a better woman. Great Expectations is about the magical and ironic links between people, and how the person who you think hurt you the most may end up to be the person who helped you the most. The fact that an evil man is not as evil as he seems, and a pure man is not as pure as he seems.And these are just few of the many other themes in this classic. So the bottom line is, this novel may be more meaningful to the middle school son than to the forty something father. Read it early before you get older!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Victorian society got a good spanking when Great Expectations was published, at the time Dickens's anger and frustration was at one of its highest points. Pip, the novel's protagonist - I hesitate to call him the hero - is at once likeable and recognizable as a powerful symbolic tool, though the former quality intentionally decreases as the novel progresses.Pip is joined by a cast of the most memorable characters in literature - the cold, ethereal Estella, the crazy, wounded Miss Havisham, loveable dullard Joe, whip-smart lawyer Jaggers - the list could, and possibly might, go on for pages. If there were literary awards for Best Ensemble, the characters in Great Expectations would clinch them all. The characters function as both political/social symbols and, though they exist in a time period far removed from us, identifiable and memorable figureheads that will - and should - be a literary hallmark forever."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I first read this about 12 years ago as a teenager in High School of course at the time I could not possibly comprehend everything that is going on. On a whim I decided to reread this novel and am very happy that I did, Pip, Joe, Estella, Mrs Havisham all these charecters are so colorful and well written it amazes me. This novel covers a diverse collection of human emotions such as love, friendship, loyalty, shame, and forgiveness. If the only time you read this it was mandatory reading for freshman english do yourself a favor and pick it up again and reread it I found it very worthwhile."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Many reviewers have called this Dickens' greatest novel. One reviewer says it was the first time a character's feeling had been explored in such detail. These things I cannot comment on - this is the first Dickens novel I ever read, and I am not familiar with other works of this period. I can say that it was a damn fine read though.I must admit, maybe it was a convention of the time, but there were a great many impossible coincidences in this story. The term &quot;soap opera&quot; even crossed my mind at one point. In the end I forgave these improbable coincidences because the story was so compelling, and the novel so old, and the author of legendary repute.I loved the saint-like character Joe. I think he was my favorite character. And Dickens does a masterful job of showing the friendship between Pip - the protaganist - and Joe and especially Herbert. Miss Havisham is the picture of the bizarre rich recluse. And Estella the epitome of the cold-hearted shrew. All of the characters are rich.And it is true, as many other reviewers have commented, that so many issues are explored in this work. The meaning of true love, genuine friendship, the implications of &quot;moving up&quot; and it's effects on family and friends, good fortune, redemption, etc. It's all there - life is there.The book was slow at certain parts, but most of the time I found myself eagerly turning the pages. Dickens is a master at compelling his reader to turn the pages. What will happen next? At some of the titanic coincidences and plot turns I found myself thinking, &quot;what?! You've got to be kidding me...&quot; and then begging for more. I think you will too.There are some deeply heartfelt moments. Deeply heartfelt, touching, that inspired warm feelings in me. It was a pleasant change of pace from the darker, more cynical literature of today (though there are evil people and violent actions in Great Expectations as well). The final lesson of redemption is truly heartwarming."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This is my favorite book. I've read it at least 6 times, and it is still a wonderful story. Dickens makes you feel what little Pip feels on the unexpectedly interesting journey of his life. From his childhood encounter with an escaped convict to a mysterious rise to riches and fame later in life, I am completely immersed in his story. The tale of his love for a girl named Estella who, not only will never love him, but emotionally tortures him every day of his life is heartbreaking yet somehow familiar. There are subtle lessons to be learned from this book.

As all of Dickens' tales do, this provides a look at life for the ordinary man in that time and place, England in the 19th century. It is also a parable about the worth of people as judged by their wealth, status and power vs. their character and more. It is filled with wonderful character studies that only Dickens could do: Miss Haversham, stunted and destroyed by her bitterness, in turn doing great damage to the beautiful, cold Estella. The star of the novel, the orphaned Pip, raised by his shrewish and abusive sister and her wonderful, loving and simple husband Joe, the friends Pip makes, etc. Mr. Prebble reads this great novel as no one else can. He brings the characters to life so I could feel their emotions. All of the characters had unique voices and suitable accents that matched them perfectly. I was particularly moved by his portrayal of Joe. By the way, Mr. Prebble's beautiful, very masculine voice does the female characters believably. One does not even think about it. Thank you, Mr. Prebble, for narrating this novel and providing me with the best Christmas I've had for a while."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I loved it! In fact I remember reading Great Expectations during a 7th grade English class and getting in trouble for not paying attention to what was being taught. I came to this book on my own, as opposed to being made to read it, and while the lenth and the language was challenging for the first few pages, I remember falling head over heels in love with Dickens' style. This was the first time I felt myself get lost in a book. I've read it several times since in the last 14 years and I get lost in Pip's world every time!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Yes, the prose is overlong. Yes, the English language has evolved since Dickens' day, so you'll be using the dictionary feature on your Kindle often. But Great Expectations transcends time to bring a very relatable story to modern readers. The mystery deepens at every turn, the characters develop more fully and, if you open your mind and relax, the book's a downright page-turner (or page-clicker, for Kindlers).I tried reading this classic when I was younger and less patient, but it took a 40+-year-old me to 'get' it. Perhaps young people need to experience life and the lessons we all learn to really appreciate Great Expectations. Perhaps they relate a little too much with the freshly made gentleman and don't really understand why he castigates himself for his behavior. Or perhaps they're just not patient enough to 'zen out' and enjoy the book for what it is. Whatever the reason, I sincerely hope the young people who hate this book today, will pick it up again when they're more 'seasoned' - then they might just understand why it's a classic.If this review gave you information that was helpful, please feel free to click the YES button below!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great & free down load to PC Kindle product; yes, Kindle has a free software download so that you can read their books on your PC too.

She is 14 and it was easy for her to understand and follow."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Like many other reviewers, I read this book because it is a requirement in many English classes. Although the plot becomes interesting at times, the majority of it is filler. The book is filled with pointless characters and chapters devoted to run-ons of Pip's thoughts.Because the book was written so long ago, it is also very difficult to connect with. The character relationships are annoying. The romance between Pip and Estella becomes very hard to believe, because Estella is not a likable person. And the dialect is very unbelievable. It is hard to picture someone using Joe's speech patterns, even in old English times.While there are probably many people who will enjoy this novel, I would not suggest this book to someone looking for a quick read (meaning high school students). It is very difficult to skim and requires alot of time to appreciate. If you have a lot of time on your hands and you enjoy long, character developing novels this book may be for you."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This was an interesting book. It is the first book by Charles Dickens that I had ever read. The language was weird but that was because it was a British novel written in a different era. I enjoyed it though because it was a escape to a different era and time. I plan on reading several other works by this author. It was slow to start but only because I was not used to the writing style or language. I would recommend."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"The setting of this book is in the Elizabethian era. Class, titles, and wealth is veryimportant around this time period and Dickens shows the importance in this great novel.Another theme of this novel is that not everyhting is as it seems.The story starts with Pip(Philip Pirrip) at the graveyard. He went to visit his dead parentswhen all of a sudden he was snatched by an escaped convict. The convict threatened Pipsaying that he will slit his throat if Pip did not bring food, a drink and a file. Pip did whathe was told and felt guilty for helping the convict out for many years after.He is asked to play at Satis House where he meets Miss Havisham and the beautifulEstella. Pip hoped that Miss Havishams intentions were to make his fortune, make him agentleman and have Estella to wed. He was wrong, instead Miss Havisham's intentionswere for Pip to fall in love with Estella and then have his heart broken.After this dissapointment, Pip hears news that an anonymous benefactor wants to makePip a gentleman and give him a fortune. Pip believed that the anonymous benefactor wasMiss Havisham but instead it was the escaped convict that Pip helped when he was ayoung boy. It gets even more interesting when Pip finds out that Estella is the daughter ofthe escaped convict.This novel comes with interesting twists and great themes that can have a reader thinking,\\" whats going to happen next?\\" I recommend this novel to any reader who likes a greatstory."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"The reason I choose to write this review is quite simple: to tell of a great book that gets better every time you read it. The compelling twists of &quot;Great Expectations&quot; are very involved and makes for a book that not only comes off extremely in depth but also entertaining. I first read this book and high school and have since read it twice more. It seems the more knowledge I have gained the more I take out of each segment of this book as it is more closely tied into my real life.Simply put this is Dickens masterpiece and that should not be overlooked as many of his books were of extreme quality."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I liked the book Great Expectations, I thought it was very interesting to read. When I first found out that we ha to read it I didn't think i would like it at all but I did, once I got into the book.I thought it was hard to read. Sometimes I didn't get it but othere times I did and did think Charles Dickens made it easy to understand. I don't think he should have written so many characters becasue I lost track of who was who and where they were at. He should have written more to the ending, like what happend to Pip and Estella.I did like when Pip started realizing that just because you have money dosen't mean you can be mean to people like Joe and Biddy and everyone else that do't have as much as he does. I liked how toward the ending everything kind of came togeter; that's whenI really understood who was who. I really liked how all the characters were sonnected in some way like Magwitch, Estella, And Molly. Also Compeyson and Miss. Havisham."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This is one of Dickens's better known classics, though not his best. The theme is worthy enough of study, though, and the reading is enjoyable. Recommended."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great Expectations is one of Dickens less &quot;weighty&quot; novels. It is slow-moving and at sometimes tedious to read. While the setting and characters are developed well enough to draw you in to the story, the plot is quite unbelievable and the book sometimes tedious at times.The story is about Pip, a young working class boy who comes into great wealth because of a mysterious benefactor. He abandons his good old friends Joe and Biddy to follow his heart towards Ms. Havisham and her cruel daughter Estella. Also dragging along with him are Hubert, his friend and confidant, Magwitch, a filthy convict, Mr. Wopsle, a bad Shakespearean actor, Mr. Jaggers, a vindictive lawyer, Mr. Wemmick- Jagger's more amiable assistant, Molly, a servant with a mysterious past, and Old Orlick, whom you'll know all about at the end of the book.After my first go through, I gave this book a second chance to grow on me and read it again, but it didn't. Unless you are absolutely OBSESSED with Dickens,you are required to read it for a class, and/or you don't have anything to do over a weekend, then don't bother reading this book"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I found this book hard to read and hard to comprehend. The book is about a boy named Pip and his rise from lowly to gentlemanly status. Along the way, he manages to alienate his friends and he learns some valuable lessons about friendship in the end. The way the sentences are written and structured made it difficult for me to understand everything that was going on. Many of the sentences would be considered run-on today."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Dickens tells his story through the consequences of several secret, unsolicited acts of kindness. The consequences of these acts varies greatly. Dickens seems to be unconcerned with passing judgement on the acts themselves, instead he prefers to humor himself by exploring of their unpredictable outcomes."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I cannot fathom how this novel only has a rating of 3 stars. It is an exceptional book that well demonstrates the genius of Charles Dickens. Not only does it have suspense and charm of romance and adventure, but it delivers thematically a look at the hypocracy of wealth in Elizabethan England, and a philosophical perspective on the meaning of happiness. In the end of course there is the climax with every bizarre plot twist imaginable. It is true, this is not necessarily a happy one: Pip gains happiness at the end only by learning by immense misfortune to himself and others, and by having his &quot;expectations&quot; crash down upon him, nearly destroying his future. Yet, this novel is an essential read for anyone, no matter how old or young because it still retains its meaning as freshly today as it did when it was written. It's only unfortunate that it's wasted on all of these people who don't bother to take the time to actually to try and comprehend what they're reading and who have consequently made such poor reviews."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I'm here referring to the Oxford World's Classics edition, published in 1999. Firstly, I love the book itself. It's compact, the pages have a soft, easy feel to them, and the print is a welcome size: smaller but very readable. A+ here.The characters are particular and animate. Through the use of his famously detailed characterization and description, Dickens creates an elaborate colorful neighborhood of which you feel part. A+ for this escapism and for the sheer pleasure it brings. I especially admire his keen sense of the droll. However, while the tale runs well through the first half or so, as it progresses -- did you find so also? -- it loses the intact sympathies of the reader by trying to connect all the dots that its intricate plot has spun out into. It's forever tying its own shoes. I was similarly disappointment in the final denouement of Estella and Pip, as a let down and overly cerebral. (B-) But I highly recommend this book as a good Dickens novel, and on its own terms, a great one.A very fun read!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great Expectations, a book that Dickens ironically considered as one of his \\"little pieces.\\" Though it is small compared to other works by Dickens, what this novel lacks in size it makes up for in quality. Great Expectations succeeds beyond almost all novels of its time in exploring the roots of character and moral behaviour. Charles Dickens makes the case for there being the potential for good and evil within everyone. Evil and sin follow from a combination of being self-absorbed and selfish. What is remarkable about the way these themes are handled is that they are clearly based on an assessment of human psychology, long before that field was established. The book is also remarkable for its many indelibly memorable and complex characters. Miss Havisham, Pip, Magwitch, Mr. Jaggers, and Estella are certainly some of the most complex characters ever created by Dickens.Though a novel founded on philosophic concepts, the story is full of action to keep the plot moving. An escaped convict, an attempted murder, and a mysterious benefactor all add to the sense of mystery that exists throughout most of the novel and forces the reader to continue. Murder, deceit, jealously, and revenge also help to hold the attention of the reader while Dickens explores the depths of human nature.As you read Great Expectations, raise your expectations (sorry, I couldn't help myself) to assume that you will receive answers to any dangling thread. Every detail is important, if not to solve the mysteries of the characters then only to enhance the \\"sense of place.\\" Although the England described here is long gone, it becomes as immediate as a nightmare or a dream that you have just awakened from.This story by Dickens is a must-read and deserves five-stars."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"The great English master is at his best in &quot;Great Expectations.&quot; This is a story about loyalty, trust, and, this being Dickens, dark overtones of the human nature. One should not expect something for nothing, that is what this novel makes perfectly clear. Pip, who is the central figure of the novel, a good-natured boy growing up into adulthood, expects to be continously favored by fotrune and his mysterious benefactor who, he thinks, is acting out of the goodness of her heart. Along the way he meets a cast of character who represent the entire range of human nature: devotion, strength, treachery, level-headedness, and brutality.&quot;Great Expectation&quot; is a classic because of its relentless exposure of truth about the human condition--the condition in which decency and sanity are maintained at a high price, and innocence not at all."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I imagine many of the negative ratings are from high school students forced to read the classics, and this book is one of those undisputed classics. Why else would every student I've talked to have had to read this book? Me included.I must confess I didn't like it in high school. Dickens does have a way of writing elegant sentences conjoined by semicolons. A great editor would have told him frequent use of periods is acceptable.However, eight years later, while frustrated at my illiteracy in Japan, I was starved for great literature in English. I had gone through a couple of contemporary literature that always left me vaguely dissatisfied. I started reading my favorite author Jane Austen again, and picked up Great Expectations on a whim. What a difference those eight years made!!No one can touch Dickens ability to evoke an atmosphere. I felt I was right there with Pip in the foggy marshes, shivering before a menacing Magwitch. Or sitting around the fire of a small but cozy house while Joe was smoking his pipe and passing along nuggets of his own brand of wisdom. Or creeped out in Mrs. Havisham's mausoleum of a mansion.In addition, the dialogue is so authentic you feel as if you're eavesdropping on people's conversations. Joe's working class speech, Mrs. Havisham's upper class diction, the lawyer's dry speech all ring so true.Ultimately, the story itself is so carefully constructed, even after countless rereadings, the clues in this mystery of who Pip's benefactor is are barely perceptible. And Dickens' themes of human pride, ultimate humility, willfulness of character that only later realizes the consequences, and the six degrees of separation are priceless. Dickens' championing of the working class pervades all his books, but in this one his affection for the working man is more personal. You really can't help but love Joe and his bungling dignity.Yes, Dickens can border on the excessively dramatic. But most of the time this drama works to pull you into a touching tale."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Having seen the many reviews written by students, I must say that I would agree. In fact, they sounded like they could have almost been my students from the past. Overall, GE is well liked, but the major complaint most have is that the story line is too slow-developing. I think this is a fair assessment. Of course, this was the style chosen by Dickens since this book was compiled from serial form. How many people would claim that we ought to take a week's worth of a soap opera program and turn it into a movie? I doubt such a production would attract much attention. In the same way, a serial writer's objective was to build mini-climaxes throughout the book, twisting and turning to get the audience to scream with anticipation, so that the next segment would sell. From what I understand, Americans could hardly wait for the shipments to get off the ships. They would purchase the newest segment and immediately dig in!If you are a teacher, I highly recommend showing the 4-hour movie starring Anthony Hopkins (produced in the late 1980s, I believe). It is the best and most accurate of all the GE movies. This works really well in conjunction with the book, and it truly helps in the interest level for those students who are not as motivated as &quot;the readers.&quot; So go ahead and find out about the adventures of squeezable Pip, lovable Joe, the mysterious Miss Havisham, sweet Biddy, snooty Estella, and of course the mysterious Magwitch.

We would expect someone born into his social class to remain in this position forever, without much hope for improvements. However, Pip surprises us when he has a chance encounter with Miss Havisham, an old, grumpy, widow. She's obviously delirous, upset at men who have crossed her, and does take out some of her anger at poor Pip. But yet Pip is lucky behind his wildest dreams, for he is about to meet the beautiful Estella, and while this may appear normal, it is definitely not. And this is what makes &quot;Great Expectations&quot; a classic: the book is about Cinderella from reverse: it is the man, in this particular instance, who moves from working-class peasant to meeting an upper-class elegant lady who is beautiful beyong Pip's dreams.It is an aspiring tale in that it tells the reader that they, too, may be able to have widespread class mobility.

Sure, I know the language is a bit of a challenge, but that's what a dictionary is for!Anyway, I haven't yet finished the book (I still have a long way to go,) for I'm only on chapter 13, but I had to chime in and counterattack what all of the rest of the whiney students have said. So far, the way Dickens portrays his characters (by means of language, description, and dialogue) seems ultimately realistic (it should be, considering it was written in the 1830's) and there are many things throughout the book one has to come to love: Pip's almighty guilty conscience, the friendship bond between Pip and Joe, etc.I can't sum up everything, for as I've said, I'm not finished yet, but for those of you who are being forced to read it, read it with an open mind. One of the reasons why I understand this book and find it a good read may be due to the fact that our class discusses the book as a whole, AND we have vocab sets weekly to help enrich what we read."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I never had to read Dickens in high school or in college; so I decided to try this classic author.

Nicholas Nickleby is next for me..."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Certainly one of the most famous of Dickens's novels (right up there withOliver Twist (Penguin Classics)andDavid Copperfield (Penguin Classics)), Great Expectations follows a familiar coming-of-age narrative as young Phillip Pirrip - better known as \\"Pip\\" - negotiates the rocky road to adulthood in early 19th century London. One of only two of Dickens's novels that are written in first person narrative (the other being David Copperfield), Great Expectations is a fascinating tale of ambition, love, regret, missed chances and redemption, topped off with an adequately ambiguous ending (more on that later).Raised by his tyrannical sister and her kind, doting husband Joe, Pip is contented enough to become a blacksmith and live out his life by the misty Kent marshlands. That is until he is unexpectedly thrown into the path of two extraordinary people. The first is a convict, escaped from the prison barges offshore, a terrifying man who coerces the young Pip into stealing him some supplies from his sister's larder. Stricken by guilt and terror, Pip complies. The second is the mysterious Miss Havisham, a spinster woman who employs Pip as a playmate for her young ward, the beautiful Estella. Estella is regal, snobbish and cold - naturally, Pip falls head over heels in love with her, despite the realization that she's far beyond his status. Wretchedly aware of his own shortcomings, Pip yearns for a chance to make a gentleman of himself, and win the hand of fair Estella.And then, just as unexpectedly, fortune is thrown his way. He is informed by Miss Havisham's lawyer that a secret benefactor has endowed him with great expectations, and that he is to travel to London in order to prepare for his future. The only catch is that Pip is forbidden from investigating the origins of his newfound fortune, although logic dictates that it must be Miss Havisham, who surely has designs for both Pip and Estella. Locked up in a house full of bitter memories after she was jilted by her lover, Miss Havisham is certainly one of Dickens's most famous creations, with her own disturbing brand of revenge against mankind: to unleash her prot&eacute;g&eacute;e Estella out upon the world, to break hearts wherever she goes.Dickens has created a twisty and labyrinthine plot, with plenty of intrigue and adventure throughout, as familial bonds, secret alliances and loyalty among friends and work colleges are tried and tested. In typical Dickensian style, there are several extraordinary coincidences concerning shrouded parentage and wayward meetings, but everything hangs so well together that it's instantly forgivable. \\"Great Expectations\\" is Dickens at his best in terms of plotting and characterization; though there is a melancholy twinge throughout that no doubt stems from Dickens's personal trouble (he had recently divorced his wife, and has carrying on a stress-filled love affair with a young actress). As such, romanticized domestic bliss that so often concludes a Dickens's novel (reflective of Dickens's own longing for such a state) is completely absent here. The domestic angel-woman that is given so many names and forms throughout the canon of Dickens novels (here called Biddy, though she is virtually identical to dozens of other Dickens heroines) comes to a surprising end in \\"Great Expectations\\", as does Pip himself.Pip himself is certainly an interesting character; in that he is woefully aware of his own shortcomings, yet unable drop certain attitudes that make him miserable. After becoming accustomed to the life at Miss Havisham's manor house, he is frustrated to find that he now holds his beloved brother-in-law Joe in contempt, embarrassed at his low breeding and lack of gentlemanly manners (despite the fact that Joe was always his staunch ally against Pip's terrible sister, and the epitome of the virtuous commoner). Likewise is Pip's self acknowledgment that his love for Estella never brings him any happiness, only pain and longing. The fact that Pip is narrating his own story from a point in time *beyond* the proceedings mean that we are never overly critical of Pip, considering he is his own harshest critic when relating his behaviour - and it certainly makes you consider your own shortcomings.This is not to say that the whole story is woe and misery, as there are plenty of comedic characters that help lighten the mood, such as Pip's best friend Herbert Pocket, who (at their first meeting) challenges him to a fight, and Mr Wemmick, who survives his job by assuming two personalities: a grim and dour one during working hours, and a cheerful one when he returns home. There are several moments of humour in Pip himself, (though they are usually tempered by a sense of disappointment or miscommunication) such as his misreading of his parent's gravestone, or his excitement in reaching London gradually dissipating when he realizes that...well, that it's a bit of a hole.Last of all, there has already been several mentions in other reviewers about the fact that there are two endings to this novel; the first was considered too melancholy by Dickens's publishers, and so was revised (although to be fair, Dickens's himself didn't seem to put up too much of a fight, suggesting that he himself was divided on the issue). The published ending is still ambiguous, yet with room for hope (at least in the mind of Pip) as to the future with Estella. Now, most agree that the original ending is more powerful, and I have to agree. However, I do issue a warning *not* to read both endings in the same sitting. In my edition the original ending was added in an appendix directly after the conclusion to the book, and because it is so drastically different to the published ending, it disrupted my appreciation of the novel. I was left in two minds as to what truly happened. So if you're a serious reader, do yourself a favour and decide what ending you want to go with *before* you finish the book. It may be a tricky business, but it'll enhance your enjoyment of one of Dickens's best novels."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Dickens' ability to turn a beautiful phrase is done complete justice by Michael Page. He delivers all that Dickens intends for you to find in Great Expectations, as though he was Pip's shadow for those many years described in the story. This CD set is worth listening to; I looked for chances to get in the car and continue the story."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"When his magazine, All the Year Round, began failing due to an unpopular serial, Dickens was forced to begin publishing installments of a story of his own. The resulting work, Great Expectations, was published weekly from December 1, 1860 to August 3, 1861. This was his second semi-autobiographical work, but where David Copperfield was a confident expression of faith in middle class values, Great Expectations offers a bleaker view of whether those values will lead to happiness. In fact, Dickens own marriage had just come to an end after many unhappy years. Indeed he had recently changed the name of the magazine from the more bucolic Household Words. Despite, or because, of this ambivalence, Great Expectations became one of his greatest achievements.Pip, a boy of the marshes, is being &quot;raised by hand&quot; by his shrieking harridan of an older sister and her seemingly doltish husband, the blacksmith Joe Gargery. One day, while visiting his parents' gravesite, Pip is accosted by an escaped convict who demands that he bring him a file and some &quot;wittles&quot;. When the convict, Abel Magwitch, is later captured, he accepts the blame for stealing the file and food before being carted back to prison.Shortly thereafter, Pip is invited up to Miss Havisham's manor house to play with her beautiful ward Estella. Miss Havisham's life came to a halt when she was jilted at the altar, all clocks are stopped at the hour of her betrayal, the feast lies rotting on tables &amp; she wanders about in the decaying wedding gown. Estella is to be the instrument of her revenge upon men.Eventually, &quot;Great Expectations&quot; are settled upon Pip when a secret benefactor sets up a trust in his name and sends him to London to be educated and become a gentleman. Pip assumes, and Havisham allows him to believe, that she is his benefactress and that he is being elevated to a position that will make him worthy of Estella.As Pip rises in society, he leaves Joe behind, despite the many kindnesses Joe had shown him growing up. He becomes a shallow arrogant middle class climber. So he is stunned when he discovers that he is actually benefiting from the secret wealth of Magwitch, who made a fortune in Australia after being transported. Moreover, Magwitch's unlawful return to England puts him and Pip in danger. Meanwhile, Estella has married another, a horrible man who Pip despises. Eventually, with Magwitch's recapture and death in prison and with his fortune gone, Pip ends up in debtors prison, but Joe redeems his debts and brings him home. Pip realizes that Magwitch was a more devoted friend to him than he ever was to Joe and with this realization Pip becomes, finally, a whole and decent human being.Originally, Dickens wrote a conclusion that made it clear that Pip and Estella will never be together, that Estella is finally too devoid of heart to love. But at the urging of others, he changed the ending and left it more open ended, with the possibility that Estella too has learned and grown from her experiences and her wretched marriages.This is the work of a mature novelist at the height of his powers. It has everything you could ask for in a novel: central characters who actually change and grow over the course of the story, becoming better people in the end; a plot laden with mystery and irony; amusing secondary characters; you name it, it's in here. I would rank it with A Tale of Two Cities, Oliver Twist and David Copperfield among the very best novels of the worlds greatest novelist.GRADE: A+"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I listened to the unabridged audio tape version of this book narrated by Michael Page. It's one of those deals where you listen to each tape entirely on the left channel, then play the whole tape again on the right channel to get the next part of the story. Which is kind of awkward, since you forget which channel you were on if you also use your stereo for music; but these editions are probably the least expensive (by the hour) audio tapes you can buy.I think Dickens' tendency toward exhaustive descriptions works a lot better when you're listening to it in the car than when you're reading it in print. I might never have had the patience to read the actual book while sitting in a chair, but listening to it in the car was pretty entertaining. Colorful characters, humor, suspense, unexpected plot twists; I can picture a lot of it in my mind even now.

This edition has the 1986 introduction by John Irving. It contains the Dickens classic in its intact form, with the original ending following it separately. It is 528 pages.When Dickens first wrote Great Expectations, it had a different ending. There are some who feel that the original ending is more in line with modern tastes, and that Dickens \\"caved in\\" by changing the unhappy ending to one that was \\"more acceptable.\\" Some feel that Dickens went too far in order to cater to his audience rather than stick to a literary standard. In the introduction, Irving discusses this issue among many others and suggests that Dickens was not so much driven by the audience as he was in touch with their lives when it came to inspiration. Ideas in literature may seem fantastic and improbable, but Irving points to events in Dickens's life that would seem equally improbable had they appeared in fiction. He also mentions modern real life events that, if put in a novel a decade earlier, would have seemed impossibly unrealistic.Yes, Dickens was an optimist. But the new ending is not a \\"happily ever after\\" one so much as one that leaves the door open.

Great Expectations is about the unexplicable evil youth encounters and how one should rise above the hate and vindictiveness of stupid, petty people. It is a book that explains that there is great suffering in the world and there are those that will hate you for no other reason than that you look the way you do, or simply for the fact you exist in the form you are, or have the ancestors you have. And this hate may never be fully exposed, but be there none-the-less, lingering in mysterious shadow and never seen. An honest read of this book by my ninth graders allowed some, who felt anger and self-pity in the form of vengful hate, to rise a little out of their cycle of dispare. The greatest revenge, some say, against your oppressor is to live happily. The book shows how a vengeful heart is so self mutilating and unfulfilling. Great Expectations runs the coarse of someone who managed to forgive. It is a moving book and one that gives inner strength and respectful grace and recognition to the divine in all of us. It is better to not get bogged down in a discussion of Dicken's personal life, which is a mixed bag, but just read the book. Why would ultra feminists hate this book? Because they hate. Hateful people will hate a book that so poignantly exposes these wreched people for what they are. The book also shows, most significantly, and contrary to much of the belief of the time, that bad people can reform and become good. The significance of this, and its effect that Dicken's made upon this notion, is as haunting and deep a goodness as the evil Mrs. Havisham placed in Stela's soul."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great expectations is a very good book. It has action and a meaning. The book starts off by pip, which is a young orphan boy, going to a graveyard to look at his parent's tombstone. Then a escape convict grabs pip and tells him to bring him food and a file for his chains. The next day pip brings the man what he wants and then police capture the man but he protects pip and says he stole the food because he is touched by pips kindness. Then one-day pip is taken to the satis house, the home of miss Havisham, pip meets a beautiful young girl named Estella and falls in love with her. One-day Jaggers who is a lawyer tells pip that he has received a great fortune from a secret benefactor. The man tells pip he must go to London immediately to start his education as a gentleman. Pip thinks miss Havisham has given him the fortune. When pip is in London he finds new friends and begins to treat his old friends coldly, especially Joe. Several years later a familiar face comes in to pips room it is the convict, Magwitch. He then tells pip that he is pips benefactor. Pip then agrees to help him escape London. Compeyson is pursuing Magwitch and pip later finds out that Compeyson is the one who left miss Havisham on the alter and that Estella is Magwitch's daughter. Pip begins to care for the convict but later Pip hears that Estella has married another man. When Pip goes to visit miss Havisham she catches on fire and is burned badly. During the escape attempt Pip and Magwitch are capture by police. Magwitch is sentenced to death and Pip loses his fortune. He gets back together with Joe and later ends up marrying Estella and living happily ever after. I think that the author of this book could have made this book in 3rd person instead of 1st and it could have made it better. I think that this book was well writen had had a good message of dont let money go to your head and know who your true friends are. I recommed this book to anybody."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"It may be difficult to rehabilitate Dickens from the reputation assigned to him by his critics, such as his being labelled as a spinner of popular yarns; a prime representative of Victorian strait-laced morality; a notoriously verbose prosaist whose writing teems with rhetorical redundancies and digressions; a careless plotter and over-plotter with a propensity for hyperbolic and grotesque comedy, depicting grim and depressing situations peopled by caricatures and abnormally exaggerated personages. The criticism that he commits a number of unforgivable Freudian flaws cannot so easily be obviated as well. Unlike the more firmly established exponents of the realist novel, such as Stendhal, Balzac and Dostoevsky, with their searching psychological assessments of character and motive, Dickens seems concerned mainly with evoking the idea of a certain character and not the character itself in its concrete, three-dimensional actuality. This explains his penchant for caricature. Nevertheless, his ability to present concrete characters is illustrated in &quot;Great Expectations&quot;, one of his later and finer works, particularly the characters of Pip and the convict Magwitch, who are psychologically profound and sympathetic portrayals in comparison to the host of other characters. His ability as a profound satirist and social critic is conclusively demonstrated by his interweaving his analysis of class, injustice and crime with the narrative. Pip, who finds himself elevated from his humble origins to one of the highest strata of society, by being made into a gentleman by a mysterious benefactor, is shocked to discover that this same benefactor, the agent of his social progress, is a despicable criminal who offends him by his sight. The message is obvious: society is a complex network of interrelations that interpenetrate class divisions; Miss Havisham is jilted by Compeyson, who is Magwitch's accomplice; Magwitch is the benefactor of Pip, who is in love with Estella, Magwitch's daughter. All, Dickens seems to say, are equal, regardless of their class or origin, before the judgement of God, which transcends human judgement. This is memorably brought out in the courtroom scene, during Magwitch's trial, in the description of the shaft of light that illuminated the room, \\"between the two-and-thirty [prisoners] and the Judge, linking them both together and perhaps reminding some among the audience, how both were passing on with absolute equality, to the greater Judgement that knoweth all things and cannot err.\\" Dickens's moral is the necessity of human fellowship, which we see lacking in the dehumanised Jaggers and Wemmick and in Estella and Miss Havisham, who both come to tragic or regrettable ends, through their coldheartedness and pitilessness. This quality, Dickens's use of plot coincidences to deliver profound human statements, partially redeems him from the charges of being a mere popular storyteller or a romanticist. In this respect, and also with regard to his verisimilitude in rendering authentic detail, he invites comparison with the great realists, such as Flaubert and Joyce, the masters of radical and even amoral realism, though Dickens, with his undisguised moralising, his chaste heroes and puritanical heroines, does not sit comfortably amongst these two; both of whom had works banned, one for his apparent frankness, the other for his obscenity and scatology. &quot;Great Expectations&quot; remains, however, as one of the great representatives of the realist, or social, novel, the product of an age that abolished serfdom and slavery, that witnessed the Industrial Revolution, the growth of large towns and the expansion of business enterprise. as such, it is an invaluable document of its time."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"A classic British novel written by Charles Dickens, Great Expectations, is a great novel with a very good moral at the end. The main character, Pip, is a very dynamic character. His morals and thoughts change throughout the book.In the beginning Pip grows up living with his aunt but then he gets an anonymous benefactor who helps him grow up a new life as a boy with a good education and living as an upper class citizen.

Also, the cover does not press an image of the characters or setting onto you, and allows you to picture your own Pip or Estella. Other editions of this book might not give you so many resources and be so reader-friendly. I am glad that I was forced to read this book, because I would have never read it on my own, or I would have quit after the first book---- which is a little boring, but reveals some very important facts to develop the intricate and complex plot. Isn't it great how everything ties up so nicely in Dickens? Read this book, but make sure never to question the genius of Dickens... putting you halfway to sleep before dropping a bomb and putting a huge plot into action.

And then there is the reappearance of Magwitch, the escaped convict who forced Pip to steal for him when Pip was a young boy. While Pip's maturation and moral education forms the heart of novel with his usual array of unforgettable characters, such as Miss Havisham, Joe Gargery, Jaggers, and of course Pip.

The only problem is I don't want to get out of my car.The reader does a fabulous job of bringing Dickens many wonderful characters to life. I heartily recommend."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"\\"Great Expectations\\" was Charles Dickens' third attempt at writing semi-autobiography, and his most successful. Poor Oliver Twist barely registers in his own book, while David Copperfield becomes a pasteboard figure after reaching adulthood. Pip only grows richer and more complex, and it's no wonder critics thus see \\"Great Expectations\\" as the best of the lot.We open with the finest sequence in the novel, along a swampy coastline in southern England where a small boy at his parent's grave is threatened by a desperate convict. The convict wants food and a file to help cut him free. The boy, Pip, must wrestle with some serious guilt, not to mention the threat of his sister and guardian's overzealous discipline. Social expectations cut one way, but a rogue feeling of sympathy for the convict guides him another. Which will win out?Pip's a bit of a prat, but he's meant to be. After coming into some mysterious money, the former blacksmith's apprentice abandons those who love him in a doomed attempt to win over Estella, the high-class, heart-challenged ward of balmy Miss Havisham. Estella bothers some people. How could Pip love her? Man, I've been there, and I reckon a lot of others have been, too. Estella is one of the great fictional representations of unrequited love, and in Dickens' hands, becomes something even more potent, a symbol of class division and status-scrambling folly.Dickens' handling of Pip is subtle and worth careful re-reading. By using the device of an older, unseen Pip as narrator, we sense where he fell astray without it being pointed out overmuch. Clashing with a snooty rival for Estella's affections, he sweats the possibility of being discovered as the friend of a guileless village blacksmith, Joe: \\"So throughout life our worst weaknesses and meannesses are usually committed for the sake of the people whom we most despise.\\"Whenever the focus is on Pip, particularly when dealing with Estella, Miss Havisham, or the mysterious, vaguely creepy lawyer Mr. Jaggers, \\"Great Expectations\\" is both high art and a great read. Dickens' descriptive powers remained in high beam in this, his penultimate novel (completed in 1861). The storyline takes its time, but in such a way that it often feels like a prototype for the stream-of-consciousness narrative authors would employ a century later.If only \\"Great Expectations\\" didn't suffer from one of Dickens' chief bte noires, compounding coincidences. Whether it's the identity of Estella's long-lost father or Miss Havisham's unworthy suitor, too many of the plot strands wind up twisted together to unwholesome effect.Other plot strings, like the tale of a blackguard named Orlick or the romances of Pip's pals Herbert Pocket and Wemmick, do little to merit the lengthy attention they receive. Most annoying is the story of Compeyson, built up as Pip's main adversary. Yet we hardly meet the guy before he vanishes in the black waters of Dickens' top-heavy plot machinations.Except for Jaggers, Estella, and Miss Havisham, \\"Great Expectations\\" suffers from an uninteresting cast of supporting characters. But when you have three such meaty characters, not to mention the noble yet shifting Pip at the center, you have one eminently worthy novel. Add to that Dickens' descriptive abilities, and that harrowing opening, and \\"Great Expectations\\" delivers most of the way on its title's promise."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"i enjoy these barnes and noble editions. pocket books make a nice addition to the library."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I do pretty much all my \\"reading\\" on audio books these days and Michael Page is probably my favorite narrator so far. He changes his voice for each character in a way that sounds so natural and undistracting, and his female voices are not annoying (I think the mark of a really great narrator is how undistracting their \\"opposite gender\\" voices are.)The story of Great Expectations deserves to be told by someone of Page's talent. I first read it by accident when I was a kid, not realizing it was a classic (always avoided books I was supposed to read.) I liked it well enough then, but I love it now. The characters are interesting, the morality of the book is not preachy and it's such a substantial book that you can listen to it several times and still pick up some new insight or pleasure. If you're an impatient reader, the book is probably not for you. If you need action on every page, you might get bored. But if you are a people person and you like getting to know the characters of a book, if you like to look for truth in fiction, it's a great story, very well told."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Well, I was looking through some of the reviews posted here on amazon just to get an idea of what to write because this is my first review, and saw that a few people said that you need to be an adult to read this book. I kind of understand what they mean because this is a pretty dense novel, as most of Dicken's writing is. However, I don't feel that an individual's determines his maturity as a reader, and so, I dont feel that people should be discouraging teenagers from reading this classic book.Having said that, let me discuss a few key points that are important to keep in mind when considering whether or not to buy the book. Firstly, this is a very difficult read, so unless you are accustomed to reading classical fiction, be prepared to devote more time to reading the book than you generally would to a novel of similar length (450ish pages). Furthermore, the book is a drag at times, especially in during the first part. Often times, I would get lost while reading the book because I couldn't focus on the descriptions which seemed to get in the way of the plot. However, I have to give Dickens credit on doing a remarkable job of writing the dialogue between characters which allows the reader to immerse into the story. Whenever I wasn't lost, I would often feel as if I was right in the center of the scene and could vividly visualize what was going on around the protagonist.As for the theme of the book, I felt that it tried to impart a good, however slightly shallow, message on the reader. By the end of the book, it is very clear what the message is as all of the characters get what they deserve. However, having read a lot of philosophical literature, I feel compelled on extracting deeper meaning from everything around me, which is kind of hard to do from this book.My recommendation of this book would depend on the reader, I feel that if you have read another book of a similar genre or time period, then you would really enjoy this book otherwise it might be very boring. If this is your first time reading a book by a classical writer, might I recommend visiting sparknotes after every couple of chapters to get a clearer understanding of the plot. Also, I would recommend to every single person to only buy this book if they can dedicate significant time to reading it. Don't think this is one of those books that you can just read anytime you have a few minutes here or there because you will be lost and won't understand it at all. I feel it would be best to sit down and just read for an hour or two (depending on your attention span) and delve deep into the world of the characters. Not only does this process make identifying character development easier, it also makes the book more enjoyable.Also, for anyone who finds Dicken's writing style interesting, I recommend looking at David Copperfeild (just read the first paragraph, and you will be hooked)."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"During the course of the year I try to read a few, &quot;Important Novels&quot; in order to get a fuller understanding of literature. Dicken's &quot;Great Expectations&quot; has been on my list for nearly a year. I completely dreaded reading what I thought would be a long and drawn out story about something I could careless about. Well, I was wrong.&quot;Great Expectations&quot; is now #1 on my all-time favorites list. While, admittedly, it took me roughly 150 pages to get any enjoyment out of the novel- once I was in- I was hooked. Pip's journey through life is a very refreshing look at how distorted we let our lives become by focusing on the unimportant. Dicken's ability to slowly alter Pip's views on life, without changing his essential character/morales (Ex. How Pip looks to help his friend in his business pursuits). Some have called &quot;Great Expecations&quot; his masterpiece... but in my opinion, it may be the &quot;Masterpiece&quot; of English Literature.I also wonder why this is required High School reading. While I loved this book at age 28, I think most 16 year-olds would find it unbearable. It seems like such a waist to ruin both the book and Dicken's name on minds that are not ready for such a reading task."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I am definately a fan of Great Expectations (although don't go see the movie made about it with Gweneth Paltrow).

My recommendation will probably mean little because if your still in school you will probably have to read it anyways...but I still recommend it."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great Expectations was ok, but there were a few things that the author could have done better. First, in my opinion he shouldn't have changed certain characters names around, which can be confusing for some people. There is also illegal activities on the part of some of the characters. Also, even the abridged version of the book is a bit long. Perhaps Dickens could have wound things up in a tighter package for the reader. Dickens plot can be a bit confusing at times, and the reader sometimes is left to piece together the novel for himself.However, this is not a necessesarily a totally boring read. There are several good things about it. Lying is at least partially looked at in a negative light, and steadfast faithfulness among friends is evident among some of the book's main characters. Justice is done to an man for his wrongdoing.Overall, the book is readable but too long. Also, when considering this book, keep in mind that author's back then, are different from authors today.

The modern movie adaption with Ethan Hawke is one of my favorite movies and I always thought it was a beautiful love story with a real human quality. The book is much different then the movie, but however I believe the modern adaption was incredibley well done considering the difference in time. The book is aslow start but once you are adjusted to the language its actually fast paced reading... especially when Estella returns. My first Dickens and won't be my last. I believe everyone should read the classics"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I got this book assigned to me near the first day of high school this year, and just got finished reading it about a week ago. Let me tell you something, if you know about Dicken's life, this story is kinda based on it. Let me also say this book is extremely boring in the beginning, because you are learning the peices of the puzzle, but the second half is excellent, and all the peices of the puzzle came together, which is why this is an excellent book. My favorite character was definetely Miss Havisham. Don't give up on this book!!! This is the kind of book I think needs a small sequel."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I think that the character development alone makes this novel stand out as one of the best novels of Charles Dickens. The plot summary is also well-crafted, with so many characters intertwining in the books final chapters. We see a personality change in not only Pip, but other major characters such as Estella and Miss Havisham, as we find out that they are all connected in some way.This book might be seen as a rather long and detailed book. Some of the details are probably overdone and unnecessary. This is definitely a book that takes some getting used to. However, I think that one of the morals of the book-- understanding your roots and accepting them-- make this a great book to read.The many characters contrast each other in so many ways, and there are so many good and bad characters, that it becomes a fun book to read. However, you must have patience to read a book this long and detailed.I think this book is well-written (some of the language is a little tough), and Dickens exposes his great writing ability and his abilty to deal with a complex plot and make it all come together in Great Expectations."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Charles Dickens was one of the most popular writers of all time, creating some of the best-known characters in English literature. In the book \\"Great Expectations\\", the protagonist and narrator, Pip begins the story as a young orphan boy being grown up by his sister. I like this book, because Charles Dickens takes you right inside the Pip's mind and you live through the events and discoveries of his life with him. Pip is passionate, romantic and somewhat unrealistic at heart. That makes the novel interesting. Of course, you cannot forget the great love story (Pip and Estella). The other characters Magwitch, Miss Havisham, Joe Gargery, Miss Joe, Estella, Mr Jaggers and Mr Wemmick are all unique and special in their way and they add to the novel's richness. Another thing I really liked was how all of the characters are interrelated to each other in ways that you may not discover until you get to the end of the novel. This novel will make you sometimes laugh and sometimes make you feel sad, but it is always entertaining. Latif Dose simplifies the texts. The language is very clear. There are not old English words and this gives the reader much pleasure while reading the novel. I think most young people would like this novel because it's not as hard to read as an other classic books. I recommend Great Expectations to anyone who wants to read a good, classic book because Great Expectations has a little bit of everything in it, mystery, romance and suspense. You cannot easily find all of these properties in other novels, which makes &quot;Great Expectations&quot; a special and a classic one.. That makes this novel very different. It is probably one of the top ten English novels of the 19th century. Some of the passages are beautiful. I cannot forget Pip's response to Estella when she says \\"You will get me out of thoughts in a week.\\""},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"It was hard to get into for the first 200 pages. The end was nice though. It was not as good as I expected it to be. Not one of Dickens's best. David Copperfield was much better."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"HAHAHHAH696"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I too have been out of school for some time. I decided explore the classics. Mr. Dickens has such a command of the English language so much so that I could not put it down. He expatiated very well throughout the entire pages of the book. I did not read it without my dictionary; which is the reason I read it to expand my vocabulary. After reading this book television became very boring to me. My favorite is Joe Gargery and John Wemmick. Joe because of his stick-to-itiveness. He is the same no matter what. The latter because of his ability to separate work with Jaggers from home. He enjoys life to the max and loves his father so. Pip is also to be appreciated for he does see what is most important in life and the value of love is what is important. After reading this book I have embarked on two others: Much Ado About Nothing (which I have thorougly enjoy) and Silas Marner which is great also. I hope everyone can find the enjoyment of reading for pleasure and learning as I have. Happy reading"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"A great book in concept. However, Dickens was apparently paid by the word. Especially the silly ones, like &quot;prithee&quot; and &quot;vittles&quot;. It is time that we stopped attacking freshmen honors students with this pretentious book, which serves only to drive them away from English forever. Nowhere near the best of Dicken's work, the book reads like a 19th century soap opera, without bathroom breaks and Snuggle-bear commercials. By the time the first interesting character returns to the novel, the reader is lucky if he or she hasn't choked to death on tears of frustration. Why is Estelle such a b****? Why is Ms. Havisham such an old hag? Why is Pip so utterly slackjawed that he permits 20 years of idiocy to be perpetrated upon his stale English carcass? Why, after all, doesn't his benefactor take care of business, murder the lot, and turn this into something vaguely enjoyable? Never mind the fact that Dickens couldn't choose an end, he apparently couldn't even choose a plot, wavering wildly between romance and mystery and the sort of English politics that Michael Palin would love to throw his pasty-white Anglo-Saxon hands about and throttle. Especially the politics. Do we really care about how an English attorney carries himself when we're 15 years old? Not bleeding likely. Powdered wigs and leg stockings sum up the bizarre nature of the staying power of this novel. It's about time that High School English teachers stopped telling one another how *good* this book is, and read it themselves, without the Norton Critical Teacher's Edition beside them. Especially when they have the advantage of alcoholic beverages."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I'm an eighth grade student forced to read this book for English class. Most people would probably assume that the book sucks. Guess what? It does. I'm sorry, but Charles Dickens does not happen to be my cup of tea. He may be a master, but it's impossible to deny that his writing is dry and the story drags in many places. I counted numerous parts of the novel that could have easily been eliminated without affecting the rest of the book. And what the h*** is Pip thinking at the end when he decides to marry (person who I will not name)? Seems to me his only reason for doing this is that he's completely desperate and tired of chasing after Estella all that time. It totally came out of nowhere and wasn't very realistic. The book's really not that bad, but apart from the interesting episodes with Miss Havisham, it's pretty boring."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Some may call me a classic book snob, but here it goes.Great expectations may be at times tedious and I won't deny that, but it is worth it.Charles Dickens goes into great depth of detail and at times a bit overly detailed and I'm sure that is where many people get lost. But if you get the main plot, then you can get the jiff of it.The characters in this book transcend time.Pip, the poor boy who finds himself wondering if he can love old Joe know that he is rich.Estella who cannot love truly but yet brought up to love and destroy.Miss Havisham, the old rich woman who had her heartbroken and know is trying her best to seek revenge.Joe, Biddy and others also play a pivotal role.The story itself plays on the role of moral and also mercy. It shows a colorful and at times exaggerated array of feelings. From grief to greed, to deceit and happiness.Pip, a lonely orphan and living with his sister, finds and help a criminal. Although it was not completely of his own will.Then Pip is introduced to the sad and luxurious world of Miss Havisham where he met Estella, the girl he loved from then on.From then on he resents his meager living until one day he finds out that he had just inherited a large fortune.Then on Pip goes on a quest to truly become a gentleman and win Estella's heart.But how can he win Estella's heart when she doesn't have one?Can he really forsake his family for money?Who gave him that money?"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"The kindle text is fine, but please be alerted that the link provided to get the free audiobook takes you to some japanese website that has nothing to do with Great Expectations that I could find."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This is a really good new book.

But why, for example, doesn't Pip use the Internet to look things up? Stuff like that.

However, I find that while its messages are eternal, Dickens's style is very off-putting. Don't get me wrong, his prose is very, very beautiful, and his characters are layered in a way that many modern novelists seem to forget. Yet his descriptions are extraordinarily, unnecessarily lengthy. It's a novel, not a travel magazine. Considering that Dickens wrote this novel as chapters to be published weekly in a newspaper, it's unsurprising how drawn-out the descriptions are (higher word count = higher profit). Also, by compiling all of his entries into one novel, you find repetition creeping in as you realize he redoes all of the unpleasantly elaborate descriptions from the previous few chapters over again. It's disappointing to read a book that takes you for either a dunce, or someone with short-term memory loss."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Ordered Great Expectations because it has been many years since I originally read it as a requirement for a literature class.

The book starts out when he is 8 years old and he is in a grave yard when an escaped convict comes up to him and demands that he get him some food and a file, so he can get out of his ankle cuffs. Pip does as he is asked and doesn't tell a sole like he had sworn too. The story then continues to follow Pips life as he gets older.This book is an English novel written by Charles Dickens. Charles Dickens wrote many books, of which a couple are required reading by English classes. Great Expectations is a well written book in which the surroundings, characters and noises are well described. Although Great Expectations is well written I feel that the story is a little slow to pick up and, it is hard to become engrossed into the book because it seems a little monotone. In later chapters you can also guess at what might be coming next.Great Expectations though slow to pick up, does have a good, solid story line and can be entertaining to read once you pass the first chapter. This would not be a good book for people who like action books or books with a lot of twists and turns that keep you reading to see what comes next. But if you like a slower paced book with maybe a hint of love in it with a less gripping more predictable out come then Great Expectations would be a good pick."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Well, unlike the multitudes in America, I was NOT forced to read \\"Great Expectations\\" in high school or at any other time. However, lately it seemed like it was time to pick up this old classic and to dig into its treasures.The story starts out with an unlikely scene in a graveyard in a small English village. There we meet a little boy named Pip, who is visiting the gravesites of both of his parents. There we also meet a desperate convict who is cowardly enough to scare the little boy half to death in order to get some food and other items. Pip - an earnest, battered little orphan being raised by his sister and brother-in-law - anxiously sets out to please this convict. And so starts the tale of Pip's life.After the convict scene, Dickens takes his time in setting up exactly what Pip's life was like as he was groomed to take his brother-in-laws place as the blacksmith in the town. Dickens' genius for wit, along with some very likeable characters, help pull the reader through the endless pages of details and slow action.Soon, however, Pip's fortunes change...and then they change again...and then yet again. Yet, while the storyline somewhat resembles a roller coaster, the pacing is so slow that one is never overwhelmed by the action. In fact, I was rather underwhelmed by the amount of action there was for the number of words I was reading.Even so, I would say that this book is worth the effort. Dickens explores human nature of an average man when beset by a number of unusual situations, each one building on the last. Pip is likeable in these scenarios because he is never obnoxiously perfect or unaffected by his changing fortunes. In some ways, he \\"learns his lesson\\" by the end. In others, he does not.While Dickens tackles some rather weighty issues in this book, he does so in his distinctive, chipper, witty manner. Thus, one never really understands the emotional depths that the characters experience due to either their oppressive or their opulent fortunes. But, of course, one does not go to Dickens for emotional depth. One reads Dickens for explorations of tough circumstances with happy endings. If that is what the reader wants, Dickens is probably as able to handle the issues as anyone."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"* * * * * * * * *&quot;Heaven knows we need never be ashamed of ourtears, for they are rain upon the blinding dustof earth, overlying our hard hearts.

That convict has escaped with another, his enemy convict. They are captured in the end but the convict whom Pip aided gives Pip 2pounds and a shilling by his fellow convict later on.Then, Pip is taken to a rich lady, Miss Havisham&iexcl;s and meets proud and heartless Estella whom he falls in love with. Born in a quite a poor family in the country, he tries to be clever so that Estella does not call him common, and quite succeeds. And plus, fortune lays itself in his way by an unknown rich person. A lawyer, Mr. Jaggers knows the provider of the fortune but does not tell Pip who it is because the provider&iexcl;s wish is to let him/herself known when he/she is ready for it. And Pip goes off to London.In London, Pip is introduced to Mr. Matthew Pocket, a relation of Miss Havisham for Mr. Pocket is to be Pip&iexcl;s tutor. Pip lives with Mr. Pocket&iexcl;s son Mr. Herbert Pocket whom he had met before at Miss Havisham&iexcl;s when a child, and becomes very acquainted with him. His other acquaintance is Mr. Wemmick, who works for Mr. Jaggers. He has a different life at work and at home, that makes him peculiar. All this time Pip thinks that the &iexcl;unknown provider&iexcl; of his fortune is doubtlessly Miss Havisham and thinks that she wants Estella and him to be married. However, he finds out that in fact it is not Miss Havisham who gave him his fortune but the old convict he had helped! That convict had escaped again and fled to Australia where he had worked for Pip and had become an owner of quite some money which was given to Pip. And now he comes to Pip and tells him. So that convict is known to Herbert as well and they live together.Now, when Pip was young, his parents had died so he lived with his sister&iexcl;s family. Joe, his brother-in-law is a good friend of his, a blacksmith, but his own sister is not very nice to him. A man called Orlick, who was Joe&iexcl;s helper, thinks very ill of Pip&iexcl;s sister and one day, hits her on the head and makes her a simpleton and she dies after some years. That man Orlick, tries to murder Pip for false reasons but fails for Pip&iexcl;s friends save him.The convict, if captured, would be hanged, therefore, Pip decides that the convict should be out of England as soon as possible and that Pip should accompany him. They plan it, and it proceeds. Meanwhile, Estella is married to a quite rich man and Miss Havisham is dead. The other convict who had escaped with Pip&iexcl;s that long time ago, Pip&iexcl;s convict&iexcl;s foe, follows Pip and the convict on their way out of England and tries to capture them. There is a fight underwater, Pip&iexcl;s convict is alive but is soon captured by the police and his foe is dead underwater. Pip&iexcl;s convict, named Magwitch or Provis is deeply wounded, and dies in prison. Before he dies, Pip finds out that Estella was adopted by Miss Havisham and that her father is Provis, so tells Provis that and that Pip loves his daughter. After that, Provis dies.Pip has an old acquaintance in the country, his hometown, a lady named Biddy. He decides to propose to her, now that Estella is gone, and leaves to the country only to find that Biddy is already married to Joe! He congratulates them and thinks about another little Pip to be in that house, just like he was when he was young. He then departs abroad to where Herbert works, for when Pip was a possessor of a fortune, he had secretly found Herbert that job, and Herbert, not knowing the provider of such a job had invited Pip to be a clerk. Pip lives abroad for eleven years, meanwhile Herbert marries and Pip becomes their &iexcl;partner in the House&iexcl;.After those 11years, he returns to Joe and Biddy&iexcl;s abode where he finds himself there! Named Pip after Pip was a little boy! Pip is warmly greeted, and after dinner, Biddy, who knows all about Estella for Pip had told her when he was young, asks if he surely does not fret for her? Pip replies that he thinks not, but anyway, revisits Miss Havisham&iexcl;s old house. The buildings are taken down, but among the ruins, stands Estella! Her husband had died most unfortunately because of a horse but even before his death, her marriage was not led to be a happy one. For all Pip knew, she was married again, but she was not. Pip and Estella converse about their interests, and Pip says, &iexcl;We are friends.&iexcl; To which Estella continues, &iexcl;And will continue friends apart.&iexcl; Then there is a nice little paragraph, which, if I am not quite mistaken proves that they are married.When I was reading this fantastic novel, I saw a lot of things. On my reading of pre-20th century novels, I only encountered those which were in third person, or first person, but &iexcl;I&iexcl; as a girl, not a boy. Great Expectations was something new, for I had thought that a boy liking a girl is to be quite different from a girl liking a boy and a boy&iexcl;s thoughts about poverty and being ignorant is to be quite different from a girl but I found out that it&iexcl;s quite the same. I mean, it depends on one&iexcl;s character and personality of course, but I found out that some boys do not like telling lies or stealing as much as girls and adults do not. It is a fantastic novel, an excellent read, and although the ending is not originally Charles Dicken&iexcl;s idea, I think Dickens made a great decision to follow what his friend suggested. For the original ending was a sad one, which would have made the reader very unhappy for Pip, whereas the new ending gives some hope and happiness to the reader. I read from a book on Great Expectations that the title, Great Expectations, meant not only Pip&iexcl;s expectations but the reader&iexcl;s of Dickens&iexcl; novels&iexcl; expectations. I surely think that those expectations were rewarded to perfection."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I was forced to read Great Expectations in the ninth grade, and i am still in the ninth grade, so yeah.

It's a classic that my girl has to read for English class. I'm sure she will enjoy it."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Another reviewer claims that you have to be at least 21 years old to read this book. Although I don't think it should be \\"forced\\" on schoolchildren (they will only hate it) I read this novel when I was a child and I loved it. I have just re-read it now and I enjoy it all the more. This is my favorite novel by Dickens. It is from his later period and is criticized for being too dark - which, however, makes it more perfect for today's sensibilities. Stephen King cites this work as one of his favorites: he believes that it is this book that brought the gothic novel mainstream.Was there ever a novelist who created more memorable characters than Dickens? Here, we meet perhaps his most intriguing - Miss Havisham. For anyone unfamiliar with the story, I will not spoil it by describing her. The story is similar to parable about the prodigal son - good Pip inexplicably comes into some money and goes off to the corrupting city.AN IMPORTANT THING TO NOTE: Dickens wrote two ending for this book. His friends thought that the original ending was too downbeat and they asked him to come up with a different one. It is the upbeat ending that is the official ending of the novel. However, most critics agree that the original unpublished ending is better. Most modern editions feature the unpublished ending in an appendix. MAKE SURE YOU BUY A COPY THAT CONTAINS THE ORIGINAL ENDING!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great Expectations is one of Dickens's later novels, a work of his artistic maturity. The narrative is symbolic rather than realistic. Although, as in most of Dickens and in Victorian literature in general, the plot relies heavily on coincidence, it is acceptable here because the events are true to the internal, psychological, logic of the story.After writing A Tale of Two Cities, which was unique among his novels in that it had none of his trademark humor, Dickens set out to make Great Expectations rich in comic elements. This despite, or perhaps because of, being in a depressed state of mind himself at the time. The conventional critical view is that he largely failed in this attempt, but I strongly disagree. The book is hilariously funny in parts and the main character, Pip, exhibits a characteristically British humour-in-adversity throughout his adventures. There is also the host of minor comic characters that we expect from Dickens. And he for once manages pathos without spilling over into bathos, so there are tears as well as laughter here, sometimes both at once.If you have not yet read any Dickens, this is not a bad book with which to start, although for younger readers (teens) I would recommend Hard Times or A Tale of Two Cities as their first. Great Expectations demands a mature sensibility to appreciate its symbolism and psychological depth. Perhaps because it chiefly concerns the childhood and youth of the protagonist, it is often given to young people to read and is a set text in some High School classes. This is a pity because, in its dark complexity, it is more likely to turn youngsters off, rather than onto, Dickens."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I've never read any Dickens of my own free will. I was forced to read &quot;A Tale of Two Cities&quot; in high school and I thought that was enough for me. However, one day, on a whim, I bought a copy of Great Expectations. I'm not sure what I expected, but I certainly didn't expect to love it as much as I did.Dickens is not a writer to read at a swift pace. Indeed, this novel was written in weekly episodes from December 1860 to August 1861 and, as it was created to be a serial, each installment is full of varied characters, great descriptions and a lot of action which moves the plot along and leaves the reader yearning for more. Therefore, unlike some books which are easily forgotten if I put them down for a few days, Great Expectations seemed to stick around, absorbing my thoughts in a way that I looked forward to picking it up again. It took me more than a month to read and I savored every morsel.Basically the story is of the self-development of Pip, an orphan boy being raised by his sister and her blacksmith husband in the marshlands of England in 1820.Every one of the characters were so deeply developed that I felt I was personally acquainted with each one of them. There was Pip's roommate, Herbert Pocket, the lawyer, Mr. Jaggers, and his clerk, Mr. Wemmick. And then there was the wicked Orlick. The dialogues were wonderful. The characters often didn't actually say what they meant but spoke in a way that even though the words might be obtuse, there was no mistaking their meaning. I found myself smiling at all these verbal contortions.Dickens' work is richly detailed and he explores the nuances of human behavior. I enjoyed wallowing in the long sentences and letting myself travel backwards in time to a different world. However, even with the footnotes, I found myself sometimes confused by the British slang of 150 years ago, and there were several passages I had to read over several times in order to get the true meaning. Of course I was not in a particular rush. I didn't have to make a report to a class or take a exam about the book. This is certainly a pleasure.I heartily recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a good read.ting from the secret wealth of Magwitch, who made a fortune in Australia after being transported. Moreover, Magwitch's unlawful return to England puts him and Pip in danger. Meanwhile, Estella has married another, a horrible man who Pip despises. Eventually, with Magwitch's recapture and death in prison and with his fortune gone, Pip ends up in debtors prison, but Joe redeems his debts and brings him home. Pip realizes that Magwitch was a more devoted friend to him than he ever was to Joe and with this realization Pip becomes, finally, a whole and decent human being.Originally, Dickens wrote a conclusion that made it clear that Pip and Estella will never be together, that Estella is finally too devoid of heart to love. But at the urging of others, he changed the ending and left it more open ended, with the possibility that Estella too has learned and grown from her experiences and her wretched marriages.This is the work of a mature novelist at the height of his powers. It has everything you could ask for in a novel: central characters who actually change and grow over the course of the story, becoming better people in the end; a plot laden with mystery and irony; amusing secondary characters; you name it, it's in here. I would rank it with A Tale of Two Cities, Oliver Twist and David Copperfield among the very best novels of the worlds greatest novelist.GRADE: A+"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This review refers to the audio(CD - Brilliance Audio) edition of \\"Great Expectations\\" by Charles Dickens, read by Michael PageThis unabridged audio edition of Dickens' classic superb chronology of \\"Pip's' journey through life going from a poor boy to becoming a man with \\"expectations\\" is simply marvelous. As Pip comes into a small fortune, and becomes a \\"gentleman\\" he learns the value and true meaning of friendships and life. But the journey is a long one, with many lessons to be learned along the way before he can find his true self. Dickens has given us a wonderful story, with rich details of the setting and characters that grow and are among the most interesting and magnetic to be found in literature.I don't need to go on and on about the book itself(although I could easily go over my allotted word count here), if you haven't read it yet ,just know you are in for one heck of a literary treat. It is a story that will transport you to another time and place, and you may not want to come back. I will however, talk about this marvelous audio edition. Michael Page is the reader, and what a reading he gives. Just curl up and listen to this master storyteller. Every voice, every nuance is captured. There is no doubt who is speaking as he gives each character the personality and cultural characteristics as Dickens intended. He even does the women wonderfully, without going over the top. In my mind Miss Havisham has always sounded just the way Page portrayed her, Estella as uppity as ever,the humble Joe, along with all the rest.The book is an unabridged reading on 16 discs. each discs has 90 very short tracks(about 45 seconds each), I had no trouble starting up where I left off(when I absolutely had to leave off). I just made a mental note(or you could even write it down) of the track number and disc where I stopped it. The sound quality is excellent, and total running time is about 20 hours. Each disc is in it's own paper CD holder with a clear front so you can see the disc number you are looking for.If you are a fan of this book, this audio edition will give you a fresh read and new appreciation of this fascinating book. If you are experiencing it for the first time, you can't help but to become enthralled. Great to take on long drives or for younger readers to be introduced to classic literature in a most entertaining way.Enjoy the read...for the 1st Time or the 50th time!....Lauriemore great audio reads:A Christmas Carolread by Geoffrey Palmer-Carrie(read by Sissy Spacek)Back When We Were Grownups(read by Blair Brown)The Shipping News(read by Paul Hecht)"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I love this book! This is one of my all-time favorite books ever. I had to read it eons ago when I was in ninth grade, and now (14 years later) I am still enjoying it. Every few years I take this one down from my bookshelf to revisit. This is the story of Pip, a small orphaned boy living in poverty in the English countryside with his much older sister and her husband. Pip meets a convict in a graveyard one damp morning and helps him out in the form of some vittles and an iron file. Later in the story, Pip moves from poverty to being a &quot;gentleman&quot; due to the influence of a mysterious, anonymous benefactor. This book tells of his adventures and how Pip's expectations guide him through life. Towards the end of the story, Pip finds out that reality is sometimes very different from what we expect it to be. The characters are what really make this book stand out. Charles Dickens is a master of character development, and his descriptions of Miss Havisham, Wemmick, Joe, and the others is brilliant! The dialogue is great, with the words written the way a commoner would have spoken in England in the 1800's. Another thing I really liked was how all of the characters are inter-related to each other in ways that you may not discover until you get to the end of the novel.This novel will make you laugh and it might make you sad, but it is always entertaining. If you are in high school and reading this book for the first time for English class, keep at it! It may seem difficult at first if you are not used to Dickens, but this book is well worth it! It is truly a gem."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This book is not the full version, despite the length. There's no indication of this until you get inside the book."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Charles Dickens's acknowledged masterpiece, Great Expectations, is rightly considered one of the greatest novels of all-time. It depth and breadth are staggering, as it follows its protagonist, Pip, from his early childhood through his later life. During the course of his life, we encounter a vast catalog of raw human emotions: love, hate, jealousy, hope, sadness, despair, anger, pity, empathy, sympathy -- and on and on. The story is treasured and revered for many reasons. One of its main strengths is its plot: after a somewhat slow introductory section, Dickens puts his story in fifth gear and delivers a fast-paced and exciting story that gallops along without ever losing interest or clarity. The incredibly complex plotline, full of separate stories and incidents that seem totally unrelated to each other, but are then all harnessed together as the book heads straight toward its denouement, is also full of constant plot twists, which continue up until, literally, the last paragraph. But, of course, as with all of Dickens's major works, it is the characters that make the book. Like Shakespeare, Dickens preferred to have the story develop through the characters, rather than having the characters be mere set pieces inside of an overriding story. And what great characters they are: the perennially paradoxical but essentially human Pip; the bitter and mysterious Miss Havisham; the beautiful and haughty Estella; the simple and saint-like Joe; the kind and benevolent Herbert; the very human convict, Magwitch -- and all of the other wonderful characters. Dickens excelled in creating well-rounded, very human characters who harbored very real and very complex emotions -- that is, human emotions. We identify with Pip as he winds through his life, because we have been there, too -- the disappointments, the surprises, the loves, the anger, the sadness. In whatever way his story may differ from our own, it is still essentially human, as is ours. For all of his complex and paradoxical emotions and sentiments, Pip is a recognizably human character -- and that is why we love him and this book. A masterpiece for the ages, which will endure for years yet to come, Great Expectations is a great book that can be loved by one and all, for, at its heart, is that grain of simple truth that says so much about what is human in all of us -- whether we have great expectations or not."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"The description of Miss Havisham & her home alone is worth two to three stars. This is unlike any other book in the English language, with the possible exception of Emily Bronte's \\"Wuthering Heights?\\" Dickens tells us many things in the begining of the novel that appear out of place or irrelevant, but later those pieces fall into place so that the big picture is revealed.This story runs the gamut of emotions for the reader. Shock, empathy, joy, disappointment, & disdain are all there for the various characters at different times. Multiple plots, detailed descriptions, & ever mutable characters made this a long & entertaining read. This is the story of Phillip Pirrup or Pip. He is a true hardluck case that you root for. His family except for a brother & sister have all passed away. He lives with his sister{a husband beater} & brother in law Joe Gargery in a tiny English village. Oddly for this era, this is one of the few books where fear from a man's perspective is explored. That in itself was refreshing. Along the roller coaster life that Pip finds himself on he meets enigmatic people & gets an anonymous benefactor who helps him reach London to start a better life? Once there life & the nature of Pip himself is radically altered. This is when the title of my review becomes clear. Dickens asks & answers very poignant psychological questions long before Freud was ever heard of."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I chose to write a review of Great Expectations because I wanted to be able to rate a novel &quot;five-stars&quot; without an ounce of hesitation.Context: I'm not by any means some sort of an intellect. Like many people who have read Great Expectations, I was assigned this book in high school. I remember looking to the end of the book, first, to see how many pages there were. I cringed. Then I began to read that first chapter about a boy named Pip who meets the convict looking for vittles.I won't give anything away about the plot. I only want to say that this was the first book that I ever read that I had me truly absorbed. I remember a kid in my class who read ahead a few chapters and had us all in wonder as to what twists transpired. He just smiled and said, &quot;you won't believe how this thing turns out.&quot;After reading other Dickens books I realized that his greatest strengths was populating his books with amazing, odd, likeable, and despicable characters who found there way in and out of his stories.If you haven't read this book, do so."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I got the &quot;cover-to-cover&quot; book on tape for a long road trip, never having heard the story before. I loved every minute of it. The things that Dickens does with the English language is endlessly entertaining, the story he tells fascinating and fast-paced. The highly talented Martin Jarvis reads wonderfully, giving great characterization to the many people appearing in the story, allowing me to see them all as completely distinct.It's a shame that people feel such resentment when forced to read something. Most of the bad reviews this book gets are from young people who were forced to read it for a class. When taken at one's own leisure, and in one's own time, it is quite entertaining. I'm not sure that the teachers who assign the book are pointing out all the things that make the book great, such as Dickens's flair with the language, the point he's making about a society that places birth above worth, and his ability to make abstract arguments that enhance the story. I'd be interested in hearing from literature teachers to find out how they use the book in their classes.One of the best books ever written, this reading is one of the best investments of my time I've ever made."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I appreciate this edition for its introduction (which is interesting for literature buffs and beneficial for serious students/readers), for the end notes (which are definitely helpful in explaining Victorian allusions and other references for readers who have little or no background or experience with such), for the inclusion of the original ending (which provokes a variety of options for discussion and examination), for the discussion questions, and for the presentation (easy to read pages). My students find this edition less intimidating than some others; overall, this edition seems user-friendly rather than overwhelming (which is often the case with such a long story)."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great Expectations is one of Charles Dickens most famous books. Even with Dickens' extremely long r&eacute;sum&eacute; of books Great Expectations maybe the only one read by younger readers because the other are usually mature plots or have extreme length. But, Great Expectations is a \\"great\\" exception.Charles Dickens used a very eloquent vocabulary. His absolute mastery of English makes his book interesting yet difficult to read. Terminology has changed since he wrote the novel, and, in addition to the evolution the language, Dickens was British. This fact changed his wording from typical American English and helped the book be more in character. Dickens also exercises his talent for manipulating words and creating vivid word pictures like these sentences, \\"Mrs. Joe was a very clean housekeeper, but had an exquisite art of making her cleanliness more uncomfortable and unacceptable than dirt itself,\\" and \\"It was one of those March days when the sun shines hot and the wind blows cold: when it is summer in the light, and winter in the shade.\\" These brilliant word pictures make the book a bear to read when quickly read but also makes it brilliantly fascinating when soaked in and read slowly. In short Dickens has the entire language in his hands and works it masterfully into a brilliant weaving of plot.Dickens also knew how to capture his audience. He used a fantastic plot that wove in and out. Even though his plot was almost cheesy, he managed to pull it off without to much \\"cheese\\" suspected. Though I thought this book had too many climaxes, if you think about its original form - serial - then you understand that he had to keep his readers interested. Dickens keeps the plot \\"writhing\\" until the very end where he had a most expected and cheesy ending. The ending seemed rushed and scrambled together. Out of the whole book spanning thirty some years the last eleven are on the last five pages. The plot as a whole was very good. The plot moved the characters along and changed them to be what they are at the end. The characters grew as you read it not only in age but in emotion and focus.Dickens characters are amazing. He captures a lot of emotions and kinds of people in one book. He grasps a boy's changing thoughts until he grows to be a man. The innocent, childish fears of Pip are so easily grasped, and Pip's relations with Miss Havisham completely change him into a self-centered man trying to woo and unlovable woman. He also shows the starkness of humanity when exploited by its own race. Even some of the lesser characters still show the variety of human expression like Joe's nobleness and Wemmick's eccentricism. In all the characters were amazing.As a whole the book is a masterpiece and classic for all generations. Great Expectations will always be close to my heart."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"First of all, in reference to the reviewer who seemed to think the title was inapropos, all I can say is that I hope that they didn't read the book, for such a lack of understanding would be pathetic. I digress. I am here to dispel some myths. Since this book is often assigned in school, and perceived as \\"important,\\" as another reviewer noted, I think a lot of people shy away from it and assume it will be boring or difficult to understand. Dickens' novels, however, work on multiple level. There certainly is important social criticism and a web of subtly laced motifs within this novel, but on the surface, it's just a good read. I read it on a whim and ended up staying up all night to finish it. So, don't dispel this novel and turn to the many vapid works available to you. One piece of advice, read the real ending before the changed ending (though the changed one will appear first). I felt that the original one was far better, more relevant, and sadly invalidated by the changed ending thrust upon me first. Happy reading!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great expectation was a wonderful classic written by the author Charles dickens. The main character, Pip, grow up in the home of a blacksmith. With both of his parents dead, He lives with his older sister and her husband named Joe. Pip soon meets Miss Havisham and the beautiful Estella that live wish her Pip hoped that Miss Havisham intentions were to make his fortune, make him a gentleman and have Estella to wed. He was wrong, because the social class division leaves Pip a worker, and Estella was a lady.

Great expectation is an amazing book in many ways such as the themes, the Character and the writing Themes in this book are very important. They can easily relate to us today. The main point of the book is affection, loyalty and gratitude and friendship are more important than social class, wealth. The Character of Pip made me feel quit e sad. He had a very difficult life but he can improve him self and become a gentleman finally. There are many character of this book. That also made this book very interesting follow"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Probably one of the most memorable Dickens characters, Philip Pirrup is known to most readers as Pip, the 7-year-old boy whom his short-tempered sister raised by hand. Little Pip infers that he has sustained, from as early as his babyhood, a perpetual conflict with injustice. He has known, from the time when he can speak and discern his surrounding that his sister, in her fits of caprice and violent coercion, is unjust to him. It seems to poor Pip that all the endearments in life brushes by him or bypasses him altogether. Fate has ineluctably deprived him of the lightsome hours that make our childhood a time to be remembered like a happy dream through all our after life. The bright side of growing up with his sister's fits of spleen is Pip's friendship with his brother-in-law Joe, who not only has taken him into apprenticeship but sanctified the house Pip calls home that is otherwise sullied by his sister's temper.A chance but terrifying encounter with an escaped convict for whom he brings provisions pilfered from the kitchen cupboard changes the entire course Pip's life. But it is not until he meets the beautiful, cold-hearted and haughty Estella during a summon to a decaying Miss Havisham that he sets his mind to whittle away his coarseness and to become a gentleman, one on Estella's account. The sudden but timely generosity of a mysterious benefactor comes to assist his making of a gentleman and promises a handsome property. The prospect of great expectations not only immediately relieves him from his ordinary sphere of life and frees him from apprenticeship with Joe, but also concurs with his eagerness to abandon his humble origins.GREAT EXPECTATIONS thus follows Pip's new life under his fortune and depicts his education, new relationships, and development through adversity as he slowly dawns on the true nature of his great expectations. The new life does not come without a catch as he finds himself living in a state of chronic uneasiness respecting his perfidious behavior to Joe, whose interference in his life he now regards as disturbance. The more Pip basks in the favor, privilege, and conviviality that is concomitant of his fortune, the more his is convinced of a happier life derived from simplicity and fidelity that only Joe can offer. As he sidles closer to the truth about his benefactor's identity, a revelation for which he is not prepared struck him.GREAT EXPECTATIONS is a story of moral redemption with a prodigal son-like protagonist in the orphaned Pip. The tale is extremely straightforward but is woven with substantial issues he has to deal with. Eager to shred his humble roots, he promptly disavows family and friends at the prospect of a fortune. As the fortune loses its luster and eventually dissipates altogether, he confronts his own ingratitude and learns to love the man who both creates and destroys him, figuratively speaking. Dickens deftly validates Pip's redemption by showing that it produces good deeds as well as good works. This is especially worthy of merit because the novel is told in Pip's first person narrative. Mishandling of the narrative might render the whole tale unconvincing.The proof of Pip's redemption comes laden with good deeds rather than airy words: his clandestine acts of kindness in securing Herbert a partnership in business, and in securing Miss Havisham's respectable opinion of the long-suffering Matthew Pocket, and in his refusing to accept money from Miss Havisham, and most significantly in his love for the man whom has bequeathed him with the fortune."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This book was reccomended to me by my mom for me to expand my reading tastes. I was maybe a little hesitant, but I began reading it, and was immediately pulled in by the compelling, quirky characters and the mind boggling plot. Each new character is equally amusing, and their names seem to depict their nature. When I first saw Uncle Pumblechook's name, I was immediately able to guess what sort of a person he was, same with Mr. Wopsle, Mr. Wemmick, Mrs. Joe Gargery, and more. The humor is subtle, but once you get the joke you'll be howling.However, Dickens is certainly not an author who says little when there is an opportunity to say more; in a nutshell, his writing is quite flourid. Ten pages can be a whole lot to get through, not because it is boring, but because it is full of complex words, sentences, and paragraphs, that you'll need a little bit of rest. I felt sometimes like reading it was like an excercise seminar for my mind. But don't let these few words discourage you, it's a great read."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"...endless is the error of intimacy.Such is the story of &quot;Great Expectations.&quot; I have to say that Dickens totally floored me with this magical tale of love and pedestals. I don't even know what made me read it. I think I just found it in my mother's house amid throwaways in the attic. Oh no...this is NOT to be thrown away, this treasure of English literature. This is the reason why we read.Pip is an orphan with no prospects in sight. But one day, under the strangest of circumstances, he becomes the veritable ward of an unknown benefactor and hurtles toward the gentlemanly future of high living and culture. Along the way, he is placed in the almost daily charge of the bitter and rich shut-in Miss Havisham, guardian of the irresistable, yet bitchy Estella. Poor Pip spends a great deal of his days partaking in the education of a gentleman, doing the bidding of the witchy Havisham woman and pining after the girl who uses and abuses him. It sometimes seems like this high society training is a big freakin' mistake.Things heat up when he comes across the criminal Magwitch and doesn't turn him in to the authorities. From there on in the piece continues to fill the mind with limitless imagery. The writing style is a beaut and the characters continue to intrigue with every passing page, from the disgustingly prunish Miss Havisham to Pip's dim-witted, but thoroughly likeable father - a man he sadly comes to see as shameful as his education and training strengthens.This is a story of yearning and loss, guilt and foolish pride as one person after another gets a wish granted and regrets it or waits for a train that never comes in. Yet somehow the ending leaves behind a great feeling. This is among my favorite books ever."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I may be only a 6th grader, but you wouldn't believe how much I enjoyed this book. Charles Dickens having a poor childhood because of the little money his family earned, has written a miraculous book having to do with money. Charles Dickens makes his case for there being a potential for good and evil in everyone. I really enjoyed reading this book and if you are looking for a fabulous book to enjoy, I strongly reccomend you read this."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I love the cover of this edition. The painting seems almost perfect for Dickens novel.But on to the novel itself. \\"Great Expectations\\" was the first of Dickens' novels that I read and I had to read several more before I found another I liked anywhere near as much. It is a small work compared to \\"David Copperfield\\" and his other massive English comic novels. It is a much darker work, too with less of the comedic touch.Dickens published and/or edited several magazines and some of his novels were first written as serials to bolster flagging circulation, \\"Great Expectations\\" is one and it shows. The novel grabs you fast and has a story with many surprises and twists along the way. The one drawback to the earlier serializaztion is that the book probably has too many small climaxes and cliffhangersLike many of the other great novels of the 18th and 19th century a modern reader may well find it a little too full of long descriptive passages. I personally feel that it travels along fast enough that you won't notice.I feel a word or two may be necessary about coincidence in the novel, certainly some other reviewers here at Amazon have felt there was too much. The first thing that should be said is that Dickens readers would not have criticised the coincidence, at the time they had a much firmer belief in \\"fate\\" and would have felt that the coincidence showed how much of Pip's tale was fated to be. The other thing worth mentioning is that the coincidence is no less than one can find in quite a lot of modern television if you just explain the plot. We need to ask if the number of coincidences seems unnatural within the book and if the book works. My answer would be that this tale runs along at a fine pace, well written and well worth the read. The coincidence does not detract from the novel.I'd recommend this book to anyone who wants a good, classic read. As one of Dickens shorter works it is also a fine place to start."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"As a student, I had to read this book as a requirement for my junior year summer reading. Being the largest book of them all, I reluctantly started on this one. However, after giving it the twenty-five page test, I found the book terribly addictive. Had I had a more generous time budget, I would have finished the book in two to three days. As it was, it took me over a month. The storyline, with Pip intertwined in a weird emotional triangle with one Miss Havisham and Estella, has the reader wondering &quot;Who is on Pip's side?&quot; and &quot;What the heck is going on with this Estella babe?&quot; The emotions Pip felt, the things he went through, and just the thought of actually having to go through what he did brings tears to the eyes (even mine, which had been dry for years). By reading this book, I even became more in-tune to my emotions. This novel is an excellent piece of literature for any language buff (Dickens is a sheer master of the English language), and for anyone who loves a good tearjerker. Happy reading!!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great Expectations is one of the most absorbing novels I have ever read. It is also the best. The plot is complex and exciting, sometimes very funny and sometimes almost unbearably sad, with so many plot twists it is impossible to lose interest. The writing and descriptions are...well they're Dickens': always brilliant and powerful. And the characters in Great Expecations, Pip, Uncle Pumblechook, Miss Havisham, Mr. Jaggers, etc., are colorful and original, and complex and lively. Great Expectations has the suspense of any of today's thrillers (during the last fifty pages I could not put it down) and a wonderful message: that your social standing does not determine what kind of a person you are; aristocracy isn't all it's cracked up to be; what you really need in life are good friends and people that care about you. Great Expectations is a masterpiece of the first order. I cannot stress enough how much I enjoyed it. It is most assuredly a book I will keep reading again and again throughout my life."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"When reading this book in high school, I considered myself very fortunate that the copies we had contained the original ending. It was placed at the end, after the ending that was originally published. I much preferred the original ending from the momentI read it, and have since checked every copy I have come across to see if it is in them. Sadly, often it is not.The kindle edition does not contain the original ending. I did not see any reviews of this edition that mentioned it, so I thought I would post one for anyone else who finds that important, as I do."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"GREAT EXPECTATIONS is often the novel used in high schools to introduce students to Dickens. Due to it's length and fairly long and uneventful middle phase, I'm not sure it's the best text to introduce people to Dickens. Still, it is a pretty good story and contains some of the most memorable characters in Dickens' fiction.GREAT EXPECTATIONS is the story of Phillip Pirrip, otherwise known as Pip. Pip's parents die not long after he is born and he is raised &quot;by hand&quot; by his sister. His brother-in-law, Joe Gargery, is the town blacksmith and loves Pip. The two are best-of-friends. One night while looking at his parents' graves, Pip meets a convict and his life is forever changed by that meeting. As the novel progresses, Pip meets Miss Havisham (the wealthiest woman in town) and her beautiful ward, Estella. Pip immediately falls in love with Estella and is haunted by her all the days of his life. Eventually Pip is bond to Joe as his apprentice and sets to work in the blacksmith forge. Several years later, Pip's luck changes when he is informed by a lawyer from London, Mr. Jaggers, that he has become the recipient of &quot;great expectations&quot;. The book then follows Pip's life as he enters this new stage in life and as he develops and becomes a &quot;gentleman&quot;. Everything is brought full circle and just about everyone gets what they deserve by the time the novel ends.GREAT EXPECTATIONS isn't the easiest of books to read. What many writers can do in a sentence often takes Dickens two pages to tell. Also, the book is divided into three phases and the second phase is rather boring (except at the end) and really does nothing more than to fill in a few plot gaps and illustrate to us how much of a prig Pip becomes. Nevertheless, GREAT EXPECTATIONS is still a good story containing some very vivid characters: Pip, Estella, Joe, Miss Havisham, Magwitch, Jaggers, and Wemmick. The characters in GREAT EXPECTATIONS are as memorable as anyone in DAVID COPPERFIELD, OLIVER TWIST, or A CHRISTMAS CAROL. The first phase of the book is quite interesting and sets up everything that later occurs in the novel. The third part of the novel is full of excitement and contains Pip's repentance and reformation. Overall, it's a great book and even though it was written over a hundred years ago, it has a lot to say about the society in which we live today."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I first read this book when I was in eighth grade. Ever since then, I have been going back to it because even though I know how the events will eventually turn out, this book always retains the magic touch to entertain and keep one hoping that the main character Pip will live a happy life.Upon reading the first page, the reader is drawn into a world of mystery and suspense.

Will Pip remain the same kind-hearted young man he was when he was poor or will he change?Even though I have long found the &quot;answers&quot; (there are two different endings in the orginal) I am still amazed at how Dickens creates fascinating characters and fills his novels with mystery, suspense and romance."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"As an English teacher, I purchased the collection to use in my classroom. We had already started the novel when the cd's came in. Because the cd's were not marked according to chapter, it was difficult to find the starting point each time we used the cd's. I would have liked to have chapters to correspond with the tracks for easy listening. On the up side, it was easier for the kids to follow along once we did find the spot, and the animated voices brought the story to life."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I read this book in high school years ago and just recently read it for the second time. Dickens never disappoints."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This is yet another great story by Dickens. Throughout the book I kept thinking, I know what will happen. How obvious. What was obvious was how wrong I was each time. Follow young Pip from boyhood to manhood. See how he goes to become a gentleman (make his fortune in our terms) and what comes of it. This is a story about growing up and learning what is important in life. It is full of Dickens' excellent descriptions and characters and their relationships.If you like any Dickens story you will like this one as well. If you have never read Dickens, you should.For Kindle owners. I only saw two errors. Both words probably had accents on characters as missing characters appeared as question marks (?), so I am not positive what the words actually were (one was French) and to be honest, I never bothered to look them up. But those were the only two. The book contains a table of contents that works fine. I did not see page numbers on this version. Overall, no reason to pay for a copy, this was excellent."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Excellent copy. Clean. New. thank you. Suggestion to reader: look for a copy with BOTH endings!

Many of the free classic ebooks have poor formating or other problems but there are none here that I notice. I highly recommend this wonderful book andfor free you cant beat that price."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This is a book worth reading, and it's a shame my first experience with it was having it force-fed to me 22 years ago as a high school sophomore or junior. I only wish I could find the crappy, soulless joke of a book report I regurgitated from Cliff's Notes to please my teacher and get that all-important \\"A.\\" Suffice to say that if I found it I would not post it here.Having re-read the book, I now can say with certainty that Dickens is a brilliant writer and storyteller. His use of language is phenomenal, and his characters tell a deep emotional tale. I suspect it is the tale of Dickens' own childhood dilemma: an emotionally abandoned boy seeking greatness and knowing at some level that he was born for it---and that fate somehow picked him out for it.Pip is a multidimensional character, with hopes and charm and honesty and flaws. He is utterly sympathetic, as I'm sure little Charles Dickens once was himself.Pip, an abused and undefended boy, is picked out rather randomly by a near stranger (seemingly the idealized parent for whom every child secretly hopes) to become a gentleman---to rise above the meagre expectations for which his limited birth has chosen him. Even his closest childhood ally, Joe the blacksmith, does nothing (read that: nothing) to defend him against Joe's abusive wife, Pip's older sister. To Dickens' discredit, I felt that he over-defended Joe's weakness as a non-defender. But, by the same token, Dickens' rendering of Joe's all-too-realistic weakness is quite honest and common: after all, so few adults really do stick their necks out to defend the child. I am only left to suspect that in Dickens' own childhood none did either. I would guess that like Pip, Dickens was surrounded entirely by adults who were weak, sadistic, self-centered, or manipulative. My guess is that only his talent, hard word, and patience allowed him to rise above.My only real criticism of the book (and it's not a big one) comes near the end, when Pip tries to help Magwitch escape England and thus find safety. Granted, Dickens' treatment of this situation does assist the flow of the novel, and does allow him to show just how much Pip has grown to care for his benefactor, but it still left me shaking my head. (And I'm not spoiling the plot, because in the version I read the editor's footnotes spoil the plot anyway early on in the reading, as clearly the editor assumes that the reader knows the story beforehand. Then again, maybe the editor is spoiling the plot to give himself some power. I felt some of his footnotes, which are otherwise quite helpful for background, suggest that he was in an annoying sort of competition with Dickens to show his own greatness.)So although the plot device works for Dickens' purpose, it just didn't strike me as sufficiently realistic to keep my disbelief suspended. My reason: Magwitch is a hardy, intelligent, cunning world traveler, who suddenly, for no good enough reason, puts all his trust for escape from England (and thus his life) into the hands of a complete novice, Pip, who creates a foolhardy plan for escape that ends up getting Magwitch captured and sentenced to death.In reality, given what Dickens' shows us about Magwitch's character, here's what I think would have really happened had Magwitch heard Pip's plan:Magwitch: \\"Pip, thank you for creating a plan to rescue me, but I think I'll pass. I'll go off into the night on my own, and leave England the same way I came to it: on my own.\\"Magwitch would have traveled onward with less hurrah, more stealth, and far more privacy. And as the result he would have likely left England safe and sound, and continued to keep up his benefactor relationship with Pip.But that wouldn't have suited Dickens' purposes for the plot, so the more realistic ending was avoided.That said, the book was still great. I couldn't put it down. Kudos to Dickens! And to hell with my high school teacher for nearly ruining my regard for this great writer."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"the course of the year I try to read a few, \\"Important Novels\\" in order to get a fuller understanding of literature. Dicken's \\"Great Expectations\\" has been on my list for nearly a year. I completely dreaded reading what I thought would be a long and drawn out story about something I could careless about. Well, I was wrong.\\"Great Expectations\\" is now #1 on my all-time favorites list. While, admittedly, it took me roughly 150 pages to get any enjoyment out of the novel- once I was in- I was hooked. Pip's journey through life is a very refreshing look at how distorted we let our lives become by focusing on the unimportant. Dicken's ability to slowly alter Pip's views on life, without changing his essential character/morales (Ex. How Pip looks to help his friend in his business pursuits). Some have called \\"Great Expecations\\" his masterpiece... but in my opinion, it may be the \\"Masterpiece\\" of English Literature.I also wonder why this is required High School reading. While I loved this book at age 28, I think most 16 year-olds would find it unbearable. It seems like such a waist to ruin both the book and Dicken's name on minds that are not ready for such a reading task."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great Expectations is an exciting story dramatically done in this audio presentation."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Many people may find Charles Dicken's \\"Great Expectations,\\" dated, due to it's time period and its flowery 19th century language. True, the book is extremely wordy, and there are many words you'll be getting out a dictionary for reference, and yes it's very slow moving, but it's wonderful.The book focuses on a young boy, who becomes a young man, named Pip, raised by his over dominating sister, and a kind blacksmith, Joe Gargory. For awhile Pip has gratitude for living in the town, but, when he is spurned by the rich Estella and Miss Havisham, he wants to be something greater, someone richer. Being rich falls into his lap, but not without consequences. The book is about the follies of false vanities, of turning ones back on those who loved you, on trying to chase an uncatchable dream from those who don't reciprocate feelings, (in this case Pip's devotion to the haughty Estella) and for neglecting the good values of life for the ostentatious ones. Too often in todays society people (I'm guilty of this too) forget about what's truly important, family and good friends, and associate with only the proud and the, what they deem to be, the important. In the process they get too wrapped up by material wealth rather than the simple beauties around them.Aside from the basic story, the characterization in this novel is wonderful. Dicken's has really created some memorable characters, full of depth and complexity. The dull headed, but kind, Joe Gargory, and the haughty, but lonely, Estella, along with the mournful and bitter Miss Havisham will stay with the reader long after he/she finishes the book.Reading this book is a treat. Peruse it's pages and enjoy."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This novel by Charles Dickens is very well written, although very verbose. The novel has a good plot, but the writting is sometimes hard to follow. It took me one whole month to read the book and fully understand it.

Readers beware though, they must be ready to analyze everything in order to understand the novel"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I'm not a huge fan of Charles Dickens, but I have read a number of his books for reports and for reading. I've read Great Expectations for class and for personal reading. First of all the book is much easier to read then David Copperfield and others. The beginning is really riveting, and from there it keeps going. This book made me look to my personal life to see if I was finding happiness in the right things. I would read it at least once."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I loved this book. I have to admit in the beginning it was a bit of a chore to get &quot;into&quot; it but once I did I was just swept away. I especially loved the characters in it. I found myself putting the book down to tell my husband how mad I was at Pip. Joe, Estella, Abel Magwitch, Mr.Jaggers and of course Miss Haversham are unforgettable! A great book once you give it a fair chance. I am so glad that I stuck to it!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Before you reads this book, examine the title, and what great expectations do, so the events seem less shocking.This story is quite bittersweet and ironic, with a lot of interweaven and connected plots-not just of Pip's life. These plots make understanding this book, along with the rich dialect, quite difficult (where it lost the star) but amazing. ADVICE: read the Coles Notes (or other notes) chapter summaries.As I said, it's an extrodinary coming of age (rite of passage) which will not be as distant and farfetched as you might think. Comparable to your own rite of passage if you care to draw parallels with not only Pip, but all other characters too.I found that when you are forced to read this book and too much emphasis it placed on it, it loses it's 'interest', 'luster', and 'magic', (*wink* *wink* high school teachers!).Overall, I liked this book, but the language overwhelmed at times."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Dickens has a very vivid imagination. He express himself in a bizzare way in all of his works. In this novel, however, he out does himself. This book has a strange air about it.

Not only I didn't find it overly \\"wordy\\" or else, but extremely well written. But that's details. This novel is very intense and has unforgettable characters in it, honestly. It's very emotional and it's a trip. A trip that lasted two weeks for me, and that I will not soon forget, if ever. I wholeheartedly recommend this book for those of you who love literature, and even for those of you who are not literature-buffs, because the novel is very readable so don't be afraid of its length if you're not used to reading classics and such.Dickens, I realised, can be surprisingly funny at times, and this without ever losing his capacity to create strongly emotional moments and images. As there seems to be tons of reviews for this book already I'll stop mine here and just tell you that if you're interested in this book, go for it!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I never wanted to read this book, but a friend convinced me when he learned that I loved Pip on South Park (I found the little nerd funny). This was the best advice I'd ever taken. Reading this not only made me love Charles Dickens, but gave me a late start on loving reading in general.Granted, it's a difficult book to read. Dickens packs his book with descriptions and long sentences (yet every word is important and helps with understanding) and he's not easy to get through. Yet Dickens still, with all his flaws, remains a masterful storyteller. His characters aren't deep, but they're relatable and memorable. I love Pip, Estella, Miss Havisham, Joe, Herbert Pocket, Magwitch, and Aged P, and even though I've read this book a long time ago, I love them just as much now as I did then.It's a shame that people have to read this for school (I did so for my second time). It's a wonderful story that should be enjoyed by itself. If you haven't been made to read it, do so now. Push yourself through it and take your time (it took me a month to finish the book myself). You'll be glad you did. Assignments make you rush and over-analyze stories, and Dickens should never be read that way."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great Expectations was a remarkable book. I really enjoyed it. I didn't really have great expectations before I read it. It was about a little English boy named Pip. Pip is a poor kid who suddenly inherits a bunch of money and becomes rich. When he was poor he hated the way rich people treated poor people, but he finds himself doing treating poor people horribly when rich. He finally learns that everyone deserves to be treated with the same respect, even those less fortunate. This was an interesting book, but a tough book to understand, I would probably recommend it only for adults."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"When I was assigned to present a novel for my English class at Mercy High School, I thought of Great Expectations because I had read it five years ago and remembered that I had liked it. I thought that it was rather straight forward and didn't remember having difficulty reading it. When I read it for a second time, however, I realized that it was alot more complex. The reading was simple and getting through the book was easy, but Dickens made his story one worth contemplating by expressing the many sides life with his characters. What made the people he wrote about so wonderful was his ability to make them unique and entertaining, yet so believable as human beings coping with ordinary problems that the reader had no problem sympathizing with them."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Charles Dickens develops the characters, the plot, and the conflicts in Great Expectations spectacularly. The characters Dickens develops throughout the story are human and easy to connect with. Pip is the most real to life character, because he exhibits the most human-like qualities. Pip is a very personable character that makes the reader feel sorrow and happiness along with him. As Pip looks to better himself and become a gentleman, he comes to realize a very important life lesson; money cannot buy happiness. As Pip goes through the story, he allows the reader to see and feel exactly what he feels and sees.Estella is described as a beautiful young woman that captures Pip's heart. Estella has a very insensitive personality, and enjoys making Pip cry; something everyone has encountered in a person some time in his/her life.Herbert is a young man with many dreams and aspirations. Herbert becomes Pip's best friend, and Pip realizes that this young man works very hard for what he believes in. This is the kind of friend that will push a person where they would not normally go by themselves.Abel Magwitch is the convict that Pip encounters at the beginning of the story. Magwitch gives Pip a large amount of money to start his life as a gentleman. Magwitch is the kind of person that would give the clothes off of his back to anyone in need. Magwitch is also a very personable character because he is not all good or all evil. He exhibits both of these; he is a convict and he devotes his life's earnings to Pip.Charles Dickens develops an outstanding plot as the novel unfolds. There are many life lessons throughout the novel. Pip realizes that all of the money in the world cannot buy happiness. Pip also finds out that true love is not just the woman he cannot obtain, because love has to be much more. The plot has many twists and turns throughout. There is always something new happening to Pip. It is almost like a soap opera, because there are so many people and events interacting with each other during the novel. When the plot becomes a little thin, Dickens begins to create suspense for the next big event about to occur. Dickens chooses to develop the plot through the character's actions. Not once did Dickens explain what was happening in the story, he let the characters take over, and within a few pages all questions were answered.The novel has many conflicts that develop throughout the plot. Pip and Estella have a love-hate relationship going on. Pip loves Estella, but she could care less about him. Pip and Joe have a conflict, too. Pip wants to see much less of Joe now that he is a gentleman, but Joe just wants to see Pip, period. Pip thinks he is too good for Joe, even though he is still just the same human as he was before. Money changes people's outlook on life. Pip was once a benevolent, caring, young man, but once he fell into money, he changed dramatically in the way he acted towards others. These conflicts provide for some pretty interesting facets in the story. Charles Dickens develops the characters, the plot, and the conflicts excellently throughout the novel."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Truly one of the best books I've read. I could hardly put it down- I carried it everywhere I went. The novel has humor, suspense, and action. All of the characters are delightful and important to the story. And I like the revised ending better than the original."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This version of Charles Dickens' &quot;Great Expectations&quot; may make a fine read: but that really depends on your taste.

The plot is suspensful and you don't know what to expect. Also, the main characters are all very well developed. Like I said before it is really good, but if you don't like the classics don't bother because then it will be very boring."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I too am one of those high school kids that was forced to read the book freshman year. But unlike most of them I loved the book. It was with in my textbook which made it hard to read but other then that I could not put it down. The themes of the story are so inviting that you can't wait to read about what happens next. Dickens kept the tone inving and I kept going back to read more. I am now a junior and reading the book yet again for a history assignment and even though I know what is happening I still can't put it down.To all the freshman out there that have to read this book: Give it a chance. If you really hat eit and want to watch the movie go to the local library and get Disneys version of it. They did it exactly to the book and it is awesome. Its long but it does get rid of some of the unnecessary backgorund information. It comes in a series of 3 tapes.Other then that I love this book. I am not an avid reader but this one was awesome."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I didn't enjoy this book in high school back in 2000. I am re-reading this book again after 12 years.What an amazing gift we have inherited from Charles Dickens. I am enjoying revisiting the Victorian society again."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I was compelled to read Dickens (\\"A Tale of Two Cities,\\" in my case) in eighth grade and decided that I didn't like his writing. I managed to avoid Dickens and the Victorian novelists for several years, even as an English major. It wasn't until I was in my mid-20s that I read \\"Great Expectations,\\" and I'm glad that was so, because I was finally ready to appreciate Dickens. If you've ever picked up a Dickens novel and put it back down with relief, you might try again in a few years. If you do, \\"Great Expectations\\" is an excellent choice for meeting, or for encountering again, this amazing author.Like \\"David Copperfield,\\" this novel is written throughout in the first person, and follows the title character from childhood to adulthood. The first-person point of view gives the story vividness and impact, as we see everything that unfolds through Pip's eyes. The difference between the perspective of Pip the boy and Pip the adult, looking back and writing, colors the plot and creates suspense.There are many possible reasons to read this book (other than having it assigned to you, of course).You could read it for its astonishing characters -- Miss Havisham, defiantly moldering away and shut up in her never-used wedding finery; Magwitch, the escaped convict with a backstory you'd never expect; Joe Gargery, the blacksmith whose external roughness is matched only by his inner tenderness; Estella, as self-divided and self-destructive as she is beautiful. You could read it for its settings -- the spooky marshes, the busy streets of London, the gothic horrors of Satis House. You could read it for the plot -- the hidden connections, unexpected reversals, and ambiguous endings. You could read it for its social criticism -- the comprehensive view of working-class, middle-class, and upwardly-aspriring characters; the insight into what people will do to themselves and others for money; the unsparing look at ideas of gentility versus actual nobility of character. You could read it for its language -- the idiosyncratic dialects, the indelible scenes, the variety of prose rhythms Dickens employs.In the end, there are two main reasons to read this novel: pleasure and wisdom. \\"Great Expectations\\" is of its time without being dated, and can be enjoyed as a satisfying story. The themes Dickens addresses are timeless, and speak to the 21st century as forcefully as they spoke to the 19th.This isn't my all time favorite Dickens novel -- that would be \\"Bleak House,\\" followed by \\"David Copperfield\\" -- but it's one of his best. If you've never tried it, or if it's been a while since you did, give it a try. You may well become a Dickens addict."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"The DK series of classics are great!

I loved the book then, and I love the book now. It is easily one of the best books that Dickens' has written and well worth the read for everyone.

Charles Dickens is one of my favorite authors of all time next to Sparks, Crichton, Irving, Brewer, and Bradbury.

I've had my copy of the book on the shelf for years, but never got around to reading it. Unfortunately, I spend more time driving than reading. Michael Page did a fine job reading all the roles with distinctive voices for each character, male and female. The total listening time was about 20 hours. There were many tracks on each CD. So if your CD player only remembers which track was playing when you stopped it, then probably the most you will have to repeat when you re-start the disk would be about 40 seconds. The recording quality was good, but the duplication process less than perfect. There was 1 disk out of the 16 that had some \\"popping\\" sounds. I do not know if every copy of the audio book will have 1 disk with some static, but my copy did. It was a little annoying, but was not too bad.

He did sound British!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"\`Great Expectations' is one of my favourite Charles Dickens', second only to A Tale of Two Cities. Those who are not habituated to his style of writing may find it a bit difficult, but eventually that hurdle too would be overcome and the reader can enjoy the work of one of the finest authors of all time to its fullest.Phillip Pirrip was an orphan living with his dominating elder sister with no great ambition for the future, other than to become a blacksmith like his brother-in-law, Joe Gargery. But that was before he inherited a large amount of money from a mysterious benefactor. Now, leaving behind his shallow ambitions and old acquaintances, Pip follows his dream of becoming a \`gentleman'. Then maybe the beautiful but cold-hearted, Estella, the ward of the eccentric Miss Havisham, would accept his love for her. But will the unsolved mysteries of his past hinder him from fulfilling his \`Great Expectations'?Though Great Expectations first appeared in Dickens' weekly magazine, All the Year Round, more than a century back the story and the characters of the book still live on. Like all other books by Charles Dickens \`Great Expectations' too, does not just tell a story but also gives a message to its readers. Pip after coming into his inheritance starts ignoring his old friends because he feels that they are inferior to him, little realizing that they were the ones who loved and cared for him when he had no money. This situation is not something unique or something that can be related to only by the people of that time. This happens with almost every one of us. Once we achieve our goals we conveniently forget about those who helped us reach that goal. The way Dickens' has woven this message in his unforgettable story makes the book all the more beautiful. One thing I liked about this book is how all the seemingly unconnected characters seemed to fit together like the missing piece of a jigsaw puzzle by the end. What makes this book truly unforgettable is its characters. Every character of the book has an eccentric side to them. The only character that I think is \\"normal\\" is Pip and I did not find him interesting at all (I like eccentric characters. Am I weird?). Maybe that's how the author wanted it to be. Though the book has only a few female leads, they are the ones who steal the limelight. The eccentric Miss Havisham who sits in a room with a rotting wedding cake, wearing her wedding dress seemed more alluring to me than any of the other characters. It was her eccentricity that truly attracted me to her. If she had been some old, moody spinster, I would not have liked her half as much.Though I have repeated the point more than once, but \`Great Expectations' is truly an unforgettable book. Combined with prolific writing and memorable characters, this book is something which should be read at least once by all.Favourite Quotes:\\"Suffering has been stronger than all other teaching, and has taught me to understand what your heart used to be.

Having completed two of his greatest novels, Great Expectations and David Copperfield, I am a Dicken's fan for life! As an author, I realize how much I have missed. I love the old-english style of writing, the great history of Britain, and the downhome stories of boys, which seems to be Mr. Dicken's love.

Full of wisdom. Enjoyed it.I found lots of really great quotes. Some parts were hard to read/understand."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I enjoyed this edition, I am happy with the endnotes and the inclusion of the original ending."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Who knew that a book written almost 150 years ago could be so great? Not me. Granted, part of the reason I enjoyed this book so much was because I had expected it not to be (A Tale of Two Cities is still collecting dust on my bookshelf). The writing is flawless; characters, wonderfully varied; and plot, save an occasional feeling of contrivance at the almost uncanny character interconnections, spectacular.Pip, an orphan, lives with his 20 plus years older sister Georgiana \\"Mrs. Joe\\" Gargery, an unhappy woman who \\"rampages\\" on him and her blacksmith husband Joe, a simple, kind man. During an unexpected encounter with a shackled escaped convict, he is coerced into helping the man to prevent bodily injury to himself. It's not the last the boy will see of him. Pip is later asked to visit an eccentric woman (having been left at the altar by a scheming fianc&eacute;), where he encounters the beautiful but cold Estella, a future love interest, and several other central characters. Eventually an anonymous donor provides monetary help to Pip hoping that it will facilitate his becoming a gentleman and a scholar. But as his financial situation changes from meager but adequate to one of relative wealth, his personality transforms from kindhearted and unpretentious to inconsiderate and snobbish. Only through the adversity that follows his attempt to fulfill the expectations of his benefactor does Pip learn some important life lessons.Also good, Mr. Pip by Lloyd Jones (wish I hadn't read it before GE), An American Tragedy by Theodore Dreiser, and The Woman in White by Wilkie Collins."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"When I was a teenager, I loved Dickens. In later years, however, I abandoned Dickens for more overtly \\"intellectual\\" authors. The wonderful thing about great books is that they do not suffer from multiple readings. Returning to Great Expectations after maybe 20 years was a delight. It is simple, accessible, gently humorous and heartbreaking. Dickens' love of language is simply a joy to experience. The novel is beautiful, effusive and yet tinged with Pip's own discomfort of class and self. Dickens holds his own as the Master Storyteller of the 19th Century."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"All the standard Dickensian motifs are present in this book: deus ex machinae, factitious coincidences, longueurs, inventive names, an empathy towards children in a world of pompous adults, and sheer expository brilliance.Dickens paints a picture in your mind...you see the country, smell the air, and hear the voices of the characters as if they are actually speaking. This being Dickens, you must allow for some patness in the plot...grant that, and then you can enjoy the genius of his phrases, metaphors, characterizations, and recounting of the absurd.(Wopsle's go at Hamlet in London should have you laughing out loud.)This is an excellent book...a classic."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"A dark night. A pair of escaped convicts; a young boy named Pip who is seven years old. Pip helps the convict Magwitch with food and drink. Magwitch is sent in chains to banishment in distant Australia. Pip living at the forge of Joe Gargery and Pip's sister (Joe's wife) becomes an apprentice blacksmith. Pip also meets the enigmatic Miss Havisham who dresses in a yellow wedding dress lamenting her lost love. At Satis her estate he encounter Estella (star) who becomes the love of his life. Estella is as cold as an Eskimo and her heart as icy as Mt. Everest. He also meets Herbert Pocket who becomes his best friend.In part two we see Pip moving to London as he and Herbert become dissolute, fall into debt and live shallow lives.In part three secrets are revealed which make Pip a good man. We learn that it was the convict Magwitch who provided the funds needed to allow Pip to go to London and work for Mr. Jaggers the lawyer. We discover who is the father and who the mother of Estella. We learn what happened to Magwitch and all other mysteries are revealed. To give these secrets away in this review would ruin the pleasure of reading this classic novel.Great Expectations is a bildungsroman which is darker and more inttrospective that Dickens earlier David Copperfield of 1850. In it we see Pip grow from a selfish callow boy to a man who has suffered, helped others and been reunited with his lost love.Along the way we meet such immortal characters as Joe Gargery and his loving wife Biddy; the tragic Miss Haversham; the evil Orlick and Compeyson and the complex convict Magwith.The novel is cinematic in its ending as Magwitch returns to England to see how Pip is doing as a young man who has lived on the convicts benevolent financial bequest.Some critics believe that Estella is a representative of Dickens mistress Ellen Ternan. The novel is well plotted and moves quicker than many Dickens novels. This 1861 novel is narrated in the first person by Pip and was the last completed novel in the prolific Boz's illustrious career.Great Expectations should be read by everyone who loves English literature and Charles Dickens."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This is a wonderful story that Everyman's Library has place in great binding."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"If you have a student who either hates to read or struggles to read I would highly recommend this audio book. This unabridged version brings the Dicken's story to life. There are 16 CD's to listen to, but it is an enjoyable experience."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Dickens's Great Expectations is a novel of exceeding quality with, perhaps, only a few minor flaws that fail to significantly detract from the overall greatness of the work. Were I able to, I would give the book four and a half stars, rather than the four I've assigned it. As other reviewers have already amply commented on the book's numerous merits, I should like only to point out , what I thought to be, its foremost shortcoming. Although intentional by Dickens, I found my extreme dislike of Pip for much of the book to be a nuisance, chiefly because, as narrator, Pip set the tone of the narrative. It can be difficult not to equate the loathing of the narrator with the book itself. Luckily enough this was not a particularly prominent failing, and did not heavily tax me. Besides this, I found the book to be splendid, particularly during the bits concerning Joe and Mr. Wemmick, who were, at times, heartwarming and emotionally evocative to an extreme degree. In short, Great Expectations is one of Dickens's greats, with only minor, easily overlooked flaws."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"It is impossible to exaggerate the satisfaction this book gives to its reader and the power of its deep human sympathy. If you were to read only ten books in your lifetime, Charles Dickens' GREAT EXPECTATIONS should be one of them.If you were to listen to just one audiobook in your life, Frank Muller's narration of Great Expectations should be it. One of the most complimentary things that can be said of such a performance is that it leaves you feeling that the work can be read only in that way. Muller accomplishes this, with the curious and endearing twist that Pip's own narration comes with an American accent, while all others speak in the unforgettable idiom of their place among the English classes and subclasses. Muller on Dickens is a triumph that even Dickens would have applauded.Now, for the book. The personae will stay with you forever. Pip himself. The deeply generous Joe Gargery. The immortally beautiful Estella, her heart in the end made soft through suffering. Miss Havisham, too terrible to believed but in the end redeemed from her lake of bitterness, if her cry, 'What have I done?!' is to be taken innocently. Wemmick and the Aged P, then - belatedly, Miss Skiffens the gloved. Herbert, then Herbert and Clara.Jaggers, about whom one is left to ponder, 'Who *is* this man?'Dickens and Muller are at their best with scoundrels. Expectations provides them no shortage of villains upon whom to practice. Pumblechook. Bentley Drummle. Old Orlick. Compeyson, about whom the best thing said is that he has drowned.Dickens' keen eye for the glory and the pathetic depths of humanity is almost unparalleled in English literature, with apologies to his critics. He knows that there are Gargeries and Biddies and Herberts. He understands this without for a moment denying the hell in human hearts that is comprised by the likes of Pumblechook with his false respectability and Orlick with his violent, drooling hatreds.He has comprehended that heaven - if he believed there is such a place - is likely populated by people surnamed Havisham, Jaggers, and Magwitch, who perhaps dance the more vigorously for having been much forgiven.Yet writing *about* Dickens and his worlds takes time that could be spend on reading Dickens and of his worlds.For that you'll need to pick up Great Expectations."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Michael Page gives a wonderful performance that brings \\"Great Expectations\\" to life.

The reputation of the book and the author speak for themselves. I was overwhelmed with the quality of Dickens' writing, the intricate nuances of the plot and the many surprise twists.

Few authors have exhibited and illustrated the breadth and depth of story telling inherent and extant in a Dicken's novel.

I wish I had read it a long time ago. The Kindle version is great, though. Even though I am a trainer of English teachers, I found many vocabulary words that were unfamiliar. A right click gives an instant dictionary, and I had to use that feature more than I liked, along with a big font.The characters are amazingly well described, even as they develop chronologically, and although some aspects of the story are predictable (i.e Joseph the blacksmith and Biddy's romance) some are completly unanticipated and surprising.I like the ending in this version- it leaves hopeful possibilities!For free, this is the best bargain I ever purchased- hours of joy- so thank you Amazon..."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I read this book as a freelance. I really enjoyed this book, especially because it isn't cliche. The events that were portrayed in this book were events that a reader would not typically expect.

However, after a couple chapters, I became adapted to the use of language and sentence structure that it became easier to read and comprehend."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Of course, this is a wonderful book, but it is brought to life by the BBC audiobook. I don't know the reader/actor's name, but he is a master at providing individual, dynamic voices for every character - voices with personalities that match the character, as well. It added so much to the enjoyment when compared to other audiobooks read by lesser actors.

I read every page searching for why people loved this book! After reading the last page, I put the book down and felt disappointment that I still hadn't alighted on it. I realized Pip's selfishness once the wealth settled on him, and realized his turn-a-bout after losing everything to his name.

It taught some morals and keep me as a reader on the edge of my seat to see how Pip will finally end his most adventerous days."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"&quot;Great Expectaitons&quot; deserves to be called great. While not as emotionally satisfying as the earlier &quot;David Coppefield,&quot; it is nevertheless tighter, more compact, and displays a greater maturity and discipline of writing style on Dickens' part. Those who feel 'Copperfield' has all the characters, take note of the ensemble here-- Pip, Joe Gargery, Biddy, Mr. Jaggers, Uncle Pumblechook, Abel Magwitch, Estella, and the novel's haunting, living spectral figure, Miss Havisham. The intertwining of these lives, the playing out of these destinies, combined with its memorably Gothic beginning and unsettling ambiguous ending make &quot;Great Expectations&quot; a pleasure to read for both its narrative power and literary craftsmanship. Considered by many to be Dickens' &quot;best rounded&quot; story, I concur by offering this example. Having finished the novel, I craved a viewing of David Lean's brilliant 1947 film. I ended up by mistake with the Ethan Hawke Gwyneth Paltrow 1998 remake. I decided to give it a try, and was so enraptured by the look of the film and its grasp of the material I stayed with it. Not as satisfying as Lean's film, to be sure, but it works.

In classical Dickens style, Chuck makes a good social commentary or stirs some good emotions, yet does it way too slowly. The plot speeds and dies down, goes somewhere sometimes and goes nowhere even faster more often, and brings up characters who have no real purpose. Dickens is accused of being &quot;wordy,&quot; and I see why: British authors were often paid by the word and length of their novels and short stories. No wonder so-called classics like &quot;Tale of Two Cities&quot; and &quot;Great Expectations&quot; is heaped in a drudgery of fluff."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I had to do a report on Great Expectations, and this audio cassette helped me out so much.

It lacks some of the comic energy of his earlier works, but makes up for it with a compelling story, characters, and haunting images: the convict on the moor, the decaying wedding cake, the frigid Estella, honest Joe. This is painful, thoughtful material. See if you can find an edition that contains both the original ending and the rewritten, happier one. Both are wonderful."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"Great Expectations is a magnificent metaphor of humanity vs. life. It is the story of what each of us would probably do if placed in the situations Pip deals with. There are love, friendship, and warmth, which are nearly destroyed by obsession, discontent, and the desire to keep up appearances during the course of this powerful novel. These seemingly necessary emotions and acts of something near betrayal are finally exposed as cheap and worthless when the hero's true benefactor is known in the end. Pip, the main character, is something like all of us, and the people he encounters are very likely to be similar to those we encouter in our own lives."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I found that this novel was quite wonderful, really.

Read it. These is a classic and my favorite Dicken's novel. Fall in love with and his often misguided heart."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"It's ridiculous to review Dickens, who is as secure in the Western canon as Shakespeare. Nonetheless, I'll make two points about \\"Great Expectations\\", which is the first Dickens novel I've read since my adolescence. (Kennedy was President, alas.)First, I'll say that the characters in this book are affecting exaggerations and not quite real. For example, Joe Gargery, the blacksmith, is touching in his decency and saintly in his generosity. But Dickens gives him no rough emotional edges, and so he never rises beyond rustic sentimentality. Likewise, Hebert Pocket, Pip's friend, is a lovely young man but exists in friendship with out making any demands. And, there is the resolute and controlling Mrs. Havisham and her pathetic martyrdom. Yes, she was hurt by a man. But, it's hard to imagine a person living in the filth and disorder of her mansion, unless she is crazed, like a modern street person. To sum this up, I'd say that his characters are not really persuasive, even though they resonate emotionally.Second, I was surprised by the near total lack of visual effects in the writing. Early on, there's a moment of visual writing when young Pip is in the cemetery. But thereafter, this element is all but lacking in the book. Even after several re-readings, for example, I could never quite see Magwitch tumble into the river.Regardless, I enjoyed the read and did not find it discursive or too long. Go for it!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I liked this book even though sometimes I couldn't understand it. Charles Dickens used a lot of words he didn't need to, and he used a lot of big words that needed to be looked up. There was a lot of parts that I did not understand. Otherwise it was a pretty good story when I knew what was going on. I would recommend this book to other people because you learn about the lifestyles back then."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This novel was pretty good. I liked how everyone's lives in it were somehow connected. I also liked how Pip matures and learns the big lessons of life.One thing I didn't really like about it was that it was hard to understand. The English dialect was hard to follow, all the different names were hard to sort out, and there were manyold-time-ish and confusing words. But other than the confusion, the story line was great and Dickens wrote it really well and brought everything and everyone in the book together nicely. All of the characters were fun to read about and Dickens made them seem interesting and some very weird. I would recommend this book to anyone because it seems like anyone could connect with the characters in this book."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"This book seems interesting as you would expect from Dickens, but I must admit that i found it boring. I only got past the first chapter, and found my self asleep. I think that the plot is a good structure that could be updated very well. If you can get past the boring language you will definitely enjoy it. If you went in with 'great expectations',then i doubt that you will come out with great pleasure. if you are put off by this review, hten check out the 1930's version starring the late Alec Guiness- it's absolutely brilliant!"},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I was assigned to read this book for my English class and I have never read a more stupendously boring book.It's almost 500 pages long and has a story that could be told in half that.A poor, young orphan has aspirations to one day be a respectable gentleman.Big deal.

We had &quot;Great Expectations&quot; before the matinee last week. The matinee was &quot;Smoky the Cowhorse.&quot; It was Martian Thanksgiving, so &quot;Awful (great (yeah right!)) Expectations&quot; was a good choice, because it is so freakin' long, and low in cholesterol. I am on a strictly bad classics diet. The Martian Major Leagues starts today, so I grilled a warthog.One of the reasons that I found this book (in terms of literature, not food) so disturbing is because the Martian term for a hemmohroid is a pip. In terms of food, it could have used a bit more seasoning, like a trip to Denmark. Of course, they didn't actually go to Denmark. If instead of being named &quot;Magwitch&quot; the convict had been called Bozo the Clown, and gave Pip balloon animals instead of money, I would have enjoyed the book much more.But, the thing that ticked me off the most (and Auntie, too!) was the way that Dickens never ended his sentences: instead, he just ran them on and on and on and on and punctuated them only with commas and semicolons, as if to say, &quot;this is my book, feel free to fall asleep; or, you could eat it&quot;: that reminds me of a very funny story about a man named &quot;Kitty&quot;...WHACK!(Auntie just hit me over my other head with a frying pan).

It's like a really boring nightmare! I mean, the parts that take place at Satis House are mildly interesting, but no part of it seems to be building up to anything. The story moves so slowly that at times you'd swear it wasn't moving at all, and, to be sure, at times, it isn't! It's just sitting there in its stupid rocking chair knitting and petting its cat by the fire, which isn't even burning!

White's influences span the ages, and don't skip Victorian, if that's what you're into, which you obviously are, or why would you be here?Don't get me wrong. I like Victorian literature. A Christmas Carol is a very good story, as is Dracula, and Frankenstein, and most of Poe's works. It's just this particular book that I don't like...and anything by Jane Austen.In conclusion, buy Hellstone. You'll be happy you did."},{"Title":"Great Expectations","review":"I have been a great reader my entire life, having read and enjoyed many classics as well as the modern books of today, but never in my life have I had such a difficult time getting through a book. I usually fly through novels within a few days, but getting through this one is likened to going through a maze in the dark. I give it two stars because I do think the plot was interesting, but the execution was abominably horrible. I actually had to have a dictionary next to me in order to understand all the weird words Dickens used, words such as 'peppercorny' and 'farinaceous.' Now, I usually pride myself on having quite an excellent English vocabulary, but I felt utterly lost when trying to read this book. Some of the dialogue was completely unfathomable and pointless, and about a quarter of the time I did not have a clue as to what he were talking about. Many of the characters were annoying, Mr. Pumblechook for example. I cringed during the chapter when he saw Pip, after Pip had become a gentleman, and the stupid man kept saying \\"May I? May I?\\" Ugh. There was so much this book could have done with out; the endless pointless descriptions, the useless minor characters, and the stupidity of some of them was unbearable. What I mean by that is Miss Havisham's voluntary reclusive existence; I mean, how can somebody live like that without going completely insane, just sitting in the dark day after day, wearing the same clothes, and throwing her life away for a man who was only after her money? Stupid and lame that was, if mildly noble (her behavior). I cannot understand why Dickens is so praised as a writer. His plot may be good in this book, but it is terribly written. I have made two attempts in my life to read this book. The first time, I got about halfway through and had to stop because it was about as enjoyable as plucking my eyebrows. A few years later, the second attempt got me to about the 42nd chapter, but again, my interest fizzled out. I do not think I will ever finish this book, and would only advise reading it if you have trouble sleeping, because it will knock you out fast. As a final note, I could not get through Oliver Twist either.

We had &quot;Great Expectations&quot; before the matinee last week. The matinee was &quot;Smoky the Cowhorse.&quot; It was Martian Thanksgiving, so &quot;Awful (great (yeah right!)) Expectations&quot; was a good choice, because it is so freakin' long, and low in cholesterol. I am on a strictly bad classics diet. The Martian Major Leagues starts today, so I grilled a warthog.One of the reasons that I found this book (in terms of literature, not food) so disturbing is because the Martian term for a hemmohroid is a pip. In terms of food, it could have used a bit more seasoning, like a trip to Denmark. Of course, they didn't actually go to Denmark. If instead of being named &quot;Magwitch&quot; the convict had been called Bozo the Clown, and gave Pip balloon animals instead of money, I would have enjoyed the book much more.But, the thing that ticked me off the most (and Auntie, too!) was the way that Dickens never ended his sentences: instead, he just ran them on and on and on and on and punctuated them only with commas and semicolons, as if to say, &quot;this is my book, feel free to fall asleep; or, you could eat it&quot;: that reminds me of a very funny story about a man named &quot;Kitty&quot;...WHACK!(Auntie just hit me over my other head with a frying pan).

Many books have a strong structure and basis where you want to know what will happen next, which keeps you reading on. This story has no meaning and Charles Dickens is going no where with this. Not to mention the characters are just plaing weird. Where in the world did Dickens get a bizarre lady like Miss Havisham, who is practically ill in the head? I would never recommend this book because it was boring, time consuming, and I can rarely consentrate on what I was reading. I'm glad I got over reading this.

I'd like to see all copies burned. Okay, not really. That's a little extreme. But, at least take this garbage out of school curriculums. Its' making us stupid, making us believe Pip's world is what the world really is. Pip if a fool that got dumped too many times and where's the sex. Was Dickens scared of it.

I had to read this book for my 9th grade honors English class. It was too long and boring. I see were Dickens was trying to go with the suspense, but it just made the book monotonous and boring. The uncanny coincidences just did not seem real. It's ok to use a coincidence as a tool of suspense, but this was just overkill. Every chapter was boring. I got tired pretty quickly of pip wishing he were with Estella for the whole book. Also, the book seemed to stray away from the main point for chapters at a time. Who cares about Wemmick's stupid plays? This could all be summed up in a couple of page short story. In conclusion, this is another swing and a miss for Dickens. STAY FAR AWAY FROM THIS BOOK!

Every topic was explained with clarity, and, yet it did not seem too slow or dull. The code samples included line-by-line explanations. If I got it just by looking at the sample, I could move on. Otherwise, the explanations were there to illuminate the sample for me. The review and exercises at the end of each chapter follow the collegiate textbook formula. Why is it a formula?

DEITEL continues it's great reputation for consistently publishing exceptional learning tools. Not only is XML syntax explained but the CD comes with learning tools to integrate BIZTALK/SOAP, XBRL, WML, VoiceXML, JavaServer Pages, SAX, WAI, and more!

I had already purchased two in the past that lacked real-life programming examples and seemed to be a regurgitation of formal XML specification. But then I did a search on Amazon.com and found this book. Just by knowing the author, I knew it was going to be a great book. I've used Deitel's \\"C: How to Program\\" as a classroom textbook and \\"Internet and World Wide Web: How to Program\\" as a professional reference.I can't say enough about the book. Numerous professional quality applications and examples; programming tips; concise, well-written prose; exercises at the end of each chapter. The authors are great teachers, not just great programmers dumping their vast technical knowledge into a book. The only thing I wished they'd done was to broaden the discussion on XML Entities. I found myself referring to another text to get a handle on their use (but, maybe that's just me!). However, I was able to apply other examples and bits of applications write out the book and retrofit into a Java/XML program I was developing at work."},{"Title":"Xml How To Program","review":"I read some of the other reviewer's comments on the book and I agree with some and disagree with others. In comparison to other popular XML books it's not perfect but it's solid. If you are like me, a beginning XML programmer then you need to learn XML hands on and the book gives just that. Giving you examples and problems to apply what you just read is the best way to learn and thats what this book does. I read the \\"XML by Example\\" by Marchal and although that was a solid book also, it doesnt give you the material or examples for YOU to practice. Marchal doesnt offer the code samples for download either. One reviewer said that in order to complete this book's self review exercises you have to use outside sources. This is true but think about it...what better way to learn than by being challenged?I also read some of Erik T. Wray's (O'reilly series) XML book. That book is the better of all 3 books in my opinion but again it doesnt offer you that hands on material that I need. Love or hate the Deitel's books, the bottom line is that until these other authors challenge the enthusiast on whatever topic they are writing about people will always turn to these books. Yes the line by line styles are annoying but you know exactly what functions, (tags in this case) the author is referencing. Theory is great but the only way you will truly know any language you learn is by doing it!

Some people mention their credentials (like having a degree, etc, etc) like this somehow demonstrates that their review is less biased or more credible somehow. Yes, I do have a degree in computer science and I've been programming for DECADES. Does this mean anything? Not really, but read on...This book costs $72.00. There aren't a lot of pages in it, when you consider the price. However, the pages are very glossy and very bright. This is some very high-quality paper. Is that worth the extra cost? Maybe not.This is clearly a book that's situated for a beginner. You don't really get into the good stuff until Chapter 5, presuming you're fairly comfortable with HTML. Some other reviewers clearly took this to heart and quit the book early. It's not THAT bad. Once you're out of the history and background and review, it gets cooking, and there are about 27 chapters.Everything about the book's presentation screams quality. Unfortunately, this is reflected in the price. This is the first XML book I've gotten, so I can't say how little or how much it covers, but I didn't feel &quot;ripped off&quot;. The end of chapter sections are quite extensive; this would make the perfect textbook for an XML class that presumes no prior knowledge of HTML."},{"Title":"Xml How To Program","review":"I like the way Deitel teaches. I always got much help from C, C++ and java from Deitels's How to Program series. But this one is not satifactoty. Even though this book's title is xml, contents about xml technoligies are not dealt with sufficiently. Some chapters contain the introduction to asp,cgi,perl and java. The introduction to those technologies are easy to get on internet and in other books. The authors should deal with core xml technologies.The Deitel's series are of college-text- book-sytle.I guess xml is not for college course style. If you are new to xml from non programming experience or the other programming lanuguage. I recommend the XML in a nutshell by Rusy Harold."},{"Title":"Xml How To Program","review":"I much enjoyed this book as the presentation of complex topics is made very clear. I feel that this book helped me to understand several topics that I never fully understood before (for instance XLink).Generally the approach in this book is to give a clear and concise coverage of each important topics. This is the best approach to learn but reader should be aware that the coverage is not exhaustive enough for the book to serve as reference. In fact I would have prefered that the author added complete reference on several topics (XML DOM, XPath, XSLT, XSLFO) instead of the 'bonus programming chapter'.The book is catered for programmers. As a result the table of content will satisfy programmers (unlike many beginning XML books it gives ample coverage of XML APIs) but examples are sometimes non-trivial and written in high-level programming languages. Although generally, it must be said that effort has been made to use various programming languages (i.e. Perl, Java, ASP, etc) so that everybody should find some useful examples.I would have prefered additional coverage of XML services, SOAP, etc. Also, I found that several chapters (Programming java, programming Perl, etc.), while not useless, were clearly off topic and added to fill-in pages. Only other criticism is that the book is really quite expensive. However, it is one of the best book to LEARN xml (even though you may require additional reference to use it).One last thing: do not buy the CD ROM training kit of the book. The CD ROM included is very disappointing.Edit: I wrote this review a while back. Since then, I revisited the book and I must say that it does appear dated. In particular the coverage of schema (an important topic) fails to suitably cover the W3C Schema recommendation and focusses mostly on Microsoft's version of schema which are now hardly used. For this reason, I would recommend another book instead (for instance, Beginning XML from Wrox) until the publisher comes with an updated edition."},{"Title":"Xml How To Program","review":"This book is a big waste of money. Besides being very expensive, most of the book covers other subjects other than XML, with little relevance to XML. Although there is some useful information on using XML with Java, there is way too much information on the Microsoft implementation of XML, (when the book actually gets around to mentioning XML) and the standardized W3 version of XML seems to be included as an afterthought. The reviewers who gave this book such a high rating probably didn't read the book very well, or are hired by the publisher. A much better book is the Liz Castro Quickstart guide to XML (for a fourth of the price of the Deitel!), although it is centered around the W3's standard for XML, and doesn't mention Microsoft's implementation. Castro text, however, is more suited to learning from the ground up. The Deitel text is a disaster and I wish that I had just kept my money."},{"Title":"Xml How To Program","review":"I've been programming for a few years and have a computer science degree.I'd heard all the hype around XML and XML related technologies, and while looking for a book on the subject, stumbled upon the XML Training course.At the time there were no reviews for it so I took a chance.It seemed to good to be true. All of the XML stuff was included, plus lots of stuff I don't need, like the first few chapters which cover HTML (this should have warned me) plus it includes a short primer on Java and some other stuff as well.Well, to make a long story short, I stopped reading it in the middle.It just seems to me that the authors just wanted to make a fast buck by getting out an XML book that tries to cover everything. The book isn't even all written by the authors !! In the acknowledgements, they list about 10 different people who contributed to various chapters!The book reads like a dry reference manual (that's not even %100 complete) with a lot of examples thrown in.The coverage is shallow and doesn't go into any reasoning or teach you how to USE XML technologies, it only teaches you how to WRITE for XML technologies.The examples themselves are at the same level of &quot;hello world&quot; stuff.I guess I'm &quot;spoiled&quot; from reading books like the O'Reilly series (most of them) or Thinking in Java.I've read about 30 programming books over the past few years, and this one is the worst.I'm sure you can learn more from better resources available freely on the web."},{"Title":"Xml How To Program","review":"I bought this text thinking it would compliment the E-business and E-commerce How to Program text (it was recommended that way).

But within the covers are sometimes rambling discussions about a particular topic that leave you still wondering what you were supposed to learn, while other sections get cut short just when things are getting interesting.My biggest beef: You won't be able to complete some of the exercises without the use of outside resources. Of course, multiple sources are great for any project, but you should certainly be able to answer a book's exercises with just that book! (Specifically, one exercise was within the XSLT chapter, and deals with a number-type element.)When I was assigned to write an essay on a topic, XML Topic Maps, I first consulted the book. Only a couple of paragraphs as I recall. RDF, an up-and-coming XML technology, gets nary a page.Mind you, there is a bit of good in the book, mainly with the introductory material. It's a bit Java-centric, but that's to be expected, and there is a decent Java primer in the back of the book. I also appreciate the code samples on both the CD-ROM and Deitel's Web site.I wanted to like the book, but I found it useless for most of the projects I was working on.

The garrison was overrun and killed by troops under command of Nathan Bedford Forrest, one of the founders of the first KKK. Add the fact that many of the dead were black and the politically correct liberal left school of history is in full cry. The worst book on the subject is Richard L. Fuchs \\"An Unerring Fire: The massacre at Fort Pillow\\". The only thing missing in that book is Forrest in formal Klan robes riding about extorting his lynch mob of an army to kill all blacks.Mr. Ward avoids these mistakes and produces what is the most evenhanded book we are likely to see. The Union Army in west Tennessee was a series of second or third-rate units with sever leadership problems. Black marketing, speculation in cotton, a hostile population and a habit of \\"foraging\\" contributed to the poor condition of these units. Into this mix came two distinct sets of regiments raised in the area; the United Stated Colored Troops comprised of freed slaves and the white \\"loyalist\\", many of whom had deserted from the Confederate Army. Being in the USCT or a Tennessee Union regiment didn't change racial attitudes, dividing local commands even more. The isolated forts were to be abandoned but the profit in cotton was to attractive for Memphis to act quickly.Into this mix rode General Nathan Bedford Forrest and his very able command. Forrest had made Memphis his home before the war and many of his men were from the area. The book covers this 1864 raid in detail giving us a good understanding of the conditions Forrest's men face and the stories of \\"foraging\\" they had heard. Fort Pillow was targeted, invested, refused to surrender, overrun and a massacre occurred. Forrest lost control of his men but was never charged with any crime. It was impossible to build a case against the man that would hold up even in a Reconstruction Court.Having said all of this, why don't I like the book? \\"Damned with faint praise\\"; sums up the author's treatment of Forrest. In any question on where he was or what he was doing, the glass is always half empty. He should have been stopping the massacre not checking the gunboats on the river. However, these boats could have slaughtered his command if they had fought. \\"The Wizard\\" is used so often, in referring to Forrest, that it becomes a snide remark. Likewise, his Christian name was not \\"Nathan Bedford Forrest, slave trader\\".The stories from the saviors of the massacre are told in stunning detail, as is the fate of the Union POWs, both white and black. This section of the book clearly illustrates how the \\"hard hand of war\\" was being applied. This is not a pleasant book to read but it is the best coverage of the subject I've found."},{"Title":"River Run Red: The Fort Pillow Massacre in the American Civil War","review":"Few Civil War figures inspire as much debate and discussion as Nathan Bedford Forrest. The so-called \\"Wizard of the Saddle\\" has been anointed America's greatest natural military genius, and has been the subject of numerous books highlighting both his military achievements and his unsavory business dealings before and after the war.The April 12, 1864, battle of Fort Pillow, Tennessee, and the events that followed it, form the crux of the debate over Forrest's place in our national consciousness. Was Fort Pillow one of the most celebrated of Forrest's victories, or was it an out-and-out massacre of blacks and whites that highlighted the war's essential racial component?In River Run Red, author and screenwriter Andrew Ward demonstrates conclusively the latter, in what should be the final word on this topic for some time to come.The seasoned Civil War reader should not be put off by the author's lack of formal academic qualifications. Ward brings a newspaper correspondent's eye for detail and turn of phrase to this familiar story. He makes excellent use of archival and published primary sources; of particular note is his use of the pension questionnaires of many of the Fort Pillow survivors.One of the unique and valuable features of this book is the author's ability to flesh out the lives and backgrounds of the battle's various participants, both black and white, giving the reader a clear and detailed understanding of the war in western Tennessee.This was a \\"civil war\\" in the truest sense, with Tennesseans, many from communities within a day's ride of the fort, on both sides in the resulting battle. In addition to Confederate cavalrymen, there were white Union officers of black artillery units, all-white Union forces, escaped slaves, and white merchants at Fort Pillow. All of these groups bring unique perspectives to the battle, and Ward tells their stories.From the Union perspective, Fort Pillow was a blunder of the first magnitude. The fort's garrison was poorly supported and supplied, and Ward places the blame squarely on the shoulders of the district commander, Maj. Gen. Stephen A. Hurlbut.After a lengthy approach march during which he captured or defeated other Union forces, Forrest easily surrounded Fort Pillow in the predawn darkness of April 12, and continued the battle long after all resistance had ceased.The most compelling and disturbing portion of the narrative documents in excruciating detail the depredations of Forrest's command. Any objective reader will be convinced beyond doubt that a deliberate atrocity took place.After the battle, Forrest's command returned to Mississippi, taking with it a column of prisoners. Some 139 white soldiers made their way to Andersonville, where 107, or 77 percent, died in captivity. Many of those who died at Andersonville were residents of west Tennessee and veterans of the Mexican War, heightening the heartbreak of this story.Forrest retained 62 black Union soldiers as prisoners, and for the most part they fared better: even though most of them were wounded, three-quarters escaped and returned to their regiments.News of the massacre reverberated through the North, causing Gen. Ulysses S. Grant, by this time general in chief of Union armies, to relieve Hurlbut, no small feat given the general's Republican Party connections.West Tennessee Unionists were understandably afraid for their lives, and the massacre caused a groundswell of popular opinion, further encouraged by the Northern press. Senator Benjamin F. Wade's Joint Committee on the Conduct of the War took up the case, holding hearings in Memphis almost as soon as the smoke cleared.Wade's findings encouraged Radical Republicans to continue to pressure Abraham Lincoln to remove all restraints on the Union war effort. Events in Virginia obscured those at Fort Pillow, however, as Grant's Overland Campaign dominated newspaper coverage and government attention for the next several months.The book's final chapter, \\"Deliver Me From Bloodguiltiness,\\" details the rest of Forrest's life. The Wizard was famously active, and unsuccessful, in politics, and had a key role in the founding of the Ku Klux Klan. Enigmatic to the last, late in life he apparently found religion, and died a penitent man in October 1877.River Run Red is a well-researched, engaging and thoughtful book on an oft-told story."},{"Title":"River Run Red: The Fort Pillow Massacre in the American Civil War","review":"River Run Red The Fort Pillow Massacre in the American Civil War by Andrew Ward, 2005.531 pages cover to cover. 100 pages of notes. 8 pages of 31 photographs. 2 maps.I have read and own nine biographies and histories of General N. B. Forrest and his cavalry and I'm pro-Southern. Although this work is described as an examination of the Fort Pillow affair by the author in my estimation it is not. River Run Red is an attempt to reduce General N. B. Forrest popularity and blatantly smear his historic reputation as an outstanding military commander. If one word could describe River Run Red it would be the author's repeated condescending use of the nickname 'Wizard' for General Forrest. I wish now I would have starting counting his term for the General but by the time I noticed he was using it at least once per page and sometimes three times per paragraph I deemed it was not worth the effort.Another distraction was Mr. Ward's own smug opinions frequently interjected after favorable Confederate quotes necessary for the story. They were either by whole paragraph or found between brackets. I found no such distractions after any of the Union quotes.References: Mr. Wards includes one hundred pages of valuable notes and references at the back of the book. I had to go to these many times when I questioned something in the main body of interest. I found either mistakes or outright omissions. One famous quote from a Confederate is only half published (the favorable part in reference to Gen. Forrest omitted) and is misrepresented as from \\"an unknown\\" when this is false. Another unfavorable quote, said to be from General Forrest and referenced by Ward in Hurst book 'Nathan Bedford Forrest', I did not remember. After an extensive search this quote cannot be found in Hurst's book either at the pages specified or anywhere near them.Research: Mr. Ward included more material on this one subject than any single work I've read but on new information on the actual fighting at Fort Pillow I find he submits little. The most valued information for me is the great detail about the people surrounding the whole story of Fort Pillow. There is no new detail on exactly how many soldiers were involved, how many were captured, how many were killed in combat, and how many were killed while trying to surrender. There are no detailed diagrams or maps showing the fort layout, the geography and positions of the combatants necessary in understanding a military event. There are no muster rolls, list of the dead, or captured. Most importantly I found his feeble attempt of the chronological order of the events at Fort Pillow contradictory and hard to follow.Bias: This work is simply biased. Mr. Ward's buildup to April 12, 1864 is very incomplete and misleading. This book is not for the uneducated novice. Mr. Ward does not give General Forrest any credit of his victories and actions before Fort Pillow. Any new reader of this history would wonder why the Union forces were so scared of Forrest's men in the first place. Mr. Ward states that Forrest was jealous of Duckworth's 7th Tennessee's capture of the Union garrison at Union City and was totally humiliated by his defeat at Paducah, Kentucky and suggest this led him to attack Fort Pillow and massacre its garrison. He fails to mention that the 7th Tennessee, one of Forrest favorite regiments, was under his command and performing his orders. Further he does not mention Forrest's raids into Western Tennessee and Kentucky were well over a hundred miles behind enemy lines and just getting to Paducah was considered a success. He states near the beginning of the book that military reports from General Forrest and his lieutenants were not to be trusted but includes Union reports frequently and without comment. At one point in the book Mr. Ward states that the Battle of Parker's Crossroads was a great and shattering defeat for Forrest losing all of his plunder and 500 of his own men there; these details obviously came from Union reports and those of Forrest are not even mentioned. Mr. Ward either does not know or does not appreciate the difficulty Forrest was in, being surrounded by a much larger force, behind enemy lines and was still able to escaped with 1500 prisoners and over thirty wagons of captured supplies.The Story: For both pro-Union and pro-Confederate the book has a section or chapter for you but Mr. Ward contradicts himself many times. This incompatibility of statements forced me to have to go back and reread sections of the book. I also found his notes in the back of the book, in many cases, more interesting than the main body of Mr. Ward's work.Dumbest statement from Mr. Ward: \\"The men who served in the Civil War called going into battle 'meeting the elephant.' No one knows exactly why. Perhaps, from a distance, the smoke roiling up from a battle resembled an elephant, but it seems to me just as likely that they could have been referring to the old saw about the blind men and the elephant, each feeling a small portion and none able to describe the beast as a whole.\\"Recommendations:I recommend this book for the serious historians of General Forrest and Fort Pillow. I also recommend this book for Civil War reenactors for the vast amount uniform, horse equipment, and weapons details mentioned. This book has a wealth of quotes and facts. Warning: his references should be verified first, I found omissions and mistakes that question Mr. Ward's accuracy.For the new readers on who General Forrest was read Jack Hurst book 'Nathan Bedford Forrest'.For the military operations of General Forrest read 'The Devil Forrest' by John Allan Wyeth."},{"Title":"River Run Red: The Fort Pillow Massacre in the American Civil War","review":"None other than W. T. Sherman headed an investigation that absolved Forrest. Too many of the events described in gross detail never happened according to the official accounts and in many of cases denied by the participants themselves. Simply another effort to malign the record of the greatest cavalry commander of the War of Northern Aggression."},{"Title":"River Run Red: The Fort Pillow Massacre in the American Civil War","review":"I think this is the best book on Forrest, Hurst biography is also very good. People say the author is biased against Forrest but I saw him giving Forrest credit where other people don't. Forrest wasn't a very nice person is an understatement but he is a very interesting person.The book could be about half the length and still cover the material, but it is obvious the author did a great job of research."},{"Title":"River Run Red: The Fort Pillow Massacre in the American Civil War","review":"I'm still reading this book, but I wanted to respond to a couple of comments made by the reader who gave the book one star. He derides the author for describing Fort Pillow as \\"crescent-shaped.\\" The reviewer scornfully claims that the fort was a shallow \\"w\\" in shape.If you google the term, \\"Fort Pillow\\" and \\"crescent,\\" guess what pops up? Among other things, a reproduction of Nathan Bedford Forrest's after action report about the capture of Fort Pillow. Guess what the \\"Wizard of the Saddle\\" describes the fort as being shaped like? Here's what he said in the report:\\"The fort is an earth-work, crescent shaped, is 8 feet in height and 4 feet across the top, surrounded by a ditch 6 feet deep and 12 feet in width, walls sloping to the ditch but perpendicular inside.\\"Personally, I would take the impression of the man who captured the place over any reviewer here. I wonder what Forrest would have to say to him? (probably something memorably profane).Now, let's talk about the endpaper map: I've looked at it too. First, it isn't that great a map. If I had been the author, I would have found a better, clearer one. But it doesn't show barracks or anything else in the Mississippi River!I'm not saying this book is perfect, but people need to have a sense of proportion. Does it really matter in a study on the massacre at Fort Pillow whether the author placed a statue of Andrew Jackson in the wrong city? Getting the description of the fort wrong as the \\"one star\\" reviewer so clearly did is a worse error than something like that.The bit about the Army of Tennessee is a legitimate ding, but people ought to think about the odds that in a book that is 530 pages long, anyone could get all of the thousands of facts contained within it correct.As far as the idea that the book is some sort of hatchet job on Nathan Bedford Forrest, that is just that reviewer's interpretation. Forrest came up the hard way. He was a slave trader, and I think one had to be pretty hard-minded to prosper at it the way he did. He was also a military genius. But he allowed the massacre at Fort Pillow to take place. Does that mean he was monster? No. It just means that there's a shadow across his reputation --just like the role he played in setting up the KKK after the Civil War."},{"Title":"River Run Red: The Fort Pillow Massacre in the American Civil War","review":"\\" War is cruelty, and you cannot refine it .\\"These words from General William T. Sherman should be kept in mind when reflecting on the events at Fort Pillow.I found this book to be engaging and informative, and I especially liked the quotes from the participants from both sides. I was not aware that anyone had the foresight to interview Tennessee Civil War veterans in the twentieth century and I think their comments added a lot to the book. The events recorded here are a stark contrast with the more widely recorded war in Virginia.Should we really be surprised ? White southerners were conditioned then from birth to see blacks as inferiors, and the vast majority of the participants in the battle on both sides grew up in a country whose Chief Justice once notified them in writing that no black person had any rights that they were bound to respect.The Confederates who fought at Fort Pillow were desperate combatants, not philanthropists or humanitarians.By the spring of 1864 , it must have been obvious to many of them that their war was lost, and the sight of armed blacks in U.S. Army uniforms with leveled rifles and cannon provided a glimpse of a future they would have found insufferable. I do not try to excuse the murder of wounded and prisoners, but I'm not sure that Fort Pillow was worse than Fredericksburg, Franklin , and Cold Harbor.I did find certain elements of the book awkward. The author does overuse the term \\" Wizard \\" with reference to Forrest. I also found the references to federal units as 13/E,6/E and the like a bit bewildering after a time. This is apparently a shorthand of the author's own devising as I have not encountered it elsewhere in more than forty years of reading about the Civil War.I thought the book worth reading. The Civil War was unquestionably the most violent and brutal event in American history. This book is a chilling reminder of one of it's darkest days."},{"Title":"River Run Red: The Fort Pillow Massacre in the American Civil War","review":"I would not describe this work as a polemic. The author is sufficiently professional to have done his research and the raw data that he presents is worth the price of the book. Fans of Forrest can read between the lines of the author's bias. The information exculpating Forrest is presented, it's just that the author puts his own spin on it in some far-fetched ways that strain credulity. 500 black people showed up for Forrest's funeral. There is no proof whatsoever that they did so for any other reason than to show their respect. The author spins this into the remarkable explanation that they came to be certain he was dead! Forrest \\"fathered a black child.\\" How do we know this allegation is true? Because no black person would lie about such a thing, since they would never volunteer for the ignominy of being known as a descendant of Forrest. There is plenty of laughable drivel like that in this book. The good news is that rare historical facts are also presented and winnowing the facts from the spin yields welcome new documentation and in some cases, ammunition on behalf of Forrest, a warrior of fantastic, archetypal prowess who ended his life a sincere Christian and spokesman for racial reconciliation. His conversion should be applauded rather than sneered at, but the vitriol of the victors has not dissipated with time."},{"Title":"River Run Red: The Fort Pillow Massacre in the American Civil War","review":"Fort Pillow still stirs emotions. Neo-Confederates claim that no massacre occurred. Due to the persistence and volume of their complaints textbooks and even Fort Pillow's official webpage state that there is \\"controversy over what exactly occurred on April 12, 1864.\\" However, arround 40 survivors gave testimony to a Congressional investigation that defenders of Fort Pillow were shot down after they had laid down arms, many of them surviving wounds they received after trying to surrender. Union survivors not only gave testimony under oath to the investigation, but they also related their experiences to newspaper interviewers and family members in their own letters immediately after the battle. And yes, there were a couple of Confederates who described the massacre in letters to their families. Many others freely admitted shooting soldiers who were floundering in the Mississippi. It was official Confederate policy not to recognize blacks as soldiers.Only after northern outrage boiled over did Forrest and the South begin to build their case that Fort Pillow was not a massacre.Some reviewers will have you believe that Ward is hiding some of the story, but that is not the case. He uses the works of Forrest's defenders, and mentions his late in life disavow of violence. Forrest's black aids are in the book.Ward also does a fine job of setting up the battle, showing why Fort Pillow's defenders were in no mood to surrender without a fair fight.Yes, there are errors in the book; Ward is not a Civil War specialist. But, the case for the massacre is there.Ex-slaves and Tennessee whites fighting for the North defended Fort Pillow. Forrest and his men reviled them as traitors to the South. Apparently, they are still hated by Neo-Confederates. Only by discounting their testimony as lies can anyone claim that there was no massacre."},{"Title":"River Run Red: The Fort Pillow Massacre in the American Civil War","review":"This book is listed in the incorrect section as it is pure fantasy!!!!!!

I have studied Forrest for the past 20 years and though I am a Southerner I have come to very different opinions than Mr. Ward. I just don't have the temerity to publish those opinions as facts. What bothers me most about this work, besides the historical untruths, are Mr. Ward's comments about Shelby Foote, a very recognized author and historian of the Memphis area.

The critique thus far in the reviewer notes on this Amazon site has the strong whiff of disappointed Nathan Bedford Forrest acolytes and hero worshippers. Good historians dig, sift, and organize material to fashion an honest, fair, detailed understanding of what happened. In the case of the Fort Pillow incident, Ward has done all of that and served it up in wonderful prose. The grit and cruelty of war, human weakness, political economy, and American racism are described with a careful eye and Ward comes to the reluctant conclusion that a massacre did indeed occur within a complex web of cause and responsibility. Excellent book and a very good read if entered into with an open mind."},{"Title":"River Run Red: The Fort Pillow Massacre in the American Civil War","review":"Much good information, but------When discussing the Battle of Fort Pillow, most if not all Dixie-bashers start their distortions by leaving things out of the description of the fort itself. Originally a Confederate fort, it was next used as a Yankee outpost. It came in handy for transporting cotton stolen by Yankees from Southern civilians and shipped up the river for sale. It was a base for legitimate military operations (if you believe that an offensive war, against a country that doesn't threaten your country, is in any way legitimate). Later when terrorist actions against civilian women, children and old men became a major activity, it provided a sanctuary for the terrorists, who could find safety to rest up, replenish ammo, and dispose of the articles stolen from nearby homes. Military authorities had ordered abandonment of the fort; this was not done, probably because of the profits from stolen cotton.Confederate soldiers whose homes were subject to terror raids prayed for destruction of those who terrified their families, and often molested the girls and women, and burned the homes and barns. The most feared were slaves who had run away. Escaping is, of course, most understandable. But the ones who joined the Yankees knew the roads, knew where the females were, and whether they had protectors; where the guns were; where the cotton was, where food and horses were, and even where the men of the house were.Another great concern was the possibility of a general slave uprising, bringing a terrible race war like Haiti suffered. The worst nightmare for Southern soldiers away from home was a mob of armed slaves attacking their families. So Fort Pillow represented a threat to their homes, a haven for war criminals, and there was a crying need for swift justice.Forrest, however, was very intelligent, and avoided giving excuse for retaliation against Southern civilians and prisoners. He would never have arranged a massacre. The northern hue and cry about Fort Pillow was mostly trumped up to counter Southern protests against war crimes by the invaders."},{"Title":"River Run Red: The Fort Pillow Massacre in the American Civil War","review":"Far too biased with an agenda. Forrest who was praised by both Gen Sherman and Lee for his military prowess is dismmised as a country rube that got lucky in Battle. Sherman's own report to Grant exonerates Forrest in Fort Pillow..The entire tone of the work is so redolent with contempt for Forrest and the Confederacy it might have been written by Harriet Beecher Stowe.Ward goes on about Confederate prisons with no mention of the savagery of Union prisons, where the Union did have food and medicine and simply refused to provide it."},{"Title":"River Run Red: The Fort Pillow Massacre in the American Civil War","review":"Andrew Ward, author of River Run Red promises a thoroughly researched definitive account of the Fort Pillow Battle. The book fails to deliver that promise. The bibliography is impressive, but the author's admitted obession with Nineteenth-century massacres drives the content; not a careful analysis of historical inquiry. In short, River Run Red is composed of truths, half-truths, complete fabriations, and yellow journalism.From the initial chapters Ward's literary skills predispose the reader to a myopically predetermined conclusion. N.B. Forrest's mother was a tobacco chewing, ferocious, child-abuser. Ergo, Forrest had whipped his men into a killing frenzy before they reached the fort in April 1864. During the secession crisis, Forrest's compulsive gambling buddy, Governor Isham G. Harris, has thugs gurantee a positive vote in 1861. According to Ward, only a miracle would have prevented a massacre.Errors begin with an endpaper map showing barracks and fortifications in the Mississippi River. In the first sentence of the \\"Prologue\\" the fort is described as \\"crescent-shapped\\" when it actually is a shallow \\"W\\". No small error when one considers the tactical disadvantage the shape would be for Union defenders in 1864. Ward describes a bust of Andrew Jackson in Memphis's Court Square as larger than life-sise on his \\"rearing horse on a stone pedastal.\\" That statue exists, but not in Memphis, and no closer than New Orleans.The errors continue. The Confederate forces at Fort Donelson (February 1862) are described as The Army of Tennessee which was not even organized until after the fall of Corinth in June. Cited sources often do not support the text, and the errors go on and on.River Run Red promises, but fails to deliver."},{"Title":"River Run Red: The Fort Pillow Massacre in the American Civil War","review":"In depth analysis of the brutality following the battle.

Congressional hearings in 1871 absolved General Forrest of atrocities committed by the KKK (he actually dissolved the KKK to stop outrages).The \\"massacre\\" along with the \\"Emancipation\\" Proclamation (which actually freed no one at all) remain as the two greatest perpetrations of propaganda in the American Civil War, and are disproven by historical fact.The fact remains that, love him or hate him, Nathan Bedford Forrest was one of the most remarkable soldiers in American history. He rose from the ranks to Lieutenant-General, a commander whose tactics were studied for generations by the British Royal Army. It's unfortunate that subsequent historians have demonized the heroes while elevating war criminals such as William Tecumseh Sherman. One star for bad research and the ongoing whitewashing of history to suit political correctness."},{"Title":"River Run Red: The Fort Pillow Massacre in the American Civil War","review":"\\"River Run Red\\" is a retelling of tired old lies.In 1871 a Congressional investigation cleared Nathan Bedford Forrest not only of his alleged involvement with the KKK but also reinvestigated the \\"Ft.

These were hardly acts consistent with a \\"massacre.\\"Forrest was accused of ordering the burning of Union barracks with wounded Union soldiers inside. In the Federal Official Records Lieutenant Daniel Van Horn, Sixth U.S. Colored Heavy Artillery, reported, \\"Lieutenant John D. Hill, Sixth U. S. Heavy Artillery, was ordered outside the fort to burn some barracks, which he, with the assistance of a citizen who accompanied him, succeeded in effecting.\\"Mr. Ward wrote that, \\"When Union Gen. William H. Bradford's soldiers, white and black, finally put up their hands, most, perhaps 400 or more, were cut down.\\"Lieutenant Van Horn also reported that, \\"There never was a surrender of the fort, both officers and men declaring they never would surrender or ask for quarter.\\"Who would know better whether or not there was a surrender - an author with no reservations about lying or a Union officer who was an eyewitness participant writing his report only days after the fact?Since the author apparently could not find fundamental references commonly used by real historians - the Federal Official Records and the Congressional records - we must question how such a book could possibly be considered to be \\"meticulously researched\\" unless the author \\"meticulously researched\\" only those records which supported his position.During the War 45 Black men rode with Forrest as servants, teamsters, foragers, scouts, and even as his personal armed bodyguards. Convinced he would die in battle, the freed them in 1863 and ALL remained with him through the War and beyond.In 1875 Forrest gave a speech in Memphis to a Black political and social group. His speech included the following: \\"We were born on the same soil, breathe the same air, live in the same land, and why should we not be brothers and sisters . . . Although we differ in color, we should not differ in sentiment . . . I thank you for the flowers, and assure you that I am with you in heart and hand.\\"Hardly the words of \\"racist mind-set\\" as Andrew Ward alleged. It is clear that the \\"racist mind-set\\" is possessed by Mr. Ward, not Forrest.

It was occupied against the order of the union high command and was in no way ready for what it was too face. It is well known that it main purpose was too rob and terrorize the local populace. Wars in an attempt to exonerate the forts inhabitant dismisses the literally dozens of reports pertaining to these facts to be \\"lies\\". A statement at odds with earlier accounts of the departments well know corruption. It is enough to make you wonder if this fellow read his own book. The Forts antagonists are the Confederate Calvary led by the controversial and vastly successful ( at war ) General Nathan Bedford Forrest.The most devoted and savage fighters in the Confederacy were described by there biggest enemy Union General Sherman as \\" The Finest cavalry in the world\\". They are farm boys mostly from 18 to 25. Incensed by attacks against the regions defenseless inhabitants they are in a lather by the time of the battle. The union commander is killed early in the attack and the defense degenerates form there. Ward second guessed the scaling of the forts walls stating had the artillery commander still been living he would have hurled grenades over the wall stopping the attackers. Firstly hundred of trained artillerymen were still alive at this moment if this were feasible it would have happened. Thus is just one of many conjecture ridden incidents in this book. Forrrests cavalry sadly murdered a large number of the forts defenders after they were beaten. However a quarter survived making fort pillow a massacre in name only.

Also, I didn't notice errors. While I am not an expert, I do have five year's experience in the process instrumentation industry. This book has been a helpful reference for me."},{"Title":"Industrial Pressure, Level & Density Measurement (Resources for Measurement and Control Series)","review":"This is a good introductory book to be used as a self-study guide to the Basics of Industrial Applications of Pressure, Level and Density Measurements.The most common transducers / transmitters and their general operating principles are discussed in this book. This text will proof useful is you are newcomer to the field of instrumentation, or if you are an experienced engineer preparing training materials for technicians and operators at your plant.No attempt has been made on this book to list or discuss all of the many applications dealing with the measurement of these variables, nor to list manufacturers, specific equipment, specifications, constraints or approximate prices. If you need more in-depth information, or if you specify, install, maintain and operate meters for these and other Process Variables, you might want to consider Bela Liptak's Instruments Engineer's Handbook Volume 1 - Process Measurement and Analysis.

In this new edition the write-ups for each group have been cut right down and are far, far shorter than in the previous edition. Also some of the breathtaking excellent essays have been dropped. For example compare the entries for Nirvana: 20 column inches in 1997 have been reduced to less than three column inches!Fortunately the All Music website provides access to most of this missing data but I would really like to have it in book form.Yes, this is still the best rock reference around but sadly it is not as good as it used to be. It is drifting worryingly towards the format of the MusicHound book on Rock (which, if you don't know it, is another rock reference guide).I guess the best way to fill the hole which is now appearing in the All Music book is to get the Rough Guide to Rock. The Rough Guide was always a bit idiosyncratic as a lot of its entries were written by fans of the groups involved (but they were not always sickeningly sweet in their statements!) but the Rough Guide always gave a far more immediate sense of the passions and emotions of what the band was all about, whereas the All Music guide confined its remarks to the strictly factual and it always seemed to write as if the All Music guide was thinking about the band's lawyers suing it!Just to complete the comparison of the All Music guide to other similar volumes, there is the Virgin Encyclopedia of Popular Music. Despite its high price the Virgin book really doesn't stand up to any of the guides I have mentioned. It is not worth considering.So buy this All Music guide. It still is the best. But the best just got worse. Maybe buy the former edition (1997, second edition) instead to make sure you get all the band info. In fact, I could see a case for buying the former edition in preference to this latest edition if your real interest is not on album reviews but on background to bands!"},{"Title":"All Music Guide to Rock: The Definitive Guide to Rock, Pop, and Soul (3rd Edition)","review":"5 years after the 2nd Edition, we finally receive the 3rd Edition of the All Music Guide to Rock: 1,399 (no, not 1,400!) pages of vital information on the best in rock music from yesterday and today. What sets this reference book apart from its competitors is the detailed album-by-album review (and rating) of the artists. A good example is how the editors treat Bob Dylan's career and its 40+ (and counting) albums.The book cover albums issued before or no later than October 2001, so you will find reviews on albums such as Dylan's \\"Love & Theft\\" and Collective Soul's \\"7even Year Itch\\", but you won't find, say, Radiohead's \\"I Might Be Wrong--Live Recordings\\" or Natalie Merchant's \\"Motherland\\". Of course, as the editors note, this book is culled from the vastly more expansive on line version of All Music Guide, which obviously is also updated more frequently. The book has some curious omissions (what, no listing for Creed?) and out-of-proportion reviews (3+ pages on The Fall, about the same as for the Beatles!).In the end, those are minor quibbles. While the on line version is more complete and up to date, I also want to have something I can physically leaf through (same reason why there are still actual newspapers, I guess). Let's just hope that it won't take another 5 years before the 4th Edition sees the day of light! Meanwhile, we will do with this. BUY IT!"},{"Title":"All Music Guide to Rock: The Definitive Guide to Rock, Pop, and Soul (3rd Edition)","review":"This is without a doubt the best rock reference book around today. However, it does not quite live up to the standard of of the original 1995 edition which was simply the best rock reference book ever.The good news is that there is little overlap between this and the previous volumes. Nearly all of the reviews (maybe 90 percent) have been assigned to new writers and re-written. Besides the new and often fascinating reviews, the advantage this book has over its predecessor is more reviews per artist. And as in the previous edition nearly all of the albums featured receive an in-depth critical appraisal not the one or two tossed off lines you'll find in other music guides. Of course the book is also up to date featuring dozens of albums released since 1995 by both new and veteran artists.That all being said, the original book was much better. The artists biographies are cut to the bare minimums this time around. And while this new edition contains individual essays on rock's various sub-genres, there are less of them in the new book. Further the first volume contained a number of book and bootleg reviews. In this edition there's none of the former and precious few of the latter. There are also less of the one-hit wonders and obscure bands that were present in the first book.As usual, the criteria for inclusion is erratic and subjective. Like the first volume the editors draw the line at performers associated with a Country and Western audience excluding even performers with large pop and rock followings like Johnny Cash and Brenda Lee. There are similar oversights with current performers like the hugely popular Sugar Ray. The questionable selection criteria is also present in the albums that are reviewed. For example, the Temptations are represented only by greatest hits collections all essentially featuring the same songs. While a casual fan needs to know which of these to select, they also want to know where to go for more. Finally, though they are few and far between, there are a few factual errors. (The CD reissue of &quot;Ray Charles and Betty Carter&quot; does not contain &quot;But on the Other Hand Baby&quot;. That's one example that jumps out at me.)Still, the majority of these flaws are only noticeable in comparison with the stunning standards set by the previous book. Nowhere else are you going to find this much rock history in one volume. When you're done with this you'll know more about the music as music than you'd ever thought you would know. Just don't throw out the first volume."},{"Title":"All Music Guide to Rock: The Definitive Guide to Rock, Pop, and Soul (3rd Edition)","review":"If you're into rock trivia or just have the need to know more detail, this is an excellent source. It is not fully encyclopedic, missing many albums found in other books, such as the Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock. The writing is generally very good to excellent and doesn't lean into the overly opinionated, a fault with the Rolling Stone book. At the back of the book, there is a section covering the evolution of rock music that is very informative. It includes recommended recordings for many genres. Another minor point - some of the album release dates in this book are incorrect."},{"Title":"All Music Guide to Rock: The Definitive Guide to Rock, Pop, and Soul (3rd Edition)","review":"I agree with most of the sentiment expressed by the other reviewers. It's still the best guide out there, but its previously high standards have dropped alarmingly. Not only do we lose some excellent and helpful essays, but these are frequently replaced with fan-type reviews, which almost always are unobjective (i.e. they praise the band/artist without question), and which are therefore largely useless to the reader wishing to explore the music of that artist (I seem to recall the entry on 'Modest Mouse' being something on these lines...although my memory may be failing me).To summarize: It's still the best guide out there, but I sincerely hope that the editors realise the error of their ways with this 3rd edition and rectify it in the 4th."},{"Title":"All Music Guide to Rock: The Definitive Guide to Rock, Pop, and Soul (3rd Edition)","review":"Has some errors and odd omissions, but I still learn something every time I pick it up.

Reviews on nearly every album ever made as well as helpful and educational essays can be found there. The rock version of that site has been put in a book and released in 2002.For the most part you will no longer have to use the site if you just want to look up rock and soul albums. In fact only the most obscured artists and albums are left out. Not every rock essay is included in the book so you'll be returning to the site if you want to see all of those. A black dot next to a review indicates a good first purchase for that artist. A star indicates an essential purchase bu that artist. A black star indicates both a good first purchase and an essential purchase.A helpful system that Rolling Stone's album guide didn't care about or try to emulate.One may argue that the book is too generous. 95% of the artists get at least one five star review. The artist or album only gets blasted when it truly deserves it ( such as Milli Vanilli or Vanilla Ice ). For the most part the book treats everyone with kid gloves ( would you rather they be mean and hateful like Rolling Stone? ).I don't agree with all the reviews such as Peter Gabriel's hit album, \\"So\\", which only get four out of five stars. They still gave a believable reason as to why the album deserved that rating instead of just saying that the album quote 'sucks' like the so called literates at Rolling Stone would have said.To sum it up this is a very good book. It's still a good idea not to completely ignore the site because the whole site is not in the book. I cannot count how many artists this book has led me to recognize and maybe it will be helpful for you too."},{"Title":"All Music Guide to Rock: The Definitive Guide to Rock, Pop, and Soul (3rd Edition)","review":"First off this is supposed to be a guide to ROCK. With that in mind the following artists are missing:Fear, Robin Trower, Accept, Raven, Giant Sand, Saxon, Yngwie Malmsteen(in fact there are no shred guitarists from the 80's included), New Model Army, Monkeywrench, Michael Viner's Incredible Bongo Band, The Pandoras, Warrior Soul & Deadbolt.The next list is all of the artists that are in this ROCK guide:Celine Dion, Mary J. Blige, D'Angelo, TLC, Tony! Toni! Tone!, Jessica Simpson, Britney Spears, Spice Girls, Sir Mix-A-Lot, Mariah Carey, Biz Markie, Coolio, Das EFX, Dr. Dre, Raekwon, Puff Daddy, Public Enemy, Queen Latifah, Rakim, Busta Rhymes, Vanilla Ice, Jay-Z, Jodeci, K-Ci & Jojo and last but not least the rockinest act ever Kid & Play.Another beef that I have is that quite often a greatest hits type of record will be the only album reviewed by what I consider to be important bands. One that comes to mind is Rainbow. They had many albums with many different lineups so reviewing a greatest hits album will just not suffice. With all this negativity I still admit to reading this thing to death and it does come in quite handy for mostly classic rock purchases.Next time leave the radio r&b; for the r&b; guide and include more complete discographies, metal, indie & punk or press up some separate guides for those genres."},{"Title":"All Music Guide to Rock: The Definitive Guide to Rock, Pop, and Soul (3rd Edition)","review":"This book is without a doubt the best overall guide to rock bands and musicians I have encountered. The coverage is very full - each artist has a career summary at the beginning which usually indicates highlight albums. THEN there is a discussion album by album. This is fantastic for being able to decide (if a given band is one you want to check out but are not familiar with their total output) which albums to buy to get their very best. The reviews are in general very well balanced. On some bands, a few albums are only listed rather than reviewed, reflecting the Guide's view that these albums are minor by comaprions - and one may diagree with this on given albums - but all up, this book is a must-have!"},{"Title":"All Music Guide to Rock: The Definitive Guide to Rock, Pop, and Soul (3rd Edition)","review":"Cool book but not a patch on the previous edition.

Subtitled \\"The Definitive Guide To Rock, Pop and Soul\\" it is five years old now, but as its nearly 1400 pages in length you won't get bored with it.Artists are listed alphabetically and an enhanced 5 star rating system is used. Apart from the number of stars some albums additionally get either a filled circle a filled star or the outline of a star. Generally the very best recordings by an artist will get a filled star and any acknowledged masterpieces will get an outline star. So most of The Beatles albums are 5 star albums with an extra outline star. Sounds complicated on paper but its not - its just difficult to describe!At the back of the book are a series of essays on different genres, such as electric blues, Rap etc. These feature family trees of the most important artists and are interesting reading their own right.AMG also do separate books on Jazz, Soul and Blues all of which I recommend.

For months I have tried to look for a rock n' roll guide that presents an honest case about rock yet at the same time, does not insult intelligence of anybody who loves the music. After reading the All Music Guide to Rock, I can happily say that my long search has come to an end. AMG truly IS the Definitive Guide to Rock, Pop and Soul.I have to say that it makes me sick to see a lot of people quibbling that the AMG is being too generous and that they give too many five-stars. They also have the nerve to complain that certain great albums do not deserve the high critical acclaim it should get. What these people need to realize is that rock n' roll isn't about vocal harmonies, Beatlesque melodies and guys singing like Kurt Cobain or James Hetfield or Paul McCartney. All Music shows why: rock n' roll is a diverse, multi-layered art form akin to cinema, an art form that is liberating in how people express their music, play their music, fool around with their music and even deconstruct it. Instead of following a simple-minded approach consisting of sweeping damnations, unfair generalizations and empty pretension, the writers of AMG show why certain genres, bands and albums should not only be defended but also be accepted in the realm of rock journalism and especially people who love music in general.Consisting of hundreds of artists and thousands of albums, written by a multitude of the writers (mostly from Stephen Erlewine, William Ruhlmann, Greg Plato, Steve Huey and Richie Uterburger), All Music Guide does what many rock journalists are too lazy to do: give an objective biography of all musicians, go into detail as to what makes them so distinctive and write impartial reviews to determine what albums are great and awful and what is strongly recommended for anyone new or life-long fans of the artists. As an added bonus, near the end of the guide, All Music provides brief history on the evolution of rock, rap, soul, pop and other forms of music, dissecting certain genres, explaining what defines them and giving a list of recommended albums to buy for anyone who wants to get involve in these genres.But the greatest thing about the All Music Guide is that it is refreshingly free from highbrow elitism and stick-up-the-ass hipster attitude that makes reviews from certain publications hard to swallow (**cough**Rolling Stone**cough**). The guide is, first and foremost, about the artists and the albums, determining not which sentence sounds more intelligent but what is the best album by a group or artist. Because the reviews are written by multiple writers, rather than a couple, it makes the reviews more accessible for beginners and many bands that get no respect, such as heavy metal, progressive rock, art rock and techno bands, are treated with the admiration that has wrongly eluded them.I cannot recommended All Music Guide enough. It is not perfect: like many encyclopedias, there are typos and certain facts mixed up. But the passion and love for rock music and respect that these people have for artists and their fans make up for such minor shortcomings. If there is a better, more comprehensive book about rock n' roll than All Music Guide, then I clearly missed it.Get this book while you still can."},{"Title":"All Music Guide to Rock: The Definitive Guide to Rock, Pop, and Soul (3rd Edition)","review":"That is what a review said.

This honor is only won, though, by the default of Trouser Press to update their album guide after 1996.If you're merely interested in exploring contemporary rock music, skip the purchase; refer to AMG's website, search to your heart's delight, and take their suggestions with a grain of salt.If you're a die hard aficionado and looking to complete a well-rounded collection, AMG's guide serves as a checklist of sorts for choosing from the discographies of thousands of artists. Again, you will certainly find your opinions vary from those of the writers.* Do not buy blindly.For albums produced prior to 1995, I personally refer to the Trouser Press guide or the 2nd edition of AMG's guide. In the 2nd edition of the AMG rock guide, the writing style is closer to rock journalism than fan fiction, and the reviews seem honest rather than celebratory.*As for other users' comments that the reviews in the 3rd edition seem to be written by fans rather than journalists: that's because they are written by fans. At the launch of the AMG website, AMG began allowing fans to submit reviews; with the publication of the 3rd edition guide, they began including fans' reviews in the written volume.

Waddell's treatment of their tragic lives is nearly as timeless as they are. I like the fact that Waddell knows what she's talking about--her grasp of Abelard's revolutionary theological ideas (especially at the very moving close of the book, when he's working out his theory of atonement) is the furthest thing from superficial. It's precisely because of her scholar's knowledge that she's able to create a richly-woven setting for her two protagonists. This is something I've not found in any other treatment (especially *Stealing Heaven*, which is ghastly). She doesn't attempt to sensationalize the love story, and there's nothing in the way she presents things that's either anachronistic on the one hand or stilted (in that self-conscious, I'm-writing-medieval-dialogue way) on the other.I didn't find her Heloise at all bloodless; in fact, quite the opposite. I was pleased that Waddell lets us see Heloise's brilliant intelligence and intellectual fervor. (Abelard fell in love with her mind as much as anything). It's a shame this book is out of print here in the States. For anyone with an interest in the story of Abelard and Heloise (or even for anyone who simply likes good prose and well-done fictionalized history), this is a book that sould not be missed. It's a lovely, sometimes stunning read."},{"Title":"Peter Abelard,: A novel,","review":"This book was recommended to me by an utterly fascinating, extremely well read man I met in India. Just the fact that it is his favorite book convinced me to read it. The beauty of the prose is breathtaking, haunting. Even as someone who is decidedly not a Catholic, or even religious (making it an opportunity to learn about medieval Catholicism), I found Abelard's spiritual journey profoundly moving, particularly in the end when his faith is restored. It is one of those books, like most of Nabokov's and many of Turgenev's, that is so beautiful it cannot be absorbed in one reading. A note on the story: as the title implies, this book is first and foremost about Abelard. His famous love affair with Heloise is treated as but one aspect of his remarkable life. Even so, it is well worth it, even for those with little interest in the man himself."},{"Title":"Peter Abelard,: A novel,","review":"I've always been an admirer of the philosopher Abelard, and like everyone else, I found the story of his love affair with Heloise very touching. So naturally, I jumped at the chance to read a book like this. And I was not disappointed. This book was very well written. Rather than painting Abelard as an egotistical, condescending, self-absorbed brute as some writers have (I'm pointing a finger at the author of &quot;Stealing Heaven&quot;), this book portrays him in a more sympathetic light. In this book, he is more accurately depicted as a deep and insightful man. Helen Waddell builds on what we know about Abelard, rather than making a bunch of wild guesses. Her writing style, too, is vivid and eloquent. &quot;Peter Abelard&quot; is a must for anyone who is into the story of Heloise and Abelard or anyone who likes a good book. I highly recommend it.(But whatever you do, DON'T blow your hard earned money by buying &quot;Stealing Heaven&quot;) :)"},{"Title":"Peter Abelard,: A novel,","review":"A well-written tale of two historical characters. Lovers of romance fiction and of great fiction in general should not miss reading this book of the tragic and enduring love between abelard and heloise. Sublime."},{"Title":"Peter Abelard,: A novel,","review":"This brief 1933 novel encapsulating the life of Peter Abelard was hard to read and ultimately unsatisfying. Part of the problem is the author's assumption of a certain level of erudition and familiarity with the classics on the part of her readers, not a given these days. Abelard's fame as a learned rhetorician, teacher and philosopher attracted both great adoration in his time as well as the inevitable jealousy and ill-wishers. However, the lofty rhetorical argumentation on which Abelard's genius and reputation rested is hard to relate to in these modern days as having much importance or relevance to the \\"real\\" world. Discussions of what religious beliefs constituted heresy and elevated disputations on the nature of God and the truths of the Bible, hot button topics at the time, failed to much interest or engage this modern reader. The other center of gravity in the story is the tragic passion between Abelard and Heloise, but the depiction of their love affair likewise seemed remote and failed to elicit much emotional response. The other characters may have been famous clerics and scholars of the time, but they and their opinions are not so readily known today. Overall, I felt the author had \\"talked over my head\\" a good bit, the result of which was my lack of engagement with the novel.

I, however, would disagree strongly with that.I happen to be a Certified Financial Planner, thus, I think I am pretty well versed in the area of personal finance - and I still found this book to be a delightful read.While it may not have provided me with much \\"new\\" information, I think one of the central themes is that sound investing really comes down to a few basic principles that many of us already know. This book does a wonderful job of reinforcing those fundamentals - and it does so in a very \\"readable\\" style - I read the book in one night!In addition, I appreciate Mr. Brennan's candor in the final chapter, \\"Regrets, I've had a few\\" where he confesses to some of his own investing mistakes, showing us that even for \\"experts\\" the game of investing is quite challenging.Order this book and put the principles to use with your own finances - you'll be glad you did.And, to top it all off, Mr. Brennan is donating his book proceeds to charity - a very classy move.Vince Brascia"},{"Title":"Straight Talk on Investing: What You Need to Know","review":"Anyone who thrives on their broker, CNBC, or CNN-Fn for investment advice needs to read this book.Better yet...anyone who is interested in investing needs to read this book.Having read \\"Take on the Street\\" (Levitt), \\"You Got Screwed\\" (Cramer), and \\"The Great Mutual Fund Trap\\" (Baer & Gensler), Brennan outshines all of them.\\"Straight Talk\\" offers very solid, common-sense advice for financial planning, saving, and investing. It is not solely about mutual funds, but rather about investing with objectives in mind.Successful investors are disciplined, rational, and invest with goals and objectives. This is not difficult, but it goes far beyond looking at the 5, 10, and 15-year returns on the various funds in your 401(k). You set your goals, then choose an investment strategy that helps you meet those goals with minimal risk. CNBC is not the answer, but taking the time to educate yourself will pay off big, and \\"Straight Talk on Investing\\" is a good book with which to start.Brennan provides a concise guide to making solid, prudent investment decisions.Unlike Baer and Gensler (\\"The Great Mutual Fund Trap\\"), Brennan provides more comprehensive, non-partisan investment advice. Brennan promotes no political agenda, whereas Baer and Gensler have soiled an otherwise fine book with their partisan sniping.Brennan is also a breath of fresh air in another respect: in spite of his status as CEO of a reputable mutual fund provider (Vanguard), he does not encourage people to invest in things with which they are not comfortable. Unlike many investment writers, Brennan does not put down those who would rather save their money and not invest.Whether you are a saver or an investor, this book is excellent reading; it is full of very practical advice."},{"Title":"Straight Talk on Investing: What You Need to Know","review":"I've bought and read many &quot;investment guides&quot;. This book is far and away the best I've read. It's not a get rich quick scheme. It's not a &quot;one size fits all&quot; financial plan. It is straight talk on investing.

Things to look for, watch out for, realistly expect.This book gives you everything you need to form and execute a reasonable financial plan, or help you to choose a financial professional who will have your best interest in mind.I've already recommended it to my friends and family, and have sent a copy to my best friend.Get it for your children, your syblings, your friends. It's what people need to know starting out in life."},{"Title":"Straight Talk on Investing: What You Need to Know","review":"I've done a lot of both short-term trading and long-term investing in the market, and this book cuts through the smoke and mirrors to give you the straight dope on investing. I've read many books over the years on the market by most of the great traders and investors, and there are really only a few important lessons you need to learn. This book distills all that down into readable form without all the distracting technical details.One important lesson, for example, is to find an approach that is right for you, and that matches your goals, tolerance for risk, and essentially, your personality. If you like to trade more actively but are doing a passive dollar-cost averaging program; or if you're a more hands-off investor but are trying to be a day-trader, you're probably not going to be able to make a success out of your program.Another important lesson to learn is that investing really isn't, and perhaps shouldn't be, rocket science. Although I've done a few very technical kinds of investing, including such things as arbitraging short and long butterfly option spreads, which can get very complex, Brennan says you really don't need to get this fancy to be a good investor, a point I would have to agree with.And realistically, I can't say I did that much better with all the fancy stuff as I did with my more low-key long-term investments in quality stocks. In that case, why not just invest in good, quality stocks and stop all the thrashing? I was doing okay at it, but after adding up all the commissions, I wasn't doing that much better than my long-term portfolio, and it was a lot more work, although it was fun for a while. Anyway, I finally decided to do just that. This is the sort of wisdom that perhaps only comes from experience, but Brennan has packed a lot of that into this book, so you don't have to go through everything I did to learn these important lessons.The present market has unfortunately reminded a lot of people that stocks are potentially risky investments, and so many people are rethinking their portfolios and whether the market is really for them. For those who still have the courage to brave the waters, this book has a lot of great advice and information for the investor who still wants to invest in the market."},{"Title":"Straight Talk on Investing: What You Need to Know","review":"Jack Brennan, CEO and Chairman of the Vanguard Group (2nd largest mutual fund company), has penned his first book and has provided investors with an easy-to-read style on investment basics. Brennan has a long way to go to catch up to his predecessor -- Jack Bogle, the index fund guru and prolific author . Not one of Bogle's books was included in Brennan's recommended reading list, which is surprising, since they are classics.This 239-page book is divided into four parts and 22 chapters. Part I focuses on mastering the basics. Brennan urges investors to first do their homework (learn about stocks, bonds and cash; where to invest -- bank, mutual fund or broker; understand risk; and know yourself as an investor.Next, he tells investors to develop good habits (saving money, buy-and-holding investments, don't keep score too often). He warns investors to be skeptical and avoid investment fads like the Nifty-Fifty (popular in the 1970s) and the Dot.coms of the 1990s. Lastly, he recommends that investors continue their investment learning process and become aware of new opportunities.Brennan then counsels investors to trust themselves, the financial markets, and to find a trustworthy financial services firm. He pushes compounding as a way to build wealth.According to the author, developing a financial plan including current and future financial needs is important. He covers college savings vehicles, saving for retirement, how to handle debts, and the use of margin. Additionally, Brennan expounds on the benefits of dollar cost averaging and using automatic monthly investments plans, as well as stuffing money in tax-deferred retirement plans.In Part II, he shows how to construct a realistic portfolio using diversification and the balanced portfolio approach. He illustrates the typical returns from 1926 - 2000 with different portfolio allocations of stocks and bonds. These portfolios provide returns ranging from 6.2% to 10.7%, from the least to most aggressive.Not surprisingly, Brennan recommends mutual funds as the best way to diversify. He goes into a discussion of how mutual funds work, their advantages, and a few caveats (yes, you can lose money). He then provides guidance on how to select the appropriate mutual fund using a 4-step approach. Next up is a discussion of the costs associated with mutual funds (loads, 12b-1 fees, taxes, etc.). He provides a table depicting the value of various hypothetical funds using different costs for each and how costs play a big role in the final value of the funds over time.The most important chapter in Part II is the one on risk. Most investors do not understand the implications of neglecting to take into account the riskiness of their investments. Brennan defines investment risk, duration, volatility, risk tolerance, and how to manage risk.Part III focuses on managing your funds with focus and discipline. He explains style boxes (similar to Morningstar's style boxes) and how funds are classified into one of nine boxes arranged by market cap size (small, medium and large) and style (value, blend, growth).Brennan then attempts to make the case for buy-and-hold as a solid investment strategy. He indicates that frequent trading and market timing don't work. He says, \\"my advice is to forget market timing and let time, and compounding, do the magic.\\" He illustrates how missing the \\"best\\" months greatly reduces an investor's overall performance from 1992 - 2001. But he neglects to mention that missing the \\"worst\\" months provides a higher performance than missing the worst months.Investors who got killed in the market crash from 2000- 2002, the worst since 1929, by sticking with their stocks or mutual funds, and especially those who kept dollar-cost averaging down, probably don't agree with Brennan on the benefit of buy-and-hold and dollar-cost averaging. I strongly believe that market timing with the right tools and strategies can beat buy-and-hold with less risk, but this is not the format to make the case.A chapter entitled \\"Time is Everything\\" makes the case for accumulating wealth by making systematic investments in retirement accounts. Brennan illustrates the value of compounding, and why investors should start investing at a young age. He also shows the range of returns of the S&P; 500 from 1972-2001 for various rolling holding periods (1, 5, 10, and 20 years) and concludes that all 10-year or longer rolling periods produced positive returns. He urges investors to tune-up and rebalance their portfolios to retain the proper allocation among investment classes.Part IV starts with a discussion of the history of financial bubbles, and then goes into how to recognize a bubble, and how to protect yourself from speculative bubbles. Brennan urges investors not to follow the crowd, not to become greedy, and not to chase hot sectors. Above all, he cautions investors to beware of themselves -- since they may be there worst enemies because of their behavior. Overconfidence, focusing too much on the short-term losses, feeling compelled not to stay on the sidelines all can lead to financial disaster.One chapter focuses on bear markets. Brennan reviews their length since 1956. He points out that a diversified portfolio of 60% stocks/40% bonds had lost only $29,000 out of $100,000 in the 1973-1974 bear market compared to a loss of $48,000 invested 100% in stocks. He offers the following tips for handling bear markets:- continue to use dollar-cost averaging- maintain long-term perspective- make small shifts in portfolio allocation- have realistic expectationsHe says, \\".....people who are investing regularly for a long-term goal-- not those drawing on their investments -- bear markets are good things. If you are investing for retirement, and retirement is decades away, a decline in you account is not a \\"real\\" loss\\". Oh really!! Tell that to the millions who have lost a large chunk of their retirement money in this cruel crash by following the conventional wisdom.In conclusion, I felt that Brennan offers many useful insights for novice investors to contemplate, especially on the importance of using diversified no-load mutual funds. The book is well written, easy-to-understand and offers down-to-earth advice. His discussion of buy-and-hold is weak and flawed and that's the weakest part of the book."},{"Title":"Straight Talk on Investing: What You Need to Know","review":"Well written book with common sense advice from someone who we can trust.

A good refresher for the more seasoned investor."},{"Title":"Straight Talk on Investing: What You Need to Know","review":"The Vanguard Group is the world's second-biggest mutual fund company, and author Jack Brennan is its chairman and CEO. When this book was published, Vanguard had 15 million shareholders and approximately $600 billion under management. Vanguard pioneered index funds, a type of investment that aims to reflect, not beat, the returns of the market. Because Vanguard does not pay fund managers to outguess the market, it can keep fund fees and expenses low. This economy is one of its primary assets. Brennan's book, written with Marta McCave, recapitulates sound principles of long-term investing in a straightforward, user-friendly way and details numerous kinds of investments. He does not tell you how to strike it rich in the markets or discover the next Microsoft or recognize unusual patterns in price charts. Better yet, he tells you how to build wealth the unexciting but generally reliable way: slowly, carefully and dispassionately. We recommend this excellent book to those who don't want to get rich quick, but who would be very content to get rich eventually. Warning: this book is not for the greedy."},{"Title":"Straight Talk on Investing: What You Need to Know","review":"Simple, basic, conservative advice on investing basics. His main points: spend-less-than-you-make, pay off high credit card debt, become a disciplined saver and investor, pay yourself first, invest in no-load mutual funds (preferably low cost index funds), reduce risk through buy-and-hold strategy over a long period of time, employ balance and diversification, re-balance your portfolio periodically, dollar cost average.Suffice it to say, there's very little new here. This advice has been said many times before in many different ways. However, he does say things very clearly and has nice, short chapters.Very easy for novices to learn basic principles of successful investing.The best part of this book are the graphs and tables. He uses them very effectively to show how your total returns are affected under different scenarios.This is a book, though, that concentrates on principles. You'd probably still need to sit down with an adviser and figure out exactly which funds to buy.surpises: He should have been more up-front in admitting his bias for index funds. He is, after all, running the company that brought them to the masses.Also, as another reviewer wrote, why no references in appendix to the books by John Bogle? He founded Vanguard and practically invented low MER index fund investing."},{"Title":"Straight Talk on Investing: What You Need to Know","review":"This book is very appropriately titled. \\"Straight Talk on Investing\\" is just that, straight talk on investing. I've read many books on investing stressing the buy-and-hold approach and this book is by far the friendliest to read. Most other books read more like text books but this author gives it to you in plain english. I highly recommend this to the beginning investor as they are not interested in academic hoopla. That said, the author is somewhat biased to mutual funds specifically index funds since he is the CEO of Vanguard, the 2nd largest fund company in the US. But objectively speaking, other books that are totally unrelated to Vanguard also stress buying Vanguard index funds since they have the lowest fees and are virtually the pioneers in index funds. Basically, buying an index fund allows you achieve market performance which, according to research, is pretty good performance - beats 2/3 to even 3/4 of other actively managed funds. Unless you know for sure that the fund you own is part of that elite 1/4 that beats the street, I'm guessing you better go with market performance. It's really hard to argue on tried-and-tested approaches such as indexing, buy-hold, or dollar-cost averaging. Even from my own experience, I realized had I just bought an index fund such as the Vanguard 500 and hold it for the last ten years, I be up 20%. But instead, I thought I could beat the market with my own stock picks and as of current I'm still down 10% from the bubble (I'm firm on buying-and-holding). I've read other books and they all say the same things with the exception of those \\"get-rich\\" trading books so there is something to be said of those techniques. Sadly, you would think more people would follow the advice, but in the world of investing, everyone is still after that quick buck or the excitement of the possibility of discovering something that will give them an edge. One thing for sure, if such a way exists, you won't be reading about it soon. I remember once when I was working for this company specializing in financial software, the tools which will allow the professional investor/trader achieve what they desire and I ask if their stuff really works. They gave me a vague answer about it being able to access the situation better - baloney sandwich anyone - and ended with something I never forget: \\"When we do find a way, we won't tell anyone\\" Makes you wonder whether that 1/4 that do beat the street found \\"the way\\".

Dr. Thibodaux explores terrorist tactics used by fervent PC activists to intimidate, bully and manipulate American media, culture and general public.

He goes further to explain the position of American universities and their contribution to the growing sentiment toward ridiculous censorship practices, intelligently labeling our academic institutions as the &quot;though police&quot; This is a clear, concise and unbiased explanation of what political correctness is, how it effects our culture, and contributes to the &quot;Cloning of the American Mind&quot;."},{"Title":"Political Correctness","review":"It is perhaps a relief that this book is now out of print, for this might indicate that the subject matter is somewhat out of date and no longer of relevance. On the other hand, it might mean that the book no longer describes a novel phenomenon, but instead one that is now predominant in all areas of cultural, academic, and political life. &quot;Political correctness&quot; in both content and in terms of legal boundaries may now be so entrenched that no one even questions its morality or legitimacy.Have we become clones of each other in ethical, legal, and political thought since this book was first published in 1992? I don't think so, but anyone who was a teacher or professor in the late 1980's and 1990's should understand very well what a fight it was to maintain intellectual independence in the universities and colleges of the nation, and this was pretty independent of geographical location. Any deviation from the narrow bandwidth of political correctness was met with highly vituperative diatribe and personal attacks. Those of us who were unprepared for this naturally wondered whether anyone else was experiencing the same. Therefore books like these were welcome additions to our libraries, and we read them as a sort of catharsis.One might interpret the current hate and anger literature that is proliferating the best seller lists as a reaction to the politically correct movement. Whether it is or not is a question for social research to answer, and this research must hold to the most rigorous of scientific standards. In addition, any answer to the dogmas and principles of political correctness must at all times be calm and rational and avoid the intense smear campaigns against individuals and institutions that are characteristic of the anger literature of today. The author of this book has taken such an approach, and the result is a book that documents, albeit sometimes purely anecdotally, the intensity of the politically correct movement in the universities of the 1980's and 1990's.If we are to measure progress by the degree to which we accept and tolerate true diversity, we would be correct to do so. But diversity, as the name implies, means tolerance of ALL ideas, no matter how corrupt, no matter how evil, and no matter how irrational we believe them to be. That does not mean we need to finance ideologies that disagree with our own. It does not mean that we have to associate with people whose ideas disagree with our own. It does mean that whatever language they use, in whatever form, and no matter how disgusted we are with it, it should not be eliminated from our books and libraries. In fact, armed with the incredible instrument called the brain, we should welcome all ideas confronting us, and then sift through them with infinite curiosity, rejecting those that don't meet the evidence, and accepting those that do. The ones that are rejected will still be viewed as past sign-posts, as mistakes that are essential to human cognition. The ones that are accepted will stand or fall on the weight of future evidence. Ironically, it is the ideas that are truly diverse, that seem to apply to many different situations and contexts, that survive intense scrutiny and become timeless."},{"Title":"Performance Through Learning: Knowledge Management in Practice (Improving Human Performance)","review":"If you need to understand or study aobut the KM knowledge ,here is your choice.easy to understanding and reading!"},{"Title":"Performance Through Learning: Knowledge Management in Practice (Improving Human Performance)","review":"While we are all clear that we need to learn to be successful in today's market, it is far from clear how to justify \\"learning\\" from an economic perspective.

If you are near a bookstore, you can easily verify this. I imagine that this comparison (or lack thereof) would hold for many other probability textbooks. Also, if presentation makes a difference to you, this is quite minimalist.Another area that I found lacking is that the answers in the back just provide a numerical answer without any explanation to how solutions were arrived at. While this is often the case for other books, the author did not provide a sufficient base for a novice to work the problems. As a result, most of the end of chapter problems were of little use in helping me better learn the materials. A good workbook or better explanations would be very helpful.While there are certainly couple areas that I found worthwhile and this does appear to be one of the only books on this niche area (the lack of competition may explain a lot of why the shortcomings exist and why this doesn't have the feel of real textbook), this first edition book needs some serious work to make it truly effective and user friendly."},{"Title":"Modeling, Analysis, Design, and Control of Stochastic Systems (Springer Texts in Statistics)","review":"This is a very good text to study stochastic processes for the first time. It contains a review on basic probability material in the four first chapters, which is quite extensive for a review, but very useful, since usually undergraduate students have covered in detail only parts of the material they will need to study Markov Chains and other stochastic processes.Grad students will find probably find it useful too, since after the review, discrete and continuous Markov chains, queuing models and other topics are presented and illustrated with many examples. They serve to clarify propositions and theorems that are formally proved.In general, I think this book helps to develop the intuition necessary to use Markov processes in many practical applications, and understand higher level texts.Of course, having a broad topic coverage at introductory level, some more advenced topics (like positive and null recurrency) had to be left out, so grad students will need some other reference too (Kulkarni has a grad text, in case you like this one)."},{"Title":"Frankenstein: The Legacy","review":"The DALLAS MORNING NEWS calls Frankenstein: The Legacy &quot;a fun and easy read - Schildt has given the 'monster' a humanity and awareness.&quot; CINESCAPE MAGAZINE reports the following: &quot;Frankenstein: The Legacy is a strong literary follow-up to the original.

I was a high school student, who often found myself alone with no one to talk to and i was often depressed. Due to this predicament, i often was caught with my nose pressed to the inner spine of a book for hours on end.My mother had just gone and stolen my last purchase for decorating the end of her own nose before i had finished it again, leaving my face was feeling a little cold. While in this store, i saw a book that was based upon Frankenstein, which we were reading in my mystery/fantasy/scifi classes. My eyebrows raised, interest peaked, and my wallet screamed for me to take this one home. I don't even remember what other purchases i had made that day, other than this one, though i know there were more.I got home and had it sitting on my shelf for awhile, as i was busy with school and work for a few months. Every so often i would look at it longingly, wondering when i could officially sit down with it and snuggle.Eventually things slowed down enough that i could start reading. Oh the emotions this book sparked! You can feel every emotion that Daniel is going through, from actually finding the journal, to the creation of the creature, and to the fear he feels when he realizes the depth of the creature. You feel the emotions of the creature, it's self loathing, it's pain, it's misery at the rejection it gets from Daniel. this is a wonderful book that i would definitely suggest for an All Hallow's Read Book."},{"Title":"Frankenstein: The Legacy","review":"The author does a great job of capturing Mary Shelley's style and gives us a modern day tale that is both compelling and relevant. A modern day scientist goes to the Arctic to and comes across Victor Frankenstein's journal. He is obsessed to carry out the same experiments using modern science and very careful to repeat the same mistakes. As always, something goes wrong though not in ways that you would expect. I enjoyed this book a lot and will look for the Dracula novel by the same author."},{"Title":"Frankenstein: The Legacy","review":"At last someone had the guts to write a contemporary Dracula without the silly bite in the neck, stake in the heart theme. Congratulations, Schildt! We hope to see many more just like this. I liked &quot;Frankenstein: The Legacy,&quot; but this one is even better."},{"Title":"The Yellow Admiral: Aubrey/Maturin Series, Book 18","review":"This is another &quot;land-based&quot; book in the series, which is a good thing. Jack Aubry's troubles dealing with land lubbers (whose dishonesty and unstructured ways mystify him to no end) and the often tumultuous relationship between Stephen and Diana are always entertaining. Less exciting than previous books in the series, the characters are definitely slowing down as they get older. Also, not much new happens here; the characters are not really developed further. Despite these shortcomings, is there any writer whose prose is more enjoyable? O'Brian's polished writing, his sly wit, his eye for fascinating detail, his descriptive powers: they're all here in full force. Another caveat: the jacket description reveals almost every plot point in the book. It would have been much more enjoyable not knowing many of these events were going to happen"},{"Title":"The Yellow Admiral: Aubrey/Maturin Series, Book 18","review":"A reviewer of O'Brian's next book in the series wrote that the Aubrey books are really one 6000 page novel.

If not, don't start here, start atthe beginning."},{"Title":"The Yellow Admiral: Aubrey/Maturin Series, Book 18","review":"I assume that people interested in audio versions of O'Brian's novels have already read the books. So, listening to a read version is a supplementary pleasure that can follow a great read. My rating here has nothing to do with the literary quality of the work in question. The whole Aubrey-Maturin series is superb. But if you want to listen to them I recommend that you stay away from any of them read by Simon Vance. He is unable to sufficiently differentiate the characters, with their diverse accents from around the world. For example, Maturin grew up in Ireland, and should therefore have a bit of an Irish accent. Vance can't do it, but rather offers stuffy readings that makes Jack sound like a bombastic jerk, and Stephen like a mincing prig. And in his hands, Diana sounds like a silly simpering ninny. An actor, not just a reader is required. I highly recommend Patrick Tull, who recorded the entire series with consistent success and enthusiasm, as well as John Lee, who unfortunately only recorded the first 6 volumes."},{"Title":"The Yellow Admiral: Aubrey/Maturin Series, Book 18","review":"Unlike Forrester O'Brian has really done his homework.

I must say, this is by far the weakest. NOTHING HAPPENS! The first part of the book has Aubrey and Maturin wandering around, mostly at Aubrey's home. They natter on about the land, politics, a little nature, and Aubrey's responsibilities as the member of parliament for the area. Once they get out to sea, they are on duty patroling outside Brest, to keep French ships from going in or out. Apparently none do. The admiral hates Aubrey, because he voted agains the admiral's nephew in a parliamentary vote about how to use land. The only action in the entire book is Aubrey and his ship going after a &#34;prize,&#34; which promptly gives up without a fight. Throughout the book, Aubrey worries about what will happen if war ends, and he is retired, nominally as an admiral, but with no command. This is what is called being a yellow admiral, and it is considered quite a disgrace. It gets quite boring. Really, there is absolutely no action in the entire book. I wish I hadn't wasted my time reading it. There was no pleasure and no entertainment value whatsoever."},{"Title":"The Yellow Admiral: Aubrey/Maturin Series, Book 18","review":"My husband started reading the series but did not have the complete set.

I am absolutely smitten by O'Brian's writing (both in terms of his characters and the way he writes \\"nautical fiction\\"), but the story here was lackluster, focusing mostly on the enclosure movement and how Aubrey's political opposition to it may have impacts on future promotion (hence the title, a \\"Yellow Admiral\\" a reference to those post-captains who have been given the rank of admiral, but have been passed over for command of a ship, in effect ending their naval careers.) To summarize: Aubrey's immediate superior sought to enclose common land adjacent to Aubrey's (which would have been of tremendous financial benefit to the individual who claimed the land). Aubrey, acting out of a sense of ethics (enclosure would mean the farmers and herders would become tenents of the lord) used his position in Parliament to prevent this from happening - to the extreme displeasure of the commanding admiral, jeapordizing his possibility for advancement, and giving the admiral an excuse to berate, villify and otherwise belittle our hero.This plot point developed, Aubrey spends the remainder of the book on station, blockading Le Havre and Breast as the Napoleonic wars wind down on the continent - adding a sense of pending crisis for Aubrey's promotion. Understand that once the war ends, opportunities for promotion dry up, increasing the likihood of any number of post-captains becoming \\"yellowed.\\" Hardly the gripping reading I have come to expect from O'Brian. To be fair, there is a deal of character development here: the issues sailors (and Marines) face when returning home after a long voyage is explored, (including some regretful dillances in Aubrey's' past come to haunt him) as is the fine line Aubrey must walk as both Naval officer and MP. However, in books past, this was done along with either the political intrigue of Maturin or the occasional roar of cannon (or roar of the seas), none of which are present in his installment.Having invested so much into the series, and knowing the characters (and the writer) as well as one does 18 books into a series, it is easy to forgive O'Brian, and perhaps easy to criticise a review of that most unusual of things, a mediocre book by this author. Nonetheless, I will continue with the series, and continue to \\"call them as I see them\\" - even when an author I much admire drops the ball. This flat novel aside, the entire series is well worth a read."},{"Title":"The Yellow Admiral: Aubrey/Maturin Series, Book 18","review":"I really love this series, I just wish it'd been printed on better quality paper."},{"Title":"The Yellow Admiral: Aubrey/Maturin Series, Book 18","review":"\\"The Yellow Admiral\\" is 18th in the 20 novel Aubrey-Maturin series, featuring Captain Jack Aubrey and his companion ship surgeon Stephen Maturin, set in the year 1815. \\"The Yellow Admiral\\" one a episode in a grand epic, and as such the plot is of secondary importance. Revealing \\"how it comes out\\" does not really constitute a spoiler. For reader's new to the series, the titles often describe the ending of the novel, or the next novel in the series.The novel begins with a rather through summary of preceding novels in the series, through various second-hand accounts. So, a reader new to the series could start with \\"The Yellow Admiral\\" and not be too confused. Caveat, once you've read any book in the series, you're hooked. So, if you are thinking about reading \\"The Yellow Admiral\\", do it right. Start with Book 1, \\"Master and Commander\\"SUMMARYThe action begins at with Jack on temporary leave at his estate at Woolcombe, England, to attend to his Parlimentary duties. Jack is very much opposed to the enclosures of the commons in general and specifically of \\"Simmon's Lea\\". As \\"Lord of the Manor\\", he is in a position to essentially veto the effort, and does. We learn a great deal about the subject, the effect on \\"small holders\\" and the politics. Jack's opposition to the enclosure, other political positions he has hold in Parliament, and unpopularity in some parts of the Royal Navy threaten his naval career if peace with France breaks out.Jack is ordered to sea to join a rather uneventful blockade of Brest, France. During which his wife Sophie learns of an affair Jack had with an American woman.When the blockade ends, with the capture of Napoleon, facing the fact that he will almost certainly be \\"yellowed\\", i.e., be promoted to admiral but never given a command, Jack opts to temporarily resign his commission in order to accept a private commission surveying the coasts of Chile, and organizing a Chilean navy. The agreement is accepted by \\"the powers that be\\", with the proviso that Jack can be called back into service with the Royal Navy at any time.So, Jack and Stephen set sale on the former \\"HMS Surprise\\"-now privately owned by Stephen--for Chile. At Madeira, he receives orders to take command of all Royal Navy ships at Madeira to blockade the Straits of Gibralter.CRITIQUEAlthough lacking the wonderful action sequences of pitched naval battles, \\"The Yellow Admiral\\" is extraordinarily rich and vibrant. In addition to the politics of the time, and vivid details of nautical life, the state of medicine (and surgery) are brilliantly illuminated.Not for the action junky, and maybe not the ideal introduction to the series.

I have read all of them at least three times each. But &quot;The Yellow Admiral&quot; appalled me. I was certain within fifty pages that it had been written by someone else who had picked up all of O'brian's turns of phrase, but none of his wit or heart. I wrote an indignant letter to the publisher demanding my money back, but then never sent it. It's embarrassing to admit how passionately I feel about this - I mean, it's only a book, right? But this book was so poorly done it would have been funny had I not been so eagerly awaiting it. Diana's pronouncements on sex! and Sophie's transformation to a shrew! Sir Joseph's tortured explanations re: Stephen's character to a clerk! I would have been far happier had it never been published - it was like watching close friends disintegrate before my eyes."},{"Title":"The Yellow Admiral: Aubrey/Maturin Series, Book 18","review":"O'Brian is never dull, of course, but this installment is too didactic for me. Where before Maturin's naivete is a natural cue for exploration of many topics, here it's just too obviously a chance for P O'B to display his astounding reasearch skills.But the thread of Aubrey &amp; Maturin's shared life remains compelling, and it surely has the best &quot;cliffhanger&quot; ending of the series so far. When does the next one come out?"},{"Title":"The Yellow Admiral: Aubrey/Maturin Series, Book 18","review":"There is an awful lot of recycling going on in this book. The research is still prodigious, but I suspect at this point O'Brian has the topography and culture of early 19th Century Europe so much a part of him that he is now on automatic pilot. Well, he's entitled at this point. As usual, situations and characters are introduced, then never heard from or of again. Maturin's naivete is a more than a bit tiresome at this point. Nonetheless, I look forward to the next one and see how Jack deals with Napoleon."},{"Title":"The Yellow Admiral: Aubrey/Maturin Series, Book 18","review":"The Yellow Admiral is as good as any of the previous 17 Aubrey/Maturin novels: as good as novels get. It has occurred to me, and not for the first time as I have read and reread the entire series and observed the whole cast of characters mature, that what we call the Aubrey/Maturin series is really one very long book with eighteen chapters.One can read the Holmes/Watson books in any order; the characters never change, and I don't recall references by Doyle to previous events, such as those backwards glimpses O'Brian slyly slips to us steady fans from time to time that must sail right over the heads of hit-and-run readers.With not a molecule of discredit to her genius intended, Agatha Christie's Hercule Poirot remained the same character through 25 stories, and I'm not aware of any maturation of Miss Jane Marple. Of course, Agatha Christie probably felt that her readers preferred the familiarity that the sameness of characters provided.What gives me the feat tha! ! t The Yellow Admiral might be the final Aubrey/Maturin episode? Diana never once jumps the traces; Jack mends all his fences at home; Sir Joseph Blaine is very much back in control in his seemingly obscure but influential position with &quot;the Committee;&quot; and Stephen has lived through a volume without a crisis. Then, just as Jack Aubrey has gotten used to the idea of building the Chileans a navy, while on a little respite in Funchal, Madeira, with his family and almost everyone else dear to him, he receives an urgent dispatch from Lord Keith of the Admiralty, advising him that Napoleon has escaped from Elba. Writes Keith: &quot;You are to take all His Majesty's ships and vessels at present in Funchal under your command, hoisting your broad pennant in 'Pamone,' and . . . proceed without the loss of a moment to Gibraltar, there to block all exits from the Straits by any craft soever until further notice. And for so doing the enclosed order shall be your warrant.&quot;A! ! t the bottom of Keith's letter was a handwritten note from ! dear, dear Queenie, an important figure in Jack's youth and during his career, now married to Lord Keith: &quot;Dearest Jack -- I am so happy for you -- love -- Queenie.&quot;So the Chileans must develop their navy without the services of Captain Aubrey. And there will be no yellow admiral in the person of Lucky Jack Aubrey.Thus, with this pristine conclusion, I fear that we have seen the last chapter in the adventures of Captain Jack Aubrey, Royal Navy, and his loyal friend and invaluable companion Stephen Maturin. But O'Brian will be writing, that's for sure. And if his next work is another splendid biograpy, a fine story on another subject, short stories, whatever he writes will be a thrill for me to read."},{"Title":"The Yellow Admiral: Aubrey/Maturin Series, Book 18","review":"\\"The Yellow Admiral\\" is one of the less interesting of the Aubrey/Maturin series, although it has its merits. This novel takes place mainly on shore, and as usual, Jack Aubrey's life is more complicated and beset with more problems here than when he is at sea.The biggest problem in Aubrey's life is the probability of being \\"yellowed\\". The rank of an admiral in the Royal Navy is denoted by color. For example, an Admiral of the Blue has higher rank and responsibility than an Admiral of the White. In some cases, however, an officer is promoted to the rank of admiral for ceremonial purposes only, but is effectively decommissioned. When this happens, he is referred to as an Admiral of the Yellow, or one who is \\"yellowed\\". With Napoleon facing imminent defeat and peace on the horizon, Aubrey faces the strong prospect of himself being yellowed. To make matters worse, Aubrey opposes the enclosure movement in his district even after his commanding officer, Lord Stranraer, urges him to support it. And just when things could not get worse, Aubrey's wife discovers his old correspondence with a former mistress and throws him out of the house.Things are not going well for Stephen Maturin either, since he is isolated from his fortune and temporarily destitute. But in a rare turn of events, he appears to enjoy a tranquil domestic life with his tempestuous, capricious wife, Diana. In fact, it is a rare twist in this series to see Aubrey financially secure but romantically distraught while Maturin, for a change is emotionally contented, but utterly impoverished.If you are a fan of this series or a lover of history then you will enjoy this book. It has an enormous amount to teach us about life in England and in the British navy during the Napoleonic wars. However, if you read O'brian purely for his thrilling accounts of Napoleonic naval battles then this one probably won't do it for you. O'brian briefly takes us out on Patrol of the blockaded French coast and provides a wonderful description of the perilous navigation in the fog. However, even the brief naval engagements in this book are a little too mellow and hardly as thrilling as the others. Still worthwhile though."},{"Title":"The Yellow Admiral: Aubrey/Maturin Series, Book 18","review":"For those of us who have avidly followed the exploits and conversations of O'Brian's remarkable characters, &quot;The Yellow Admiral&quot;is a disappointment. Just as the Napoleonic wars have gone flat in this episode, so, too, has the world Aubrey and Maturin. For the firsttime I had the feeling that the author was uncertain where to take the tale. Perhaps the characters have now grown too much within themselvesand thus find very little that is fresh in their world. In any event, in this story the sheer joy of life and discovery, and the thrill ofcompetence that is theirs at sea, is gone, gone, gone. Sour elder middle-age seems to have taken their place.For those who have followed this series, of course, &quot;The Yellow Admiral&quot; is a must read. But were it not for the long association withthese characters, I would have found the book tedious, undirected, and boring."},{"Title":"The Yellow Admiral: Aubrey/Maturin Series, Book 18","review":"The most important aspects of this story takes place on dry land in England. Patrick O'Brien paints the tapestry of 19th century rural life in terms that makes it relevant to the story and breathes life into it that it becomes personalized and completely relevant. It also is this time ashore that makes the adventures at sea so much more interesting for Jack and Stephen. It is the complexity of the characters dealing with their successes and trials at home which make the two main characters seem that much more human. Developing characters that are seemingly real is what Patrick O'Brien has mastered like no other and it is what has kept me coming back to his books (18 times so far).Back ashore in England, Stephen is broke and Jack is once again an impecunious landowner. Jack's fortune is tied up in lawsuits related to his actions off West Africa suppressing the slave trade. To make matters worse (or more interesting), Jack's marriage is on the rocks as a result of Sophie's mother finding evidence of Jack's past infidelity. At the Admiralty, Jack's prospects are dimmed by his actions as a Member of Parliament and his opposition to the enclosure of a commons near his estate. As a side note, Patrick O'Brien clearly understands and has the ability to describe the political and economic aspects of enclosing a commons. He weaves this into the story without technical jargon and in an interesting manner. Even at sea, Jack has trouble. He captures a French privateer laden with gold and ivory, but the Admiralty believes that he ignored signals for personal gain. Troubles mount for Jack and his fear of being \`yellowed' seems that it might become a reality.When all seems lost for Jack, Stephen returns from a mission in France and back to England with forgiveness from Sophie and a reprieve for his career in the form of a possible mission to secure Chilean independence. This is especially important because the war has ended, further dimming prospects for his chance for an Admiral's flag. By the book's end, both Jack and Stephen see their personal fortunes somewhat or completely restored. And just as Jack is looking forward to this reprieve for his career, Jack is ordered to Gibraltar because Napoleon has escaped from Elba."},{"Title":"The Yellow Admiral: Aubrey/Maturin Series, Book 18","review":"Yes, it's true there is a bit more description of the rights of English landlords in the nineteenth century than I would have liked. There is less actual sailing than in previous books, so this volume doesn't have the sense of motion that O'Brian portrays so well. Yet this remains a fascinating book. True to form, O'Brian describes life in it's nitty-gritty detail, whether it's the horrendous personal violence of Bonden's boxing match, or the consequences of Jack's infidelity, yet the eloquence of his description and the sympathy for the characters that O'Brian evokes keeps the reader deeply involved. It's not as much of an adventure story as previous books, yet there is an agreeable sense of community and familiarity when all the characters are staying with one another on land. And of course the ending makes you want to read the next one immediately."},{"Title":"The Yellow Admiral: Aubrey/Maturin Series, Book 18","review":"This is the eighteenth in O'Brian's intelligent 20-volume naval series. True to form, the \\"Yellow Admiral\\" finds Captain Jack and sidekick Stephen Maturin on shore in England, where they have domestic troubles, win and lose their fortunes, and finally set to sea in the Bellona. Assigned to duty on the blockade of the French city of Brest, Jack Aubrey manages to capture a French privateer while Stephen carries out his usual intelligence activities after a nighttime landing in France. But peace breaks out. Napoleon is defeated on the continent and exiled to Elba, meaning that the British Navy will be demobilized and Jack's prospects for promotion to Rear Admiral are diminished. Just as Jack and Stephen are about to set sail for an intelligence mission in Chile, word comes that Napoleon is again on the loose.

But, however (as they say), there's a lot here for the faithful reader of the series -- mostly domestic, with Jack being caught in an old adultery, as he says, \\"without a leg to stand on,\\" but getting back with Sophie eventually. It's 1814, and with peace about to break out, Jack is very worried about his lack of a professional future, wholly expecting to be \\"yellowed\\" -- being made admiral in time but given no command -- having unfortunately crossed his admiral, whose nephew wants to enclose the common on Jack's manor.

Having read these fine books over a period of several years, I decided to evaluate their cumulative integrity by reading them consecutively in order of publication over a period of a few weeks. This turned out to be a rewarding enterprise. For readers unfamiliar with these books, they describe the experiences of a Royal Navy officer and his close friend and traveling companion, a naval surgeon. The experiences cover a broad swath of the Napoleonic Wars and virtually the whole globe.Rereading all the books confirmed that O'Brian is a superb writer and that his ability to evoke the past is outstanding. O'Brian has numerous gifts as a writer. He is the master of the long, careful description, and the short, telling episode. His ability to construct ingenious but creditable plots is first-rate, probably because he based much of the action of his books on actual events. For example, some of the episodes of Jack Aubrey's career are based on the life of the famous frigate captain, Lord Cochrane. O'Brian excels also in his depiction of characters. His ability to develop psychologically creditable characters through a combination of dialogue, comments by other characters, and description is tremendous. O'Brien's interest in psychology went well beyond normal character development, some books contain excellent case studies of anxiety, depression, and mania.Reading O'Brien gives vivid view of the early 19th century. The historian Bernard Bailyn, writing of colonial America, stated once that the 18th century world was not only pre-industrial but also pre-humanitarian (paraphrase). This is true as well for the early 19th century depicted by O'Brien. The casual and invariable presence of violence, brutality, and death is a theme running through all the books. The constant threats to life are the product not only of natural forces beyond human control, particularly the weather and disease, but also of relative human indifference to suffering. There is nothing particularly romantic about the world O'Brien describes but it also a certain grim grandeur. O'Brien also shows the somewhat transitional nature of the early 19th century. The British Navy and its vessals were the apogee of what could be achieved by pre-industrial technology. This is true both of the technology itself and the social organization needed to produce and use the massive sailing vessals. Aubrey's navy is an organization reflecting its society; an order based on deference, rigid hierarchy, primitive notions of honor, favoritism, and very, very corrupt. At the same time, it was one of the largest and most effective bureaucracies in human history to that time. The nature of service exacted great penalities for failure in a particularly environment, and great success was rewarded greatly. In some ways, it was a ruthless meritocracy whose structure and success anticipates the great expansion of government power and capacity seen in the rest of the 19th century.O'Brian is also the great writer about male friendship. There are important female characters in these books but since most of the action takes place at sea, male characters predominate. The friendship between Aubrey and Maturin is the central armature of the books and is a brilliant creation. The position of women in these books is ambiguous. There are sympathetic characters, notably Aubrey's long suffering wife. Other women figures, notably Maturin's wife, leave a less positive impression. On board ship, women tend to have a disruptive, even malign influence.How did O'Brian manage to sustain his achievement over 20 books? Beyond his technical abilities as a writer and the instrinsic interest of the subject, O'Brien made a series of very intelligent choices. He has not one but two major protagonists. The contrasting but equally interesting figures of Aubrey and Maturin allowed O'Brien to a particularly rich opportunity to expose different facets of character development and to vary plots carefully. This is quite difficult and I'm not aware of any other writer who has been able to accomplish such sustained development of two major protagonists for such a prolonged period. O'Brian's use of his historical setting is very creative. The scenes and events in the books literally span the whole globe as Aubrey and Maturin encounter numerous cultures and societies. The naval setting allowed him also to introduce numerous new and interesting characters. O'Brian was able to make his stories attractive to many audiences. Several of these stories can be enjoyed as psychological novels, as adventure stories, as suspense novels, and even one as a legal thriller. O'Brian was also a very funny writer, successful at both broad, low humor, and sophisticated wit. Finally, O'Brian made efforts to link some of the books together. While a number are complete in themselves, others form components of extended, multi-book narratives. Desolation Island, Fortune of War, and The Surgeon's Mate are one such grouping. Treason's Harbor, The Far Side of the World, and The Reverse of the Medal are another. The Letter of Marque and the ensuing 4 books, centered around a circumnavigation, are another.Though the average quality of the books is remarkably high, some are better than others. I suspect that different readers will have different favorites. I personally prefer some of the books with greater psychological elements. The first book, Master and Commander, is one of my favorites. The last 2 or 3, while good, are not as strong as earlier books. I suspect O'Brian's stream of invention was beginning to diminish. All can be read profitably as stand alone works though there is definitely something to be gained by reading in consecutive order."},{"Title":"The Yellow Admiral: Aubrey/Maturin Series, Book 18","review":"For the past 10 years I have been reading all the O'Brian - Jack Aubrey books. I enjoy them so much, I only read them during vacations so I can throw myself into them. I only have a couple of books left and after I am done, I will feel like a old friend has moved away. I really enjoyed \\"The Yellow Admiral\\" It only took a couple of sessions to read because I did not want to put it down. If you like this series, then you will like this book too."},{"Title":"The Yellow Admiral: Aubrey/Maturin Series, Book 18","review":"THE YELLOW ADMIRAL is the 18th book of the Aubrey-Maturin series by Richard Russ, who changed his name to Patrick O'Brian, perhaps to suggest a purely non-existent Irish origin and to hint at a more exotic background than his English heritage would provide. Many authors have written under noms de plume, but Russ's name change strikes me as devious and as an attempt to fool book buyers into believing the author hailed from a more intriguing background than was the actual case. Perhaps the fact that Russ abandoned wife and children (one of whom was dying of spina bifida) and moved only himself to London to do his writing has prejudiced me against him.But enough about the ethics of the author; what about this particular book? In a word, boring. The \\"action\\" begins on land, which is generally Russ/O'Brian's least interesting setting, and a great deal of the narrative focuses on Captain Aubrey's fear of being \\"yellowed,\\" that is, of being promoted to admiral but without being given a fleet to command, hence the reference to a non-existent \\"Yellow Fleet.\\"There is also quite a bit of discussion concerning the enclosing of commons, an act that Aubrey abhors but which the fleet admiral's relative supports. When Aubrey prevails in court and the petition to enclose the commons that lies within Aubrey's purview as \\"lord of the manor\\" is blocked, the admiral has little good to report about Aubrey's seafaring performance, which obviously reenforces his fear of being yellowed.The reader is in great hopes that the action may pick up when it becomes known that the government of Chile is interested in finding an experienced naval officer and warship to patrol its coast line. This would have to be done somewhat clandestinely inasmuch as the country could not ask England to provide such a service officially, so Aubrey is actually granted a unique leave of absence from the naval service and a promise of reinstatement with no loss of seniority when the mission is finished. Some actual excitement may be brewing, but, frustratingly, nothing comes of all of this scheming, as we see on the very last page of the book. Just as Aubrey is prepared to take his ship and sail for the Chilean coast, he is informed that Bonaparte has escaped from his exile on Elba and is ordered to blockade the French coast (again). Well, this development may prove exciting--but the book ends at this point. With some luck, this thread may resume in the next volume. We'll see.Not only is much of THE YELLOW ADMIRAL generally devoid of entertaining action, but it also shows signs of a decline in Russ/O'Brian's imagination through his re-use of phraseology from earlier volumes. At one point, he waxes philosophical and observes that nothing but a nine-inch plank separates Dr. Maturin from eternity (the sick bay being below the water line of the ship). This might actually be a remarkably good observation had it not appeared pretty much ver batim in an earlier volume, THE FAR SIDE OF THE WORLD.If one has collected the entire 21-volume set of Russ/O'Brian's seafaring novels featuring Jack Aubrey and Stephen Maturin, then THE YELLOW ADMIRAL is pretty much obligatory reading. However, if one is picking and choosing selected volumes for his reading pleasure, then I suggest that THE YELLOW ADMIRAL be among those bypassed. I cannot see any of Russ/O'Brian's works being considered of having lasting value, but this volume is of even less quality than the others I have read so far. If one seeks a really fine series of seafaring novels, look to C. S. Forester or, for shorter stories, to Joseph Conrad. Overall, Russ/O'Brian is somewhat better than mediocre--but not by much."},{"Title":"The Yellow Admiral: Aubrey/Maturin Series, Book 18","review":"&quot;The Yellow Admiral&quot;, the 18th novel in Patrick O'Brian's critically acclaimed Aubrey-Maturin saga, is one of those which are most closely akin to Jane Austen's riveting, elegant descriptions of British aristocratic society around the time of the Napoleonic wars. Here Aubrey must contend with a long-forgotten extramarital scandal which threatens his marriage to Sophie and a senior admiral who is displeased by Aubrey's opposition to enclosing lands with fences by the admiral's nephew, a wealthier landowner and neighbor of Aubrey's. Aubrey serves under the latter's command as his beloved Bellona joins the blockade fleet off the Normandy coast. Worst of all, with peace on the horizon as Napoleon suffers one crushing defeat after another on land, Aubrey fears that he will be &quot;yellowed&quot;, promoted to admiral without command of a squadron or fleet. Meanwhile Maturin returns from a secret mission on the continent, bearing news which may restore his old friend's military fortunes. And, at the very end, not only is Aubrey reconciled to Sophie, but he receives news of Napoleon's escape from the Italian island of Elba, and reinstatement of his temporary rank of commodore, in command of a small frigate squadron near Gibraltar."},{"Title":"The Yellow Admiral: Aubrey/Maturin Series, Book 18","review":"Aubrey &amp; Maturin will always be worth reading, butthis series is definitely getting tired.

But I really think that any series of books, in order to be truely successful, must be built of volumns that can stand alone. Certainly any of Bernard Cornwell's Richard Sharpe series contains enough exposition and general background material that a reader is not required to have read all the other books in order to enjoy it. I'm not sure the same is true here.

Nothing much takes place during the story, and what little as does, takes place offstage, as it were. Characters and events are introduced that lead no where and serve no purpose other than to fill the page. While the real world is often like that, works of art are not the real world, and novels are not documentaries. I was grossly disappointed in this book, as I had read such wonderful things about this series, and I will give O'Brian another chance, but I did not find any charcters other than Aubrey and Maturin to be given any definition, and their characters were more described than shown.

If you are interesting in learning a little about theology, I would read this book."},{"Title":"Theology and sanity","review":"Sheed lost me near the beginning of the book, when he defined sanity as &quot;seeing things the way the Church does.&quot; The entire book is an explanation of how the Church sees things - a kindly explanation, to be sure, but backed by the assumption that the reader needs to understand and accept these explanations to be &quot;sane.&quot;Add a little temporal power, change the name of the institution to &quot;the Soviet Union,&quot; and you have the recipe for a story like Alexandr Solzhenitsyn's &quot;Cancer Ward,&quot; in which anyone who dissents is automatically assumed insane with dire consequences.I kept returning to the book, because the prior reviews speak so highly of it and because I am interested in both sanity and theology (I almost wonder whether I read the same book). But the author repelled me, despite his friendly tone; he assumes that Catholics have nothing to learn from other religions, and he states that in spite of the large number of corrupt popes, the Church has never taught anything false. I wonder what he would make of John Paul II's apologies to the Jewish people.This is kindly authoritarian Catholicism: &quot;the Church is right, submit to it.&quot; It's not unthinking, because Sheed is very interested in people thinking well. But I think today's freedom of denominational movement would perplex him: this book works well for Catholics who are born into it and for whom the option of leaving the Church is unthinkable. For today's Catholics, many of whom returned after experiments in evangelism, eastern religions or paganism, it's probably pretty unhelpful.Since Vatican II, the Church's position has been more authoritative than authoritarian: &quot;here is why the Church's teaching is correct.&quot; I find this mode much more interesting and helpful than the authoritarian one; I would give John Paul II's encyclicals, particularly Fide et Ratio and Veritatis Splendor, as excellent examples."},{"Title":"Theology and sanity","review":"Mr. Sheed proves once again that he is an educator and theologian par excellence. This work is a more detailed and in depth version of &quot;Theology for Beginners&quot; but a must read even for those who have read the &quot;lighter&quot; version. In fact start with &quot;Theology for Beginners&quot; and then read &quot;Theology and Sanity.&quot;I have read innumerable books on theology with an emphasis, but not exclusivity, on christianity. And this book explains with clear and beautiful reasoning the christian faith. You will not find a clearer yet amazingly comprehensive explaination of the Holy Trinity. If you think the 'triangle analogy' is a good model, you will forever look back on it as a simple 2-dimensional representation, with usefullness to be sure, but without life. Mr. Sheed brings the Trinity to Life!Ever wondered how Christians have come to believe in Heaven, Hell, Angels and the Devil through scripture? Ever doubted that you could come to a rational belief of those concepts using logic, through combining philosophy and theology? Rejoice becuase Mr. Sheed reconciles both of those for you, beautifully and clearly.By the end of this book you will understand why viewing life without a belief in God is insanity and why believing in God is having clear and sane thought. Do yourself, your soul and your spirit a favor. Read this man's works."},{"Title":"Theology and sanity","review":"In an age where philosophy, academia, and society hold religious belief as subrational, Frank Sheed shines as a beacon for those who desire to begin the grave and joyous journey of reconciling faith with reason. His explainations of Catholic theology and the metaphysical realities it upholds prove to be some of the clearest of our time. His explaination of how those realities are translated into practical application,(morality), prove equally lucid. His embarkation into the mystery of the Holy Trinity leaves one with much to meditate upon. I highly recommend this book for anyone seeking to understand their Catholic faith. Only a minimum understanding of the Catholic faith is required to follow the author through some of the most complex teachings of the Church. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Theology and sanity","review":"Sheed does a fine job here of concisely presenting the entire Catholic worldview in a single volume. His explanation of difficult philosophical and theological concepts (i.e. the Trinity) is done in a manner that can be easily understood by those with less expertise in these areas. This book is really a valuable piece, and should be on the bookshelves and in the minds of all Catholics."},{"Title":"Theology and sanity","review":"Unlike the previous reviewer, Sheed never lost me, in the beginning or anywhere else. This is, admittedly, the Catholic view of the universe and I don't think Sheed intended it to be anything else. As such, it is much more an exposition and explanation of that view than a defense against various competing views, although there is some of that. So, if you are looking for defenses of the Catholic Christian faith against Buddhism, Islam, Judaism or even specifically contrasted to some Protestant beliefs, you won't find it done here explicitly. If you are a Catholic or are interested in learning more about how this magnificent religion views God and creation, there is no finer introductory work (although Sheed's Theology for Beginners is on the same par as Theology and Sanity, just shorter). I have now read four of Sheed's works and intend to read everything of his I can get my hands on. Two other points: 1. For the Catholic Church's thoughts on other religions, see the Catechism or the Pope's speech Dialogue with Great World Religions on May 19, 1999, or his Encyclical Fides et Ratio for starters, all available on-line. 2. For books on the Catholic argument for the teaching authority of the Church see Jesus, Peter, and the Keys, among many others."},{"Title":"Theology and sanity","review":"I am a professor of theology at a Catholic university, and I find myself going back to Frank Sheed for help in expressing the depths of the faith in accessible language.

Absolutely the best intro to Theology for highschool ages and up."},{"Title":"Theology and sanity","review":"Ever wondered what catholics really believe? Why they havesome strange views &amp; practices? Written by a field-testedapologist, Theology and Sanity sets out in layman's terms a marvellously clear view of catholic theology.

Sheed's lucid descriptions are exceeded only by his wonderful prose. Highly recommended to both catholics and non-catholics. Companion volume: Society and Sanity -- an equally well-written exposition of catholic anthropology and sociology. Will be seen by some as somewhat dated, the core truths nevethless shine forth brilliantly."},{"Title":"Theology and sanity","review":"Well, ok, unless you want to go to the real compendium of the Catholic Faith: The Summa Theologica of Saint Thomas Aquinas. Otherwise, this is it. Look no further. Sheed's Theology and Sanity is a masterful, deep yet accessible summary of the mystery of creation, its fall and redemption by the Divine Redeemer.The book covers all the essential aspects of the Catholic Faith and it makes for one of the best Adult Catechisms, Chistian Apologetics and theology books ever written. The reason for its greatness is that this is a book written with the love of a man of great faith and born out of love. Every sentence in the book was tested over 50 years of street corner preaching by its author to crowds not always in agreement with him. And this is the key to this book's clarity: it has been tested by time, the love of its author for the True Faith and his genuine desire to help others make sense out of the Catholic Faith and man's long relationship with God. In reading the book one finds the Faith as beautiful and merciful as the author himself obviously did.Some of the concepts such as the doctrine of the Trinity are difficult to grasp, but their study is by no means impossible and remain enormously rewarding to the mind. If you have never taken theology or philosophy before you may want to start with Theology for Beginners, also by Sheed; otherwise, look no further than this book. Like many reviewers, I had not covered 3 chapters before I decided to read it a second time as soon as finished in order to drink deeper from this fountain of Truth. How much better would the Church be if this book was more widely used in Seminaries, Universities and Schools!Those who upon reading this book find it \\"authoritarian\\", as some reviewers do, miss the point and prove their \\"insanity\\": Sheed properly sets Truth before \\"charity\\", as his concern is with explaining the mystery of the True Faith the way it is, come what may; thereby showing objective sanity, rather than subjective insanity (i.e. making the world an image of one's subjective self) -- This is not another experiment in a zoo of faiths. This is intellect seeking understanding and illumined by Faith above all. It is precisely that understanding that gives intellect its sanity, and it is that grandiose vision and comprehension that is the seed of all love. How can we love what we do not understand? It should be noted that in the Trinity, the Spirit (Love) proceeds from the Son (Word - Truth) and not the other way round. To set charity before Truth is to reverse and falsify the Trinity, and falsity belongs not to God but to the father of lies. We live in insane times. In times where man sacrifices truth every day to a false sense of \\"tolerance\\" for error and calls this \\"love\\". Charity requires Truth in order to be truly Love, and one can hardly love his fellow man if he is not truthful to him.

It has the clearest explanation of the Trinity that i have ever read.I guarantee that you will not be dissapointed with this purchase."},{"Title":"Theology and sanity","review":"Frank Sheed's \\"Theology and Sanity\\" is a classic work of Catholic apologetics. The book is a distillation of core Catholic teaching, which comes down to actions of three beings(God, Adam, and Jesus) and four events (Creation, the Fall, Redemption, and Judgement), and the implications that these beings and actions have on Catholics' perception of reality. Sheed believes that without understanding the basic theology behind these beings and actions, that individuals have a limited ability to make sane decisions, because they are not making decisions based on the full reality of life.The chapters in which he defines the Trinity, are worth the proice of the book alone; never have I have such a full comprehension of this doctrine or understood the smenatics implied when Christians pray and invoke any or all of the three Persons. His chapters on Christ ignited in me a greater desire to read all that is written about Jesus, as well as made me more sensitive to dynamics behind his actions in the Bible.The book is written in a style that is simple and accessible, yet still erudite. I recommend this book to all Catholics who want to understand better the concepts with which they grew up. All Christians may benefit from reading the book as a whole, but I don't think it is the type of book to convert people who are opposed to Catholic teaching. Sheed uses scripture extensively to support dotrine presented in some chapters but does not implement this approach with all chapters, which might lead people who are not familiar with the history of the teachings presented to question \\"where in the Bible it says that,\\" though all doctrines are supported by the Bible, this is not a Bible study (but Sheed recommends that people reading the bok combine its study with a simultaneous study of the Gospels). It is a summary of Catholic beliefs about main events and actors in the history of the Christian Church. There is less stress on proving that the beliefs are valid, and a greater emphasis is on articulating the basic interpretation."},{"Title":"Theology and sanity","review":"Frank Sheed, in his wonderful volume THEOLOGY AND SANITY, writes at length upon theological topics which are meant to make a man see the world through the eyes of the Church. Various topics, such as the nature of the Trinity and the Fall of Man, are wonderfully discussed in a few short pages.Frank Sheed writes in his simplistic style that does not water-down Catholic theology, nor does it present it as something incomprehensible to untrained theologians.

Sheed does a great job showing how the world's perspective has invaded our minds willingly or unwillingly and if we desire to grow in our faith we must not only have a Catholic will but also a Catholic intellect. The \\"both and\\" theme that is a common theme in theology is implied and put to practical use in this book. Most Catholics in the pews and unfortunately even in the pulpits are not always expressing an authentic Catholic perspective on the Church's teachings because of a combination of ignorance,sloth and weak faith. I am one of these slothful catholics that can attest to this reality that we need to hunger and thirst to truly know and love our Holy Mother Church as she reveals to us the infinite love of God. Although God has given us all of these lights and \\"graces to know Him and love Him we have not sought Him or meditated on the realities He reveals to us through His beloved Bride. Reading this book has deepened my love and knowledge of God as I try to meditate on trying to see the world through the eyes of Holy Mother Church.

In the author's own words this is a book about seeing the universe the way the Church sees it because that is reality, and seeing reality is sanity. Seeing the world in any other way is not reality, and therefore insane. As a very early example Sheed writes,\\"...she [the Church] sees all things whatsoever held in existence from moment to moment by nothing but the continuing will of God that they should not cease to be. When she sees anything at all, in the same act she sees God holding it in existence. Do we? It is not merely a matter of knowing that this is so. Do we actually see it so? If we do not, then we are not living mentally in the same world as the Church. What is more, we are not seeing things as they are, for that is how they are.\\"Sheed's writing has a very academic tone to it. In fact he states up front that he is writing about the intellect, not the will. He is clear that salvation depends directly on the will, not the intellect, but at the same time he emphasizes that neglecting the intellect is to our own great disadvantage. In Sheed's own words,\\"But knowledge of the truth matters all the same. It matters for the reason we have already stated, namely, that every new thing known about God is a new reason for loving Him. It matters also...[because] in the appallingly difficult struggle to be good, the will is helped immeasurably by the intellect's clear vision of the real Universe.\\"and,\\"After all, the man who uses his intellect in religion is using it to see what is there. But the alternative to seeing what is there is either not seeing what is there, and this is darkness; or seeing what is not there, and this is error, derangement, a kind of double darkness. And it is unthinkable that darkness whether double or single should be preferred to light.\\"The academic tone to the book will definitely appeal to those who are more intellectually oriented, but the book is much more than pure academics. Sheed spent many years as a street minister and this comes through in the book, making each point hit home personally in one's own life.The book is written in three main parts: God, Creation, and Oneself. And within these three sections the author covers the whole gamut of the Catholic faith including: Thomistic proofs of God's existence, the mystery of the Trinity, God's creation of man, God's personal relationship with man, the life of Jesus Christ, the Church as the body of Christ, the sacraments, the human condition as viewed by the Church, heaven, angels, sanctifying grace, and so much more. In short it is an exceptionally good overview of what the Catholic church is about and how it sees the world.There are a few things one might want to be aware of before choosing or starting to read this book. First, as I've already mentioned, sometimes Sheed's writing, can have an academic air about it that might turn some people off. Many will appreciate the academic tone, but Sheed's passion for the intellect may at times be a little overbearing and rub some people the wrong way. If this is the case for you, try not to let it distract you too much. What Sheed has to say is excellent regardless.In the same way, with Sheed's passion for the intellect, sometimes his writing is not the easiest to read. For the most part his writing is very clear, but sometimes it can be just a little difficult to follow. I mention this simply because I would hate to see someone start the book and then stop reading it because it was more difficult to read than they expected. It is better to know up front that it might be a little difficult in spots, and be determined to push through it, than to give up entirely.Finally, the book was written in 1946 and updated in 1978, so some things may feel a bit dated. Again, I point this out simply so that one does not begin the book only to give up on it because it \\"sounds too old.\\" On the whole, everything Sheed has to say is just as relevant now as it was then.In summary, through a mix of theology and ministry this book provides an exceptionally good overview of how the Catholic church sees the world and what that means for us in our personal lives."},{"Title":"Theology and sanity","review":"This book provides wonderful insights into what Catholics believe, with supporting arguments and justification. If you have ever been at a loss to explain your faith, you should read this book. It's written for lay people, not religious scholars, so it's pretty easy to understand."},{"Title":"Theology and sanity","review":"This book opened my eyes to things I had thought about or pondered for over a decade. Multiple issues were presented concisely, simply, informatively, and in depth, all at the same time: Amazing! It is not dumbed dowm material but it an easy read simply because you get so into the book, as you would a good novel. If you think you know your faith, read this and learn you know very little (the section on the TRINITY ALONE IS WORTH IT)If you know little about your faith, this will teach and bolster a new love for the faith and drive you to want to learn move. Simply one of the greatest books ever to grace my desk."},{"Title":"Theology and sanity","review":"FRANK SHEED'S BOOK IS HEAVY READING AND A GREAT STUDY ON THEOLOGICAL MATTERS OF SUPREME IMPORTANCE SELDOM EXPOSED AND CONTEMPLATED.

It was later republished by Ignatius Press and remains one of the most essential and unforgetable Catholic books in America.He talks greatly about free will, the creation of Man, the test of Angels and Men, the difference between free will and predestination (the Protestant Calvinist notion), the Sacrifice of the Mass, and more importantly---WHO IS GOD?I love it because it is a great in depth book of understanding Catholic Theology. The Scripture quotations are from the Douay Rheims Bible and the Revised Standard Version: Catholic Edition.I recommend this book for all Catholics and non-Catholics as well. It was one of the best textbooks I used for catechism class in my parish church."},{"Title":"Theology and sanity","review":"This is the most comprehensive overview I have read regarding the overall Catholic philosophy. If you are not Catholic, you may be offended by the basic assertion that the Catholic view of the cosmos is the sane view.

For this purpose, this book is even better than the Catechism."},{"Title":"Theology and sanity","review":"Frank Sheed will coax you along to have a much clearer understanding of where you are in relation to God, and what is known about the mystery of that relationship."},{"Title":"Theology and sanity","review":"Excellent, reasoned defense of Christianity and the Catholic faith.

Let me add only that this is probably among the best five books I have ever read in my 66 years on earth. I read a lot, usually between six and eight books a month since I was in my early teens. Sheen was a post-Vatican II layman before his time. He wrote Theology and Sanity in 1946, back when many thought that only the clergy were sufficiently instructed to write intelligently about theology. If you are Catholic, this book will strengthen your faith and inform you concerning many things you don't yet know(unless, of course, you are already a theologian). If you are Protestant, it will make you want to explore those aspects of Christ's teachings subtracted from the whole by 16th century revolutionists. If you are a non-believer, the book will make you decidedly uncomfortable, but you of all people should read it for that very reason."},{"Title":"Theology and sanity","review":"This was a wonderful book; one that I needed to read given my questions concerning God and His role in our lives. I also needed to read this book to determine how it is that the Church continues to spread the word of God given that the Church is organized and run by man. Man, inherently, because of the fall of Adam, is prone to sin. So how is it that the Church, run by man, who is prone to sin, can be the one organization to espouse the \\"truth\\" of God and His Son, Jesus?The first aspect of this book that I really enjoyed was that Father Sheed takes some very complicated topics and puts them into plain English so that the lay person can understand them. Father Sheed's explanation of the trinity, one of the most complicated aspects of the Catholic Religion (in my opinion), was explained in a most wonderful way. It was explained so that I could understand it and without all the \\"religious\\" terminology that usually accompanies such explanations.The second aspect of the book that I enjoyed was the organization. He takes these issues from step one and then logically continues with the book up to the end. He takes the prior steps and incorporates them into later steps and wonderfully demonstrates how they all fit together.The third aspect of this book I loved was the explanation of why Jesus \\"lowered\\" himself to human form. Father Sheed had a wonderful way of explaining why is it was that Jesus came to do what he did. He ties this in with the fall of Adam and how the fall of Adam severed our relationship with God. Father Sheed also explains what \\"original sin\\" is and why we have it. It is not that the person born has sinned but has the sin of Adam just because we are human. Because of the fall, man was severed with God but Jesus came to \\"bridge\\" that gap and that is what he did.Do not get the idea that the \\"sanity\\" part of the book title means that if you don't live the Catholic Way perfectly that one is insane. This is not what that term means in the context of the book. Sanity means seeing the world as it really is; not deceiving ourselves that the world is differnt that it really is. If we can do that, then we are seeing things correctly and have \\"sanity\\". However, not seeing the world and God as they truly are does not mean you are insane, in the mental aspect of the word. Father Sheed gives us a good idea what it means to not see things as they really are and how to change that in our lives.This is a wonderful book. However, this did take me a long time to read. Father Sheed has much to say and it is all something that you must think about to fully understand what he is saying. You cannot read this book like a fiction novel; you can't or you will miss much of what Fr. Sheed is saying. It will take time but the time is well worth it.I have already purchased two more of Fr. Sheed's books and I look forward to reading them.If you have an interest in learning more about the Catholic, or even just the Christian faith in plain English, then I cannot recommend this book highly enough. It certainly has helped me along in my own search on God and the role He plays in our lives.Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Theology and sanity","review":"Helps one discern what \\"is\\" is. Bill Clinton needs to read this along with most of our university professors."},{"Title":"Theology and sanity","review":"Haven't finished the whole thing quite yet, but I'm very impressed by the book! It takes a very logical approach through theology and attends to many vital fundamental issues. If I could make one criticism, it's that Sheed seems to assume a certain amount of theological background at some times, but then later proceeds to discuss (in detail) things that such a background would presumably already contain. That's nit-picking to the max, though.Once again: great read, great theology, great stuff overall. While I'm reading it, I feel like every qualm I have is addressed and resolved almost immediately.Would recommend to anyone!"},{"Title":"Trigonometry for College Students","review":"Traditionally located after functions and before calculus, trigonometry combines elementary proofs with everyday applications. Smith follows this mold, but breaks step in a very positive manner. The conventional wisdom has been to consider the trigonometric functions to be the ratios of the sides of a right triangle first, and then generalize. In this case the general functions are followed by the special cases, and it works.The functions are defined as coordinates on the unit circle and then it is on to the consequences of the definitions. Several obvious identities are immediately presented with proofs, reinforcing the functional approach to trigonometry, as well as introducing the concept of proof. After graphing and additional proofs of identities, the inverse functions are defined. Only then does right angle trigonometry make an appearance. The book closes with complex numbers, polar curves, and conic sections, with much of it being labeled as optional.As is the case with books of this type, the majority of the problems are standard issue. However, some of them show a great deal of creativity. For example, if you wish to understand the path of Luke Skywalker's fighter as it attacks the Death Star, turn to page 207. And if you need to know how far Mr. T. must throw his grappling hook to catch the top of the building so that he can climb up and stomp the bad guys, turn to page 208. Such problems add spice to the text that will delight all readers with a touch of youth in their hearts.All chapters end with a list of chapter objectives, key terms, summary problems, and an application for further study. There is an occasional historical note about certain topics and solutions to all odd problems appear at the back of the book. A calculator is required to do the majority of computational style problems.There are some areas that are poorly done. The inverse trigonometric functions are poorly presented as the restricted graphs of the functions appear after the definitions. It would have been much clearer if the presentation had been more simultaneous. In the preface a technique called framing is introduced, being described as innovative and unique. Actually, it is nothing that the typical teacher of this material will fail to recognize. The taking of one cycle of the function and repeating it after suitable alterations is a standard way of presenting the periodic nature of trigonometry .However, these weaknesses are in no way fatal, and this book is an excellent option for anyone looking for a textbook of trigonometry with the right mix of functions, proofs, and applications to everyday situations.There is additional material for this book:. An answer book for all problems;. EXPTEST Question bank for IBM compatible computers;. Instructor's manual;. Solutions and study guide;. Trigpak, a computerized tutorial for IBM compatible computers.Published in Journal of Recreational Mathematics, reprinted with permission."},{"Title":"Trigonometry for College Students","review":"I bought a copy of this on the strength of the other reviews, and was rather disappointed. I found the presentation at times unclear, as in the presentation of the unit circle definition of trig functions: it was never explained why it has this name, or how it differs from the ratio definitions. (The answer that the unit circle def. uses angles in a circle with a radius of one: this is good for following the functions around the circle and noting how the sign changes. The ratio definitions are based on right triangles, and enable one to use the Pythagorean theorem to calculate missing parts, like the hypotenuse length from the x and y coordinates. I rapidly figured this out with the help of Wikipedia, but if Wikipedia is better than your textbook, you have a problem.)Some things in the book are just eccentric, like the explanation of the exact values of basic trig functions on the basis of not-very-relevant triangle geometry, e.g., proving the ratios of a 45 degree angle on the basis of its being a right angle with two equal sides (both of these are equal to each other, hence \\"one,\\" and the hypotenuse ends up being the square root of 2) That's actually pretty cool stuff, but not what you want to throw into the mix in the initial presentation of the basics: except maybe in a footnote or an appendix.The beginning student will have his hands full memorizing the standard angle ratios, and getting the basics of how to use the Pyth. formula and the calculator.Radian measure, which no one seems able to explain helpfully, is not clarified in this book.I used this text for review after I had gone through McKeague's very superior book, and it was OK if you already knew the material, but I think you'd be well puzzled if you tried to learn trig on your own from this book."},{"Title":"Trigonometry for College Students","review":"It has been some years now since I used Karl Smith's textbook (5th ed.) but I have very positive memories of it. I discovered that this text was very thoughtful and appropriate for a college course in trigonometry or even for an advanced high school class of motivated students. For one thing, the writing was clear and mathematically correct plus it was extremely readable.I found that the book's exercises involved modern applications along with diagrams that helped my thinking processes as a student. Even though there were many contemporary problems in the text, I do recall they were nicely balanced off by enough exercises that also exposed students to the historical applications of trigonometry.There was a section on disproving identities which was a very positive and appealing feature because it exposed readers and students to the concept of counterexamples.Finally, Smith's book had an extremely complete presentation on polar curves which raised this text above many of its contemporaries and made it worthy for use in any college level course in trigonometry. I highly recommend Smith's text and I'm sure he has carried over his book's strong features to subsequent editions."},{"Title":"Seeing is believing (Pocket book)","review":"Carter Dickson, also known as John Dickson Carr wrote the best mysteries especially of locked rooms and totally unexplainable mysteries.His books (all of them I might add) are books you simply cannot putdown once you begin a read. This book was published first in 1941.In my estimation mysteries that were written in the 1800's and early tomid 1900's were far, far superior to any mysteries written today andI think that also includes other fiction and non fiction."},{"Title":"Seeing is believing (Pocket book)","review":"First Carter Dickson book I read, back in fifth grade or so, maybe sixth, and it was a pip! However re-reading it I'm like, duh, it isn't that good after all.Well, what's good about it? As usual, the spooky, creepy atmosphere Carter Dickson (pen name for John Dickson Carr) could evoke at the drop of a hat. He can build it up so that you fairly scream at the end of a chapter, and a lot of the writing in SEEING IS BELIEVING is very effective. This is the book in which a stage hypnotist elects to entertain a house party with his celebrated vaudeville act, persuading suggestible Vicky Fane to try to kill her husband, who stands by like an idiot, with her choice of revolver or dagger. Dr Rich, the hypnotist (a sympathetic portrayal of a figure often written as a charlatan in the Golden Age literature) has substituted a rubber dagger that couldn't hurt a fly for the real thing, and yet when Vicky thrusts the dagger into her husband's heart it is discovered that someone invisible has switched the daggers yet again, and Arthur Fane lies dead on the floor in a circle of lamplight.Afterwards, to shut her up, the killer tries to give poor Vicky a severe case of lockjaw (tetanus) with the pin that her girlfriend has poked into her as a test to see if she was really \\"out\\" during the hypnosis or was she just faking.I have to say that, when the revelations finally came at the end of the book, Carter Dickson cheated like crazy. Could Dr. Rich's celebrated stage act be timed within seconds as Sir Henry Merrivale asserts? It had to be, otherwise the killer couldn't have proceeded with Plan A, but it's extremely unbelievable. And the killer had forty seconds to make everything work. Ridiculous. Plus, we find out that (a la Hitchcock's STAGE FRIGHT) the narration contains two basic lies, one in each of the first two paragraphs, and that is definitely not fair play.Finally, the heroine, Vicky's girlfriend Ann Browning, is one of Carr's most unappealing and nasty female characters. Usually his women characters are feisty, and bawdy, often in a way Jay-Z would approve of. Here, Ann is a drip who for some reason keeps unaccountably silent when a man tries to molest her. She's severely neurotic, and Phil Courtney, the hero, deserves better. I'm talking as if these were real people which I suppose is some kind of tribute to their creator. Remember Martha Vickers in THE BIG SLEEP? That's what she's like. Blonde poison!"},{"Title":"The Most Valuable Asset of the Reich: A History of the German National Railway Volume 2, 1933-1945","review":"Alfred C. Mierzejweski, a university professor in Alabama, has attempted to write a political and economic history of the Reichsbahn (German National Railway) during the Third Reich. Although the book is impeccably researched, it is written in a very dry, academic style and too narrowly focused. The first chapter, on the initial \\"coordination\\" of the Reichsbahn by the Nazis when they came to power, is painful to read. The book has only 164 pages of actual text and most of this focuses on high-level bureaucratic and organizational issues, rather than the actual operations of the railway.For those readers who hope to learn more about the Reichsbahn's role in supporting German military operations in the Second World War, the book is far too general and thus a disappointment. Although there are some useful statistics, many are too arcane - like the number of daily car placings or tons/kilometer - to be of real use to military historians. Mierzejweski does have a sub-chapter on the railways role in the invasion of the USSR in 1941, but there is little new information included. I was particularly interested in learning more about the Eisenbahn railroad repair units, but they are only mentioned in passing. Incredibly, there is no detailed discussion of the re-gauging issue in the occupied Soviet areas or how the supply difficulties contributed to the German defeat. Instead, the \\"winter crisis of 1941/2\\" is discussed more in terms of general statistics and leadership changes. However the author does convincingly demonstrate that the Reichsbahn was ignored in Hitler's war plans and was starved for resources, like steel and labor.It is also clear that the Reichsbahn did poorly in the political in-fighting prevalent in the Third Reich. The over-age Reichsbahn leadership seemed more intent on maintaining organizational autonomy and balancing their financial budget than either fighting for resources or evaluating how the Third Reich was using their trains. This is particularly evident in regard to the Holocaust. Mierzejweski clearly shows that the upper leadership of the Reichsbahn was aware of the death camps and their own role in transporting the Nazi's victims. However, since the total number of cars required for the Holocaust was less than 5% of the total available and hence a small burden on the Reichsbahn, the railroad leadership ignored the moral issues. Significantly, Mierzejweski points out that only two Reichsbahn officials involved with transporting victims to the death camps asked to be re-assigned to other jobs (with no negative repercussions).As a history, this book only succeeds on the organizational level. There are very few photos and only a handful of inadequate maps. There are too many useless statistics - like Reichsbahn financial information or investments - and not enough crucial information - like the number of trains lost due to military action, or produced each year as replacements. This book lays a solid foundation for understanding the subject, but then unfortunately builds very little atop it. The book is certainly not worth the price of admission."},{"Title":"The Most Valuable Asset of the Reich: A History of the German National Railway Volume 2, 1933-1945","review":"Mierzejewski has done a thorough job of documenting the Deutsche Reichsbahn's struggles with and acceptance of the National Socialists and World War II. Mierzejewski provides valuable insights into the railway's management and operations, but through that also provides a look at the inner workings of Nazi Germany.Most foreigners are unaware of the many contradictions in German policies and the compromises made on a daily basis. This book is best read by someone who has either an interest in transportation management or modern German history. It should be in the library of any English-reading person who has those interests.A weak point, as in the previous book in this series, is that it would have helped to have more and detailed maps. The lands that Hitler lost in the East are unfamiliar to most Western readers of English language books.It also has little about operations in the chaos at the very end of the war. This would have required oral histories and military files that are not in the same collections otherwise researched by Mierzejewski. That the accounting data for FY 1944 is only \\"preliminary\\" is one symptom of the uproar at the end of the line."},{"Title":"Artemisia Gentileschi and the Authority of Art: Critical Reading and Catalogue Raisonne","review":"I saw the pre published text and met with the author.

The series provides classic texts with commentaries by scholars who are expert in the field. Adriaan Peperzak is certainly one of the best Levinas scholars around, and this book gives us a good introduction to, and superb commentary on, Levinas' essay, &quot;Philosophy and the Idea of Infinity&quot;.Having said that, it is certainly true that this book is not the place to start if you are approaching Levinas for the first time. In that case, the best place to start is the collection of Philippe Nemo's interviews with Levinas, gathered under the title &quot;Ethics and Infinity.&quot; This is quite accessible to the educated reader. This might then be followed up with Colin Davis' genuinely introductory book on Levinas.After some such background, then the reader should be ready to take up Peperzak's commentary here. At this stage it is very good to have a guide like Peperzak to lead you through the difficult nuances and reference points of so complex a thinker as Levinas. &quot;Philosophy and the Idea of Infinity&quot; is a kind of summary of Levinas' philosophy, but it is not easy going. Peperzak helps you see what you would have missed on your own.I highly recommend this book, as well as the series as a whole. Levinas is a difficult, but very rewarding thinker--one of those who has the power to change your whole outlook on life."},{"Title":"To the Other An Introduction to the Philosophy of Emmanuel Levinas","review":"This book is of great importance to me - Peperzak addresses many nuances in Levinas' thought I wouldn't find myself. However there is a catch: the language used by Peperzak is quite difficult to understand and get through. I don't mean the depth of thought, metaphorical language or anything like that. It's just Peperzak's English which is quite crude and rough. I highly doubt this book had a good proof reading it really deserves. Maybe it's just me, since I'm not English native speaker, but if you're feeling you English skills are not good, you may be disappointed after buying this book.P.S.

Her writing style is such that either you like her or you can't relate. She says at the beginning of the book that you need to read it nine times to understand it. I plan to do just that because I like reading her words just that much. Read the pages online before you put out the cash for this book but if you find that you can relate you won't be sorry for adding her to your library."},{"Title":"Mechthild of Magdeburg: The Flowing Light of the Godhead (Classics of Western Spirituality)","review":"Metchild of Magdeburg was a beguine, a member of a lay group of women who in the medieval period desired a closer relationship with God than through the Church.The beguines produced many famous male and female mystics, especially female mystics. This was possibly because beguines were more loosely associated with the established church and had more freedom to express their mystical ideas.Metchild is a mystic of love, in the sense her mystical experiences were strongly focused around the intimate union of the soul with Jesus. Metchild describes several estatic experiences of this union in poems and other writing, as well as the stages leading to this state of conciousness. At times the language seems erotic, though Metchild never degrades the mystical union to mere pornography. She is clearly a literature woman, and like other mystics of loving union, often borrows motifs from the secular literature of the time.Metchild is somewhat more careful in her use of language than the burned heretic, Margaret Porete. While perhaps the theologically orthodox still might have many misgivings about the possibility of uniting with God mystically, I feel with Metchild we are on fairly safe ground, and anyone interested in Christian spirituality can learn from her. She is also a valuable female voice in a tradition in the Church which like so many others, has historically been mainly the domain of men. Women will find it refreshing the female perspective on mysticism is given quite well in Porete."},{"Title":"Mechthild of Magdeburg: The Flowing Light of the Godhead (Classics of Western Spirituality)","review":"To know God as God knows us.

In her early 20's she left her comfortable life for that of a Beguine. When she was in her 40's she decided to write down what she had received. Mechtild use the genres that were familiar to her - courtly love poetry and prose. As a Beguine she was seeking to live the way of the early Church.Although Mechtild maintained a Catholic world view regarding the fate of pagans, the place of Jews and role of the Saints, she also felt compelled to criticise the lack of spiritual hunger and corruption in the Church, and in the world. Her writings brought her under suspicion and criticism from the Church.Mechtild revealed the basis for detachment, the concept of the ground of the soul, the idea of the Mother God, the truth regarding transcending sin, the reality of the immanence of God and the importance of visions/dream as communications from God.

It is foremost a book about spiritual discovery, and secondly a travel log on one of the world's most outback religious regions. Andrew Harvey, born in southern India and educated at Oxford, England, read all he could on different Buddhist traditions but decided to leave Oxford and return to India for one year to study Buddhism in its original form. This ultimately lead him to Ladakh, one of the last places on earth &quot;where a Tibetan Buddhist society can be experienced&quot;.The first part of the book is Harvey's travel journal through Ladakh. A group of my fellow sojourners plowed through the first hundred pages and finally put the book down. Comments such as &quot;I lost interest&quot; and &quot;dull&quot; were mentioned, however the book's value and true worth happens in the second half, when Harvey meets the Rinpoche (&quot;master&quot;, &quot;realized soul&quot;, &quot;Buddha&quot;). It is here, when Harvey records the wisdom of the Rinpoche, that the text shines, providing universal truths about life and its spiritual component. The tenants of Buddhist philosophy can be gleaned through Harvey's discourses with the Rinpoche (&quot;There are no Gods in Buddhism,&quot; &quot;There is only Emptiness - Nothingness,&quot; &quot;To be freed from a false perception of Self is the end of Buddhism,&quot;.), but it is in the practical day to day life teachings that make this book worth reading.The journey to Ladakh is a journey to discover the laws of the spirit, and the relationship of the spirit to those laws. What Harvey has done for you in this book is to start you on a journey . . . a journey that explores the very center of being - or in Buddhist terms the journey into nothingness. Recommended"},{"Title":"Journey in Ladakh","review":"Andrew Harvey is an excellent writer.his writings,even on esoterica,have a light touch, making them accessible to those of us without a first at Oxford. This book is a well written decrpitive early gem by Mr. Harvey.Ladakh is [was?]the last pristine place of tibetan buddhism left on the planet. Mr Harvey goes in search of it,and ,of course, himself. The results are surprising, and very well done. The early parts of the book deal with the travel,and it occasionally borders on poetry.The meat of the book,as it were,is Mr. Harvey's encounter with a Tibetan Rinpoche,and the subsequent effect on his life.His conversations with the rinpoche,juxtaposed with his nights drinking chang[the local brew]in a Ladakhan saloon, are wonderful, and make the text much more enjoyable, and less self inflating. After all of this, Mr. Harvey writes an afterward 20 years later[this is a reprint]and he seems to have been ahving a bad day.After stopping just short of accusing the dalai lama of homophobia[traced to some of The Dalai lamas remarks made in San Francisco, I think,}he pounds the tibetan exile community,brings up the patrichial setup of traditional tibetan life[from a feminist perspective],and generally gets more heated in 3 pages than the previous 220+. Odd way to end a lovely book."},{"Title":"Journey in Ladakh","review":"After being advised to visit Ladakh by a number of people, traveller &amp; writer Andrew Harvey finally arrives in the remote Himalayan region.

He finds himself torn between his rational Western ego which is telling him that this Tibetan Rinpoche could be a fraud &amp; giving up his former life to stay in Ladakh &amp; immerse himself in Tibetan Buddhism.Like any Westerner who visits such a remote region, he laments over the encroachment of the West to an ancient culture &amp; wonders what will happen to Ladakh in the future. Wishing that he could help conserve Ladakh's unique identity, his hope is that this book will show an honest account of Ladakh, it's people &amp; it's culture.A brilliant book for anyone travelling on their spiritual journey."},{"Title":"Journey in Ladakh","review":"As far as philosophy goes this book is definitely worth the read. There are some beautiful and quite moving passages about the nature of our collective struggle to be happy in a world of pain, the beauty of a discipline such as Tibetan Buddhism, and the quite common search for an understanding of it all.I particularly liked the part on page 104 where he writes \\"It takes a great courage when you are suffering to see beyond your suffering to the clear relations between things, to the laws that cause and govern your suffering; it takes great courage to be ruthless with one's griefs.\\"That being said, I don't think this is a perfect book. There were several things that I found increasingly troubling as I read. One was the issue of language. Harvey mentions periodically that this or that character spoke good English, but there is no cogent explanation of just how communications between all of these divergent characters worked. I found it very hard to believe that all these people spoke english as well as they appear to in the book. In fact, everyone in the book spoke english more fluently than most people I know, i.e. native english speakers. Which brings me to my second issue. Harvey appears in the book to have the ability to travel to a very foreign culture and almost instantaneously forge deep and intensely personal bonds with everyone he meets. I'm not saying this is impossible. Just unlikely. It's almost never happened to me even in my own culture. That could be because I'm a curmudgeonly and cynical guy, granted. But still it didn't seem very likely to me. I question how much of the dialogue was accurate and how much was the result of Harvey's idealized memories of his journey. It reminded me, unfortunately, of \\"Mutant Message Down Under\\", though nowhere NEAR as bad, I hasten to add. That book was dreadful. At least the first half was; that's as far as I got. Harvey's book is infinitely better, but does have a hint of the same idealization of the \\"spiritual, untarnished, third world wise man\\" in it. I've met so many people who have visited Nepal and surrounding areas who say the same thing that I guess there must be an element of truth to it. It just seems a bit simplistic.The last thing that bugged me was how the Rinpoche was said to be so dedicated to his people that he was always exhausted from helping them, yet seemed to have all the time in the world for the author. What's so special about him? I don't know, maybe he's a tulku or something. The Rinpoche would know better than me. It just seemed to fit into a cultural pattern that I've seen too many times.For a refreshingly different account you should read 'Amazon Beaming' by Petru Popescu, about a guy who gets stranded in the Amazon with the Mayoruna tribe. The only way he makes it with these people, the only role that's available to him in their culture, is that of a total buffoon who can't do anything for himself. Which was accurate, of course, within their context. If Harvey's experience in Ladakh was different, isn't that in itself a symptom of the Westernization which he and everyone else decries? In a culture totally unfamiliar with Western ways, someone whose life consisted of computers, cars, working for money, investing money, and travelling to distant lands on airplanes for no particular reason, would seem pretty bizarre. What role would there be for us if we hadn't created one?But I digress.It didn't help any to search Andrew Harvey on the Internet and discover that he's now offering tours of South India at a cost of $3700.00 for two weeks (not including airfare). Sure, I'm a naysayer and a devil's advocate, but that's my burden, not yours.Read this book and enjoy the good parts. I definitely enjoyed it, I just thought I should mention some reservations in order to counter the all too common, five star, \\"ooh, unbelievable, changed my life\\" reviews which are a little too common these days, like standing ovations for non-spectacular performances. Well, what can you do? We live in a world where The Celestine Prophecies has sold 10,000,000,000,000 copies. Have you read that? DON'T!ps - I really dig my \\"real name\\" attribution. That means I'm a source you can trust. I feel almost like a corporation."},{"Title":"Journey in Ladakh","review":"I have to agree with the other lukewarm review here. This is a vastly entertaining book and I greatly enjoyed it, but by the end I too had a number of problems with it.Like many travel books, the prose really shines the most when Harvey sticks to straight reportage of the scenes and characters he meets. The panoply of sad and cheerful Ladakhis, crazed and wildly optimistic or cynical and frightened travelers, and starry-eyed Tibetan mystics is incredibly rewarding reading. The characters of 'Charles,' the conceited Swiss Tibetan Buddhism afficionado and 'Dilip,' a cynical Brahmin now on a desperate end-of-life search for meaning, are beautifully portrayed.Less interesting, or believable (to me), is Harvey's own 'search' and 'insights.' What other reviewers consider his beautiful descriptions of nature I found incredibly tiring. When he started waxing poetic on the mountains or the light at high altitude, I knew exactly what he meant, but felt nothing of what he was probably feeling, and those sections of the book dragged. Also, although he tries to tone it down and mostly succeeds, Harvey is nonetheless eager to share with us his apparent 'insights' into the 'emptiness' of all things or the true meaning of compassion for others - though considering the blurb on the back of the book shamelessly declares him to be 'sophisticated, intellectual,' it doesn't seem like any of these insights really stuck... Admittedly the beauty of both the external and internal landscapes one travels are difficult, very difficult, things to describe - but I still think Harvey failed with both of them.Still, this is a very entertaining work about a remarkable part of the world (perhaps less so these days) and I recommend reading it."},{"Title":"Journey in Ladakh","review":"Other reviewers have given a synopsis of the book, so I won't repeat it here. Also, I read an old edition without the Afterword, so didn't have to read the author's repudiation of his youth.I thoroughly enjoyed this classic &quot;Journey to the East&quot; travelogue. Harvey observes keely and writes from the heart. This book is for anyone who has travelled and fallen in love with a foreign culture, or who has travelled and hoped to find a new way of being."},{"Title":"Journey in Ladakh","review":"This is an interesting travelogue by a writer who is very well versed in his subject matter. His approach is very down to earth, and he takes the reader by the hand through his journey. One does get a detailed experience from reading this book, not quite as good as being there but close. At times the book is captivating.On the down side, I found the narrative a bit convoluted. His English is quite rich and very articulate but somehow fails to excite the reader. At times, it was down right boring. I had to put the book down a few times and pick it up again before I got through with it.Also, his analyses, where he attempts to propose any, are a bit superficial. Besides providing an account of his travels, Harvey tries to propose to the reader a discussion of Buddhism as he learns it from the rimpoches he meets. Here he inevitably becomes anecdotal."},{"Title":"Journey in Ladakh","review":"Not a journey \\"to,\\" but \\"in\\" this Buddhist enclave, before or as it succumbs to the rest of the world's ways, Harvey's quest takes in his own spiritual and existential condition as much, if not more, than his travels. While you gain a sense of how this barren, golden, light-bright landscape looks, Harvey shifts to the appeal of its monastic traditions, as he falls hard for Thuksey Rinpoche, a Tibetan refugee lama. Harvey meets Dilip & Moneesha, two delightfully drawn characters, up from Delhi, who introduce him. Gradually, Harvey's defenses erode and he learns what moves him.Nature takes up much of the first portion of this carefully composed, often understated narrative. Compared to Peter Mathiessen's \\"The Snow Leopard\\" (see my review of this and the overlapping Japanese-oriented \\"Nine-Headed Dragon River\\") which takes place over the Himalayas around this same time, sometime in the 1970s, in another monastery also called Shey, \\"A Journey in Ladakh\\" does not give as much attention to the mountains climbed. One shortcoming for readers may be this relative attention to the conversations he has (he speaks many languages) and the thoughts he shares. The book turns more inward as it develops, mirroring the shift Harvey makes as his journey turns vision-quest.Harvey's settled more in a few places and not as much a trekker as he is a pilgrim. Unlike Mathiessen, who comes to these mountains already a Zen practitioner, Harvey's a Cambridge-educated poet with a secular or disenchanted, detached perspective. His erudition's evident, if worn rather lightly, thankfully.But as his friends and teachers here note, he wants to change from his English-educated, somewhat distant attitude towards the spirit, even if he does not realize it at first. He signals this subtle change as he walks to see a monastery, but he never gets there. Instead he stays in the lovely scenery on the way. \\"I have no choice but to be alive to this landscape and this light: I must let this light do to my spirit and my words what it has to.\\" (66)He knows the folly of his mission. Hans, a visiting professor, tells him that by his own academic fieldwork there as well as Harvey's presence, they attest to the erosion of what they seek to document and preserve in Ladakh. If Harvey \\"bears witness,\\" a last testament for his readers to what's vanishing, Hans reckons: \\"aren't you inviting them to a rather corrupt party? 'Another moving study of a doomed culture'?\\" (96) With the Rinpoche, Harvey wonders what Hans'd say about his transformation as he seems to enter his teacher's mind. \\"In this old man from another, unknowable world the writer has found the perfect way to aggrandise himself, advertise his spirituality.\\" (150) This self-aware skepticism about his own struggle to let go, in the Buddhist sense, enriches this study for the outsider, such as Harvey still is.Even skeptical Hans and cautious Harvey admit they're moved by the generosity of their hosts. Drukchen, another lama, tells Harvey how the teachings represent the loss of illusion, of the end of \\"false hope or consolation,\\" as Tibet falls and its teachings spread abroad through its exiled adherents. \\"Buddhism will flourish in the West,\\" Druckchen predicts, for the West \\"is coming of age; it is becoming adult, able to bear the radical clarity of the Buddha, hungry for\\" the wisdom that brings \\"a practical, severe analysis of things as they are, of the mind as it is,\\" (180) free of salvation unless it comes from within the seeker. Compassion, wisdom, and a hard look at reality's own constructs accompany this vision of absolute change, for those unable to believe in Christ as a god anymore, but only as a man.A Swiss student, Charles, annoys but then appeals to Harvey's own search: not to use it \\"as an anaesthetic,\\" to cling to \\"a great wall of experiences and meditative ecstasies and learning between me and the world,\\" as Charles had done in vain. Instead, hang on to \\"no insight, no experience, no learning--it is to be simple and unprotected. It is to be practical, in the highest sense, with everything that is around you, with all the energies, good or bad, of the present.\\" (191)This is a difficult story of inner entry and outer adventure to control, but Harvey succeeds. He tells of a out-of-body experience as he watches a Tantric ceremony, and as he forgets \\"all my fear and self hatred in those moments,\\" he sees insubstantiality surround him, all \\"a transitory fiction.\\" (205) Later, Drukchen tells him of his confidence that Harvey must return to the West. The lama warns that \\"the East is not a large convalescent home for the West,\\" a place to \\"play at being spiritual,\\" but \\"it is a place of power, of new power, a new kind of strength which must be used in the world.\\" If Harvey's sincere, he will succeed in sharing his discovery with his audience: \\"If what you have learnt is true, it will hold.\\" (226)Finally, as he prepares to leave, he visits the Rinpoche. He takes the Bodhissatva vow not to enter Nirvana until all sentient beings he can assist will precede him there, and he's a Buddhist instead of an \\"almost\\" one as his friends had noticed before. He is told: \\"The true journey is toward the enlightened self, and you are that already. You came, across your life, across Ladakh, to this room, to this morning, to me, and now another journey is beginning, the journey which you have travelled here to begin.\\" (233)I read this again after two decades, and like \\"The Snow Leopard,\\" it sustains its energy and compels the reader to follow an outsider's struggle within these mountains to find beauty, meaning, and truth. Harvey's voice controls this compelling, yet modest, presentation of his own nuanced self-awareness. He conveys deftly his own evolution into a wiser, humbler pilgrim who returns with quite a story to tell us. (I reviewed the original 1983 edition; an unread by me 2000 version adds an afterword criticizing some sacred cows which some felt gored by, as Harvey since became a New Age-ish popular author and speaker.)"},{"Title":"Journey in Ladakh","review":"A travel book about one of the last places on earth where Tibetan Buddhist community survives. Or at least did in 1981 when the author traveled there. An interesting book about spiritual discovery and Tibetan Buddhist culture and mystery. The first part of the book is rather slow but still interesting, often describing the serene Himalayan scenery while traveling to Ladakh. In the second part, when the author meets the Rinpoche, the book really takes off. Here is one passage on Rinpoche's teaching the art of visualization:\\"You will understand, slowly, and in slow stages, that Reality is a creation of the mind. You will understand it not with your intellect or even with your intuition, but practically, because you will be growing within you the power to alter Reality. You must work every day. You must not be discouraged if for many months you can visualize very little. What you are beginning is a journey into a different world, into an awareness of different reality; you cannot expect to make that journey quickly. Nor, in a sense, should you want to. \\"Being an artist such mystical descriptions fueled my imagination while working on my art. I like reading mysticism because it induces feelings of mystery and awe... and perhaps that is its main purpose."},{"Title":"Journey in Ladakh","review":"In my reading of spirtual journeys none has been told with the personale depth that Mr. Harvey has been able to capture and infuse in this reader.This is a book for those both old and new to reading about spiritual quests.A true and universal love story of awe."},{"Title":"Journey in Ladakh","review":"...and your heart will open also.

The book gives very good insights on the problem of cultural differences and shows clearly how your own faith has been effected by your culture. It also gives a very good model of contextualization which is applicable in all times and places. The examples Hiebert gives are practical and illustrate well the points he wants to make and make the book lively and accessible. Just read it!"},{"Title":"Anthropological Insights for Missionaries","review":"Christian missionaries often are required to go through extensive theological training so that they know their doctrine and how to apply it. They also go through various psychological and personality tests so that they might gain a better understanding of themselves (e.g. strengths, how they react to stress). But they rarely receive adequate training on how to adapt to, live in, and thrive in a foreign culture in such a way as to gain a hearing for the Gospel. This book, by missionary, anthropologist, and professor at Biola University (La Mirada, California) seeks to apply anthropological insights to the work of foreign mission work in order to make the missionary more healthy (spiritual, mental) and effective in his work.\\"Anthropological Insights for Missionaries\\" begins by presenting a base of information. Anthropology is described and various terms are defined and interrelated Overarching theories of intercultural interaction are presented and Hiebert describes his basic anthropological and theological assumptions. One of the most important arguments for the purposes of the book is Hiebert's contention that the Gospel is compatible with any culture as each culture is able to understand and apply the Gospel in a unique, Holy Spirit-led way.The second part places the focus on the missionary himself. It is certainly a stressful task for the missionary to pack up everything and move to a remote, unfamiliar land. Issues of culture shock and ethnocentrism are examined as well as cultural assumptions. Hiebert provides paradigms and practical advice for acclimating to a new culture and (beyond that) to becoming incarnational within that culture (adopting it as best as one is able). Hiebert provides a brief-yet-accurate list of Western cultural assumptions and contrasts them with differing cultural assumptions in real communities.Part three places the focus on the Gospel message itself. He emphasizes that cultures will view the Gospel through their own cultural filter and thus the missionary may have difficulty determining whether the host culture is gaining an orthodox or heterodox understanding of the Gospel. While becoming a thorough understanding of the language and culture is helpful in this regard, Heibert continually argues that the missionary should work toward allowing the (new) Christian leaders of the host culture take the lead in determining authentic practical applications of the Gospel (after all, they know the cultural significance of their community better than a missionary will be able to). Indeed, one of the major tasks of the missionary is to develop a new Christian community to maturity both in leadership, resources, ability to evangelize others, and theological application. While recognizing the difficulty of this task, Hiebert reminds the reader of its long-term importance for the Church.The final part examines what it means to be bi-cultural. Any time two cultures interact as closely as is the case when long-term missionaries (and their families) evangelize and disciple Christian nationals (and their families), a new hybrid culture is developed. People who become bi-cultural face unique challenges as they fully comfortable in their host culture, nor are they comfortable in their home culture. A missionary should be prepared for this inevitable change.The book is well structure and well written. Hiebert presents a balance of theory, practice, and anecdote (from his own personal experiences and the experiences of fellow missionaries). The information is presented in a logical and straightforward manner, advice and principles are given to the reader, but the reader is often left to figure out how to apply this information/advice in his own context.Recommended to those engaged in cross-cultural ministry, especially those considering serving as a foreign missionary."},{"Title":"Anthropological Insights for Missionaries","review":"Missionaries should learn and understand culture of the people to whom they want to preach the gospel. I agree with Hiebert that without all that knowledge their message may be irrelevant and meaningless in cultural enviroment that is different from the cultural background of missionaries, especially if they came from the West. Missionaries must be tolerant for other cultures and keep interest in their own ways of being and believing, but they must resent the popular concept of cultural relativism. Christian missionaries may lost the meaning of the gospel and ministry if they only reflect the culture of people around them or ignore the native culture.Hiebert accents that the preaching of gospel may reflect the background of missionaries but he in his book helps to avoid trap of culture shock, how to make bridges between cultures, and lay good foundation for native Christian churches. Especially interesting is Hiebert's analisis of trends what will and may happen in the new native Christian church later after three and four generations.I recommend this book not only for missionaries but also for pastors and gospel workers."},{"Title":"Anthropological Insights for Missionaries","review":"\\"Anthropological Insights for Missionaries\\" should be required reading for anyone involved in short or long term missions. While well researched, this book also comes from an insider. Mr. Hiebert's years of mission experience shine through in the practical applications.

That is NOT the message of anthropology. As an anthropologist, I resent this book profoundly. Anthropology is based on tolerance for other cultures, interest in their own ways of being and believing, and the concept of cultural relativism--that a culture's values and morals can only be understood in their own terms. The one thing we do NOT do is try to impose our own \\"truths\\" on others. If missionaries want to learn what anthropology really is, then read an anthropology book. But this text merely steals from anthropology in the most primitive way and turns that stolen material into the guidelines for cultural judgment, invasion, and destruction.

With the help of Chef Az I have learned how to prepare meals that aren't boring, within 20 minutes.I never think about preparing a meal until the kids are starving and demand an instant dinner.

I bought this book looking for vegetable based (in other words, healthy/light)recipies that also made use of the 'freezer cooking' method. I have NO kitchen skills, so cooking an elaborate homemade meal is a challenge for me in all respects. If it's too complicated - I quit!This book meets all my needs and I'm pretty happy with it. I think the secret here is that there really is no magic secret to cooking - just most of us don't have this sort of home-economics knowledge anymore of how to select vegetables, prepare them for multiple uses later, and freeze them. This book delivers all that and more - nice, basic recipes that aren't drenched in mayo, cheese, and ground beef like you find in all the other freezer cookbooks. 'Mediterranean-inspired' - is a selling point here - the flavors are upscale but not pretensious, great for people who want to cook healthy meals every day for their families. A good tool to help get out of the fast food lines. Stocking your freezer with the prepared 'basics' does help, as promised, make you feel like a chef!"},{"Title":"There's a Chef in Your Freezer: Fast, Fabulous, Delicious, Mediterranean-Inspired Recipes Your Family, Friends, and You Will Love","review":"I love &quot;There's A chef In Your Freezer.&quot; It has really changed the way I cook. I'm a working mother and I really appreciate how the book helps me prepare delicious meals quickly. I don't know how I ever lived without roasted garlic in my freezer before -- it adds so much flavor to food. I use it sometimes to jazz up store-bought food and frozen vegetables. The roasted garlic and marinades are my favorite recipes in the book. I use the marinades all the time. They are very easy to make and add so much flavor.I find myself making roasted vegetables and potatoes often; roasted chicken parts are delicious with the rosemary thyme marinade. Even the children love them. The caramel chocolate sauce is to die for and easy to prepare.I appreciate all the humor in the book as well, and I find the recipes are clear and easy-to-follow. I highly recommend this book to anyone who likes to cook.

We had a lot of veggies from our garden at the end of this summer, and this book helped me make the most of them. I found the book to be well-organized and easy to use.

The author introduces Kabbalah through an interesting overview of its history and then delves into the main ideas. Two of these chapters are exceptional because the ideas they address are usually not included in other introductory books: the chapter about God and the introduction to Genesis according to Kabbalah. The final chapters analyze the Tree of Life, always pointing how this knowledge can be utilized for our own growth.Although I've only finished the book last week, I know I'll read it again soon."},{"Title":"Simple Kabbalah (Simple Wisdom Book)","review":"I choose this book as my introduction to Kabalah and could not have been more pleased.

An easy to understand, insightful and educational book on a very intricate and complicated subject. Detailed yet comprehensible, most every aspect of this mystical art is touch upon and illuminated.

I was riding on a train and started talking to a lady sitting next to me who told me about these wonderful teachings. Unfortunately for me, and for people like me, there weren't many resources besides this book. I have seen and read other books but they were rather complicated and difficult to understand. This book taught me many things. One of the main messages I learned is that no book holds the key to happiness. I do not believe Cabala is a secret answer or cure for anything. Rather it will enhance your life if you invite it in."},{"Title":"Simple Kabbalah (Simple Wisdom Book)","review":"Its hard to imagine taking such a complex topic and creating a book that explains it without speaking down to the reader.

I put my daughters name in it so that she could take it to school (so now I can't return it) and on the first day is when I realized the book came in two sizes and, of course, all the other children have the larger one. sigh. So I come back to Amazon, read the reviews I should have read the first time around and I really have to agree that the print is just too small for a small child and too small for her 40-something mother to read.

I loved this Bible and had a hard time turning it over to my friend. I like the 'read-aloud' nature of the Bible accounts, but what really impressed me was the support information about the culture, meanings of words etc. I knew this Bible would grow with her nephew. Matter of fact I am going to suggest it to my Sunday School Teachers and parents. Its like a Bible, concordance, Bible Atlas and Handbook rolled into one. I purchased the large one, even though the small one is suggested for little hands, its the adults that would be reading it and you could always get a little one for church services."},{"Title":"The Children's Illustrated Bible","review":"While the illustrations are beautiful, I need a magnifying glass to see them.

I have used the original, full-sized edition with older kids for many years. It's been especially useful in helping older children who have had little exposure to church or Bible do some learning before they are baptized.Recently I ordered 4 copies of the compact edition. It turns out that the type is so small as to be almost unreadable, even for children. The body copy is printed in 7 point type--smaller than phone book text type. The type in the notes under the illustrations and photos is 5 point. This tiny typeface will discourage most children from reading, especially those that are not eager readers to begin with.

I use this book extensively in my sessions with the kids, because they listen...intently. Rather than many dumbed-down, Disneyesque versions of children's Bibles that I have seen, and rather than the somewhat lame materials offered by our church, the Children's Illustrated Bible connects with kids. It does not insult their intelligence, but enhances it. The rich liturgies of the Old and New Testaments are brought to life with vivid portraiture and detailed factual explanation. Want to know more about life in the Middle East in biblical times? It's there. Want to know what type of wood might have been used in the Ark? Or what mountain range Ararat belongs to?My students, ages 5-9, are harsh critics. When something isn't real, or interesting, or meaningful, they simply turn off. Too many of the standard cut, color and paste exercises last five minutes with them. But when I pull this book out to read the wonderful stories of Noah, Moses, the Flight from Egypt, Jesus calming the sea, and so forth - the kids listen with mouths agape. They strain their necks to see the beautiful illustrations and pictures.This Bible is an excellent gift for god-children, for nieces and nephews, for your kids. Even if you are not religious, your kids will benefit deeply from hearing and reading the wonderful tales of the Judeo-Christian tradition, and step up their cultural literacy significantly."},{"Title":"The Children's Illustrated Bible","review":"This larger edition of the Children's Illustrated Bible has large pictures plus print that is big enough to be very easily read. (The smaller book, ISBN number 0-7894-5331-2, is about 2/3 the size of this book.)The pictures are realistic and not the silly cortoon-like figures you see in some children's bibles. I have read through a few of the stories, and they are short, precise and very well written. Interesting background information is given and illistrated in the margins.The high quality of the writting, the background information and the pictures deserve a 5-star rating. However, the book is not perfect. For instance, Hasting has Jesus teaching the Lord's prayer as \\"Our Lord in heaven...\\""},{"Title":"The Children's Illustrated Bible","review":"Children's Bibles are probably the genre of books I read the most critically and carefully. These books of stories can greatly enhance our children's grasp of Biblical truth and build a frame in their minds for future Biblical learning to be added onto, or they can cause lasting damage through misrepresenting, undermining, or falsely teaching what the Bible is about. I had casually flipped through The Children's Illustrated Bible in stores and liked the realistic illustrations and informative sidebars with archeological, geological, and historical information and photographs. I was looking forward to a chance to review it, hoping that my opinions would remain positive after a closer inspection.Unfortunately, this was not the case. I read every word on every page of this 309 page book. I put a sticky tab with notes on each page I had questions/issues with. There were a LOT of notes sticking out of this book when I was done.What first drew me to this book were the realistic and detailed illustrations. While this was a strength with some stories, with others it was a definite draw-back. For example, while it is true that Adam and Eve were going \\"au natural\\" in the garden, I would prefer them to be a little more covered when my young preschooler reads her story Bible! Nor, do I want her to see a painting, classic or not, of baby Jesus being circumcised. And I most definitely don't want her to study and ponder a picture of Daniel in the lions' den, where the den has been accurately portrayed filled with human skulls, bones, and blood dripping down the rocks and off of the lion's teeth. There are also disturbing pictures of soldiers carrying out Herod's orders to kill the male children after Jesus was born (soldiers with bloody swords and mothers begging for mercy with babies huddled in their arms), and of a servant carrying John the Baptist's head, mostly covered by a bloody cloth, on a platter to Salome.I do appreciate accurate illustrations, but TMI!! My daughter would be afraid of some of the pictures in this book! [Admittedly, these gory pictures might be a draw to older boys...] :)As I mentioned, another aspect of this book that I initially appreciated were the sidebars full of extra scientific/ archeological/ historical information and photographs. Sometimes these things were very interesting and informative - I liked seeing photos of natural items that would have been used to dye garments like Joseph's coat, typical foods eaten by the Egyptians, and traditional house structures from Nazareth.At times, however, it appeared that the team of people contributing to this book clearly did not hold the Bible to be literally true. For instance, it is suggested that the Israelites crossed through a \\"marshy swamp\\" rather than miraculously through a sea (although the illustration shows them walking through the parted sea), and I was outraged at the \\"explanation\\" that manna may have been sweet liquid which seeps from the hammada shrub. (Really? Feeding thousands of people for 40 years with sap? This just ignores the clear description the Bible gives of what manna looked like.) There were many little details like these that I found heretical and could seriously undermine a child's faith in what the Bible says.Another real danger in paraphrased, abbreviated sections of the Bible in books like these is that any biases held by the authors and editors are included in the text as they \\"retell\\" the stories.For instance, we are told that God rejected Cain's offering because it was not the best of his produce - as we have discussed in the past, we just don't know that for sure. In addition, God's conversation with Cain in Genesis 3:7 is phrased as, \\"Why are you angry?... you will succeed if you work hard; and if you do not, the sin will be yours.\\" This completely changes the issue. The problem was not that Cain wasn't working hard!In the story of Abraham and Isaac on Mount Moriah, the angel stops Abraham and says, \\"You have proved your perfect love of God by your willingness to sacrifice even your child.\\" Again, as we have discussed, that is NOT the point.Where the author and editors' biases are most apparent, however, are in the life and parables of Jesus. In a two-page summary of Jesus' life and ministry, the text reads, \\"The death of Jesus is important to Christians because they believe that, in dying, he was showing God's love for all people. For this reason the cross became the main symbol of Christianity. Christians believe, however, that death did not put an end to Jesus, but that his spirit lives on, especially through his followers.\\" (207) Notice the complete lack of mention of sin, need for forgiveness, etc - and how His bodily resurrection is ignored!Each parable begins with an \\"explanation,\\" which often misses the point and emphasize \\"good living.\\" For example - Lazarus and the rich man was \\"a story to warn people about God's judgment of the selfish.\\" The Pharisee who prayed in public for show and the Tax Collector who humbly beseeched God for mercy in private were \\"to show how important it is not to be conceited or to look down on others.\\"The letters of Paul, also, are summarized with an emphasis on being good rather than on salvation through Christ and resulting deeds which flow out of a changed heart. \\"If you follow Jesus, you will find that you can overcome your worst instincts... There is no earthly law to make you into a good person, but if you obey the laws of Jesus, you will not only do what is right, but also find true happiness and peace.\\" (307)Perhaps this seems like I am being nitpicky. But parents, if there is ever a time to be picky about books, it is when a book is seeking to represent God's Word and ways to our children. Read with a critical eye. Be cautious! And teach them the actual words that the BIBLE says - not just a paraphrased summary!My husband had a great idea. He suggested that I keep this Bible, highlight all the problem areas with a bright highlighter, and use it when our children are older and able to think critically. When they get to a highlighted section, it will be a time for us to read carefully, pull out our Bibles and carefully compare, and teach them to think and use the Bible as the ultimate standard of what is True. Maybe we'll make it a game called \\"spot the heresy.\\" ;)"},{"Title":"The Children's Illustrated Bible","review":"An important part of our nighttime routine is our evening devotion and The Children's Illustrated Bible has been an important tool.

It is about the size of the small font used in paperback Penguins from the UK---about a 6-point on my computer's Times New Roman, where a 12 point TNR is the norm for letters.

However, the author ends up taking too many liberties with the text. The worst example is Jesus teaching the Lord's Prayer. He says, &quot;Our Lord in heaven.&quot; Ack! It is &quot;Our FATHER&quot; and the difference is tremendously important. Many of the parables Jesus tells are introduced by saying something like &quot;Jesus told a story about the kingdom of heaven to say such and such...&quot; Many times the author's interpretation of the parable is debateable. These detract from the reading in my view, though a child would hardly notice. Discernment is called for by the parents! But the side notes and illustrations are very helpful and there are helpful articles on life in the various stages of Bible history times. A good Bible for bedtime reading (or any time really), but you may have to ad lib in some spots a more correct translation."},{"Title":"The Children's Illustrated Bible","review":"If you are thinking of purchasing this bible, spend the extra money and purchase the larger book. This one is a nice personal size but the print is so small it is hard to read. I bought it for my granddaughter who told me it hurt her eyes to read it."},{"Title":"The Children's Illustrated Bible","review":"It's hard to rate this book, because it does some things very well and other things not well at all. Our kids certainly like it more than the one we read when they were toddlers. But I recommend waiting until they are 6 or 7 until you start this one. Almost every story has some part that I don't want to explain to my 3 year old. As an example, do a Google search for the painting \\"The Deluge\\" by Gustave Dore. This painting is part of the page on the Great Flood. At what age do you want to explain to your kids about David and Bathsheba, Jacob Rachel and Leah, drawings of Herod's men killing babies, and the stoning of Stephen? When you are ready, this is a good book. Be ready.The second criticism is about how the stories are told. I can't quite describe it, but it's like the language is more removed from the action. It's a modern translation, but very stiff and formal. I consider it more formal than the NIV Bible that I normally read. It it trying to prepare kids for the King James version?On a positive note, my kids really do prefer this Bible to the one that we used before. Maybe it's because the drawings are more realistic. It uses many classic paintings that have stood the test of time. It also mixes in photographs of things that haven't changed in centuries, like using a donkey to carry heavy loads, or ancient roads.I think of this more of an encyclopedia of Bible facts, rather than a children's Bible. There's something about it that just doesn't speak to me that way other Bibles do."},{"Title":"The Children's Illustrated Bible","review":"One great difficulty in reading Bible stories to children is the wealth of unfamiliar things, ideas, and terms. The Dorling Kindersley retellings are not only short and elegant to read, but unfamiliar items are illustrated and explained right on the page. No searching around for the picture or definition of a &quot;lulag&quot; or &quot;shekel.&quot; This makes the DK version especially &quot;user-friendly&quot; and understandable by kids. The wealth of scholar/consultants from different religious traditions assures that it authoritative and equally useful to kids of different religious backgrounds. The DK Children's Bible has become my gift of choice for newborns, whether the parents are dedicated Christians or only those who want their kids to see the Bible as great literature. A truly wonderful book."},{"Title":"The Children's Illustrated Bible","review":"Finally, a bible that bridges the gap between adult and children's bibles. The illustrations and text are interesting and accurate, it's a wonderful bible for the older children to read on their own, my son is almost ten and loves it. My seven year old daughter loves to have me read the stories and talk about the pictures, she is especially interested in the photographs along the sides of the pages showing actual carpenter tools, clothes, jewelery, foods, etc. that are similar to the ones used during biblical times. You will not find any cartoon figures or blond Saviors in this book! I highly recommend it, even if you don't have any children."},{"Title":"The Children's Illustrated Bible","review":"I purchased this book in the large picture book size a number of years ago. Recently, I wanted to buy one for my little grandson and was excited to find it on Amazon. I looked through the pages and was assured it was the same book so I purchased it. When it arrived I was disappointed to find it was reduced in size to a bit smaller than a hard bound novel. The beautiful illustrations, depiction of ancient tools, maps, etc which were so wonderful in my book were reduced to make them and the text very small and hard to see all the detail. I love the book and would recommend purchasing it for anyone interested in the teaching children bible stories and relevant history and life style of the times, but make sure you purchase the book that is large, not this reduced sized edition."},{"Title":"The Children's Illustrated Bible","review":"You can't tell from the image, but this book is quite small and it makes the font very difficult to read. I would have gotten a different version if I had known. A bible was requested by my 5 year old and I think the stories are a little advanced for her age. Wish I had researched more, but as it was from Santa I didn't return it..."},{"Title":"The Children's Illustrated Bible","review":"We love this bible, but ended up not giving it to our goddaughter as intended because the font is SO small. The book itself is small but very thick, so it's hard to really open it to a particular page. Then the small font makes it way too hard to read if you have a squirmy child on your lap and a lamp on for bed time. So, we thought the content and illustrations were wonderful, but we wish the book was much larger with bigger font."},{"Title":"The Children's Illustrated Bible","review":"The book was as described. The pictures are vibrant! My son has asked a million questions and it's nice to have pictures that make the answering easier."},{"Title":"The Children's Illustrated Bible","review":"I love the book. I wanted a story form of the Bible for school and this is great. I love the detailed pictures and the history lessons of the times. We just read the story about Joseph and his coat of many colors. On the side notes it had what they used for dyes back then. Even a picture of the item they used and the color it produced. Only problem I have is I wish they had made it a bit bigger. The print is so tiny i almost need a magnifying glass to read it."},{"Title":"The Children's Illustrated Bible","review":"I bought this as a present and ended up keeping it after reviewing it for myself. I know that sounds bad but this bible is just that good. It's informative for both kids and adults. And yeah I got another gift for the child."},{"Title":"The Children's Illustrated Bible","review":"When this arrived, I was surprised by the smallness of it, as I was hoping for a large picture book suitable for reading to my preschooler. Turns out the size and content are PERFECT for my second grader, who is pleased to find some new Bible stories (especially OT) just a little bit challenging for her. Sidebars bring the history to life, as photos from the Middle East, or of Biblical reenactments, are captioned and explained to show how people lived then, and still live today in some places."},{"Title":"The Children's Illustrated Bible","review":"I bought this book for my six year old, so that we could read it together. I definitely recommend that you find one that is the full size (look at the dimensions in the description). I would imagine that much of the impact of the illustrations would be lost with the small version, not to mention the difficulty of a small font. I was interested to read of one parent's complaint that there was content not appropriate for children. Frankly, the Bible is a PG document if ever I've seen one. Parental guidance is definitely recommended! I haven't yet found any illustrations that I've had a problem with although I have to say that I think we will skip over the story of Sodom and Gomorrah for now, as well as others that I don't think are age appropriate for a six year old.Fundamentalists and Bible literalists will probably have a problem with some of the alternate explanations that are given for manna and the parting of the Red Sea. I actually appreciate the inclusion of these tidbits and am educating my daughter to hear all viewpoints and make decisions for herself so I don't find them a problem but others might."},{"Title":"The Children's Illustrated Bible","review":"I was pleasantly surprised by this book, I didn't expect the pictures to be so great, or the stories to be written so well. It tells the stories accurately, but in a one to two page form that can hold the attention of children. If you are looking for a Bible story book for a child, this is the one to pick..."},{"Title":"The Children's Illustrated Bible","review":"I am using this book for Sunday School.

Have purchased it before and came back for another."},{"Title":"The Children's Illustrated Bible","review":"My granddaughter, who is 8 years old, found a book at the library that she loves to read by Selena Hastings about stories of the old testament of the Bible. I was hoping that this book would have been a larger book and large print as the one she found at the library. But, she still loves the book and is reading it from cover to cover."},{"Title":"The Children's Illustrated Bible","review":"I am an Episcopal priest who gives out this Bible to all children who are to be baptized in the church. The stories are an engaging retelling of the scriptures that are not too watered down. While it is too advanced for infants and toddlers, it is great for grade school and older children. But I give it to the infants and toddlers and then use it as an opportunity to educated the parents. Some of them are too intimidated to read the Bible on their own. I tell them to read the full Bible so they can educate their children, but if they can't, at least read this Bible. It includes all the most important stories. The illustrations are excellent. The background information gives a richness to the material. It is through stories that Jesus taught, and so it is through stories of both the Old and New Testament, told in a compelling manner, that we learn best. The stories are colorful and short enough for children, and colorful and deep enough for adults too intimidated to read the original. As parents read to their children, they both draw closer to God."},{"Title":"The Children's Illustrated Bible","review":"The size of the Bible was not advertised with the product. I thought I was purchasing a larger size like the customer showed me she wanted. I did get permission to return them to the seller."},{"Title":"The Children's Illustrated Bible","review":"Very interesting, in typical DK style with lots of pictures and great illustrations. Gives a wonderful introduction to the Bible, in children's language and interest. Also nice intro for adults who maybe aren't as familiar with scripture history/background. Only downside is that it's not actual scripture, all stories are paraphrased - but they are paraphrased well and have the scripture reference on the pages for further study. My kids have enjoyed it from age 5+, my dau is 10 and still it's her favorite Bible."},{"Title":"The Children's Illustrated Bible","review":"This is very small book which took me by surpise, but it seems nice, and it should be a great item to give as a baptismal gift."},{"Title":"The Children's Illustrated Bible","review":"This Bible is written and illustrated at the child's level and thus make the Bible more interesting and more meaningful to the child.

What a surprise! This book had print so small that I needed a magnifing glass in addition to my reading glasses to see the print. I was stunned with this minature version, the dimensions of which were never disclosed in the discription -- a terible disappointment. I am at a loss to understand why the publisher published this volume in an unacceptable size. My purchase was returned."},{"Title":"The Children's Illustrated Bible","review":"While children may not have a hard time reading this book, I did...so, it is not for parents to read to their children if you have trouble with a very small font. That way my only disappointment. The size of the actual book is very convenient and would be easy for a child to hold. The font is smaller then most adult Bibles.The illustrations are wonderful, the stories inspirational and retold in language that is clear and yet retains the original \\"poetry\\" of the Bible.\\"So it is that we must make the most of what God gives us, and then we will be prepared to enter the kingdom of Heaven.\\" -pg. 255, The Parable of the TalentsAn index and a listing of \\"who's who\\" makes this more useful as a text. There are quotations from the King James Version sprinkled through the book. Color photographs of animals, plants and people puts the stories into context. All the pictures are explained, making reading this particular Bible a complete learning experience.The stories are retold by Selina Hastings and an Introduction to the Bible explains that the Bible is a collection of books written by different people. Eric Thomas has even illustrated the Contents section. His artwork complements the style of Selina's writing.Children love the stories of the Bible and I remember my first children's Bible very well. A belief in God is very comforting through life and a Children's Bible helps children to understand who God is and will increase their love for others.Through my own studies as a child, I learned that God does love us, even when it seems he is nowhere to be found. The trust I have in God and my belief stems from learning about God and understanding his purpose in my life at an early age.~The Rebecca Review"},{"Title":"The Children's Illustrated Bible","review":"The printing is very very tiny. Less than 8 pt. Hard to read. Certainly not for children. I was very disappointed."},{"Title":"The Children's Illustrated Bible","review":"I am a children's ministry coordinator at our church. I searched for a Bible that would capture the interest of elementary aged children. This one absolutely does. It is easy to understand, has compelling pictures and historical facts that help explain a time period that is difficult for young folks to wrap their minds around. Families are buying copies for home use as well. Be careful tho, it comes in two sizes and the larger one is much more kid-friendly than the pocket size. Makes a great read-together book for parents and kids."},{"Title":"The Children's Illustrated Bible","review":"I wanted to share the great stories of the Bible with my 7 year old son--Noah's Ark, the Tower of Babel, the Birth of Christ and so on. But the idea of reading the Bible seemed a bit daunting for both of us. This Children's Bible presents stories in 2-3 page segments which seem to be just the right length for reading aloud at bedtime. The language is simplified for a child, and the relevant drawings and photographs give historical context to each story. Sometimes my son wants to talk about the values in a particular story; sometimes we just explore the interesting little artifacts in the margins."},{"Title":"The Children's Illustrated Bible","review":"This edition was a fraction of the size of my own copy. It is not suitable to enjoy/share with others. It never occured to me to check the size of the hardback copy.

I had no idea that the one I was buying was a small version and bought four of them as gifts. Needless to say, I was very sad when they arrived. The 1/4 size version is really small print. If you are buying the full sized version, I'd rate it a 5."},{"Title":"The Children's Illustrated Bible","review":"The content and illustrations are wonderful, so it is a shame that they printed it in such a small size. The large amount of text and the small font make reading it laborious and that completely defeats the purpose, doesn't it? A larger size would have made all of the different and made this a perfect Bible for children!"},{"Title":"The Children's Illustrated Bible","review":"I bought this book for my 8 yearold grandson and did not even give it to him. The book appears to be miniaturized. The print is so tiny that many people would not be able to read it without magnifying glasses! It is not appropriate for children given this tiny print. The pictures are well done and it would have been a perfect gift if the print were not so small."},{"Title":"The Children's Illustrated Bible","review":"This is a perfect Bible-story book that fills the gap between the immature and the mature young Christian. I bought it for my daughter back when she was in first grade and began reading it to her then. We've read through it many, many times together (depended on the attention span of the child, you can read as little or as much of the extra info provided), usually one story a night (they're only 1 to 3 pages long). And now that she's in third grade, she still enjoys it and continues to read it on her own. There are maps, timelines, and overviews, as well as interesting facts and photos inserted along the margins that help the child (and adult) understand cultural details of the time.My only problem with it is that it completely omits the conversation between Jesus and Nicodemus in the third chapter of John's gospel (i.e., John 3:16.) Hello?? Isn't that a major point in Christianity? Its omission is very disturbing and unfortunately hasn't been included in the new 1996 edition either."},{"Title":"The Children's Illustrated Bible","review":"THIS BIBLE WAS WELL WRITTEN, TRUE TO THE FACTS, & EASY TO READ AND UNDERSTAND.

I found this book again in my step-mom's collection and it's still just as enchanting as it was then.

The description says that it is great for kids as young as four. I disagree. For starters there is way too many details, hard to grasp words and concepts, and uneasy flow of language for a child that young.My daughter grew bored of this book simply because at a young age she couldn't really grasp what she was reading. In fact I had to do most of the reading. As I read I found myself constantly changing the words in the passage to something I'd think she would understand. Basically I had to paraphrase a lot. So much work!

That is the kind of tip-top customer service I have come to expect from Amazon, but am nonetheless impressed by it - especially since I was working with Apple on a seperate issue and kept doing battle only to run into brickwalls. Apple ultimately lost their chance to sell me a gift card and instead, I gave a friend an Amazon card.

There is way too much text (thus a very small font) to make this wonderful Bible to be of any use. I had to return it."},{"Title":"The Children's Illustrated Bible","review":"I am extremely pleased with the DK Children's Illustrated Bible. When I was browsing the bookstore for young people's bibles, I was surprised to find that there were Catholic Bibles and Baptist Bibles. Naively, I had expected all bibles would be more or less the same except for the illustrations.The DK Bible manages to fend off internecine religious wars by having employed a cast of religious, historical and educational experts in the creation of this work. The \\"consultants\\" list on the copyright page includes two reverends, a rabbi, a sister and a father, as well as two experts from the Western Asiatic Department of the British Museum. In addition to the stories themselves, written by Selina Hastings, the introduction and section openers were written by the educational consultant, Geoffrey Marshall-Taylor. Together with the 11 editors and designers listed on the same page, these experts, the author and the illustrator have created a work that serves the several communities seeking a quality children's bible, and it serves those communities very well.This Children's Bible has many strengths and attributes:* The DK Children's Bible is fundamentally designed as a storybook. There are approximately 140 stories of two or three pages each, all of which seem to have a comprehensible beginning, middle and end (i.e., a strict story arc that may not be easily identified in the meandering source material).* The DK Children's Bible is also an attractive picture book. Each story is illustrated with at least one and as many as three illustrations by Eric Thomas. The Thomas illustrations appear to be in colored pencil, or possibly pastel or crayon, and they are generally representative and clear.* The DK Children's Bible is a primer Bible: Each of the stories are attributed to a specific books, chapters and verses of the Bible, so readers who find their interest spark can go to the original material easily. Many of the spreads include Bible-verse pullquotes. For example, the story \\"A Son for Zachariah\\" includes the following quote in the sidebar, \\"Fear not, Zachariah: For thy prayer is heard; and thy wife Elizabeth shall bear thee a son, and thou shall call his name John. And thou shalt have joy and gladness; and many shall rejoice at his birth.\\" (Luke 1:13-14)* The DK Children's Bible is a visual historical dictionary and art history lesson. In most cases the stories are accompanied with color photographs of related people, places or things and/or with historic paintings, buildings, etchings, sculptures, architectural renderings or decorative objects that relate to the story at hand. (The introduction, for example, includes images of Matthew, Mark, Luke and John from the seventh-century Lindisfarne Gospels; \\"The Israelites Turn Against God\\" features a contemporary bronze idol of Baal; the story of \\"Jesus Before Pilate\\" includes images of Roman coins issued by Pontinus Pilate.)* The DK Children's Bible is a historical atlas. The Old and New Testament section introductions both include a two-page map of the ancient Middle East with place names labeled. This helps makes things like the distance between Nazareth and Bethlehem easily comprehensible. Smaller maps are interspersed through the text as appropriate. For example, the story of \\"Elijah in the Wilderness\\" includes a map that explains the relationship between the two kingdoms of Israel and Judah.* The DK Children's Bible is a historical reference work. In addition to the detailed introductions to the Old and New Testaments, the stories are interspersed with articles explaining the following eight topics that inform the world of the ancient Bible: The Patriarchs, Life in Egypt, Life in Canaan, Conquering Nations, Jesus of Galilee, Daily Life in Jesus' Time, The Early Church and Paul's Journeys. The various stories are also separately annotated with relevant historical facts. For example, story of \\"The Sermon on the Mount\\" includes a discussion of the Mount of Beatitudes as a probable location for Jesus' speech.* The DK Children's Bible is a biographical dictionary. At the back of the book, a four-page \\"Who's Who in the Bible Stories\\" summarizes the identities of notable Bible characters and refers the reader back to the appropriate stories. For example, \\"Abednego: One of Daniel's three friends. Pages 162-164.\\"Overall, this is an outstanding book that has a place in every literate child's home."},{"Title":"The Children's Illustrated Bible","review":"Although small in size, The Children's Illustrated Bible provides accurate information on stories and characters of the Bible.

I bought it for my daughter back when she was in first grade and began reading it to her then. We've read through it many, many times together--usually one story a night (they're only 1 to 3 pages long). And now that she's in third grade, she still enjoys it and continues to read it on her own. There are maps, timelines, and overviews, as well as other interesting facts and photos inserted along the margins that help the child (and adult) understand cultural details of the time. Depending on the attention span of your child, you can read as little or as much of it as you like.My only problem with the book is that it completely omits the conversation between Jesus and Nicodemus in the third chapter of John's gospel (i.e., John 3:16.) Hello? Isn't this a major point of Christianity? The chance that a lot of adults may never get around to looking it up turns this into a major oversight."},{"Title":"The Children's Illustrated Bible","review":"Length:: 0:33 MinsThis book is well composed.The illustrations and photographs are beautiful and interesting.Many photos show ancient things we normally don't see today.I recommend this for adults as well as children.The writing is very easily understood and you'll love the pictures.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Children's Illustrated Bible","review":"The book was beautiful - but I was expecting to be able to actually read it - it has minute font size. My son saw it and loved it immediately - maybe because it is small and he loves the pictures - but the print is REALLY small & uncomfortable for me to read to him."},{"Title":"The Children's Illustrated Bible","review":"First, this Bible is nicely illustrated with age-appropriate stories throughout. It follows the chronology of the Scriptures and like someone else pointed out, doesn't \\"dumb down\\" the stories. In appearance, this is a very good book, which is why I bought it in the first place.That said, once you begin reading it, the \\"emperors clothes\\" begin to show. The author uses phrases like \\"In Jesus time, people believed...\\" as if this is something no longer believed. In every story, almost without exception, subtle phrases cast a shadow of doubt on the Bible as the Word of God. The hints and suggestions would lead you to believe that the Bible is just a collection of old stories and tales from the past and has no relevance for us today.For this, I give this book a minimal rating. If you're trying to teach your kids to love the Bible, you're better off giving them a real Bible and taking time to lead them through a study of Scripture. Avoid this bit of subtly undermining literature and spend your money elsewhere."},{"Title":"The Children's Illustrated Bible","review":"I ordered this book and was disappointed in the confusing layout of the pages. It was cluttered with many side bars. This makes it difficult for young readers to gather information on a page. The print is too tiny.

A terrific present!"},{"Title":"The Children's Illustrated Bible","review":"I saw this bible at a bookstore, but didn't buy it because it was less expensive on Amazon. I didn't realize that this bible was miniature compared to the full sized bible at the bookstore.

I would not purchase this book again, and will probably return this one. Very disappointed."},{"Title":"Enterprise Java Security: Building Secure J2EE Applications","review":"One of the major benefits of J2EE is its security functionality. But most books about J2EE have not given enough depth to its security features.Enterprise Java 2 Security: Building Secure and Robust J2EE Applications gives J2EE software developers a great reference to use in building secure Java applications.Chapters 1 and 2 provide a methodical overview of the underlying Java technology and the security functionality. The rest of the chapters provide a comprehensive synopsis of all of the J2EE security features including JCA, JSE, SSL hooks, JSSE and more.The books strong point is that it covers all of the core security features and provides excellent sample code.The only drawback to the book is that it is light on real-world examples of J2EE security. It is heavy on the \`about' aspect, but light on the \`how' side of things. It would have also been helpful if there would be an accompanying web site where code samples could have been provided.Overall, Enterprise Java 2 Security: Building Secure and Robust J2EE Applications is a solid reference for all of the major J2EE security topics."},{"Title":"Enterprise Java Security: Building Secure J2EE Applications","review":"The first thing to say to anyone considering buying a book on the topic of enterprise Java security is that the topic is vast and constantly changing. No single book could satisfy every need. That being said, this book comes as close as any one book is likely to. I've been using this book for several weeks now and I have found it extremely valuable.Since I make my living helping people write better Java code I was dismayed by the assumption in some of the code examples that FileInputStream's available() method is guaranteed to return the total size of the file. (The code on pages 430-431 is just one example.)A loop is required for code that must work every time.Since I didn't find any infomation in the book about where to submit errors or comments I will mention one more--admittedly small--item here: on page 363 \\"9\\" is printed where \\"q\\" is meant. It's an interesting typo because it suggests this portion of the manuscript may have been originally written by hand and then transcribed by someone non-technical. Or perhaps I've been studying cryptography so much lately I'm starting to decrypt things that aren't there.I would recommend this book to anyone seeking detailed and authoritative information on any aspect of J2EE security from the low level cryptography to high level architecture."},{"Title":"Enterprise Java Security: Building Secure J2EE Applications","review":"The book covers J2EE 1.3 security with hello-world level security examples beyond I find nothing but an introductory Java Security API guide.

And once that happens, you need to know who is asking for the data and whether they should be allowed to see it. You need to start understanding how security works in the Java world. And Enterprise Java Security is a good place to start gaining that knowledge.The authors cover a lot of different concepts and technologies in this book. While nearly any of the subjects (like cryptography or web services security) could be expanded into a book in its own right, enough information is provided to give you the concepts necessary to grasp the essentials. From there, you can continue in your learning for the areas that apply to your situation. As I continue on in my Java education, I'll be able to use this book to come up to speed more quickly than I would be able to if I had to find the resources in multiple other places.Code junkies may be a little frustrated with the book, in that there's more concept than code. While there are coding examples, you'll see less than you may be used to (or may want). I view it this way... I'd use this book to get an overview of Java cryptography. Once I understood the fundamentals, I'd seek out a book that dealt specifically with that subject to take me beyond the basics. But by understanding \\"what I don't know\\" first, I'll be better prepared to get the most out of more advanced texts with plenty of code included.ConclusionA good selection for Java developers and architects who need a comprehensive overview and understanding of security for Java-based systems and environments. From here, you can delve more deeply into the specific areas that apply to your project or environment."},{"Title":"Enterprise Java Security: Building Secure J2EE Applications","review":"This book is titled wrong and absolute mess. This books claims coverage on building robust J2EE security - But unfortunately it lacks and missing a lot of J2EE security features. Particularly There is no discussion on how to adopt role based security, propogating security at all tiers, JAX-RPC and EJB Endpoint security and so on. This book only offers a very basic level of securing a J2EE application beyond that YOU WILL BE BORED TO TEARS."},{"Title":"Enterprise Java Security: Building Secure J2EE Applications","review":"This book makes me nostalgic for the early SAMS Publishing Unleashed series of books on Java. Remember when you first learned what a servlet was? That's the feeling I get when reading Enterprise Java Security. The book does a good job explaining how Secure Sockets Layer (SSL,) object-level security, Kerberos, and legacy security came about. It then shows detailed examples with sample code how to implement each of the security techniques. The text is surprisingly complete, including coverage of Web Service Security protocols and techniques."},{"Title":"Enterprise Java Security: Building Secure J2EE Applications","review":"Security is a topic which often seems to be given too little thought. This book gives a hand for the J2EE developer new to security on a Java platform and, especially, on the J2EE platform.The book has been split into five parts. I have gathered my thoughts about each in their separate paragraphs below.Part I discusses about the needs of enterprise application security in general, and how these needs are associated with the J2EE components on a two or three-tier architecture, illustrated with pretty pictures of firewalls etc. The discussion is high-level in nature and acts mainly as a smooth entry into the mind-set of implementing security into your application.Part II takes the focus inside J2EE and shows what kind of handles the J2EE architecture provides for security-related services such as authentication and authorization. Basically, this part of the book explains the programmatic and declarative security for web applications and Enterprise JavaBean components. The writing is very easy to understand but I would've liked to see one or two complete examples of a deployment descriptor instead of just small snippets. To me, seeing a full example would seem like a great way to tie things up in the context.Part III, titled &quot;The Foundations of Java 2 Security&quot;, is something I'm sure I'll come back to when I have to deal with J2SE security. The authors describe the whole shebang from class loaders to security managers and the horde of different types of permissions. This part also includes a chapter about the Java Authentication and Authorization Service (JAAS), which is top-notch amongst those I've seen about the subject. Clear writing combined with precise and illustrative examples. The one topic that could've deserved some concrete usage help were the command-line utilities such as keytool and jarsigner. Also, applet security was only mentioned in passing (the word &quot;applet&quot; can't even be found from the index), which may or may not be significant for the reader.Part IV is dedicated to the art of cryptography. After presenting the basics of cryptographic algorithms, secret and public-key cryptography, the authors continue by discussing how the selected algorithms affect the confidentiality, integrity, authenticity, and non-repudiation properties of data. The chapters also discuss digital signatures, certificates, and key distribution on a high level. The rest of the fourth part shows how the JCA and JCE frameworks are built (i.e. how the pluggable implementation architecture works) and how the relevant APIs are used. The Java Secure Socket Extension (JSSE) for SSL is also presented with a couple of very nice examples including server and client authentication.The fifth and final part talks about &quot;advanced&quot; topics such as web services security and some security considerations for container providers (which seems a bit out-of-place in this book). The subjects are covered only very superficially, which is understandable because the area of web services security admittedly requires a whole book to discuss in detail.I can recommend this book as a solid source of information for J2EE security topics. Accompanied with vendor-specific documentation on deployment and configuration issues, you probably won't need anything else for your security needs. Its biggest weakness, in my opinion, is the lack of more complete sample code which could've at least been published online."},{"Title":"Enterprise Java Security: Building Secure J2EE Applications","review":"If you know nothing about Java Security, this book will be a good book for you to fly over the air and see what's inside J2EE security. It basically covers Java security architecture, EJB and web Application security, plus an overview on PKCS and S/MIME and Web Services security.If you have known about JCA, JCE, JAAS, JSSE, you have known half of the book's content. If you have developed EJB and Web applications, you have known another quarter of this book."},{"Title":"Enterprise Java Security: Building Secure J2EE Applications","review":"* This book helps me a LOT to understand programmatic approach, why Java security is a key factor in an e-business environment.* The book shows me the J2EE and J2SE security architecture, showing how these architectures relate to each other and how they are augmented by JAAS.* I feel for the developers who need to build J2EE applications, securely and reliably, the book covers relationship between J2EE and Cryptographic technologies; like Java Cryptography Architecture, Java Cryptography Extension, Public-Key cryptography Standards, Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions, and Java Secure Socket Extension."},{"Title":"Enterprise Java Security: Building Secure J2EE Applications","review":"I read book of JAVA 2 Network Security (2nd Edition) by \\"marco pistoia\\" three years ago and I liked it a lot. I am glad to see his new book on securify with more focus on J2EE securities.There are five parts of this book, part I discusses needs of enterprise application security in high level, part II puts focus on J2EE and shows how to handle security for Servlets, JSP, EJB, part III describes J2SE security like ClassLoaders, JAAS, Keytool, jarsigner, JASS, etc, part IV covers cryptography in a whole, including JCA and JCE frameworks, part V is dedicated to \\"advanced&quot; topics such as web services security and some security considerations for container providers.This book puts lots of effort to explain how to use java security in enterprise applications, I think it's very helpful to understand the java securities.I appreciated its effort on the J2EE security and \\"advanced\\" topics on web services and some considerations for container providers, which are not easy to find in other resources.The only weakness of this book is the lack of complete examples. I hope it will be provided at least online. I think one may need some other resources with more examples when using this book."},{"Title":"Enterprise Java Security: Building Secure J2EE Applications","review":"As companies move to expand their presence on the web beyond mere read-only brochureware, then java has become the preferred choice of language in which to write the web server side and, though to a lesser extent, even the client side. The book explains why this became so; like the fact that java now runs on most computers, enabling a development of code that can be easily migrated to different computers.But the opening up of a company's computers to the web has a downside. It exposes the company to a broad range of attacks; far more so than the traditional glass house mainframe with the occasionaly modem dialin. So an adopter of java for enterprise computing might reasonably ask: Can java provide adequate security?The book is devoted to answering that question. The authors expound on a slew of acronymic laden methods: JCA, JCE, PKCS, JSSE. All under the rubric of J2EE, which is the enterprise version of J2SE. It helps in many chapters to be versed in XML. The configuration files (&quot;deployment descriptors&quot;) are all in XML. Acquaintance with the rudiments of public key cryptography wouldn't hurt either.There is one advantage of the book which the authors modestly decline to point out. The book says that all the authors are from IBM. But it doesn't say one way in which this is a plus. A certain unnamed company in Seattle keeps murmuring that java is owned by Sun, and that should you use java, you are tying your company's future to Sun, which has had revenue problems lately.But J2EE and J2SE and JCA (etc) are massively supported by other computer firms. IBM most prominently amongst these. In fact, IBM claims that its java effort is second only to Sun's. This book is a good statement of that."},{"Title":"Enterprise Java Security: Building Secure J2EE Applications","review":"The book starts off with an overview of Java and security landscape with quick introductions to things like Java Cryptography Architecture (JCA), Java Cryptography Extension (JCE), Java Authentication and Authorization Service (JAAS), Java Secure Socket Extension (JSSE) and PKI. This chapter does a great job of introducing all of the security features in the Java platform and how they fit in the standard application development framework. There is a really nice picture on page 9 that sums up all of the security providers, services and components and how they fit together in J2SE and J2EE. After the introduction, the book moves into a discussion about firewall and some network architecture discussion.The second section (Chapter 3) of the book deals with J2EE security model. This section starts with a quick intro the J2EE components before moving into a discussion of the J2EE security roles and authorization model. After a quick example of using declarative security with EJB's, the authors then discuss authentication in the realm of HTTP and web applications with a quick intro to basic, form and certificate based authentication. The authors recommend the use of declarative security over programmatic security as a best-practice. I have to agree with that assessment and recommendation completely. But there are instances where declarative security is not possible and you have to resort to programmatic security. The chapter shows some simple code example to validate security role of a user in an EJB, and fetching user information in a web application.The next section of the book deals with JavaServer Pages (JSP) and Servlet security. The section starts with a quick intro of Servlets, Servlet life cycle, before moving into the authentication section. At first, the simple HTTP authentication mechanism is explained with a nice breakdown of the HTTP status code sent from the server to the browser along with a description of how the username and password are encoded on the client side. I really like the way this section was written as it didn't leave any ambiguity in how the process works. After basic authentication, we move on to Form-based authentication which is explained very simply along with the appropriate snippet that belongs in your web.xml file. Once again, the explanation and graphic does a great job of breaking down the authentication process down to the http communication between the browser and server. This section also briefly describes certificate-based authentication and single sing-on.After authentication, the section moves on the authorization or the roles part of the puzzle. In reading this section, I learned something new and really interesting. There is discussion of the RequestDispatcher object that allows you to use the forward() or include() method to create an invocation chain. In that scenario, the web container only authorizes the first invocation and not every forward or include that are part of the process. There is also discussion about how to use security-constraints to protect a single page, URL, or URL pattern. After declarative security, the chapter moves to programmatic security with discussion of the javax.security.Principal object, role reference and mapping in web.xml. The chapter then moves on to discuss some usage pattern and best practices on how to use cookies, SSL and HttpSession. I was pleasantly surprised to a see a simple Servlet Filter example to restrict a set of users from any application. The next section of the book covers EJB security starting with a quick intro to EJBs and the moves into EJB security and method authorization.The next section of the book deal with J2SE security. This section starts with the class loader and how the default class loader and the whole delegation process works. I really liked the section on class loading process, the delegation hierarchy, bytecode verifier, security manager and privileged code. In fact, I really liked this chapter and re-read it several times. The section on the SecurityManager is very comprehensive and probably the best explanation I've read about the topic. The next chapter breaks down the Java permission model in great detail including the Java security policy. Most people that use the -D parameter to specify the java.security.manager and java.security.policy don't really understand the details behind those command line parameters really need to read this chapter.The next chapter describes the Java Authentication and Authorization Service (JAAS) in great detail. This chapter is full of example code that walks you through the JAAS framework. I really like the treatment given to JAAS as it very comprehensive and very well written. This is also one of those chapters I re-read several times. I've been using JAAS for almost 2 years now and I still found this to be very educational and the included Java code made concepts very easy to understand and follow.After JAAS, the book moves on to Cryptography and its role in terms of Enterprise security. This three chapter section starts off with the theory of cryptography and then describes JCA and JCE framework in great details. This was not of great interest to me personally and so I skimmed most of this section. After JCA/JCE, the book moves on to public-key cryptography and S/MIME.The next chapter focuses on Secure Socket Layer (SSL) or Transport Layer Security (TLS). I love the section on the SSL handshake as it simplifies and explain this very complex interaction. This section also has a lot of Java code that helps illustrate some of the complex concepts including using and creating the keystore and using client authentication with certificate.The next chapter discusses security for Web Services and discusses topics such as XML Signature, Security Services Markup Language (SAML) and WS-Security. After Web Services, the book discusses security consideration that must be taken into account by container providers.In conclusion, this is the best book I have ever read dealing with the topic of security. This is also the best Java security book and is a very comprehensive guide to anyone working with Java. This book belongs in every developer's bookcase and he/she really needs to understand these concepts. If you are looking for a book that overwhelms you with code, this is not it. Instead this is a great tutorial book that uses Java code where appropriate but relies on great writing and explanation of the security framework and components. I highly recommend this book and I know this is going to be handy reference for me."},{"Title":"Enterprise Java Security: Building Secure J2EE Applications","review":"This book is a nice, general, \\"white paper\\" type overview of security in Java. The authors demonstrate a good, solid understanding of J2EE security. However, they don't provide enough in the way of actual implementation examples. I feel this is a major shortcoming of the book.The book starts with a general overview of security and then moves on to using applets with RMI through a firewall. The next section deals with Servlets, JSP, and EJB security and shows us some deployment descriptors and a few code samples but not enough to get a firm grasp on how to implement security. Part 3 discusses the basics of Java security. Part 4 discusses cryptography. The final part discusses advanced topics including a way too brief chapter on web services.In general the book spends too much space discussing security topics and not nearly enough space demonstrating how to use the information provided. The book tends to be too technical in ways that are generally not interesting to Java developers. For example, does a developer really need this: \\"One straightforward application of the one-way function to DH is to have two entities to publicly agree on a point P on an elliptic curve E over a finite field, where p is a very large prime number.\\"I think this book may be very useful in combination with another book that is much more example driven, \\"J2EE Security for Servlets, EJBs, and Web Services\\" by Pankaj Kumar."},{"Title":"Enterprise Java Security: Building Secure J2EE Applications","review":"If you are new to Java security, you will definitely benefit from reading this book; you may even enjoy it. Other reviewers have described the book's content quite well, so I will not do this again. I just want to mention that the book is written well and provides a solid explanation of security issues, patterns, and solutions.As one of the reviewers noted below, the title of the book is misleading: &quot;enterprise Java&quot; has a reserved meaning that implies J2EE -specific technologies; the authors paid much more attention to Java security in general, than specifically to security usage under J2EE. While a drawback, the dissonance between the title and the content does not diminish the quality and value of the writing.I disagree with another reviewer regarding &quot;theoretical junk&quot;. Some people need to understand and validate their understanding by delving deeper into reasoning, while others can't wait to crank out the code without any respect for the necessity of using this or that solution. There are architects and there are coders, and respectfully all sorts of books addressing different approaches to utilizing technologies. For example, for a more detailed exploration of J2EE security usage check out &quot;J2EE Security for Servlets, EJBs, and Web Services&quot; by Pankaj Kumar: it has plenty of detailed instructions and code examples."},{"Title":"Enterprise Java Security: Building Secure J2EE Applications","review":"If you are an architect who really serious about building security to your J2EE applications, then this book would offer only a hello world to security.

More importantly this book is completely disorganized...meaning that this book discusses on J2EE component security on chapters 3,4,5 and the basic Java platform security on chapters 7, 8, 9. It looks like the author discussing about the security foundation after constructing the components...sounds funny. To the most disappointment, there is no chapter to show how to put-to-gether all these APIs in a real world J2EE application (as they claim in the title). Why should I read the book if it is repeating the API examples from the Java site. The chapter on Web services security is a Joke, shows the authors lack of understanding on Web services security fundamentals.This book is nothing but a theoretical junk with no proof. After browsing all the pages, I don't find anything which show how to build a working security architecture.

The look from inside the clubhouse opened doors which until now have stayed shut and made Tony La Russa look more human to me and a lot of other people. The book also clarified the lonelines of the manager's job and how hard it must be to live without family and friends. Great read and highly recommended to all baseball fans, this book makes me wonder if Buzz Bissinger's other books are just as good."},{"Title":"Three Nights in August: Strategy, Heartbreak, and Joy: Inside the Mind of a Manager","review":"This is Bissinger's account of a three game series between the St. Louis Cardinals and Chicago Cubs. Interspersed with the story of the games, is the story of Tony LaRussa. The reader is treated to the story of LaRussa's life, his struggles and the vagaries of being a manager in MLB today. Interspersed is the back story of each of the pivotal players in the series, as well as a description of Darryl Kile, who died during that season. Bissinger does a great job of mixing game action with the thoughts and feelings of those involved.The most compelling aspect of the story is the description of how LaRussa strategizes for each game, makes decisions, and manages in the late innings. He truly is one of the most masterful managers out there. Bissinger does get a bit too admiring in his descriptions, to the point where you wonder if LaRussa was the one who actually wrote certain bits of the book. I know Tony's smart, but he's not Einstein. This is a minor quibble, and the rest of the book more than makes up for this small shortcoming.A definite keeper, and a great book for baseball fans."},{"Title":"Three Nights in August: Strategy, Heartbreak, and Joy: Inside the Mind of a Manager","review":"My husband is a baseball fan so I bought this book for him, he loves it. The book is very well presented with a great cover picture.I live in Australia and it did not take long for this book to arrive here to us. I am very impressed with the company's service, and prices.Thank-you Amazon."},{"Title":"Three Nights in August: Strategy, Heartbreak, and Joy: Inside the Mind of a Manager","review":"Speaking as a very casual baseball fan with an extremely limited understanding of the game, I have to say I loved this book.This is a lovingly crafted account of a three-game series between the Cardinals and the Cubs in the summer of 2003. It tracks the strategizing of Cards manager Tony La Russa as he fights for the crucial wins that he hopes will give his team the momentum needed to carry them into October.The writing is exquisite. Like an ace pitcher tossing his best stuff in a big game, Bissinger seamlessly mixes in joy, heartbreak, tension, and humor. There are enough statistics and tactics and historical references to satisfy the serious fan, but the box scores and decimal points are animated by intricate personal tales and nail-biting retellings of the key events in the series. Each game is relayed as though it were a protracted military campaign in which every deed, whether heroic or dastardly, is worthy of the historian's pen.One of the best sections is, sadly, one of the most heartwrenching. That is the story of beloved Cardinals pitcher Darryl Kine, who died of a heart attack at age 33, leaving behind a wife, three kids, and clubhouse full of brokenhearted men who suddenly ask themselves what is so important about hitting a ball around a field.Some reviewers have slammed the book for supposedly staking out a stance diametrical to that of Michael Lewis's Moneyball, which used the example of Oakland manager Billy Beane to argue that statistical analysis was a far more powerful tool for assessing a player's ability than a scout's gut feeling. The criticism is misplaced. Bissinger mentions Moneyball in the preface, calling it \\"provocative\\", then goes on to say:\\"This book was not conceived as a response to Moneyball. Work began months before La Russa or I had ever heard of Lewis's work.\\"Throughout the book's entire 280 pages, there are a couple -- two, maybe three -- oblique references to guys who mistakenly think that stats can tell the complete story of a player.But of course Three Nights is not a refutation of Moneyball, if Moneyball is broadly about winning games by crunching numbers. That is readily apparent from the simple fact that La Russa and his staff rely heavily on statistics to do their jobs. They analyze the past performances of each hitter in the lineup against all the possible pitchers he will face. They agonize over tactical decisions, running through ridiculous-sounding scenarios such as: \\"So-and-so is only 1 for 9 facing right-handed pitchers with men on base and two outs in late innings\\". I exaggerate, but you get the idea.Of course, Moneyball can be read more narrowly, with the key takeaways being that on-base percentage is the only stat that matters, and that bunting, sacrifice flies and stealing do more harm than good in the long run. But even in that case, Three Nights is less a refutation than an alternative view, one that perhaps merits as much attention. After all, La Russa has coached four teams to the World Series, winning one of them. That's something that Beane, for all his talent and managing savvy, is still dreaming of."},{"Title":"Three Nights in August: Strategy, Heartbreak, and Joy: Inside the Mind of a Manager","review":"I have been a baseball fan for over 35 years, and this book is perhaps the best I've read about the inner workings or \\"game within the game\\" of baseball.

As an avid chess player, I often read chess strategy books and get engrossed in the mental challenges of the game. I have always tried to delve deeper into the mental aspects of baseball as I have gotten older. This book offered a great insight into how the game really feels and how difficult the decisions really are for a manager. Being a life-long Cardinals fan, this book was a no-brainer for me. But, Cardinals bias aside, the attention to detail and excitement of this book was there, whether or not you care about the Cardinals. Kudos to Bissinger who really knows how to write exciting sports books. A must buy for anyone who loves the mental game of baseball and wants a deeper look into the \\"x's and o's\\" of the game."},{"Title":"Three Nights in August: Strategy, Heartbreak, and Joy: Inside the Mind of a Manager","review":"Mr. Bissinger (\\"Friday Night Lights\\" - one of the best sports books ever written) takes us behind the scenes during a critical 3 game series between the Cards and the Cubs.

I like the storyline and I just think it tried to take some subtle shots at Lewis' book \\"Moneyball\\" when it shouldn't have. And this goes for in general if you're going to take your shots at \\"Moneyball\\", in order for it to be effective, you have to be indirect.Then again, I enjoyed this book. Bissinger writes really well still, hopefully he'll do it again."},{"Title":"Three Nights in August: Strategy, Heartbreak, and Joy: Inside the Mind of a Manager","review":"St.Louis Cardinals manager Tony La Russa hired Buzz Bissinger (\\"Friday Night Lights\\") to pen this study of a three-game series between the Cardinals and Chicago Cubs in August 2003. It's a good read, but won't be of much interest to a non-baseball fan. Bissinger clearly read Daniel Okrent's \\"Nine Innings\\" before he sat down to write, for Okrent's book is a detailed look at a single 1982 game, with analysis of personalities, baseball lore, tactics, and psychology sprinkled in as the game goes along. Fortunately, and unlike \\"Nine Innings\\", this book lets a few pitches go by in the name of a smooth and lively narrative. So readers don't get bogged down in too many details but can get through the three-game series in 250 pages. Bissinger clearly knows his audience, since the Cardinals big year wasn't 2003 and the season covered by this narrative, but rather 2004 when the team went to the World Series. So the author apends a few pages at the end describing the fates of some of the key players and the 2004 season -- certain to satisfy any Cardinal fan.The most interesting sections are the discussions of the personalities of the players. Even La Russa, driven and manic and oblivious to the damage he is doing to his own marriage, is not quite as interesting as some of the athletes. There is Cal Eldred's journey from New York phenomenon to effective elder statesman; there is Kerry Robinson, who over-estimates his own talents and squeaks by with the occasional ability to have startling success; there is Yoda-like pitching coach Dave Duncan; the frustrating wasted talents of JD Drew and Garret Stephenson. And of course, there is the great Albert Pujols, with a talent so majestic and sublime that he may eventually rank among the handful of greatest players ever.\\"3 Nights in August\\" is a fun read for baseball fans, and particularly Cardinal fans. Bissinger is a bit rah-rah in his devotion to La Russa, who paid him to write this book, but the cheering --like the book-- is all in fun."},{"Title":"Three Nights in August: Strategy, Heartbreak, and Joy: Inside the Mind of a Manager","review":"Buzz Bissinger's Three Nights in August is his best effort yet -which says much, given the Pulitzer Prize winner's achievements with Friday Night Lights and A Prayer for the City. Three Nights in August is a marvelous blend of insights into baseball technique and strategy (information that will intrigue even the most knowledgeable of the sport) and revelations about the human condition, particularly in the context of teamwork, role-palying and leadership. This tightly written book, which uses as its setting a three-game series between the St. Louis Cardinals and the Chicago Cubs in the heat of a division race, is one of substance. Anyone who has not read the book and might believe it to be just another cookie-cutter, pedestrian \\"as told to\\" vanity piece is sorely mistaken. Like Bissinger's previous works, this is a must-read."},{"Title":"Three Nights in August: Strategy, Heartbreak, and Joy: Inside the Mind of a Manager","review":"3 Nights in August is an awesome look at baseball and why it is such a great game. Buzz Bissinger follows Tony LaRussa around and chronicles a 3 game series with the Cubs. There are plenty of asides - histories of players, coaches, strategy think sessions, etc. It really brought baseball to life for me. For too many years I have lived through \\"fantasy\\" baseball, numbers flying at me through the internet. That is no way to enjoy baseball. To enjoy it through the eyes of a manager and a team that love the game - that was something very fun.However, if you don't like baseball, you probably will be bored silly throughout this book. But you never know - give it a chance and you may appreciate the game a little bit more."},{"Title":"Three Nights in August: Strategy, Heartbreak, and Joy: Inside the Mind of a Manager","review":"Bissinger's book isn't as inspiring as FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS, but he's a careful stylist, and the depth of his take on manager Tony LaRussa may never be equalled. Tony's fights and reconciliations with his wife, Elaine, over family issues and how to work out a long distance marriage are part of the book, a big part, and any honest reader will see both sides to the story and will come away with admiration for both LaRussa's for trying to handle a difficult issue in public.Darryl Kile's death, which ironically occurred in Chicago, the city with which St Louis has such a great rivalry, is presented here in moving detail. I feel sorry for Flynn, Kile's lovely wife, and their children. Their little boy is maybe three or four now and yet he will never know his father.The story of Rick Ankiel is treated more lightly, and will keep you in stitches. Ankiel, the pride of Fort Pierce, comes off in Bissinger's aphoristic prose as a bit of a flake.The three games Bissinger writes about are thrillingly presented, but when I closed the book it all seemed to have happened so long ago, particularly because only in the past year or so has the issue really been broached about steroid use. LaRussa seems honest about this, but it's hard to tell how much he's covering his own ass about rampant steroid use on his team and what he knew about it. After Jose Canseco's book and congressional hearings into the matter, maybe the real story will have to wait until a few more players die brutal and unexpected deaths. Or perhaps, as Canseco implies, you're not really a man if you can't handle the drugs that go with baseball.I must also add a word in favor of LaRussa's work with the Animal Rescue people. No matter what people say about Tony, you know his heart is in the right place, and this animal work is nothing new for him, he's been into it for eons. Good for him. If St Louis ever tires of T, there's a place for him reserved at Rainbow Bridge."},{"Title":"Three Nights in August: Strategy, Heartbreak, and Joy: Inside the Mind of a Manager","review":"This is another wonderful book by Buzz Bissinger. It is not only entertaining, but also enlightening. But what else would we expect from a collaboration between a top writer and one of baseball's best managers? \\"Three Nights in August\\" rates as one of my three favorite reads this 2005 season -- with \\"Hank Aaron and the Home Run That Changed America\\" and \\"The Luckiest Man Alive.\\" All three are superb."},{"Title":"Three Nights in August: Strategy, Heartbreak, and Joy: Inside the Mind of a Manager","review":"It's hard to believe the Tony LaRussa in 3 Nights in August is the same expressionless man I see in the dugout every Cardinals game.I'm a huge baseball fan and a coach, and I recommend this book to every ball player before he begins playing in high school. The book was educational for me as a coach, and I wish I'd have read it when I was playing. As a fan, it's easy for me disagree with a manager's decisions when he puts in a .230 average utility infielder in a close game, but two of my favorite topics in the book are the importance of bench management and developing younger players.My only complaint about the book is Buzz Bissinger's vocabulary. I read because I enjoy it and it keeps my mind sharp. I have reasonable intelligence and a decent vocabulary. But I think Bissinger, like too many authors, sacrifices the flow of the story to boast his own vocabulary, and, in the process, he makes the reader feel intellectually-inferior. Any word that isn't used at least rarely in a conversation should be equally absent in a book. It's frustrating when I'm reading about baseball and I have to stop to figure out or look up the meaning of words like leitmotif.Aside from the abundance of unnecessary foreign words, I loved the book. Bissinger did a great job of showing the different personalities of the Cardinals players, coaches, and behind-the-scenes workers."},{"Title":"Three Nights in August: Strategy, Heartbreak, and Joy: Inside the Mind of a Manager","review":"This book taps into the incredible baseball mind of Tony La Russa, who has managed three great teams - the White Sox, the A's, and now the Cardinals - and spent 40 years studying and absorbing the game. Bissinger is a great fly on the wall - Friday Night Lights is one of my favorite books of all time - and his inside the dugout view is informative, interesting, and occasionally very moving. The chapter about Darryl Kile had me in tears. Buy this for any baseball fan in your life."},{"Title":"Three Nights in August: Strategy, Heartbreak, and Joy: Inside the Mind of a Manager","review":"This book gives a good look into the strategy that TLR uses in his management style. If I wasn't a Cardinals fan I probably wouldn't have enjoyed this book as well. I will likely re-read this book."},{"Title":"Three Nights in August: Strategy, Heartbreak, and Joy: Inside the Mind of a Manager","review":"3 Nights in August provides an interesting narrative to talk about a baseball team including the players, managers and all of the supporting staff. By limiting the book to just one series of three games, it uses small incidents to imply season-long issues. Yet, the author does blend in backstory to provide context.This is one of the first books I have read that effectively counters sabermetric studies by giving more a detailed view of how a manager is treating particular players on a given night. The book includes glimpses such as LaRussa trying to manage the hurt feelings of millionaire players. Rather than showing sympathy for anyone, it provides a straight look at why LaRussa, who has never been known as a softie, must balance player personalities with their skills or risk having professionals act unprofessional.Since the book is essentially told from LaRussa's point of view, it does gloss over some of the most significant criticisms of the manager. However, that is not the point. Since LaRussa is known for being a manager who feels the weight of every loss, this does a nice job of communicating how last night's game impacts this manager's view of tonight's game. All-in-all, I would recommend the book to any baseball fan who wants a closer look into the dugout."},{"Title":"Three Nights in August: Strategy, Heartbreak, and Joy: Inside the Mind of a Manager","review":"3 Nights in August is a very solid baseball book, one that should be enjoyable to any baseball fan. It is interesting to see how an accomplished manager thinks throughout the game, not only about the specific strategies of the three games in question, but also about his players, about players on other teams and about other issues in baseball. While describing the accounts of an important three game series in August, 2003 against the Chicago Cubs, Bissinger also tells us about how Tony La Russa, the manager of the St. Louis Cardinals, thinks about some general baseball issues. These issues include: throwing at hitters, handling individual players, looking at statistics as a guide only, steroids, and family life.Some of his ideas are controversial. For example, it seems La Russa believes that any opponent pitcher that hits one of his batters did it on purpose. In particular, a pitch thrown by Kerry Wood in the second game of the three game series grazes the shirt of Pujols. It doesn't even hit any skin, muscle or bone, just nicks the shirt. In baseball, this is still considered a hit-batsman, and Pujols is awarded first base. However, La Russa still has vengeance in his head, and it is described how he plans to plunk Sosa, and is perturbed when his pitcher does not do the job correctly in the following innings. An eye for an eye, anytime his hitters gets hit, he wants to go after their guys. That's La Russa's philosophy, and in my opinion, it's a dangerous one and a stupid one. If he's going to plunk Sosa, what would stop the opposing manager from taking retaliation himself - especially if Pujols was not even hit, but it only nicked the shirt? I'll bet if La Russa was in the manager of the opposing team too, he would look at a possible Sosa plunking as reason to go after another one of the Cardinal hitters. And that's how these beanbrawls escalate.The book also covers a bit about La Russa's views on steroids. He's one of the few people in baseball that admits that he had an inkling that baseball players, on his team and others as well, were using them. However what bothers me about the account about steroids in this book is the lack of insight into Mark McGwire. La Russa was his manager for many years with Oakland and St. Louis. Yet the discussion in this book is more on Canseco than McGwire. There's even a bit of propaganda that Bissinger writes: \\"He (McGwire) was big when he came into the league in 1986...\\" This was mentioned to mean that McGwire didn't get all that big, therefore he wasn't on steroids. But anyone who has ever seen one of McGwire's rookie baseball cards (just hit it up on ebay and you can find one) can easily see that by 1998, McGwire was about four times as big as he was back in his rookie season in 1986. He was a twig back then, a tall lanky guy with a long swing. In 1998, he was Paul Bunyon in real life, making even Sammy Sosa look like a little man. Why spend the time to harp on Canseco when McGwire is the more important baseball figure, and the one that La Russa knew more about? That was disappointing, but understandable since La Russa is still loyal to McGwire, but not to Canseco.As for some folks that think this is an anti-Moneyball book - it is not...definitely not. There is rare mention of Moneyball or sabremetrics.All in all, I thought this was a worthwhile book. Bissinger does a good job in relaying how La Russa thinks. Of course, not everyone is going to like or agree with every one of his thoughts, but the fact they were presented clearly and in an enjoyable way makes this book highly recommended."},{"Title":"Three Nights in August: Strategy, Heartbreak, and Joy: Inside the Mind of a Manager","review":"Great inside look at the game.

Just beautiful baseball.\\"Tony La Russa is one of the most successful managers in baseball history. Every game is a lengthy epic with countless stories and numerous subplots. La Russa is meticulous, always scheming for an edge. He and his army of coaches keep detailed notes on every player and every pitcher in the league including their own.Though the season may seem long and tedious, each game counts. A whole season can change in one game. La Russa knows this and he works tirelessly to win each day.Bissinger's 3 Nights in August is exhaustive look into the mind of Tony La Russa. Though the game has changed significantly over the years with home runs, deep bullpens, sabermetrics, and so on; nothing can replace experience.La Russa managed with an unmatched intensity though he remained stoic and poker-faced. With his retirement at the end of the 2011 season after the Cardinals magical comeback against the Texas Rangers, baseball lost one of its most respected managers.Anyone who loves baseball, who loves the nuances of the game, the joys and the heartbreaks, will love this book."},{"Title":"Three Nights in August: Strategy, Heartbreak, and Joy: Inside the Mind of a Manager","review":"I came away from 3 NIGHTS IN AUGUST with more respect for Tony LaRussa. Here is an old school manager that anyone who loves the game of baseball can appreciate. LaRussa in action and philosophy is not the pure antithesis of MONEYBALL. A better description would be a heartfelt antagonist. MONEYBALL can't measure the heart, and that is what LaRussa is looking for in addition to talent. Some have talents,others have heart, but the special ones, the winning ones, have both.A enjoyable read, but Bizzinger continues to be a little out of his element when he collaborates with others. A PRAYER FOR THE CITY and FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS both had his distinctive voice ringing through them. This feels more like a book written and then showed to LaRussa, and then rewritten, which makes it a bit long in the tooth by the end. Still quite good, and Bizzinger is a talent with heart, even if sometimes a little hot headed."},{"Title":"Three Nights in August: Strategy, Heartbreak, and Joy: Inside the Mind of a Manager","review":"One of baseball's great minds meets one of sportswriting's great pens to produce an outstanding picture of management in modern professional sports.The thread of a crucial three-game series ties together a fabric of exposition regarding Tony Larussa's approach to decision making, player shepherding, coping with events that force changes in strategy and tactics, and a patchwork of stories regarding about his players, competition, the people who taught him and their predecessors.The book makes highly informative and enjoyable reading for aficionados, a mind-expanding experience for less deeply involved fans, and a fine glimpse of a \\"man behind the curtain\\" wizard for anyone intrigued by mastermind managment."},{"Title":"Three Nights in August: Strategy, Heartbreak, and Joy: Inside the Mind of a Manager","review":"The NFL is great & maybe game for game more exciting. But I love baseball. Two more games & the NFL is outta here. From April to October, thru the dog days of summer baseball supplies my daily fix of escape from the real world. Three Days encapsulates so much of what baseball is in the format of a late season three game series between the Cards & Cubbies. Buzz Bissinger dissects the games pitch by pitch with the percision of an expert surgeon, through the baseball mind of Tony LaRussa mgr. of St. Louis. In his lifetime of baseball, you'd imagine, LaRussa has seen everything there is to see. You'd be incorrect. Everyday every pitch is new & feeds his love for the game. Buzz roams far & wide on his subject. Games played years ago & anaylyed pitch by pitch could get tedious. LaRussa's experiences provide the basis for many of the stories. Emotionally, LaRussa has experienced more ups & downs than a high speed elevator. Baseball is cruel, especially to relationships. Baseball is & always will be LaRussa's first love. He know this & so did his wife & his kids, now grown. It's very nature ensues long separations during the best time of the year, summertime. Hall of Fame baseball manager, not so much family man. I still admire him. Every pitch of every game has meaning. LaRussa believes in playing it the right way. Most baseball players don't know how & cettainly most fans don't. I've been a fan for 50 years &, swear if I worked at it I'd bee hard pressed to extract the right thing to do every pitch a fraction of the time. Tony does this for a living.

Of course, on and around the years the Detroit Tigers won the World Series (1968 and 1984), I paid attention. I even attended perhaps 5-10 games per season at old Tiger Stadium, when--in the era before the giant Government-Corporate Suck Machine (GCSM, pronounced \\"Jasism\\") kicked in--you could enjoy reserved seats close to the dugout for the price of taking your girlfriend out for a nice dinner. And the field was right there.Reading Three Nights in August nearly rekindles that excitement I used to feel for the game.

To create \\"3 Nights in August\\" (3NIA), he allowed Buzz Bissinger unprecedented access to his team, his staff, and his inner thoughts and feelings. There are still areas which are off limits, of course, but this access allowed Buzz Bissinger to create a more insightful baseball book than the typical \\"fan book\\". For those baseball fans who imagine themselves to be managers (which is probably most fans other than casual fans), 3NIA provides details on what the job is actually like - but it also leaves the fan/reader thirsting for even more.3NIA is a peak inside the mind of a major league manager, showing the pressures and challenges he has to deal with, and the decisions he has to make over the course of a season, a three game series with an arch-rival in a pennant race, and individual games and at bats. Baseball is a game with many layers and complexities, and 3NIA reveals many of the games within the game, the sub plots, and the background. First and foremost is the human element, in determining the composition of the team (the roster), the roles for the different players, and motivating them to perform their best (something that not even a master like La Russa is capable of doing all the time with all his players). Dealing with injuries, adversities and bruised egos is another major element of a manager's job, and 3NIA reveals many challenges in these areas that don't usually make the papers. This reminds us armchair managers that, when we criticize the decisions of the manager of our favorite team, we simply do not have access to all the information that he does.3NIA also delves into the strategic game decisions that a manager makes. These are important, and La Russa is definitely one of the more creative, innovative MLB managers in this respect, but 3NIA shows that managing the human element is even more important. As all managers do, La Russa has to decide when to punish, encourage and reward, and how best to use these tools to extract maximum performance from his players, some of whom care deeply about being the best they can be, and some who do not.3NIA also reveals the personal and lifestyle challenges that La Russa has faced over the course of his career as a manager. He himself is very dedicated to his job and being the best he can be, and his family has paid a significant price because of this.While Cardinal fans will appreciate 3NIA the most, the book definitely makes worthwhile reading for baseball fans in general."},{"Title":"Three Nights in August: Strategy, Heartbreak, and Joy: Inside the Mind of a Manager","review":"First of all, I am a die-hard Cards fan and a big TLR fan, but I think ANY true baseball fan will find this book a great read.

Bissinger makes us feel the loneliness LaRussa feels at the end of the dugout, shows how the emotional and physical demands of the game take a toll on his family, and gets into the minutia of three games to see how tiny behind-the-scenes decisions like putting on a hit-and-run or stealing another's teams signs can affect the outcome of a game.Weaved around these games are stories of the players, like comeback kid Cal Eldred, still pitching after four arm surgeries and more than 1,000 days between wins; or the insouciant JD Drew, too confident to play with heart. There is also the tragic tale of Darryl Kile, the Cards' pitcher found dead in June 2002 before a series against the Cubs. Bissinger finishes with a short narrative about the 2004 season, the year the Cards won their division with the best record in baseball, but were swept by the Red Sox in the World Series.\\"Three Nights in August\\" is lyrical without being overly romantic and factual without being overly analytical.

The sheer insight into the mind of one of baseball's best managers, Tony LaRussa, is staggering. Bissinger had the access which allows him to have the ability to portray all of the random and intricate thoughts going through LaRussa's mind, a batter, an inning, and sometimes before a game has even started. I loved the concept of this book, the 3 game series, a season within a season, and to study a rivalry such as the Cubs and Cardinals in such detail is a privilege.

This book shows that it is human nature, not necessarily statistics, that dictates the outcome of a ball game. The book gets into the decision making process which goes on in the dugout....when to bunt, when to steal, when to pull the pitcher who is starting to lose his stuff....and they are more than just decisions made by looking at statistics, but the author shows how instinct, logic, and emotion impact the game."},{"Title":"Three Nights in August: Strategy, Heartbreak, and Joy: Inside the Mind of a Manager","review":"This was an incredible book!

Life's too short. Another disclosure: I am a Cardinals fan and, like most Cardinals fans, felt the obligation to read this book. It's about a great subject (LaRussa and his chase for another championship - which, as we now know, was ultimately successful), but as a book, I've got to be honest. As most reviews of this work so irrelevantly point out, Bissinger is the author of \\"Friday Night Lights,\\" a book that most of those reviewers probably didn't read and (another disclosure) a movie I did not see. Bissinger (who is the author of \\"Friday Night Lights\\") gives too much worshipful deference to his subject - although LaRussa is identified as a co-author, so maybe this is really an uncritical autobiography. Bissinger (who is the author of \\"Friday Night Lights\\") claims to be fascinated with and drawn to LaRussa's allegedly intense and brooding mood - something I always identified as boredom. The best parts of the book, in my view, stood on the game accounts, which were too rushed and shallow - I think because Bissinger (who is the author of \\"Friday Night Lights\\") was in a hurry to take the reader back to LaRussa's brooding strategy and post-game rituals. Whatever. Read it if you are tempted - I gave it my best shot."},{"Title":"Three Nights in August: Strategy, Heartbreak, and Joy: Inside the Mind of a Manager","review":"If, like me, however, you found Moneyball intriguing and insightful, you will probably hate this book. For some reason, Buzz Bissinger feels that his insider scoop descriptions of Tony LaRussa need to be coupled with this weird defense of the \\"old-school\\" and a puerile attack on Michael Lewis' Moneyball and sabermetrician statheads in general-- as if the statheads didn't love the game or something. This makes little sense, as you have to ask: who would ultimately devote his intellectual life to the compilation and analysis of aracane baseball statistics but a real lover of baseball?Sad to say, but Lewis writes/researches circles around Bissinger. Unless you're a die-hard Cardinals fan and have to lap up every available fragment of Cardinals literature, I wouldn't waste my money on this book. It's too bad that Bissinger has to pick this fight, because he could have written a perfectly acceptable, though fluffy, account of LaRussa and his OCD managerial style without it. Bissinger had all the aaccess in the world to the Cardinals and apparently all the time in the world, as he followed the team around most of the season in order to provide back-fill for the 3 days in August that form the timeline of the narrative.Since he did pick the fight, however, Bissinger is asking us to take sides and to pick a winner. He loses. Badly. Like a Left-handed utility infielder flailing at a Randy Johnson slider. He is not as sharp, talented, or eloquent as Michael Lewis, or even Bill James for that matter.Skip this book."},{"Title":"Three Nights in August: Strategy, Heartbreak, and Joy: Inside the Mind of a Manager","review":"An excellent look into the mind of Tony Larussa. Show's what a brilliant manager he is and how intense the game of baseball can be. If you love baseball you will love this book. Even the casual fan who may be a bit curious would enjoy this."},{"Title":"Three Nights in August: Strategy, Heartbreak, and Joy: Inside the Mind of a Manager","review":"As a lifelong baseball fan, I enjoyed this book very much. It focuses on Tony LaRussa's day-to-day tasks and stylistic choices as manager of the St. Louis Cardinals during a three game series against the arch rival Chicago Cubs in August 2003. It was very enlightening to read about how he makes his lineup for each game, the decisions required during the game itself to position his players on defense, have signals sent to his batters (because if he sends those signals himself they will surely be decoded and \\"stolen\\" by the dozen pair of eyes watching him all the time), or have his pitcher do something special with the next pitch.I also enjoyed learning about LaRussa the man and how he has essentially given up his family life (at least 8-9 months of the year) to live alone and do his job, and I appreciated his honesty in admitting that he may regret his decision to do so. I admired his integrity in the way he fosters the competitive edge amongst his players and how he also must be a dugout psychologist to massage egos and yet act in the best interest of his team.The digressive passages regarding specific players of the past, including Rick Ankiel (still trying to make the big club as an outfielder), Darryl Kile, and others from his days managing in Oakland and Chicago add to the narrative and are quite enjoyable to read. I highly recommend this book for baseball fans who seek greater insight into how the game is played and managed. It is a fine weekend read and well worth the time and effort."},{"Title":"Three Nights in August: Strategy, Heartbreak, and Joy: Inside the Mind of a Manager","review":"One of the best baseball books, taking the reader into the mind of Tony LaRussa as he manages his team through a 3-game series with the Chicago Cubs. Player weaknesses and strengths are discussed frankly. This one is for the real fan."},{"Title":"Three Nights in August: Strategy, Heartbreak, and Joy: Inside the Mind of a Manager","review":"Which of course I am, but still. Any baseball fan should enjoy this book. The stories Bissinger tells gives you insight into how LaRussa manages different situations. The access Bissinger received throughout the 2003 season allowed him to write in-depth about LaRussa's relationship with many Cardinals from the last few years. You'll learn more about LaRussa, Duncan, Pujols, McGwire, Kerry Robinson, Stephenson, Ankiel, Kile, Matheny, Cal Eldred and many more.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Three Nights in August: Strategy, Heartbreak, and Joy: Inside the Mind of a Manager","review":"Outstanding knowledge of baseball combined with relevant background and just good story telling.A sound understanding of baseball strategy would help the reader appreciate this book even more."},{"Title":"Three Nights in August: Strategy, Heartbreak, and Joy: Inside the Mind of a Manager","review":"I enjoyed reading about one of baseball's best managers. Our book club chose to read this and most of us enjoyed it."},{"Title":"Three Nights in August: Strategy, Heartbreak, and Joy: Inside the Mind of a Manager","review":"I think this is a great follow up to Moneyball, as it gives you a somewhat contrasting viewpoint to the statistics driven attitudes portrayed in Moneball. In particular, it looks at the human component of baseball. The chapters on Darryl Kile and Rick Ankiel are especially touching, and show you that not everything can be viewed just by statistics."},{"Title":"Three Nights in August: Strategy, Heartbreak, and Joy: Inside the Mind of a Manager","review":"I like for the fact they get into the nuances of the managing the game.

Having waited, I get to read it with a greater degree of hindsight, now that LaRussa has retired and Matheny is manager. I plan to tag-team this book with LaRussa's new book about last season's run for the championship. Even without all those caveats, this is the best inside baseball book I've read. It explains why few managers are as successful or long-tenured as LaRussa--few managers have what it takes in the way of brains, dedication, intensity, and most of all, love of the game for the game's sake. One part of that hindsight is reading about Matheny as a player and seeing the early makings of a manager. For all those who thought the Cardinals were taking too big a gamble on hiring Matheny because of lack of experience, this book will show you that he wasn't the neophyte everyone thought."},{"Title":"Three Nights in August: Strategy, Heartbreak, and Joy: Inside the Mind of a Manager","review":"Having been a Cardinals fan since the days of Stan Musial and Bob Gibson, I knew I'd like this book about Cardinals Manager Tony LaRussa. What I didn't know was how enjoyable a read this would be. While detailing a three-game series with the Cubs, the writer makes you feel like you're inside Tony's head. It's incredible how well he explains Tony's decision-making process. Pitch-by-pitch, inning-by-inning, you get to understand why he did, when he did it. A lot of his managing was influenced by his pitching coach, Dave Duncan, who, like Tony has decades of experience in baseball. I like that LaRussa went out on top, after the 2011 Cards made their miracle run for the World Championship."},{"Title":"Three Nights in August: Strategy, Heartbreak, and Joy: Inside the Mind of a Manager","review":"Using his unlimited access to Tony LaRussa and the Cardinals, Buzz Bissinger takes us inside the fundamental unit of a baseball season: the three-game series. And not just any such series, but one of epic proportions -- a meeting of perennial Midwest rivals, St. Louis versus Chicago, the Cardinals versus the Cubs. And not just a series between rivals but between contenders for the division title. On this August series could depend the outcome of the season and a berth in the playoffs.Bissinger captures the drama of each game, of the entire series, in which the result could depend on a single pitch or one swing of the bat. It also depends, perhaps more substantively, on the manager. We see the games through the eyes of Tony LaRussa, who is at once strategist and tactician, statistician and historian, philosopher and theorist, psychologist and psychiatrist. LaRussa is a purist, a traditionalist -- a baseball man. He loves the game -- eats, sleeps, and breathes it -- and, like any lover, is devoted to it, tosses and turns over it, constantly thinks about it. He frets about whether, and when, to retaliate for batters hit by opposing pitchers. He plans for each game meticulously and focuses on the mechanics, down to individual batter-pitcher matchups.Of course, the best laid plans of mice and men often go awry, and for all LaRussa's planning and strategizing, for all the skill of his players, a game usually -- too often, LaRussa couldn't be blamed for thinking -- returns to that single pitch, that one swing. \\"Anything can happen in baseball,\\" Bissinger writes, \\"the beauty or the brutality.\\" With generous asides on the players' and coaches' backgrounds and the history and evolution of the game, Bissinger reveals the heart of baseball, and the heart is this: it's a beautiful game -- even when it's brutal, it's beautiful."},{"Title":"Three Nights in August: Strategy, Heartbreak, and Joy: Inside the Mind of a Manager","review":"\\"3 Nights In August\\", is a very good book that is reminiscent of George Will's \\"Men At Work\\". Bissinger's case study here surrounds a three-game series between the archrival Cubs and Cardinals which takes place in St. Louis in August 2003. While holding La Russa in high regard, Bissinger presents a fairly balanced profile of one of the smartest and most respected managers in The Game today. He delves into the hours of discussion and analysis that La Russa and his pitching coach, Dave Duncan, go through in preparing for the Cubs series. Bissinger shows us the importance of strategy, technology, and statistics: video analysis, index cards, and tactics that evolve with the pitch count. But he also shows us the essential human side: how La Russa deals with prima donnas, slackers, schizophrenic pitchers, lengthy separation from his family, and even the death of one of his players.The most casual of fans may find \\"3 Nights In August\\" to be a bit too in-depth, as Bissinger often provides pitch-by-pitch, inning-by-inning commentary. But there's more than enough high-level and background material to please most readers, and many will discover the game within The Game."},{"Title":"Three Nights in August: Strategy, Heartbreak, and Joy: Inside the Mind of a Manager","review":"This book is very good. I recommend it to any fan of baseball. The author definitely has it out for Moneyball and statistical analysis as an approach to baseball and spends too much time attacking statistics. The teams that have succeeded with statistical analysis (A's and Red Sox) admit that it is just one of the tools that they bring to the table. They also rely on good old-fashioned scouting. The problem with Bissinger is that he chooses not to see this and instead sets up strawman arguments just to knock them down. Case-in-point the Red Sox apparent use of a closer-by-committee approach in the beginning of 2003. The Red Sox never said they were going to close by commitee or even that they planned to have multiple closers for different roles. The problem with the Red Sox is that in 2003 they had noone on the staff who jumped out at you as a closer. Thus they tried a bunch of different pitchers in that role, none of them worked so they got Kim. Bissinger uses this to attack Bill James and his analysis about closers. But Bissinger misses the point. James and the Red Sox both realize that if you have a great pitcher in the bullpen, using him only in situations where you have a lead (including 3-run leads in the 9th) is a waste. If you have a tie score in 9th, 8th, or even 7th inning, that may be the most critical point in the game. You may need to use your best pitcher than. If you shut down the opposing team in the 8th and then your offense gets a 3-run homer, in the top the 8th, you can put in one of your lesser pitchers to protect that lead in bottom of the 9th. Statistically, almost all pitchers will be able to protect a 3 run lead. But getting those 3 crucial outs in the 8th was the place to use your best pitcher. Bissinger just doesn't get it."},{"Title":"Three Nights in August: Strategy, Heartbreak, and Joy: Inside the Mind of a Manager","review":"I thought this book was intellegent and I enjoyed reading how La Russa deals with being a manager, he talked about the loss of Darryl Kile. It shows TLR is a real sensitive guy and loving person to his team and family and he gets a long really well with the owner, a respectful guy, and a true hero."},{"Title":"Three Nights in August: Strategy, Heartbreak, and Joy: Inside the Mind of a Manager","review":".His writing is excellent, Bissinger left off with a high point at the end off very chapter that makes you read more of it. It is enjoyable and fun to read. This is a very great book by a great writer. A-lot of people should read this book because it is a great book about baseball."},{"Title":"Three Nights in August: Strategy, Heartbreak, and Joy: Inside the Mind of a Manager","review":"I love baseball. In fact, outside of my wife and family, I cannot think of anything I love more than baseball.That said, I am pretty ignorant of the subtle intrececies of how the game is played and managed. OK, I understand the rules, but I am pretty clueless on when to give the light to hit or not, when to call for a hit-and-run, etc.This book gives some excellent insights into the finer points (at least finer from my eyes) of managing and why a manager makes certain calls or decides not to.My only complaint about the book is that it deviates from a discussion of strategy to talk about LaSorta's personal life. I do not know about you, but I could not care less where he lives, where his wife lives and how often they see each other.That said, certainly worth reading. It is helping me get through the off-season. Short of watching baseball, reading about it is a pretty close second."},{"Title":"Three Nights in August: Strategy, Heartbreak, and Joy: Inside the Mind of a Manager","review":"You should buy this book for what it is, and not for what many of these reviews say it is. It is not anti-Moneyball, it is an insiders look at a baseball game in the context of the baseball world and the career of one man, Tony LaRussa. Sabermaniacs have brought a deeper understanding of baseball to the layperson, and have challenged conventional thinking about our great game. This book does not set out to refute ther tenets of sabermetrics, in fact, Moneyball is mentioned only three times in 279 (paperback) pages. Any anti-sabermetric review is probably motivated by an almost zealous subscription to the central teachings of Moneyball.Take the book for what it is: an intelligent, thought-provoking, entertaining, insiders look at the baseball world broken down into three games. There is a great deal of context given here for what is happening on the field and in the mind of the manager. As Mr. LaRussa points out in his Foreward, the book is not about three games, and that most of what you will read \\"should really be about baseball in general.\\"As far as recent books, the excellent Moneyball's contribution to the avid baseball fan is thinking differently about the assumptions you make about the game, and that different business models can be adopted that offer advantages that can be observed as teams take the field. The contribution of this book is an insiders look at how the game is tactically executed and how the eyes, ears, and experiences of a quarter century affect the minute decisions that affect the whole.Entertainingly written, any baseball fan will enjoy this book."},{"Title":"Three Nights in August: Strategy, Heartbreak, and Joy: Inside the Mind of a Manager","review":"The content of Bissinger's _Three Nights_ has been expansively glossed over now, so I'll just get straight to the point-no need for a Summary.My interest in this book was sparked by Tony LaRussa, probably the most polarizing manager in baseball today. To some he's a master strategist, a commander pushing tactical boundaries (anybody else remember how he batted the pitcher 8th a few times to get McGwire more RBI chances?). To others, LaRussa is not nearly as smart as he acts and a poor manager of personalities. I can think of more than one player who left St. Louis disgruntled. He is also almost personally responsible for slow games from his unwavering reliance on matchups. Personally I placed myself in the He's Not As Good As He Thinks He Is camp. Still, from this book I wasn't searching for more reasons to criticize LaRussa the manager, rather I was hoping for a look at The Man LaRussa himself and an understanding of his motives. I wanted to see a human behind those sunglasses. Through the three-game series against Chicago, I was hoping to find reasons to like or respect LaRussa.Under the general's mask is a man consumed by fear. Bissinger pulls away threads of LaRussa's wool armor, showing that behind every strength is a weakness, for every move a looming counterpunch. LaRussa has essentially left his family in the bullpen, which Bissinger is not judgemental about. Rather, this is presented as the downside to a passionate man. It's part of being a Baseball Man.The most anticipated part of this book was LaRussa's attitude towards beanballs and brushbacks. Tony has, over the years, likely been involved in more beanball wars than any manager I've followed. It's part of what causes such polarizing views on him. Bissinger carefully details the conflicts that LaRussa endures when one of his players is hit. LaRussa is literally a \\"made\\" man in the dugout, adhering to the informal Baseball Man code of ethics, agonizing over what the consequences of his moves will be for his soldiers on the diamond.Slightly less effective are instances when the book's focus strays from the three-game series. Specifically, on ocassion I feel that the editorializing about Modern Players is overbearing. The purpose of including the Modern Player discussion is to show another aspect of the game LaRussa must manage, but sometimes this discussion strays into Today's Players Aren't As Good As They Were in My Day arguments that have been made time immemorial. I'm not sure why \\"hit and run\\" is italicized; this is common parlance and suggests that Bissinger indeed fails to cleanly glove basic aspects of the game. And, why not just save us all the time and capitalize the \\"great\\" in \\"great Albert Puljols\\"?What this book displays is that there is a human being behind those sunglasses, and that a manager's code of ethics leaves little room for sentimentality. LaRussa's faults aren't based on smugness, but rather his inability to transcend. His humanness rests in his imperfection, and in his attempts at forming graceful symmetry from an imperfect object. A Baseball Man is a wonderful thing, but every strength is made taught by the pulleys of weakness."},{"Title":"Three Nights in August: Strategy, Heartbreak, and Joy: Inside the Mind of a Manager","review":"This superb narrative shows us baseball from the eyes of the manager. Specifically, readers come to know the mind and strategies of skipper Tony La Russa. The backdrop is a key three-game series as La Russa's St. Louis Cardinals host their rival Chicago Cubs in August of 2003. We see La Russa\`s thinking as he contemplates his lineup, pinch hitters, pitching changes, etc., not to mention his overall views of baseball strategy. Readers come to understand the ceaseless pressure that skippers face, one that can take an emotional toll. The author also looks at several players, their personalities, egos, and determination - including a moving remembrance of pitcher Darryl Kile who died tragically (from a heart attack) a year earlier. The pages intersperse action with flashbacks and anecdotes, and the result is similar to NINE INNINGS, Daniel Okrent's superb narration of a game between the Milwaukee Brewers and Baltimore Orioles in 1982.Author Hal Bissinger spent time with La Russa to write this superbly readable narrative, one that should be enjoyed by fans, coaches, and students of the game. Readers might also consider FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS, the author's superb critique of high school football in Texas."},{"Title":"Three Nights in August: Strategy, Heartbreak, and Joy: Inside the Mind of a Manager","review":"Three Nights in August is a great, detailed account of what goes on with the Cardinals and specifically with one of the greatest managers in baseball history, Tony LaRussa. LaRussa is guarded and this book opens up his stragedies, his history in the game and the decisions that he makes. Bissinger has an amazing knack to pinpoint every detail of the game. We also take a look inside the Cardinal clubhouse and the heart-wrenching decisions that LaRussa makes everyday."},{"Title":"Three Nights in August: Strategy, Heartbreak, and Joy: Inside the Mind of a Manager","review":"I admire Tony LaRussa for his use of the bench and for his intensity, but I think his game strategy is his weak point. He doesn't realize (nor does the author of the book) that the statistical matchups which he relies on do not usually have enough examples to be statisically significant. Further, he (in my opinion) sacrifice bunts too much, and it has been shown that sacrifice bunts increase the probability of one run but overall reduce the numnber of runs scored. The criticism that he overmanages I think is warranted. The book, definitely well written and great reading for any baseball fan, is nevertheless a puff piece dedicated to exaggerating the brillance of Tony Larussa. In my opinion, he is a shoo in to the hall of fame based on the terrific job done by the general managers who have stocked his team with a wonderful group of all-star players. But he still has won a lot of games, and must be doing a lot of things right."},{"Title":"Three Nights in August: Strategy, Heartbreak, and Joy: Inside the Mind of a Manager","review":"This is a must-read for all baseball fans--it's a bonus if you happen to be a Cardinal baseball fan. Love him or hate him, Tony LaRussa is one of the best baseball minds in the history of the game. His knowledge of the game is only eclipsed by his passion for it--and this comes across loud and clear in the book.Go Cardinals and Go Tony--we'll see you in Cooperstown!"},{"Title":"Three Nights in August: Strategy, Heartbreak, and Joy: Inside the Mind of a Manager","review":"As usual Bisinger (\\"A Prayer for the City\\" and \\"Friday Day Night Lights\\") does his usual thorough job of research and reporting. But the book was slow to get going and I suspect a non-bebaseball fan will not be patient enough to stick with it.However, this book lacks the wider appeal that made the two aorementioned books so popular. The writing dragged some and several scenes seemed endlessly detailed, with little reward at the end of the section.The upside of the book is that the author gives us great insight into the work of a baseball manager and its many facets that are often unseen, or at least usually forgotten. Additionally, some details around the game time situations are wonderful and they keep the story going.This book will appeal to baseball fans and will have very strong appeal to St. Louis fans."},{"Title":"Three Nights in August: Strategy, Heartbreak, and Joy: Inside the Mind of a Manager","review":"This book was a great look into the strategy and mental aspects of America's \\"Forgotten\\" Pastime.

As a fan, you get to see what is going through the mind of a baseball genius. This is a book a person will not be able to put down."},{"Title":"Three Nights in August: Strategy, Heartbreak, and Joy: Inside the Mind of a Manager","review":"Let me start by agreeing with reviewers that say this book is not simply for Cardinals fans. This is a book for any baseball fan who wants to better understand the strategy and planning for games and series and wants to see, through the eyes of one manager, how all of that can unfold.Tony La Russa is an ideal subject for such a book. He, and Dave Duncan his pitching coach, provide Buzz Bissinger with a rich set of strategies to write about. Along the way, it becomes clear that all of this can easily be upset by injuries, players that make mistakes, or players that simply don't have the right mental make-up to believe in their manager's and coach's strategies. For example, one can easily understand why certain Cardinals in 2003 are no longer on the team or in the organization now.I was surprised the book jumped to the 2004 season in an epilogue and didn't provide closure on 2003 within the main context of the book. Perhaps, this was the desire of the author to provide a happy ending (e.g. the Cardinals go to the World Series), but a better ending would have been the conclusion to 2003 and the influence it had on the Cardinals organization in the 2003-2004 offseason.This is an easy read and one that intense baseball fans not previously exposed to inside baseball will find difficult to put down."},{"Title":"Three Nights in August: Strategy, Heartbreak, and Joy: Inside the Mind of a Manager","review":"First question: Did we really need another profile of Tony LaRussa, already the most over-exposed manager in major league baseball? Ever since he popped up in the early 80s, the media has fawned over his every move, evidently impressed by his ability to pull a double-switch and glower at the same time. Dude gets more ink than Brad and Angelina -- maybe they share the same publicist.But if you're as big a baseball fan as I, it's only a matter of time before you succumb to the hype and purchase this universally praised account of (as the title suggests) three nights in August ... i.e., a feeble re-make of 'Nine Innings' spread out over three games so the writer won't have to concentrate as hard. I finished the book in two sittings, so I can't honestly sit here and say that it stank.Or can I?The central premise of the book is as obnoxious as its subject, namely the aforementioned manager of the St. Louis Cardinals, one Tony LaRussa -- attorney at law, in case you needed reminding. According to one Buzz Bissinger, LaRussa's an old-school throwback, a balls-out 'real man' in a baseball universe increasingly lorded over by timid 'thirtysomething' geeks who wouldn't know a jock strap from an iPod nano. Yeah man, those guys just sit in front of their computers all day, crunching numbers, but me, Tony L, I go by my gut! I've got 25 years of experience ovah heah, and I make my decisions the old-fashioned way! If the stats tell me to pull my starting pitcher, maybe I will, maybe I won't -- I'm going to walk to the mound and SMELL him first. Think those MBA Moneyball twerps know what a pitcher smells like? They don't even chew tobacco, mang.Yeah, well, interesting theory. Trouble is, after taking cheap shots at such stat-head losers as Bill James and Theo Epstein, our man LaRussa gets praised for obsessively analyzing pitcher-hitter matchups. That's right -- the guy that every baseball writer hypes as a genius is making out his lineup cards based on some guy going 3-for-7 against Kerry Wood. What the *&^%? Per Bissinger, we shouldn't rely on statistics -- unless they're based on impossibly small sample sizes.Another flaw in this anti-number, pro-intangibles screed is that we never actually see LaRussa go *against* his statistics. Seriously. I mean, if the whole purpose of the book is to illustrate that you have to look beyond the numbers and size up the player himself, shouldn't there be some instances where Big Tony plays a hunch that goes against all logic and pays off huge? or where T straightens out a player with a bad attitude, or picks up a guy in a slump? You'd think so, wouldn't you? Yet such instances are strangely absent.Why? Because LaRussa's an arrogant jerk who doesn't relate to his players. Hell, he doesn't relate to his *family* either, as one of the book's better storylines makes plain. The book confirms the prejudices held against LaRussa by his detractors: namely, that he's a paranoid madman who micromanages his teams to defeat. This negative nutcase appears deathly afraid of *not* making a move, of being second-guessed by the press... or by himself, perhaps? Bissinger relates his relentless fretting about the #8 hitter on the opposing team possibly getting a hit, thereby allowing them to have their #1 hitter lead off the following inning. It's a mildly instructive bit of insider baseball, but LaRussa treats the issue as if he's launching the Market Garden offensive. Dude, it's the fifth inning and there's still fifty games to go! Pop a Paxil or bolt down some Jim Beam -- you're begging for this guy to relax!But Big Tony never relaxes -- and his players never will either. Bissinger notes approvingly that LaRussa routinely expects his guys to play as if it's the seventh game of the World Series throughout the 162-game season. As such, his players are forever under the gun, terrified their manager's going to freak out when they fail to advance the runner to third, even if they're playing the Pirates in June. His players will always press, and ultimately, they'll always lose. That's another major flaw in the book: The author presents LaRussa as the ultimate authority on all things baseball, while side-stepping the little matter of his failing to win the big one. He's managed for 25 years and has won the World Series exactly once; he's also lost it on three occasions, getting swept twice. Fittingly, he lost the 2004 series to a team that famously embraced the very stat-conscious maxims that Bissinger aims to debunk. Chew on that, Buzz. (Blaming the loss on a late flight into Boston? Sell it somewhere else, bub.)The writing, you ask? Let's just say that Boswell and Angell can rest easy. Bissinger's swinging for the fences (!) on this one, desperately throwing in highbrow references regardless of whether they fit. A spate of ill-placed phrases ranging from the Maginot Line to the Hammurabi Code culminates in the downright bizarre description of a blooper as \\"the kind of existentialist hit that would keep Camus or Sartre in the money.\\" Overwrought much? I half expected to spot Vladimir Lenin Mau-Mauing the Flak Catchers behind home plate. Add in a surprisingly irritating decision to italicize the phrase HIT-AND-RUN each and every time it appears -- imagine a Neil Young biography that wrote about all his FOLK ROCK BALLADS or a book on Bush that discussed the WAR ON TERROR -- and you have a sad case of a writer getting in the way of his own story. Bad Buzz, Bad.What was that story again? Oh right, here it is: Tony LaRussa's a genius because he doesn't rely on statistics like those other guys, except when he does, and you can tell he's sharp because he wins, except when he doesn't.Did I mention the author gives LaRussa a pass on the issue of steroids, even though Tony's teams benefited disproportionately from turning a blind eye to the problem? It just goes to show you: Never read a book recommended by Tim Russert, the man who ate Mario Cuomo."},{"Title":"Three Nights in August: Strategy, Heartbreak, and Joy: Inside the Mind of a Manager","review":"This could have been such a wonderful book.

This book satisfies my \`itch' for both reading and baseball. The author is an excellent writer, and I thoroughly enjoyed his writing style. Often baseball is communicated with the flamboyance (what I really mean is drabness) of the box score. Yes, at times this author waxes philosophical, and he sometimes writes in a way that may be better suited for fiction, but I loved it. I value the statistical, dry, factual part of the game of baseball. But I also appreciate the author's ability to liven this book through good writing. Another great baseball book is Nine Innings, but unlike Three Nights in August, Nine Innings failed in the writing department. Baseball is a long season, with lots of numbers, players and repetition. People who effectively communicate the game (radio announcers, sports writers, and authors) do so effectively through flair and color.In regard to my second \`itch', the baseball in this book is great. Larussa (love him or hate him) is one of the most successful managers in history, and a look at his life is an excellent glimpse into the game itself. I consider myself a big baseball fan, but there was so much that I learned about the game through this book. It is clear that Larussa has a passion and commitment to his job that is rare, not only in baseball but in other professions as well. So strong is his passion and commitment, that I believe it is unhealthy. The author doesn't try and cover up the fact that Larussa hasn't been a very good father or husband. The question is, was this really a sacrifice for Larussa? I doubt he would have it any other way.The book was great, I will read anything else this author writes."},{"Title":"Three Nights in August: Strategy, Heartbreak, and Joy: Inside the Mind of a Manager","review":"Though the title suggests that this book will be a tedious breakdown of three St. Louis Cardinals games towards the end of Summer, \\"Three Nights in August\\" is far more than that.In actuality, \\"Three Nights in August\\" dissects a pivotal three-game series for the Cardinals against their rivals, the Chicago Cubs, in a way never before seen in print. A single key decision of whether or not to replace the starting pitcher becomes a chapter about the resurgence of a relief pitcher who has had more than his fair share of arm surgeries. A single phone call on the way to the stadium becomes several chapters about finding and developing talent and how it can all go awry with the quirkiest of injuries.Within each and every page of this book, there is depth that one will not find in other books about baseball. As a fan of LaRussa's all the way back to when he coached the Oakland A's, I never had a clue how much was going on between his ears until now.You can't read this book and not come away with a genuine respect for LaRussa and how much he has to deal with in order to be the manager of a Major League team.You also cannot read this book and not come away with a deep appreciation for the way author Buzz Bissinger turned the minutiae of baseball into an multi-layered, compelling, yet somehow still easy to follow story.It might be a bit much for fringe fans, but if you are a true baseball fan, this book is a must read."},{"Title":"Three Nights in August: Strategy, Heartbreak, and Joy: Inside the Mind of a Manager","review":"I bought this book in an airport and read it over several days on airplanes. It held my interest pretty well. It compares well to some of the best baseball writers and is a mix of story-line and analysis. Basically it covers a 3 game series between the Cubs and Cards in August 2003. There are several excursions into timelines of various players and events, but mostly the book is an analysis of the players and the games in this series.One strength of this book is how it portrays the character of the teams involved. Teams and stadiums have very distinct characters. For example, when I lived in Chicago the Cubs games at Wrigley field were fairly laid back. They were almost always day games because the community restricts how often the lights can be on. This meant you had to take a day off work to see them. Tickets were easy to come by, and you parked on some guys lawn for 5 bucks. On the other hand, I never came home from a game at Old Comiskey Park without being drenched with beer. The gestalt of a game at Wrigley vs. a game at Comiskey was completely different.But the funny thing about this book is that I keep remembering parts of it as I watch games and the insights in it are incredibly useful. I live between a rookie league team (Ogden Raptors - Dodgers) and an AAA team (Salt Lake - Angels). Over and over some insight in this book will come to mind as I watch some future major-leaguer. Ex-manager Tommy Lasorda is at the Ogden games fairly frequently and after reading this book I can more often figure out just what it is in some minor-leaguers play that gets Lasorda swearing. And as I see the bonus babies from Ben Sheets to Prince Fielder come through the rookie league I can better evaluate the players and see what their managers are looking for. The net result: the game is more enjoyable.I'm not into fantasy leagues. I don't pay attention to the new esoteric stats. I just love to spend summer evenings watching baseball with my sons with the Rocky Mountains as a backdrop to some awesome minor league stadiums. In the book, the author uses a phrase - \\"Beautiful. Just beautful baseball.\\" And after reading this book, I find myself muttering this to myself as I watch a well-executed bunt or a heads-up base-running play that brings in a run.This book is not a statistical primer. It does almost have a little too much hero worship of Cardinals manager Tony LaRussa. But you don't have to be a fanatic to enjoy this book which has the pacing of a good ball game - sometimes up, sometimes down but just right in the end."},{"Title":"Three Nights in August: Strategy, Heartbreak, and Joy: Inside the Mind of a Manager","review":"Friday Night Lights was a great book - this one is just ok. Bissinger uses unnecessarily flowery language to complicate a book that really doesn't need it. There's really no stunning revelations in here aside from LaRussa ripping some former players. The baseball strategy examined is beginner to moderate level, nothing too complicated.It's an easy read, but certainly not a must-have for baseball fans."},{"Title":"Three Nights in August: Strategy, Heartbreak, and Joy: Inside the Mind of a Manager","review":"I strongly disagree with another persons review of this book. This book is not at all about a Moneyball vs. Old School Baseball Mentality. Yes the author does state that he does disagree with a statistics only mentality of the game. However I believe that the authors real purpose is to share the hidden gems of this wonderful game.Anyway, I just finished reading this book and I can honestly say that this is the best baseball book that I have read in a while. I am a huge baseball fan and I was consumed with the intimate details that Bissinger provides of some of the Cardinal players and their opponents (Cubs) during this crucial three-game series in late in August.I've always said that if you don't like the game of baseball, your not paying attention. This book is great at pointing out the strategies and the behind the scene moves that make up a baseball game.I highly recommend it for all baseball fans and those that want to know more about the game."},{"Title":"Three Nights in August: Strategy, Heartbreak, and Joy: Inside the Mind of a Manager","review":"I'll confess to begin that I am a true St. Louis Cardinals fan! That being said, for any Cardinals fan this is a good book. Get yourself a copy! It's great to read. There a great insights and profiles of the team. For anyone with a desire to see a little further behind the scenes of MLB, this is also a good book. There is however nothing new here. Mr. Bissinger states at the begining that this book is sort of the answer to Michael Lewis' \\"Moneyball\\". I don't see that. I suggest reading them both. \\"3 Nights in August\\" and \\"Moneyball\\" both shed light on baseball and human nature and the fundamentals of success."},{"Title":"Three Nights in August: Strategy, Heartbreak, and Joy: Inside the Mind of a Manager","review":"It's hard to believe the Tony LaRussa in 3 Nights in August is the same expressionless man I see in the dugout every Cardinals game.I'm a huge baseball fan and a coach, and I recommend this book to every ball player before he begins playing in high school. The book was educational for me as a coach, and I wish I'd have read it when I was playing. As a fan, it's easy for me disagree with a manager's decisions when he puts in a .230 average utility infielder in a close game, but two of my favorite topics in the book are the importance of bench management and developing younger players.My only complaint about the book is Buzz Bissinger's vocabulary. I read because I enjoy it and it keeps my mind sharp. I have reasonable intelligence and a decent vocabulary. But I think Bissinger, like too many authors, sacrifices the flow of the story to boast his own vocabulary, and, in the process, he makes the reader feel intellectually-inferior. Any word that isn't used at least rarely in a conversation should be equally absent in a book. It's frustrating when I'm reading about baseball and I have to stop to figure out or look up the meaning of words like leitmotif.Aside from the abundance of unnecessary foreign words, I loved the book. Bissinger did a great job of showing the different personalities of the Cardinals players, coaches, and behind-the-scenes workers."},{"Title":"Three Nights in August: Strategy, Heartbreak, and Joy: Inside the Mind of a Manager","review":"Buzz Bissinger is a talented journalist and writer, who knows how to tell good stories about the people who play and manage sports. He also has the ability to capture some of the beautiful complexity of baseball, as seen through the eyes of Tony LaRussa, and play it out in ways that make the book difficult to put down. He does not approach his subject with the sublime wit infused throughout Michael Lewis's Moneyball. Nor does he go so far as to deconstruct the whole game, like George Will did in Men at Work: The Craft of Baseball. While I rank those books above this one, you will find Three Nights in August a thoroughly satisfying read if you read and liked those books."},{"Title":"Three Nights in August: Strategy, Heartbreak, and Joy: Inside the Mind of a Manager","review":"I've always thought that managing, in general, is a skill much overrated by many baseball fans. My personal bias aside, though, this is an interesting book both in terms of the game, and in terms of the look inside the mind of a man considered one of the great managers of our generation.This book will not impress the casual fan, or anyone reading it simply because they've like Bissinger's past work. There's a ton of detail about baseball that might cause many to tune out, but it's worth sticking with. Larussa is obviously an intelligent man, and that comes across in his discussions on several topics. He also possesses an obvious love for the game, which many fans will appreciate.There's a reason why Larussa has won several managerial awards, beyond the fact that he's managed a number of talent-laden teams. He understands the game, and he strikes a good balance between the science of baseball and managerial intuition. He wants to win at almost any cost, but he also cares about his players and organization.Love or hate him - and there are many in both camps - Larussa is a fascinating baseball character. This should prove of interest to any fan of Larussa, the Cards, or baseball in general."},{"Title":"Three Nights in August: Strategy, Heartbreak, and Joy: Inside the Mind of a Manager","review":"I was really lookinig forward to reading this book. To me, Tony LaRussa is one of the best in-game managers in baseball and this book promised to give us an inside look at his mindset and strategies throughout a 3 game series with the Cubs. Overall? Not bad and, especially early on, I was enjoying the book and the intimacy of \\"seeing\\" LaRussa's thought process in various situations. It simply didn't last throughout, or it seemed to bog down or become repetitive. I enjoyed the book as a whole, but the latter third of it became slow, almost tedious at times."},{"Title":"Three Nights in August: Strategy, Heartbreak, and Joy: Inside the Mind of a Manager","review":"An incredible work of art!!I myself am a Cardinals fan, but that does not mean that this book isn't a great read for any fan of baseball. I have friends and co-workers who are fans of the dreaded Cubs, they have read this book and loved it as well!\\"Three Nights in August\\" finally gives the sports fan a look at all of the work and strategy that goes into managing a baseball team. If anyone out there thought that it would be an easy job, think again... Buzz goes into Tony's daily routines during the season, and it's hard to believe the man can stand up let alone manage the greatest team in baseball. I don't know how he does it getting a mere 5 hours of sleep a night!?!?This book does a great job showing the stress and incite of a manager and how they must deal with it everyday. A wonderful book that should be read by anyone who is a true fan of the game!"},{"Title":"Three Nights in August: Strategy, Heartbreak, and Joy: Inside the Mind of a Manager","review":"Bissinger does a fantastic job of paining mental pictures for the reader and really takes you inside LaRussa's mind. The book exceeded my expectations, and sheds some light on many managerial decisions that are made during the course of a game, series, or season."},{"Title":"Three Nights in August: Strategy, Heartbreak, and Joy: Inside the Mind of a Manager","review":"About this time of year, I begin counting the days until spring training. To fill the void until the baseball season begins, I read baseball books and dream...This is a great baseball book and I have never liked Tony LaRussa. But now, after reading this book, I can appreciate the intensity that he approaches baseball with and yes, I also have a respect for him that I didn't have before. He and Dave Duncan are baseball guys through and through.While the book is mostly about the three games between the Cardinals and Cubs at a crucial point in the 2003 season, Tony and Buzz Bizzinger do not get caught up in describing every pitch and play of the game but instead offer colorful stories about the Cardinal and Cub baseball players such as Rick Ankiel, Jason Isringhausen, Steve Kline and Mark Prior. These stories gave me glimpses of the players that even as a baseball fan, I didn't know. As a Red Sox and a Giants fan, it was also interesting to see some of the players that later played for the Sox and the Giants early in their baseball careers.It was also great fun to see games through the eyes of a manager - I will think twice before yelling at the TV set when I think I can manage better then Francona or Bochy!"},{"Title":"Three Nights in August: Strategy, Heartbreak, and Joy: Inside the Mind of a Manager","review":"Outstanding book. If you have ever wanted to get inside the head of a professional manager, this is your chance!"},{"Title":"Three Nights in August: Strategy, Heartbreak, and Joy: Inside the Mind of a Manager","review":"If you've ever wondered what it takes to be a leader -- the commitment, the focus, the almost obsessive compulsion that drives excellence then this book is a great backdrop. La Russa demonstrates what it takes to lead a team at such an elite level, the impact winning and losing has on his players and himself and how he develops the talent and manages ego...sounds eerily similar to the business world."},{"Title":"Three Nights in August: Strategy, Heartbreak, and Joy: Inside the Mind of a Manager","review":"I must admit I'm a Cardinal fan of more than 50 years, but I really felt this is one of the FIVE BEST BOOKS I've ever read about baseball. The description of the inner workings of today's clubhouse and management structure were fascinating and very well written. I can see where people get the impression that LaRussa is a self-absorbed egotist, as this book would seem to support that impression. I am a 59-yearold male."},{"Title":"Three Nights in August: Strategy, Heartbreak, and Joy: Inside the Mind of a Manager","review":"I will never see Tony the same again. It is so well written that I never got bored reading it and I cannot say that for all sports related books I have read."},{"Title":"Three Nights in August: Strategy, Heartbreak, and Joy: Inside the Mind of a Manager","review":"This was a very captivating read, I was not able to put the book down. I loved being able to get behind the scene's and into the mind of LaRussa. Exceptional, a great read for any baseball fan. A must read for all St. Louis Cardinals fan!!"},{"Title":"Three Nights in August: Strategy, Heartbreak, and Joy: Inside the Mind of a Manager","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I would rate it as one of the top 10 baseball books - but, undoubtedly, behind Men at Work. 3 Nights in August contained much useful information (both coaching ideas and personal). I felt like I was an eye witness to the on goings in the dugout. My only point of contention is that I feel the author was too hard on J D Drew. True, I have not interacted with him since the CWS, but I didn't get the feeling he was the selfish baby he was portrayed to be. I am a die hard Astros fan, but I caught myself cheering for the Redbirds. All in all a good read - I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Three Nights in August: Strategy, Heartbreak, and Joy: Inside the Mind of a Manager","review":"I read this book in hopes of finding out I was justified in not liking Tony Larussa. Quite the opposite. I have an undying respect for the man now.I will always be a Cubs fan but I will now look even more forward to the rivalry they have with the Cardinals. This book was as fair to the enemy as it was as hard on the hero. Well written, great history but I don't know if it can carry to the big screen as is rumoured."},{"Title":"Three Nights in August: Strategy, Heartbreak, and Joy: Inside the Mind of a Manager","review":"I enjoyed the book. A good and quick read for baseball fans to fill in The Void between the World Series and Spring Training. It is too long. The author needlessly falls in love with his descriptive abilities. It is sometimes repetitive. But the idea to focus on a single three-game series was brilliant. I think the picture that emerges of LaRussa helps to explain some of his failures in the postseason. The man is way too uptight for this game. His success is a product of his preparation, but in a short series (Post Season) the team that plays looser may be better off. It seems to me it would be hard to play loose with LaRussa at the helm. I think the Cardinals reflect his personality--a joyless club. A similar study of Ozzie Guillen would provide an interesting contrast."},{"Title":"Three Nights in August: Strategy, Heartbreak, and Joy: Inside the Mind of a Manager","review":"I'm biased being a longtime Cardinal fan but any serious baseball fan will get a lot of inside information from this book. I couldn't believe all the things I learning reading about St. Louis manager Tony LaRussa matching wits with Chicago's Dusty Baker.They make the game sound really complicated, maybe more so than it should be, but it's pretty mindboggling all the things that go on in LaRussa's head during a ballgame. I can understand why he is good friends with famous coaches like Bill Belechick and Bobby Knight. All of these guys are obssessed about their jobs and teaching their sports to their players. (They are also all big winners.)Buzz Bissinger does an outstanding job giving so much information with such a little premise: a three-game series in 2003. It's a great character study, though, of LaRussa. You'll never look at this guy the same after reading this book, especially when it concerns what he does with this family. Yup, he's a strange dude!Bissinger is the author of the popular \\"Friday Night Lights,\\" so if you like his style of writing, check out this book. You'll learn a lot of baseball, even if you already know quite a bit."},{"Title":"Three Nights in August: Strategy, Heartbreak, and Joy: Inside the Mind of a Manager","review":"Loving baseball, though not necessarily the Cardinals, is a pre-requisite for enjoying this book. I've never been much of a LaRussa fan, but Bissinger does a very nice job of capturing LaRussa's intensity and philosophy of baseball.The book uses a three game series against the Cubs in August 2003 to structure a narrative that includes flashbacks to the careers of LaRussa and others to give context to the particular moves and situations confronted during the series. It's a very nice narrative device, used effectively by Jane Leavy in her biography of Sandy Koufax, which was structured around Koufax's perfect game against the (who else?) Cubs in September 1965.LaRussa's appeal is his ability to combine Joe Torre's approach to managing personalities, the instincts of an old time baseball man, and a willingness to question old baseball dogmas in the light of experience and new data. I've always thought that LaRussa overmanaged games, but Bissinger's book does a lot to promote LaRussa as one of the game's top managers.Bissinger credits LaRussa with the major innovations in the evolution of the bullpen (i.e., one inning closers, set up men, and the idea of the bullpen as a calling rather than as a dustbin for rejected starters) and use of videotape. That's a bit of an overstatement. I remember the Yankees using Ron Davis to set up Gossage and even before then I remember Dick Williams using Knowles to set up Fingers. But LaRussa certainly was an important part of this trend.The true baseball fan will love LaRussa's experimentation with replacing the one starter with a cadre of relievers, LaRussa's rejection of the closer-by-committee concept, his strategic calculus during the series, his handling of difficult player personalities, and how LaRussa deals with the beanball. Also, Dave Duncan comes across as one of the great pitching coaches, rivaling old timers like Sain and the more recent gurus like Mazzone. Finally, I was unaware of the influence of Paul Richards on LaRussa and the generation of managers who came to the fore in past 25 years.On the downside, Bissinger overwrites. His flowery and overblown language gets in the way of the story. And he is, of course, too close to LaRussa given the constraints of a project in which he is essentially hired by LaRussa to tell LaRussa's story. Should LaRussa have gotten more out of a player like J.D. Drew? What about the tension between him and a class act like Rolen? Does his intensity and tactical assumptions get in the way of managing personalities to get the most out of them? What about his handling of steroid and substance abusers? These issues would have been explored more thoroughly by a more objective observer.This is definitely a worthwhile book for the baseball aficionado. The general reader may want to steer clear."},{"Title":"Three Nights in August: Strategy, Heartbreak, and Joy: Inside the Mind of a Manager","review":"This is one of the best baseball books out there. Bissinger takes the reader to many levels of the game, and gives a lot of insite to Tony LaRussa as a manager and tactician. I strongly recommend this book for any baseball fan. It is a really great read."},{"Title":"Three Nights in August: Strategy, Heartbreak, and Joy: Inside the Mind of a Manager","review":"St. Louis skipper Tony La Russa took more heat from this book than any decisions or comments he made during his hall-of-fame managerial career.Teaming with writer Buzz Bissinger, the book chronicles a 2003 three-game series the Cardinals had with the Chicago Cubs. The book weaves through the games through the eyes of La Russa, with outstanding pieces on his life and feelings about the game.At least one player made it known to La Russa - through the proverbial baseball grapevine - that he would no longer autograph items for auction to benefit Tony La Russa's ARF due to several comments in the book.There were other grumblings that made it to print in the national press - especially that Bissinger was attempting to debunk the theory of statistical analysis in the bestselling Moneyball - but Three Nights in August is a true account of what a manager is thinking at the moment something is happening on the field or in the dugout. That it was a true account puts the negative comments in perspective.A reader will not get any closer to the action or gain a better appreciation on the life off the field of La Russa."},{"Title":"Three Nights in August: Strategy, Heartbreak, and Joy: Inside the Mind of a Manager","review":"The word Genius is vastly overused in society today and I hesitated using it because it's almost lost its meaning. But when it comes to the game of Baseball, Tony LaRussa is a genius. He's one of the great minds and thinkers the game has ever had. he's a four-time Manager of the year. Look at his record and you will see a guy who isn't all that much above .500 with a career .534 winning %. But in the fickle game of baseball, LaRussa has been able to to something few managers have ever been able to do...that is to put a competitive team out on the field and do so consistently. In his 25 year managerial career LaRussa's teams have finished in one of the top 3 spots in their division 18 times including 10 first place finishes. That is truly astounding!This book is a real testament to his \\"genius\\" a man who is so thoughtful and cerebral, you wonder how he can stand to deal with so many of today's primadonna athletes. The book focuses primarily on a three game series versus the hated rival Chicago Cubs. Buzz Bissinger takes an analytical eye and breaks down everything LaRussa does during these games from making out his lineups to deciding on which relief pitcher to use. LaRussa is like a Boy Scout ten-fold, virtually prepared for any situation and playing every angle he can to his advantage.We further hear LaRussa's insights on the major problem in baseball today...steroids, as well as the Manager's way of dealing with star athletes. A truly fascinating book for any true fan of baseball."},{"Title":"Three Nights in August: Strategy, Heartbreak, and Joy: Inside the Mind of a Manager","review":"This lifelong Cardinals fan managed to get through the book, but it's hard to imagine any non Cardinals fan who is not a speed reader doing the same.Though I am not an obsessive baseball fan (haven't seen a game even on TV for nearly 20 years), the in-game stategies Bissinger details are nothing surprising; in context, anyone, experienced or not, would seem likely to come up with them. Readers will learning virtually nothing here.To give Bissinger a break, it seems he agreed and perhaps signed a contract to write this book without realizing there would not be anything to say.Bissinger does not deserve a break for his criticisms of Lewis' \\"Moneyball,\\" however. (The hardback edition of \\"3 Nights,\\" perhaps, is not so strongly positioned against that far better book, but the paperback I read contains an afterword devoted entirely to trashing Lewis' book without (a) any understanding of it, (b) apparently, a rereading of it, and (c) any evidence whatsoever to butress Bissinger's \\"ya gotta have heart\\" position.Likewise, Bissinger deserves no break for the horribly bad, lazy prose here. Examples: Pujols is referred to in his first 20 or so mentions as \\"the great Pujols.\\" No variations (not even \\"the really great\\") of the phrase are used. Page 275: a player plays \\"each and every game at five hundred percent.\\" Page 254: a World Series victory is marked by a \\"Rubik's Cube of a hug.\\" Page 243 (and elsewhere): \\"sultry hot,\\" as if \\"sultry\\" does not imply \\"hot.\\" Page 224: \\"white hair as finely woven as pasta.\\" This is the kind of writing folks compose deliberately to win bad writing contests.Disappointingly, the paperback edition, at least, doesn't even have any pictures.Stay away from this one."},{"Title":"Three Nights in August: Strategy, Heartbreak, and Joy: Inside the Mind of a Manager","review":"I picked this up because my beloved White Sox are playing great baseball and I'm becoming consumed by this wonderful season. I tore through the book and recommend it highly for anyone who loves the game and wants to swim in the lore and detail of it. It's a great job of reporting and a wonderful appreciation of how the game should be approached. I could nitpick about some of the moments that annoyed me, but they are miniscule, a pop fly in a 10-9 slugfest. I loved this book."},{"Title":"Three Nights in August: Strategy, Heartbreak, and Joy: Inside the Mind of a Manager","review":"For all of the hype and attention this book received, this has to be one of the most disappointing baseball books I have ever read. I read this book hoping to gain a deeper understanding of the inner workings of managerial strategy than a fan usually has; instead I was treated to excessive fawning over simplistic ideas and well as a lack of understanding of baseball and its' statistics. The author italicizes the phrase \\"hit and run\\" as if it were a copy writ invention of Tony LaRussa. He acts amazed at the idea that managers and pitching coaches actually plot out pitching matchups in advance [and refers to that plan as the Thing of Beauty (his caps, not mine) ad nauseum]. He describes a curveball that doesn't break as going from \\"a killer 12 to 6 morphing into a very mortal 12 to 3\\" when what he is trying to say is that it flattens out in the center of the plate. He quotes the statistical line of pitcher Garrett Stephenson from 2000 and 2001 to show how off of a year he is having when anyone can see that the only significant change is his won-loss record, which is more of an indication of run support from teammates. He tries to prove that Albert Pujols has the best start of a career of \\"any player in the history of the game\\" by comparing his early career stats to those of Barry Bonds and Alex Rodriguez, as if they are the two best players in the history of the game, and as if that would in turn mean that they had the best two year start of any players.. He refers to the video room operator as the Cardinals \\"secret weapon\\", as if they are the only team to do this. He calls Rich Ankiel a \\"once in a millennium\\" lefthander, which not only would make him the best lefthander in the history of baseball but also as likely to remain so for the next 900 years. He describes an early August game between the Cardinals and Cubs (who are about tied for first place) as one that \\"the Cards cannot lose if they want to remain in the division race\\". I could go on and on but the basic idea is that one gets the impression that Bissinger just DOES NOT KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT BASEBALL. In addition, he has an atrocious writing style, with overstated metaphors and similes on almost every page. I would recommend this book for masochists who enjoy having their blood pressure shoot through the roof, as well as to any immediate family members of the author who would be so proud as to render them oblivious to the books' faults."},{"Title":"Three Nights in August: Strategy, Heartbreak, and Joy: Inside the Mind of a Manager","review":"I was a bit disappointed because I read \\"Men at Work\\" 15 years ago and much of this reads the same as the LaRussa chapter did in that book. The chapters herein that divert from the finer details of Larussa's internal thought process with strategy are the most interesting parts of the book. The Kile, Robinson, Ainkiel chapters are where Bissinger does his best. However, Bissinger fails to deliver on communicating the passion of this rivalry the way he so masterfully delivered on attacking that angle of the passionate fans in \\"Friday Night Lights.\\" Cardinal fans will love it because they love everything Cardinals. Bissinger fans will like it. Regular baseball fans of other teams will see this book as average."},{"Title":"Three Nights in August: Strategy, Heartbreak, and Joy: Inside the Mind of a Manager","review":"If you are a baseball fan you will love this book.As baseball is said to be the great American pasttime, the St. Louis Cardinals are one of the great original teams.3 Nights in August is an inside look at the Cardinals' up and down season in 2003, disecting what would prove to be one of the pivotal matchups of the pennant race between the Cardinals and the Chicago Cubs.The dramatic story had me rivited to the book the futher I got into it. Like a fast car that starts out slow, the story slowly builds into an epilogue that is impossible to resist. Bissinger explained a whole side of the game of baseball that I had never considered even in my over one-hundred games of attendance. Hey, as long as the beer is cold and a team is playing right? His explanations of strategy were thrilling. The stories about stealing bases, signs, explanation of fielding techniques were priceless.Bissinger also delves into the mind of Tony Larussa. Although LaRussa is mediocre as far as post-season goes compared to other Cardinal coaches, he is one of the older breed who really use psychology in the game rather than relying primarily on statistics. LaRussa's coaching strategy is so thorougly disected that I cannot wait to attend another game and really pay attention to things that had escaped my notice in the past.Stories about the human side of baseball were also empowering. In this day and age of mind-numbing salaries and stories of juicing, reading about Darryl Kile and his family was heartbreaking. Reading into the emotional side of greats such as Albert Pujols, Scott Rolen, and Jim Edmunds brought a real dose of personality to an otherwise stoic game. Perhaps the best part of the book is the description of emotions and problems that pitchers have to face, be it mental or physical, dealing with the sore arm, bum ankle, or damaged ego, while describing their reactions to events during the game.This book has special meaning to me because I've been a lifelong Cardinals fan and attended game 3 that was described in the book, flying halfway across the country to catch one of the pre-eminent matchups in MLB. The image of the Kerry Robinson walkoff home run in the 9th inning will never be erased from my mind. I'll never forget the Cubs fans sitting in the row ahead who we had been hecking with the whole game jumping up to give us high-fives. I'll never forget the fans in old Busch Stadium jumping to their feet in a deafining roar that isn't adequately portrayed in the book. A squadron of F-15 fighter jets could have flown over and no one would have noticed at that special moment.Thank you Mr. Bissinger for a great read that brings back many good memories of the St. Louis Cardinals and the wonderful game of baseball."},{"Title":"Three Nights in August: Strategy, Heartbreak, and Joy: Inside the Mind of a Manager","review":"This book is fabulous. I am only about 2/3rds through it, but I like the book so much, I had to write about it. The book is so compelling, I have to constantly remind myself that this is a tale of true events and not a non-fiction thriller.Between the strategy, stats and gut instincts, La Russa shows his affectiveness from pitch to pitch as well as helplessness when dealing with human spirit and bitter ironic situations. I'm not really a Cards fan, but have always been a fan of La Russa and this book shows exactly why he is admired."},{"Title":"Three Nights in August: Strategy, Heartbreak, and Joy: Inside the Mind of a Manager","review":"This book is a great chance to see what goes on in the many hours between baseball games and the life of an athlete on the road. Stories of Rick Ankiel and J.D. Drew are great examples of the perils of the modern athlete, while the part about Daryl Kile will tear out your heart! Reading about the seeming indifference of a gifted athlete like Jose Canseco can make one question why they believe in baseball, but then there's the story of Albert Pujols to restore one's faith. By the way, Bissinger mentions about Canseco's apathy about playing during the 1990 season without following up with the Oakland A's getting swept by the mighty underdog Red in the Series that year. My big question after reading the book is, \\"How does Tony LaRussa continue to function while getting so little sleep?\\""},{"Title":"Three Nights in August: Strategy, Heartbreak, and Joy: Inside the Mind of a Manager","review":"A well written book that provided some insight into the game, particularly the thought process of a manager. For that I give it three stars.But '3 Nights' was neither as enlightening nor thought provoking as a 5-star sports book - such as 'The Game' by Ken Dryden, 'Beyond the Sixth Game' by Gammons, or Lewis' 'Moneyball'. At times, Bissigner's work came across more as a hero worship of La Russa than a study of the game, which detracted from the author's credibility to accurately assess what he witnessed and learned from the dugout."},{"Title":"Three Nights in August: Strategy, Heartbreak, and Joy: Inside the Mind of a Manager","review":"If you have played or managed baseball at any level, this book is for you. This book offers a great view of the game from the manager's perspective. Even if the reader has never managed a baseball team the author goes into great detail explaining (through Tony La Russa's eyes) that this game is won not only by statistics, it is won by the desire, the hart, and by having a winning attitude. Is a great book, I couldn't put it down."},{"Title":"Three Nights in August: Strategy, Heartbreak, and Joy: Inside the Mind of a Manager","review":"Buzz Bissinger is an absolutly fantastic writer. This book combines an indepth behind the scenes look at Larussa and others, but also gives a lot of inside info on players like JD Drew, Pujols, and others. I love hearing about the managerial strategy, what happens after the game, in the club house etc. I'm not a big reader, but once I started this book, I couldn't put it down."},{"Title":"Three Nights in August: Strategy, Heartbreak, and Joy: Inside the Mind of a Manager","review":"This depiction of baseball was very interesting & insightful.

I will wait anxiously for Buzz's next offering."},{"Title":"Three Nights in August: Strategy, Heartbreak, and Joy: Inside the Mind of a Manager","review":"Great read. It gives someone who thinks the game is just about throwing and hitting a different view on how the game is really played"},{"Title":"Three Nights in August: Strategy, Heartbreak, and Joy: Inside the Mind of a Manager","review":"After reading the title I didn't even want to think about reading this book. But it is so much more than just a series in August. Wonderful book about baseball. I learned many things."},{"Title":"Three Nights in August: Strategy, Heartbreak, and Joy: Inside the Mind of a Manager","review":"I absolutely loved this book. I love the game of baseball and often wonder why someone does what he does in some situations. This book is a great insight into a great manager's thoughts and actions. It shows how the game has changed over the years, how the strategy has changed and how one split second can screw up an entire months worth of planning.I love hearing what he saw in players as they came into the game, and what he thinks of them now in comparrison. A very informative book. Too short in my opinion but packed full of knowledge."},{"Title":"Three Nights in August: Strategy, Heartbreak, and Joy: Inside the Mind of a Manager","review":"I was able to get through this book because (a) I hate starting something and not finishing it and (b) I love baseball.Bissinger often trumpets his own book as a primary counterpoint to \\"Moneyball.\\" Moneyball, Michael Lewis' bestselling book, hailed the approach of A's General Manager Billy Beane and is synonymous with the recent trend of baseball \\"statheads\\" of emphasizing statistical analysis and de-emphasizing traditional methods, such as in-person scouting and stealing bases. While Moneyball was quite deferential to Beane, the book was very smartly written, and if one has read any of Lewis' books, Moneyball fits along the theme of Lewis' preference to profile individuals who have thought outside of the box to get results.In a way, Bissinger's book is the \\"anti-Moneyball\\" in the sense that it is anti-intelligent. The book is not particularly well written; Bissinger has an interesting yet distracting way of trying to come up with original similes and metaphors that usually come off as less than artful. Just off the top of my head, I remember one example, paraphrased: \\"Kenny Lofton watched the pitch go by like someone who had just seen a passing car the make and model of which he was not sure of.\\"In addition, Bissinger often uses statistics for his own ends, but uses them improperly. For example, early in the book, he compares the statistics of a struggling 2003 Garrett Stephenson to the \\"breakout\\" year that Garrett Stephenson had in 2000. If you look at the stats that Bissinger himself provides, the ERA, K rate, and WHIP are nearly identical for both years; the only difference is wins and losses. Even LaRussa knows himself that wins and losses by themselves don't evidence a pitcher's merit; they are based largely on luck and run support.Due to inaccuracies like this, uninspired writing and overly deferential treatment to LaRussa and the Cardinals, I found Bissinger to be less than credible in anything he said. So even when he spun what should have been a heart rending tale regarding the late Darryl Kile, I found it hard to take anything he said at face value.All that being said, I have always liked Tony LaRussa as a manager. He deserves credit for being able to win his second World Series this past year with the worst team in history ever to win a World Series."},{"Title":"Three Nights in August: Strategy, Heartbreak, and Joy: Inside the Mind of a Manager","review":"Yes, I'm a Cards fan and thus a little biased. But, Bissinger nails the ballplayer atmosphere perfectly and this is just an outstanding read. As a former college & minor league player, I can say he's definitely captured things very well. The only way to improve this book would be to make it about 5x's longer. Ha!"},{"Title":"Three Nights in August: Strategy, Heartbreak, and Joy: Inside the Mind of a Manager","review":"I was fairly excitd about this new book from Buzz Bissenger being a baseball fan and loving Friday Night Lights as well, I was sure that this book was going to be a grand slam. full of all soorts of insights into the game I love. Although the book was good it wasn't great and maybe I was looking for something that isn't always possible a follow up book that was as good than the breakout ( Friday Night Lights)Bissenger is a good author and has a great ability to frame the content, but I thought this book bounced around to much from past Cardinal experiances to the present task of writing about the series against the Cubs. It was a bit choppy in the transitions and left a bit to be desired.However the part about Daryl Kile was brilliant and I did especially like the insight into Larussa's almost manic style of decision making.So I guess the question is would I have liked this book better had I not read Friday Night lights and had those expectations?....Probably Not"},{"Title":"Three Nights in August: Strategy, Heartbreak, and Joy: Inside the Mind of a Manager","review":"This is a very good sports genre book, but it could have been a little bit better. I was very skeptical when I picked it up, but I was very pleased by the end. it covered Tony La Russa as he prepared and executed his game plan around a series in 2003 against their arch-rivial Chicago Cubs. It covers him handling the Kile situation in 2002, how him & his wife handle his job, and gives his opinion on several of his players. As I read it, I was waiting for the obvious question: How did he get into management and choose it over the legal profession?. It never came.The writer also starts off comparing the rivally of the Cubs and Cards - and how it is more intense than the Yanks and Red Soxs - No Way!It is a great book for the baseball fan, but especially a St. Louis fan.Above average for a sports-genre book."},{"Title":"Three Nights in August: Strategy, Heartbreak, and Joy: Inside the Mind of a Manager","review":"I enjoy reading books about sports because of several reasons. First, I think it is a difficult genre to write effectively in without falling into play by play that is often difficult to translate into interesting narrative. Second, I'm often interested in the dynamic of team players and managers to see what breeds success. I picked up this book because I was interested to read about LaRussa and the success he's enjoyed.However, several paragraphs in the preface turned me off so much that I could not continue reading the book and wouldn't recommend it to any thirtysomething. This is the term used to downplay any success a thirtysomething could have. According to the author, there is no way the thirtysomething could have passion for the game, or know the history, or even care about it. Despite the author's obvious success with Friday Night Lights, he feels compelled to disparage Moneyball, a book I am familiar with, but have not read.If you think I've said thirtysomething enough times, I'm getting close to how many times he used it in the preface. Thirtysomethings have seen strike shortened seasons, watched the World Series canceled not because of a World War, but because grown men couldn't agree on what's best for baseball, seen arguably the best player ever bet on his sport, seen players pine tar, juice up, and rub baseballs with finger files so is it any wonder a thirtysomething may be a little skeptical of anyone's passion or commitment to the game?I may pick up the book again, omitting the preface, but as some reviews have mentioned, it seems the diatribe continues. What is the motivation? Who cares? Not this thritysomething."},{"Title":"Three Nights in August: Strategy, Heartbreak, and Joy: Inside the Mind of a Manager","review":"If you believe that Tony LaRussa invented baseball, this is the book for you. Otherwise you will find Buzz Bissinger's take on baseball's most overrated manager to be a trite piece of [...].A detailed description of Tony LaRussa and the Cardinals going through a 3 game series with the Cubs in 2003 is the focus of the book. The author attempts to show two things. First, how great Tony LaRussa is and secondly how complex managing a baseball game is. The author succeds on the first point as he fawns completly over his subject. On the second point, he fails greatly.Bissinger details each and every managerial decision that LaRussa makes as if he is building a space shuttle by himself. Baseball fans completely understand the decisions that LaRussa (and Dusty Baker) are making in real time and do not need them dumbed down for them as Bissinger does in this book.However, that is not the worst part of the book. Bissinger goes out of his way to knock anyone using statistical analysis (read the Moneyball crowd) to evaluate players while praising LaRussa for be able to utilize statistics. The reader is left to belive that Bissinger did not understand this paradox because he does not understand the game of baseball particulary well.The book also includes a significant amount of complaining about the money that the players of today are making for their efforts. This is amusing since LaRussa is among the top compensated managers in the game. Based on the fact that Super Manager LaRussa is 5-12 is World Series games and 1-3 in the World Series (In each series his team was a significant to prohibitive favorite.), Bissinger's arrows about being overpaid are shot at the wrong target.If you are a baseball fan who wants to learn something about the game, there are plenty of GOOD to GREAT books out there. Three Nights in August is not of them."},{"Title":"Three Nights in August: Strategy, Heartbreak, and Joy: Inside the Mind of a Manager","review":"I love Tony LaRussa, as I'm an A's fan. However, Bissinger has an agenda with this book. He wants it to be the anti Moneyball. He doesn't believe in the philisophy of using statistics to judge performance and make decisions. He has said this, and attacked Michael Lewis' Moneyball without offering any kind of decent rebuttal. He goes on some rant that humans aren't machines and that the human element is important. Yes, every person is different \\"Buzz,\\" and statistics are just a way of quantifying those differences. 4 postseason appearances for the A's and a world series title for the Red Sox bear out the success of sabermetrics. It's here to say, despite the fact that stubborn baseball people hate it because it destroys so much of their outmoded and inefficient ideas and strategies."},{"Title":"Carlson Wade's Natural foods crockery cookbook","review":"With the words 'natural foods' heading the title, I expected to find whole foods, vegetarian dishes, and low fat recipes. I did not. This cook book is exactly like every mainstream American cookbook I have encountered, it is full of meat recipes. Only 12 recipes made it into the vegetable section. In addition, there are ingredients called for such as 'canned mushrooms', 'packaged onion soup mix' and 'undiluted cream of mushroom soup'. One sauce recipe for a meat dish, called for a half pound of butter!

I kept seeing this author in the back of books, and I needed something new, so I tried it. I finished both books in three days. Which is pretty incredible for me, where a dormouse has a longer attention span. However, I must warn that unless you're ready to be grabbed by the ears and slammed against concrete for a few hundred pages, don't pick this up. It was such an emotional roller coaster I'm surprised that I'm willing to read more of West's work. But as I read I saw less of those annoying grammar problems (though the sentence fragments during dialogue were truly driving me deep into kelp forests), and found myself enjoying the story more. What is most irritating, though, is a failure to close on Gilliam of Elseth. I really felt that there was at least one more thing to be said. This is a roller coaster that I want to ride again, but not right away because my equilibrium is still sloshing about my ankles. I had to pick another book up just to get this one separated from my metabolism."},{"Title":"Hunter's Death","review":"Well, West managed to keep me hooked to the end, but the book didn't leave me with much of an impact. Missing was the humor of a Weis/Hickman book, the moral teachings of a Lloyd Alexander work or the drama of a Tad Williams book. The constant shift in viewpoint wore on me and took away from the drama rather than helping to build it. The setting is somewhat interesting, but the characters are mainly bland. Some, like Jewel, are interesting, but many are one-dimensional and utterly predictable. Ms. West puts in a few surprises and plot twists, which help out, but can't salvage the book from being totally average. I wouldn't recommend you buy this, but nor would I recommend you not to buy it. Maybe the best example of your average fantasy paperback."},{"Title":"Hunter's Death","review":"I found West's Hunter's Death, and its prequel Hunter's Oath, to be two of the best books around. They had solid settings, and in depth characters--without needing 10+ books to accomplish it in. The only reason I gave it four stars is because I thought that Stephen's Hunter, Gilliam, was a fascinating character and deserved more pages for his POV. Evayne, too, was a hit--simply because she tends to lose her mysterious airs in the Sunsword books, which is disappointing. All West's books are worth reading, but HO and HD are definitely more enthralling and well-written than any of her later 6 books."},{"Title":"Hunter's Death","review":"but...

Where the Hunterlords and their huntbrothers provide for the people, using the powers granted by the Hunter God, Bredan.

I have returned the book but I am afraid to order a new one. Hope no one else has this problem."},{"Title":"Hunter's Death","review":"Often when I begin sequels I always have that faint thought nudging at the back of my mind: Will it be as good as the first? Or will it fail to live up to what came before it? What surprised me here is that I didn't even bother to think that. I just assumed that it would live up to expectations - which shows the quality of West's writing as a whole - and indeed, it was just as good, if not better.The first book, HUNTER'S OATH, had revolved around things I don't usually find \\"appetizing\\" in novels - dogs, hunting, medieval-style fealty don't particularly interest me - although I had allowed it to pull me in all the same. But this time, it's got that same delicious sense of intrigue and suspense, all set in a much more fascinating place - the courts of Averalaan. Court intrigue is what I live for, and this book had more than enough to pull me in and keep me there.Hunter Lord Gilliam and Huntbrother Stephen are the lone Breodani bumbling their ways through the capital Averlaan, a city unlike anything they've ever known. There are mages there, Artisans, nobles, Queens - and demons. For Averlaan, and the whole Empire, are no longer safe; demons are infiltrating the city, intent on doing - what? No one knows - but Gilliam and Stephen may prove by the end to be the keys needed to save everyone.There is so much going on in this novel that I'm not even sure if you could call Stephen of Elseth the main character. There's Jewel, the poor girl who steals off the streets but can sense the future; Kallandras, an assassin-turned-bard; Evayne, the time-traveler - and many more. Each and every character with even the smallest part in the plot gets a full canvas upon which to sketch their lives and thoughts and motives. It's all done carefully, building up to the main battle, but each part leading you there is also fascinating. A lot can be read into the character's actions: while West describes everyone in exhaustive detail, she leaves it open in such a way that guessing at character relationships is really quite enjoyable.The result of all this build-up, perspective-switching, and analyzing of motives and ambitions is an epic tale with characters you really care about. By the time the climactic events happen, all those characters are firmly and solidly real - so real that the book became, to me at least, really powerful. West is an amazingly skilled writer, and I applaud her careful attention to the fostering of each subplot, character quirk, and historical reference. She manages to pull everything together thoroughly. HUNTER'S DEATH does not disappoint. I loved it!"},{"Title":"Hunter's Death","review":"Hunter's Death has been nothing short of one of the best stories I've ever read. A constant page turner, yet a dramatic tear-jerker. The cast is one of the best ever, and everytime I think of this book a tear comes to my eye (or a big smile stretches from ear to ear). If I were to count how many nights of 5 1/2 hours to 6 hours worth of sleep I got just b/c I couldn't put this book down, well, you'd be amazed I could have functioned throughout the entire week I spent mostly reading this book. But if you love a phenomenal storyline, an excellent plot, an unforgetable (in a good way) cast of characters, and to be touched emotionally like no other story has ever or could ever do to you, then this book is a must read. I recommend it to everyone that likes to read, PERIOD."},{"Title":"Hunter's Death","review":"This novel attempts to wrap up the major plots in this part of the fantasy world, leaving open several strands the author may choose to revisit later. I thought it was better than the first book, with the shift in location from the small, forested country of Breodanir to the large metropolis of Averalaan in Essaylien. This book introduces one of my favorite fantasy characters of all time: Jewel, a 15 year old leader of a band of street urchins. Jewel has a rare and untrained power to &quot;see&quot; certain events before they occur, and to &quot;know&quot; a lie from truth. The mysterious Evayne, Kallandras, and of course, Stephan and Gilliam advance the story to its conclusion, with the addition of a whole new cast of characters. It is both a great conclusion to the first book and a preparation by the author for the Sun Sword series. I could hardly wait for The Broken Crown to come out!"},{"Title":"Bound for Glory","review":"Essential reading for those that need a deeper understanding.

Everybody should read this book."},{"Title":"Bound for Glory","review":"I read this book many years ago, and I easily recommend it to anyone.

Told in true storteller fashion, one which twists and turns language into something alive and personal, Woodie Guthrie recounts his life, from Oklahoma to all around this great big old country. And by the books end, you feel you've rambled the whole way with him and seen what he had. This is an American classic on par with the Autobiography of Mark Twain. No American history book or teacher or what have you can give you a tenth of what this book can---i.e., the ethos of the American people who suffered many trials and tribulations, depravations and hardship, and yet managed to still be beautiful. So forget your Beatnicks and your New England Transcendentialists, and pick up a book worthy of being called an example of the American Bardic Tradition. You most certainly won't be an inch disappointed."},{"Title":"Bound for Glory","review":"This was a really great book. It's hard to believe one man would be so talented as both songwriter and autobiographer.

Which happens to be the last line of the book. I was knocked back. Guthrie represented a man, a real man out to do what he wanted to do in the way he wanted to do it. Hard to find in our times. Guthrie has been an inspiration for me and I cherish this book, and I am going to take the same approach as he has done in Bound for Glory, as I will in the book I have just begun, 'In the Eye of a Flower'.

It was written in the Mark Twain tradition - with all the down home and backwoods country dialect included.I enjoyed this story - it is a \\"real\\" story about real people. Woody did a fine job in telling this story.The book has great drama and pathos and would be enjoyable reading even if you didn't know who the heck Woody Guthrie was or what he turned into.

As in his time, many today have lost jobs, lost homes, gone hungry, and lost hope. Today, we are more removed from the land than in his time and less able to cope with poverty.

A literary work of art.The first half of his biography enlightens the reader as to Woody's many adventures, tragedies and general life as a youth during the 20's and 30's. Some sad, some spirited and above all told with vehemence.The remainder of his book is a get-down and travel throughout America by thumb and boxcar, witnessing the poverty, mistreatment and overall life on the rails, farms, \\"jungle\\" camps, skid row and waterfronts.

I likedthis, in large part because of the narration of his son Arlo . . . my only regret is that I didn't get to hear more of the elder Guthrie's songs; rather, just small snippets were played."},{"Title":"Bound for Glory","review":"I'd heard about this book for years, being a folk-music fan for many years. What surprised me was how good it really is and such a window into a time more similar to today than people think. If you ever wondered what all the fuss is about Woody Guthrie, read this remarkable book!"},{"Title":"Bound for Glory","review":"Bob Dylan said Guthrie's Bound For Glory left even more of an impression on him than Keroauc's On The Road. Both are two of the finest pictures of America produced in literature.Guthrie's protagonist, himself, is just an average poor citizen while Kerouac's, Sal Paradise, is a middle-class college kid. One may argue that Guthrie's character roams the US by consequence rather than choice, unlike Sal Paradise, but that's not true by the end. Guthrie, like Sal, would rather roam the country with his fellow man. Both books emphasize the hardships of the lower class, Guthrie's a bit more so. Perhaps that's why Dylan preferred it. Maybe he liked the folksy dialect Guthrie wrote in. I, however, can't distinguish a favorite. They're both close to my heart, two of the greatest works of literature to ever investigate America."},{"Title":"Bound for Glory","review":"This is one of the most important books ever written, and one of the best reads ever.Woody tells his story from his own perspective.

Crucial reading for anyone who wants to understand thecultural history of the United States, or grew up there!"},{"Title":"Bound for Glory","review":"if you area woody guthrie fan you will love this book. well done. it would be a good book for anyone who is interested in music or our country when it was younger."},{"Title":"Bound for Glory","review":"The story is real and keeps you turning pages. The delivery is perfect. His words are just so much fun to read."},{"Title":"Bound for Glory","review":"Wally Gator here, stepping in to do drop a little justice on the man Woody Guthrie. He's my new best friend, ever since I read his 1943 masterpiece BOUND FOR GLORY. Woody wrote a book unlike anything I have ever read before. A road story/ autobiography of the mans life up until that point, not your average song and dance man story, boy. The man wrote unique and witty stuff, yet true, sometimes painfully true. Observe if you will the following quote... \\"There is a stage of hard luck that turns into fun, and a stage of poverty that turns into pride, and a place in laughing that turns into fight.\\" ...Damned straight wisdom. Everybody knows its true, just needed to be put down in such a way. I think thru and thru this is what Woody Guthrie was trying to put down through this epic peice of American writing, damn straight wisdom. The whole story is a series of struggles, fought by himself, his family, and the countless characters he meets on the road, while hard travelin' in the formitive 20th century America (between the two World Wars). I took my sweet time reading this book, and really enjoyed soaking up the words and wisdom of Woody Guthrie. Its to bad he didn't write more books in his time, a true joy to read. You feel your heart plummet at some of his falls, yet you can't help but laugh at some of his struggles, and the whole time you get the notion that life really isn't that tough, and should be lived to its fullest. Easily relatable, even if it does take place in a different America, in a different time. There is a great little scene where he gets curious about this medicine that people keep buying during prohibition while he's working at a pharmacy. \\"I drank it all down, and when I woke up I was out of a job.\\" Insanely awesome book. GET crackin' on this one!"},{"Title":"Bound for Glory","review":"The rollicking memoir recounts Guthrie's coming of age among the hardscrabble farms, boomtowns, labor camps, and hobo jungles of early 20th century America. The book contains many vivid and visceral images of cruelty, madness, courage, and joy, tracing Guthrie's boyhood in Oklahoma to his early days of travelling the country by freight train, with his guitar slung across his back.Guthrie's winning down-home voice can at times seem affected, falsely ingenuous, and it seems a shame that he doesn't address politics more directly in the book, given his sophistication and close involvement in the labor movement of the Depression.But overall, a fun and spirited read."},{"Title":"Bound for Glory","review":"I read this book in one day and then listened to woody's discography. It's amazing what he's been through and think everyone should be more like woody."},{"Title":"Bound for Glory","review":"Woody Guthrie had an honest vision of the Great Depression.

This particular volume includes much critical treatment - most of it not infected with the more pustulous revulsions postmodernism oozes - as well as biographical accounts of various times and much correspondence. Niedecker's is a lyrical voice which eschews the elaboration lyricism often dangles, while feeding on ambiguities lying somewhere between natural observation, Freudian autobiographical association, free-form mental imaging, and stunning word, sound, and image juxtapositions.This is a multivariate compendium of slants on the poet and her work, worth, just in crass dollar considerations, three times the price it commands. A Very High Recommend."},{"Title":"Waiting for the World to End","review":"The main character, Thomas Olsen, appears to be living an ideal existence. He is chair of the English department and the head basketball coach at a high school in Indiana. His teams have been very successful, having advanced to the state tournament several times. If you know anything about the role of basketball in Indiana, you understand that this would place him slightly on either side of godhood.However, under the crust of success, popularity, poetic talent and good looks, there resides a very lonely man. His parents were both intellectuals and distant, so he is unable to overcome the feelings of loneliness that still haunt him from childhood. Ben Wendling, the star on the basketball team and very talented in the English classroom, begins to become a surrogate son. When Thomas meets his mother (Mary), it is love at first sight on his part. Unfortunately, she is married and a deeply religious woman.The relationship between Ben and Thomas continues to deepen and that between Thomas and Mary continues to sparkle and fizzle. She returns some of the obvious affection he has for her, but they never share any real intimacy. Mary's husband (Virgil) is a man who had in some sense rescued Mary, as she was an unwed mother with a child, an outcast, rejected by her parents with no place to go. Rather than bringing Mary, Virgil and Ben together, their past seems to create a chasm between them.The relationship between Ben and Thomas becomes cemented for life when Thomas saves Ben's life after a freak accident. By coincidence, after Ben accepts a scholarship to Tucson State, Thomas is offered a job as assistant basketball coach at Tucson State. Thomas enjoys the life in the desert, falling in love with another woman and eventually getting engaged. However, even though there is distance in time and years, Mary Wendling still tugs at Thomas from time to time. Eventually, Virgil and Mary divorce and independently, Thomas and his fianc&eacute; split up. Thomas and Mary then meet at Ben's wedding, but I will not reveal the results.This is a book where relationships between the characters are numerous and complex.*) The male-/young male relationship between Thomas and Ben.*) The male/older male relationship between Thomas and his elderly neighbor.*) The husband/wife (white knight) relationship between Virgil and Mary.*) The spiritual relationships of Mary and Ben.*) The unfulfilled love between Thomas and Mary.*) The woman/woman relationship between Mary and Thomas's fianc&eacute;.*) The subtle rivalry over a woman between Thomas and Virgil.*) The male/male relationships between Thomas and his fellow coaches.*) The dysfunctional relationship between Thomas and his mother.*) The relationship Thomas has with himself, where he seems to be unable to do anything to break out of his loneliness pattern. This is the dominant relationship in the book.With all of these relationships, some of which are counter to others, this book contains a lot of subtle action. Even though basketball is a dominant theme, there are only incidental descriptions of events on the court, and then only when needed to set the stage for an aspect of the relationships. With so much going on in that area, there are times when the author gets very close to the limit of relationships overload, but never quite gets there. Thomas's life is full in many respects, yet empty in others, which is a way to describe all of us. I enjoyed the book, including the ending, but I am sure others will not approve of the conclusion."},{"Title":"Waiting for the World to End","review":"This is a beautiful book that I had to put down in many places to ponder the emotions it was evoking in me. I became so engrossed in the characters that I felt I was living my life along side theirs. I didn't want the book to end and I'm hoping Ms. Hunter is working on a sequel.At one point, one of the characters says, \\"We leave so much unsaid to the people we love.....and for what? Because we're afraid, or shy----because we just don't know how to put it into words-----and then it's too late.\\" Wow! I put the book down and told my wife how much I loved her.The book is full of tender insights like that. I loved it."},{"Title":"Waiting for the World to End","review":"I found I had to make myself stop reading and take time to reflect on the characters as the story unfolds. Thomas is a complex person with the ability to evolve in understanding himself and others. Of particular interest is his experience of loss through a decision for abortion which is usually attributed to women and how it weaves through the story of his life.I am left wondering, \\"what is Thomas reading now?\\", and \\"what is Thomas doing today?\\"I hope to read more from this author who is a new creative voice! I found myself thinking of \\"Back When We Were Grown-ups\\" by Ann Tyler who also has a gift of dialogue and ability to express the main character's life experience."},{"Title":"Waiting for the World to End","review":"I've always been curious about basketball coaches -- why they wear those ties, what's going on in their heads, how they start out with individuals and end up with a team. Now I know . . . except for the part about the ties.Having finished \\"Waiting for the World to End,\\" I miss the fun of guessing what the coach and the others will do next (which was seldom what I expected them to do). These are people I'd like to know, or maybe have known, so I'm wondering what they'll do after the story is over.Of course I'm still wondering the same thing about old movies: Will Ilsa come back to Casablanca? When Rick and Captain Renault walk off together into the night, is it really the beginning of a beautiful friendship? Who is to say?"},{"Title":"Waiting for the World to End","review":"I was caught off-guard, when I finally realized -how intriguing Tom Olsen's experiences suspensefully captivated -my need to find out what happens next? and how will it end up??!!! My body and soul connected virtually realistic to emotions within this character. I most enthusiastically recommend others to vicarioulsy know what Joe Average is thinking. Thank you, Nicole Hunter, for urging my fingers to turn the page like the best fiction now offers; and doing it in such original style. I am anxiously awaiting your next publication. :-)"},{"Title":"Waiting for the World to End","review":"This book is well-written, with complex characters that ring true to life. There are so many layers to this story, its hard to decide what to comment on. The idea that people feel like actors in their own lives is one that rings especially true for me. Most of the characters here have secrets, and you feel that the face they put on in public doesn't reflect who they really are. Much of the tension that drives the story comes from the conflict between these public and private lives of the various characters.The story is told from Thomas Olsen's point of view, and it is nice to find a male character that is both an athlete and a scholar. He enjoys and excels in his sports, but he also has the soul of a poet and appreciates the power of language. This provides what struck me as a refreshingly honest insight into the inner life of a genuine man. While he is clearly flawed and has trapped himself in his regrets, Olsen remains highly sympathetic, and you can help but hope he finds happiness.Touching on issues of faith and belief, this book provides a complex emotional story about loss and love. We hope for a happy ending, but the ambiguous ending allows the user to extrapolate their own ending to the story."},{"Title":"Waiting for the World to End","review":"Despite the fact that I initially didn't care for the personality of the main character (Tom), I found this book to be profoundly enlightening. It tells the story of a man who appears to have everything, but isn't really enjoying anything. His life seems to be on hold, as he waits for happiness to happen. The other characters (Mary and her son, Ben) don't have perfect lives, either, but find comfort in their faith, which they try to share with him. He wants to believe, but it's a real struggle.The author, Nicole Hunter, combines poetry, song lyrics, and the main character's internal dialog into the story to cleverly illustrate Tom's alternating feelings of hope and despair. Without preaching, she gets the reader to examine their own feelings on many moral issues, and she imparts insightful messages that will vary with the life experiences of the reader.I found the book to be very well written, easy to read, and the many unpredictable turns made it hard to put down. The ending was a surprise, but since everything happens for a reason, I hope the reason will be revealed in a sequel!"},{"Title":"Waiting for the World to End","review":"Our book club read Waiting for the World to End this month and discussed it for over 3 hours instead of our usual 1 hour. All of us (13) were engaged and affected by the story and the characters, who are like living, breathing people. We each had a character in particular who either touched a nerve or touched our hearts.Choices about abortion are central to the story but there's no judgment or politicking, and to me, they're a symbol of the major choices we all have to make in life and the paradoxes they bring, how nothing is as clearcut as we think.I highlighted favorite quotes all through the book but these are my top 3:We have some things in common, Mary...Mothers and fathers who hardened their hearts against us for being who we are...and truths we never speak...and the masks we wear in this world...a world that lies in wait to say we don't measure up.\\"God didn't work the way I used to think He would,\\" said Mary. \\"He didn't give Ben NBA talent or an Einstein brain, or a winning lottery ticket. He gave Ben some good people in his life who love him.\\"A father is a leader and a loner, a sinner and a saint, a man and a boy. He is blood, he is soul, and he is heart. A father walks with you to the door of the future, and knows he can't go with you, and sets you free."},{"Title":"Waiting for the World to End","review":"To say that this book is a page turner is an understatement. The ease and fluidity that is so evident in Hunter's writing style kept me captivated from my first encounter with Tom Olsen right through to the thought-provoking, unconventional conclusion. Since I am home on break from college, I was more than happy to find a book that challenged me spiritually and intellectually, while still managing to be entertaining and suspenseful.As I read the book, I could not help but wonder how Hunter managed to so accurately capture the humanity of such wide variety of people. The realism that oozes from each page of the book is precisely why I found Waiting... so hard to put down.The beauty of this novel is that the reader gains what he or she aspires to gain. Hunter does not come to unnecessary conclusions for the reader. She holds her audience's interpretations in high regard, as is evident in several key junctures in the story. This author-reader trust allowed Waiting for the World to End to become the most profound and perceptive book I have read in the contemporary fiction genre."},{"Title":"Waiting for the World to End","review":"I started off reading this novel is 11th grade English class. Typically, I AM NOT a fan of reading, especially books. As I dove into the book, I began to like it more and more, as each chapter went on. I was enjoying reading! Stop The Presses! Not only was I enjoying this book, but the rest of my class and all the other students reading it. They were sucked into it, like a tornado, only a good tornado :-). What I especially liked in the book was when Tom's (the main character) inside thoughts and emotions were shown in the book, in the bold type. It related to every typical person, the things you so long to say, yet just think them to yourself. I also found it very cool that Ms. Hunter made many allusions to the town of Valparaiso (In which I have lived the entire seventeen years of my life), and how much detail and percison she described them with. She was so accurate, it was amazing.This book was excellent, and I really liked it, the only downside I found to the novel was the last chapter of the book. The preluding chapters seemed to forshadow a major event (which I was anticipating), however the event never took place. The ending of this book I felt it really threw me off track, and it left me confused.Overall, this book was excellent. I really enjoyed reading it, and I would reccommed it to anyone over the age of sixteen.!!!BUY THIS BOOK!!!!"},{"Title":"Waiting for the World to End","review":"Over the holidays, my mother and I read \\"Waiting for the World to End\\" together. We took turns reading out loud to each other, and often paused to talk about the beautiful phraseology and the interesting philosophical aspects of the story.We found the characters to be so real that we felt like we were living their lives right along with them, and we went through every gamut of emotion as we poured through the pages.At times, I wanted to shake Olsen by the collar...then other times, I wanted to shake sense into Mary -- realizing eventually, that what I really wanted to do was give myself a good shaking, because I was tapping into a part of myself in each of them.As I got more and more involved in the book, I wanted to start underlining things. But, I didn't want to stop reading long enough to get a pencil, nor did I want to sever the lifeline that connected me to the altered state I found myself in. So, I decided I'd have to go back and read the book again.The essay on fathers, written by Ben, was absolutely beautiful. It made me cry. Every father should read it and aspire to being this kind of dad.I took a journey into self with Lissa's calm response of, \\"It doesn't seem like your heart is really in this, Tom,\\" and Cara's mature apology to Tom for judging Mary. It reminded me that the \\"all about me\\" response of anger when a relationship is in trouble isn't beneficial to anyone. It's not about \\"what you did to me!\\" -- it's about what we're here to learn from each other. It's how we grow from the experience of being together...whether good of bad, happy or sad.My greatest surprise was that it didn't end the way I expected it to -- but that's the gift Ms. Hunter gives to her readers. She allows us the opportunity to come to our own conclusions as to where Olsen and Mary go from here. As Ben said, \\"You just make your life exactly what you want it to be.\\" So, that's what I did. I envisioned their future the way I wanted it to be!This is one of the most thought-provoking books I have ever read, and I highly recommend it. It's also one of the most beautifully written books I've had the pleasure to read. Well done, Ms. Hunter! Keep writing!"},{"Title":"Waiting for the World to End","review":"I took this book on an out-of-town family weekend and I couldn't put it down! It was even a little embarrassing, but Nicole Hunter's novel was that compelling! Her writing style is lyrical and her story is so well crafted that I felt like I was present in Tom Olsen's life. The series of mystical connections between characters draws a thread through the story and builds from one high point to another until you reach the final climax. I don't want to give the story away to anyone who hasn't read it, but this book will be a favorite of mine for a long time to come!"},{"Title":"Waiting for the World to End","review":"this book prompted lots of argument, or should we say discussion ;- ) between the men and women in our group. The majority of men like the character Thomas Olsen and sympathize or identify with him, while most of the women don't like him. Most of the men really like Mary and totally get Olsen's attraction to her (but a few guys think she's a tease), while a lot of the women have serious problems with Mary's behavior. Some of the women in our group really sympathize with Mary, though, because she had a lot of inner conflict but really tried to do the right thing for her son's sake. We all agreed on liking Mary's son Ben so there was no argument there. Most of us have a son or daughter who plays or played high school sports and we all identified with that aspect of the book. We liked the way the author uses poetry in the story ~ it's something different and even those of us who don't like poetry (most of us) felt it added to the characters and how we understood them. We can't remember the last time a book stimulated this good a discussion for us."},{"Title":"Waiting for the World to End","review":"Is my mistake that I trusted the reviews? That, on itself, is not a mistake. It is a mistake however not knowing what type of book you're reading that has been rated so highly. It's like watching a movie. If a horror movie gets 5 stars you should not expect to see an Oscar-worthy or a Fellini film, right? So the question here is, what type of book is this?This is a book about a religious group of Midwestern whose lives seems a little bit too simple, where everybody is either great, beautiful and smart...or bad, insensitive and awful. Life is just not like that. Characters are shallow, there are not complexities and there is certainly not much of a plot.The main character is a basketball coach. A man. The author might know something about hoops but believe me, she does not have any idea how any men I've been around in 35 years (me being one of them) thinks or speaks. Her descriptions of him, the way he speaks, etc. are wishful views from a woman or completely stereotypical (e.g. drinking beer after or before anything).Even worse, in my humble opinion, the author intends to convey through the characters what is right and what is wrong. Black or white. And all associated with God. God and the religious message is everywhere (the main character looks for his faith -or lack thereof- during the whole book) and seems to be, in the context of this book at least, the solution for everything. Writing about God, religion or religious people can be done well and interestingly, making it...literature; this book looks like religious propaganda, at least to me anyway.And I am also truly surprised to see the author constantly writing the important lines in bold (you don't need to do that if you write well!) and there is plenty, but plenty of clich&eacute; lines. Even cheesy to be honest and more precise.Now again, my mistake was not knowing what type of book I was buying. If you are a religious and simple person (a truly blessing I would honestly say! -and not punch intended) and see life in very small range of grays you might enjoy this book. Otherwise I can bet you, you will not. Regardless, happy readings!"},{"Title":"Waiting for the World to End","review":"This is the first book I have read because I usually get bored and just stop reading. But \\"Waiting for the World to End\\" kept me waiting for class so I can get though a few chapters. I was always interested in what was going to happen next. This book has definately inspired me and I would love to read more of Nicole Hunter's books."},{"Title":"Waiting for the World to End","review":"This book was such a pleasure to read. I found myself staying up way later than usual to read it and it followed me into the bathroom many times as well. Nicole Hunter writes so well. I really got to know the characters intimately thanks to her talent. It wasn't just the characters either, but the settings and situations are so well depicted, like a movie in my head, I could \\"see\\" everything going on. Reading this book has really spoiled me. I've tried to read three books since, but none of them kept me interested long enough to finish. Conversely, I'm going to read her book again. It was just that enjoyable. (...) If you are reading this review Miss Hunter, I would like to thank you for writing it. It bought me back to several instances in my own life that had me really daydreaming back to the good old days. Great book, great writing, great experience."},{"Title":"Waiting for the World to End","review":"It was the perfect book to take on vacation...once I sat down I couldn't peel my eyes away from it...therefore creating some well needed rest. What totally caught me off guard was the perspective in this book. I never had any insight into the male's view of this complex issue. The ending was not how I would have expected but, then again, life isn't always perfect. I personally purchased the book after reading the \\"loaned\\" copy so that I could reference all the chosen passages again and again. I'm looking forward to rereading again which is not usually what I do. Great first book...is there a sequel coming soon?"},{"Title":"Waiting for the World to End","review":"Once I started reading \\"Waiting for the World to End\\" I couldn't put it down. It seemed like a real-life story for me as I love Ohio State, am an avid high school basketball fan, am a 27 year retiree from a school system and I actually know a Virgil Wendling from our hometown.This book was very easy to read and certainly held my interest. I look forward to Nicole Hunter's next book as I think she is a super author and must also be a super person. Nancy Davis"},{"Title":"Waiting for the World to End","review":"After digesting this book for a couple days, I remain in awe of the white space, the things the author didn't say, something I always appreciate in a visual work of art. For instance, even though the abortion is an event that obviously impacted the main character Olsen's life, little is written about it. And, when Coach Olsen receives a letter from Kristina, the woman who had the abortion, Ms. Hunter relates that he doesn't open it without going on about the incident or playing up the symbolism. She leaves it to the reader to put the pieces together, to get or not get the subtle clues and symbols, the spaces between the lines. She also handles the religious issues in the book with a similar, quiet, understated touch, not moralizing or prostelytizing.Another aspect of this book that amazed me was the way Ms. Hunter brought a male jock character to life (Olsen). Coach Olsen is not painted in broad, stereotypical strokes. He is complex, sensitive, conflicted, but still a guy's guy. Being a sports guy and an artist-type, I constantly contend with many facets of my being, and related to Olsen. I felt for him and understood his internal battles, and wanted things to work out for him. And they do in a way, but the ending is not simple, without mystery, or contrived, which is consistent with the rest of the book. Indeed, I'm glad the book is not so black and white and the ending not so soap-operaish. I am reminded of writer William Trevor's observation that nothing in life is black and white, but rather shades of gray.In sum, this book is easy to read, with the chapters nice bite-size chunks, and hard to put down. It is compelling, and the writing and characters have lots of heart, sensitivity and depth. Definitely worth the time."},{"Title":"Waiting for the World to End","review":"The promotional tagline for this astonishingly good book describes it as \\"the first novel about abortion and faith in middle America\\". And, yes, the burden of \\"unforgivable\\" guilt over a decades-old abortion forms a huge piece of the main character's motivations and demotivations. At one point, a frantic attempt to keep abortion-related memories from resurfacing leads to one of the most powerful scenes in recent literature! But to me, this hauntingly beautiful story is mostly about love, salvation, and doing the right thing.The author creates a heart-achingly sweet (chaste) love story between her lost, lonely protagonist and an irresistible (but married!) woman who literally leaps into his life one day and changes his world forever. Tom Olsen and Mary Wendling are two kindred, injured people - both nursing pain that dates back to childhood, and almost from the start, each realizes that the other is capable of providing some measure of earthly salvation. These two seem genuinely made for each other, yet any reader with any sense of either religious or basically-good-person morality will be uneasy with their relationship; Mary belongs to someone else; moreover, as a committed believer, she belongs to God!The theme of trying to find salvation in another person is also seen in Tom's fatherly love for Ben, Mary's son, who was (even before he met Mary) the boy he'd been coming to regard as \\"child of my heart.\\" Loving - and being loved by - Ben ties all the main characters and events together. Through Ben, Olsen learns something that this reviewer discovered many years ago through the writings of Fr. Anthony DeMello (THANK HEAVEN FOR THE DAY HE WAS BORN!), who taught me that true happiness - or unhappiness - cannot be caused by anyone or any thing...Still, we yearn for Tom and Mary to be together, and I (at least) could imagine one or two deus ex machina possibilities for bringing that about. The author, however, seems to turn her story over to a very real God, who intervenes in wholly unexpected ways to bring their story to a much more challenging, more sensitive conclusion. Let the clich&eacute; answers stay in the pulp romance section; they're not needed in fiction of this caliber.Nicole Hunter writes like a dream, and her book is peopled with living characters. It's also rich with story-advancing poetry, as well as allusions that (hopefully) will make the reader pause to think: What is the significance of Ulysses? Why does a simple gift of friendship come from Pandora's Gallery? Why does a pivotal scene take place in the sanctuary of Calvary church? And - though we all know better than to judge a book by its cover - that photo of a beautiful-but-flawed young man deserves special consideration.I highly recommend this unforgettable novel to any thoughtful reader - especially one in search of hope or forgiveness. If you absolutely can't buy the book, though, try to find some time to look up Proverbs 3:5-6 and Romans 8:28. BUT PLEASE UNDERSTAND, this unsolicited bit of evangelizing is mine, not the author's! The life-changing message in Ms. Hunter's novel transcends that of any one religious or political viewpoint."},{"Title":"Waiting for the World to End","review":"The writing is quite good but the story...not so much.We get inside the protagonist's head quite well but his emotions shift, he's restless, unfulfilled. In short, like anyone else with no real purpose.Then he falls for a married woman. Or maybe it's her son that he coaches in basketball. But again, he's wishywashy about it all. I get irritated with him. Worse, I don't like him very much so even when I want to say, Enough! Do something even if it's wrong! - I don't care enough to say it.As I said, the writing is excellent and kept me reading to the end. In lesser hands, I would have put it down after the first few chapters.So, it may not be a book for me, but others may love it. I think this is for literary readers and I, alas, read mostly for entertainment."},{"Title":"Waiting for the World to End","review":"The book, \\"Waiting for the World to End\\" had its high points and low points. The story is a little dragged out threw some parts and can be a little boring. The characters in the story made me mad with some of the things they did. Overall the book mad me upset, but it keeps you reading to find out if the characters turn out happily ever after!"},{"Title":"Waiting for the World to End","review":"every time I read this book I find a new revelation in it. It has so many threads and layers. When I share the book with friends they love it as well. Everybody sees something different or likes something different about it. It's a universal story that's also personal."},{"Title":"Waiting for the World to End","review":"Waiting for the World to End? Makes you wonder what it could be about. Almost as if a person was dying. When you think about it though, Tom really is dying. I like the way Nicole Hunter shows internal conflicts with all of the characters. With all of the internal conflict Tom has you really wonder how he is still living. This book had me at the edge of my seat wondering if Tom and Mary would ever get together. This is a great book to sit down and read, many times over agin.The part that had me most interested was the relationship between Ben and Mary. They love each other very much and Mary would be dead without Ben. It reminds me of me because I also have a relationship like that with my mother. Its always nice to have someone you can count one when you are down. I definitely recommend everybody to read this book. The more times you read it, the more you pick up. If you understand it and know what is going on, you will enjoy it more."},{"Title":"Waiting for the World to End","review":"Each time I would set this book down, the characters followed me, as if they were members of my own household. On a five-mile run, on a trip to the grocery store, during Easter mass, I continued to dwell on their predicaments, their dreams, their values and their choices.In, \\"Waiting for the World to End\\", Nicole Hunter creates a nostalgic glimpse of small-town life in Indian River, Indiana, where it is still okay to revere your English teacher, have a beer with your neighbor, and give a man hope when you tell him you'll be praying for him. Thomas Olsen coaches high school basketball in a community where the sport is more important than prime time television; he is also the head of the English department, and can inspire his students with poetry rather than what is playing on their iPods. In the eyes of his friends, he has a perfect life - single, good-looking and respected. Inwardly he feels like an impostor, and is haunted by a decision, two decades earlier, to drive his then fiance to a clinic for an abortion. The loss he feels from that day pervades him, makes him aloof and melancholy, until he finds a second chance to be a father to Ben, who plays on Indian River's basketball team.Thomas finds an even stronger connection in Ben's mother, Mary, a long-haired, free-spirited contradition - a sincere Lutheran, adoring mother and faithful wife, though she also harbors an inner despair.Thomas is a Byronic hero - his face grimmed by the decision he made two decades earlier, yet more vulnerable and thus open to a new kind of love because of the remorse that decision engendered.The writing is elegant and stylized. When Thomas encounters Mary, you can almost feel the camera down-shift into slow-motion, like a documentary, as he takes in the nuances of her movement - how she smooths her sweater with her hand, or how she twirls her hair between her fingers. It brings to mind the microscopic detail of Nabakov's \\"Lolita\\" (without the urge to burn the book).Hunter skillfully weaves the words from several poems, including the title poem, in Thomas' internal monologue, adding a poignancy to the decisions he must face. We can appreciate characters who draw inspiration and succor from well-phrased words, even as we, the reader, do the same.As I read the last paragraph and reluctantly set the book down, I knew I would continue to visit Hunter's characters in my mind. I finished the book feeling uplifted, entertained, and immensely rewarded."},{"Title":"Waiting for the World to End","review":"I recently finished reading the book \\"Waiting for the World to End\\" and it's so good that I wish I could go back in time and read it all over again. I don't like a lot of books, but when I read a novel like this, it provokes me to go out and try to find similar books.Nicole Hunter does a great job of telling the story how it is and creating an imaginary place where you find yourself sucked into. At different times I felt as if I was right there next to Tom, Ben, and Mary as they discovered how all their lives would unfold. You just can't find great books like this anymore."},{"Title":"Waiting for the World to End","review":"This book is one of the best books I have ever read. I was assigned to read this book for my English class. I thought that it would be one of those \\"boring\\" books, in which i would lose intrest in right away. But when I picked up this book and started reading, it caught my attention immeadiately; I was hooked. I could not put the book down. The plot has so many twists and turns, that I would defintely recommend it to any one.

Their just wasn't one climax, it had many. The main character, Tom Olsen, which i've heard many dislike. What's to dislike about him? That he's real, and has \\"real\\" feelings just like everyone else on this earth. The ending, i will admit i didn't like as much because him and Mary didn't get together. But the more i thought about it, i started to like the ending. I'm tired of all the happy ever after endings. That's not life, and i wouldn't want a happy ever after ending in every book, or movie. So i just want to say thank you for writing such a superb book. It makes you think about choices you will have to make in years to come."},{"Title":"Waiting for the World to End","review":"This is a truly sensational book. I recently read \\"Waiting For The World To End\\" by Nicole Hunter in my Honors English class. At first I couldn't really get into the book. For me, it's hard to be interested in something that I am being forced to read, but as I got further and further into the book I realized that in some ways I could relate to certain situations or scenarios. Personally, I loved this book. If you pay close attention, you will find that this book can teach you life long lessons. I think that Nicole Hunter is brilliant because in this book she doesn't just touch on one specific issue. She covers all different types of issues. I know that this book has helped me find some answers that I have been looking for, for a long time."},{"Title":"Waiting for the World to End","review":"This was a refreshing book. I thought it was written with great insight. The ending was a change from the typical happy ending. The characters seemed real not fictional. I liked that your evil character Virgil had more than one personality trait. Thank-you for having a conference call on a Saturday morning; that was really gracious of you to do that. Thank-you for writing this wonderful book.

But, because I'm an administrator, and not a member of the jury, I rarely have an opportunity to read the books that are submitted for consideration.I recently took a rare day-of-rejuvenation, and grabbed Waiting For The World To End from my \\"been meaning-to-read\\" pile and headed out to my deck to enjoy a perfect early-summer morning. Although I did struggle a bit with guilt-anxiety for taking the day off, by the second chapter I was completely committed to the book, and didn't think about work for the rest of the day. I finished Waiting in one seating. It's a thoroughly enjoyable read with a complex storyline and rich character development. I just kept thinking, \\"why isn't Nicole Hunter on the New York Times best-seller list?\\" Ms. Hunter is an extremely gifted writer.When reading this book, I was reminded of when I first discovered John Grisham in 1989 with his debut novel, A Time To Kill. I couldn't understand why he wasn't better known. At the time, he was selling his debut novel out of the trunk of his car. Imagine it. Two years later, the world discovered The Firm and the rest is, of course, literary history.Those who discover Nicole Hunter and Waiting For The World To End will have uncovered a great secret treasure for themselves. A perfect book for the classroom and reading groups, Waiting For The World To End will provoke readers of all ages to consider and clarify personal beliefs, and encourage them to keep their minds and hearts open to people who have made other choices or hold different opinions.As I read the last page and closed the book cover, I felt a great sense of pride that our program honors such strong and important work.Dawn MathesonExecutive DirectorMom's Choice AwardsFootnote: Nicole Hunter and Waiting For The World To End earned the prestigious gold medallion for adult fiction in the 2007 Mom's Choice Awards."},{"Title":"Waiting for the World to End","review":"\\"Waiting for the World to End\\" is a book everyone can relate to in one way or another.

It'll have you never wanting to put it down."},{"Title":"Waiting for the World to End","review":"The novel, \\"Waiting For The World To End\\" by Nicole Hunter, is a timeless novel of love, faith, jealousy, and happiness in a twisted story about a teacher who becomes infatuated with a student's mother. Whenever I would read this novel, I would think of how I would have reacted to some of the things the different character were going through. How would I have said it? What would I have done in that situation? These questions and more made me want to pick up the boook and keep reading. The thoughts and feelings of these people were so real that I sometimes found myself asking or telling the same statements as the characters would. This book keeps you trapped in it's clasp until the very end of the book. Filled with adventure, love, hate, and confusion, this book will be a never-ending emotional trip through every inch of your mind."},{"Title":"Waiting for the World to End","review":"\\"Waiting for the World to end\\" is a fabulous book that takes place right in my own home-town of Valparaiso Indiana.It brings up many different opinions and touches on a various amount of topics, such as; relationships, divorce, death, abortion,marriage, and alcohol abuse. Nicloe Hunter is the author of this novel, she brings a wide variety of views on the incidents that take place in the story. You'll constantly be guessing what prediciment Tom Olsen, the main character, will be putting himself in next. For example, Tom is an english teacher and basketball coach at Indian River High School.He becomes absolutely infatuated with his best and favorite player's mom.That very situation causes even more inner problems for Tom. To find out what happends next or ride the rollercoaster of events in Tom's life, read this great novel."},{"Title":"Waiting for the World to End","review":"The charcters in this novel are well rounded belivable individuals. I often found myself pondering the difficult moral dilemmas of the book. There are many conflicts in \\"Waiting for thw world to end\\" and many of them have more than one solution, and the outcome we hope for does unfortunatly not always come through...Although the book is in a genre I don't usually read,I never the less found it to be a good book..."},{"Title":"Waiting for the World to End","review":"\\"Waiting For the World to End\\" was a very inspiring book. It had many mysterious and exciting parts. From the first word to the last word of the book I was sucked into the black hole of brilliance that this book contained. The character Tom Olsen was just a regular guy until he met the woman of his dreams. In a way I feel like I am Tom Olsen because in some spots of my life I struggled almost exactly in the way that Tom did. This surprised me because even though the book was fiction, it should really be non-fiction because of the creative and close relation of events that took place in the book. To me I feel as if I am just like or related to Tom Olsen because some of the things that took place during his life could have or I thought would have taken place in my life. The climactic point of the book was when Ben got hurt. An evasive point of the book was the fact that nobody ever knows why Tom Olsen's parents treat him in a supercilious way."},{"Title":"Waiting for the World to End","review":"When this book first started out I didn't give it much thought. Tom Olsen is a head basketball coach and English teacher a Indian River High school in Indian River, Indiana. He is very much respected by the high school and the whole town. What's not visible is that Tom is a lonely man and is also haunted by the decision he made to abort his child 20 years ago.As the book progresses he develops a father and son relationship with Ben Wendling, one of his English students and player in his basketball team. Tom also falls in love with Ben's mom Mary, who is a married women. Mary has also been keeping a secret that only her family knows, but she later tells Tom. There are many cilmaxes in this story that you must read for yourself."},{"Title":"Waiting for the World to End","review":"To say that this book is a page turner is undoubtedly an understatement. The ease and fluidity that is so evident in Hunter's writing style kept me captivated from my first encounter with Tom Olsen right through to the thought-provoking, unconventional conclusion. This book challenged me spiritually and intellectually, while still managing to be entertaining and suspenseful.As I read the book, I could not help but wonder how Hunter managed to so accurately capture the humanity of such wide variety of people. The realism that oozes from each page of the book is precisely why I found Waiting... so hard to put down.The beauty of this novel is that the reader gains what he or she aspires to gain. Hunter does not come to unnecessary conclusions for the reader. She holds her audience's interpretations in high regard, as is evident in several key junctures in the story. This author-reader trust allowed Waiting for the World to End to become the most profound and perceptive book in the contemporary fiction genre."},{"Title":"Waiting for the World to End","review":"My review of this book is pretty good. I liked it because it showed that everyone has inner struggles that people might have and other people don't see. Tom is a good character in this book. He is a character that has to find love, religion, and himself. This book proves you can't always get what you want, and you can't always get what you need. In the end you just have to find the answers inside yourself. Thanks Mrs. Hunter for a great book."},{"Title":"Waiting for the World to End","review":"Waiting for the World to End is a mesmerizing-untouchable love story. I couldn't put the book down even though I had too. The love that Tom had for Mary was like the love that Romeo had for Juliet. They were never able to be together, but they never stopped trying. Hopefully Tom will never stopped trying for Mary, until his dying day.This story kept you coming back for more. You almost felt like you were involved, since the story took place close to home. A place you could easily drive to in about twenty minutes. Although, the end left me with regret, I believe that Mary and Tom will be together to give Tom companionship, and it will solve his problem of loneliness."},{"Title":"Waiting for the World to End","review":"WAITING FOR THE WORLD TO END is a cautionary tale about holding back, longing & fear of intimacy. It takes place over several years first in a small Indiana town, & later at a college in Arizona.It is about a man who becomes devoted to a boy who is the son he never had, who is the age his child would have been, had he & his fiancee not had an abortion all those years ago. It is filled with gestures of friendships, moments of intensity that could portend intimacy, yet fade away from lack of passion. Because Olsen's passion is all tied up in Ben's life, & the woman he loves & cannot love.Rebeccasreads recommends WAITING FOR THE WORLD TO END because it will make you think about what you did in your past & how you want to live your future. It will give you moments of sheer panic & joy, as well as frustration & satisfaction."},{"Title":"Waiting for the World to End","review":"Next time you complain that there isn't any good fiction out there about real people living real lives, searching for happiness and a little clarity along the way, making mistakes (and plenty of them) making choices - good and bad, getting lost, getting second chances, getting lost again, growing stronger along the way and maybe inspiring you to do the same, pick up \\"Waiting for the World to End\\" and give it a read. More than offering merely a diversion from reality as so many popular novels rehashedly do, this simply genuine story has the ability to double as an operator's manual for those of us who've become cynical, jaded, or just a tad confused about the things that really matter in life. The nuggets of truth and wisdom that are interspersed along the way (and served up casually by characters as accessible as your own backyard) offer readers the kind of sentences well worth rereading, highlighting, and turning down the corners of pages for. In the first 3 pages alone, I came across a memorable passage that I was later able to paraphrase during a painful conversation with my daughter. The image offered her an on ramp to a deeper understanding of a difficult decision she was facing and helped her in making a major career choice. While Hunter's storytelling is as expert and straightforward as it is fresh and spontaneous, it is the staying power of the insight and inspiration of her words that makes her writing feel more like that of a seasoned author and not a first time novelist. For me, \\"Waiting for the World to End\\" was a refreshingly welcome ride, free of gimmicks, flash, smoke and mirrors...a poignantly gentle reminder that the age-old story of one human soul seeking it's own truth, when told by a soulful storyteller, still makes for the best page turner of all."},{"Title":"Waiting for the World to End","review":"Hunter writes with lyrical precision when describing human experiences and emotions such as loneliness, social facades and dysfunctional family pasts. Her talent in using imagery and other language devices is the strength that underpins 'Waiting for the World to End'. For the first half of this novel, which best fits into the literary fiction genre, I was constantly pausing to highlight examples of evocative language and to reflect on their use. 'Waiting for the World to End' features many examples of language minimalism - where a few simple words say a lot, and Hunter is obviously observant of social interactions and people's emotional responses.However, the second half of the novel (or perhaps the last third) was slightly unsatisfactory for me. There were times when the protagonist, Tom, is downright annoying and a week later, as I think about the novel, I don't feel any connection with him - sometimes a sign that the characterisation has not been developed sufficiently for me as the reader. In addition, it's not clear what themes are meant to be the focus in this work; is it loneliness, or going after your dreams, or simply appreciating what's in front of you? I suspect that even with the minor flaws relating to plot and character - and that is only my subjective opinion - that book clubs might gain a lot from analysing this novel closely as they discuss these issues.I'm pleased I had the opportunity to read 'Waiting for the World to End'. It is well deserving of the recognition it has gained and I look forward to reading more by this talented writer.Note: After Googling this author I discovered there is a reading guide on her website for interested readers."},{"Title":"Waiting for the World to End","review":"Having just finished Waiting for the World to End last weekend,I find that I, too, am still replaying the events in the characters lives, as the descriptions and characters are so detailed they become more real with each page, but more than this, Ms. Hunter has incorporated actual poems and poetic fragments into the story, and it is nothing like I've read before. It's so refreshing to see the creative way that she offers Olsen's thoughts and inner conflicts to the reader, along with plot advancing poetry, and how complelling some of the scenes are (Ben's accident and the dialogue between Mary and Olsen in the basement come to mind) as we also know what is being said as well as what is going through the characters minds. A wonderful, intriguing read, with a thought-provoking ending you'll be pondering long after the cover is closed."},{"Title":"Waiting for the World to End","review":"I thought that \\"Waiting for the World to End\\" was a very well written and organized story. I thought that all the characters were well thought out and Mrs. Hunter gave all of them great traits. It has been one of the few novels I have started and finished more recently this year and I thought it was a good read.I was a little disappointed with the ending of the book, but it is very interesting how the book did not end the same way many novels of its type end. Since most novels end in a predictable way, it is very interesting when you find one that doesn't end how you think.I think that if a reader has the time that they should sit down and read this book, because it might give you a different view on a subject, This would be a good book for all to read."},{"Title":"Waiting for the World to End","review":"In my life I have read a lot of books. Fiction and nonfiction. I can't say any of them were bad books, I have enjoyed them all. \\"Waiting for the World to End\\" is a book, however, that I can trully say tops my list of favorite books.I read Waiting for the world to End for my junior English class.

It's an easy and great read.\\"Waiting for the World to End\\" is the story of Tom Olsen, your tipical Hoosier.

To be honest this isn't the kind of literature that I like to read, I usually read fantasy and action. However, I enjoyed this novel, it is well-written, and has very good character development. This novel deals with many problems in today's society. One problem was abortion. Tom Olsen, the main character of the novel, and then fiance Alexandria have an abortion because he didn't want a child at the time, Tom called the wedding off, and they broke up. You will see in the novel Tom regrets this and now wants a child. Tom never has a child of his own, but Ben, the star of Tom's basketball team becomes the son he never had, and also his best friend. Ben is also the son of Tom's love interest Mary. There is just one problem Mary has a husband, will she stay loyal. You'll have to read the book to find out."},{"Title":"Waiting for the World to End","review":"In \\"Waiting for the World to End\\",is set in Indian River, Indiana, and the main character, Tom Olsen describes the types of obstacles he must overcome to regain happiness. Tom faces heart-wrenching decisions that affect the rest of his life.Early on in the novel, Tom describes his relationship with his former fiance Alexandra. Eventually it doesn't work out between them because of the hard decision they had to make of getting an abortion. Tom realizes later on that he's made a big mistake. He yearns to be a father in his later years, so in substitute, Ben is there.Ben Wendling is a young teen that not only plays basketball for Tom's team, but also develops a special bond with Tom. Tom repeats many times that Ben reminds him of himself. Nicole Hunter uses good symbolism in Ben, by making him the \\"son Tom never had\\".Over the years, Tom also develops a relationship with Ben's mother, Mary. She is very active Lutheran, who despite being married to Virgil Wendling, displays acts of interest in Tom. This is where the plot was confusing. It never really specifies if Mary has feelings for Tom, but the way the novel is plotted out, the readers like to think she does. There is nothing better in a novel than a secret love affair.As the basketball team drags on with the season, Tom and Mary develop a special connection, not only with Ben, but between each other as well. Virgil is naive that the fact that there is chemistry between them, but Mary continues to stay faithful and loving to her husband.The end has an unexpected twist.This was disappointing to most readers I'm sure, but its something radical. That wasn't the only twist to the story. The plot builds up that Mary will leave Virgil and join Tom in happiness, when in reality, Virgil is the unfaithful one and he, rather spontaneously, dies of a heart attack.I think the most important aspect of writing is to get a reaction out of the readers. Whether it be good or bad, a reaction alone does its justice. Many people who have read this book have either loved it or hated it, nothing in between. People have a stereotypical approach when reading novels about a secret love between two characters and then the plot takes a crazy turn, people are astonished and they realize the true meaning of the book."},{"Title":"Waiting for the World to End","review":"\\"Waiting for the World to End\\" is a truely remarkable novel with numerous alluring relationships. This book is definitely divergent from others I have read. The feelings expressed in this novel are dynamic, vivid, and lucid. I was thrilled I could relate and understand this book. I really liked the fact that the setting takes place in Indiana. The main character Tom has many obstacles to overcome dealing with religion, abortion, love and lust. Tom is infatuated with his star player's, Ben, mother. His affinity for her and the fact that she is married plays a key role in his life. Tom's intangible feelings for Ben, Mary and basketball bring obstacles throughout the book, ending with the feeling of infinatily. I really like how Tom's perpetual feelings for Mary are not extemporaneous and they are felicitious for the story. This book is a must read and i really enjoyed reading it."},{"Title":"Waiting for the World to End","review":"\\"Waiting for the World to End\\" is a riveting story of love won and lost, friendship gained and forever lasting. I only read books when assigned to me in school. This book, although it was assigned, I was immediately drawn to it. After my second day reading it in class I drove to my local bookstore and purchased it. Once I purchased it I went outside and sat on the curb. I began to read. I found my self getting to know the characters on a personal basis and bonding with them. I often found my self watching random people and observing their characteristics and comparing them to a character in the story. For Instance, my neighbor reminds me of Mr. McCormick. He has a small \\"squirrel dog\\" and likes to go for walks. I often wonder what he is actually thinking, just like I wonder what Mr. McCormick is thinking? Also, the array of characters and settings had my hands glued to the cover, never once \\"waiting for the world to end\\".I knew that when it did, the book would end too.

I'll admit i didn't like the ending to the book because Mary and Tom didn't get together. But after i processed that more, i thought that maybe that was for the best. I'm tired of the old happily every after. That's not how life is. And that's not how it should be taught. You taught me that just because you didn't end up with that \\"special\\" someone, it doesn't mean your life will turn out bad.

It seems I'll be in the minority in the reviews of this book but I found it difficult to read, quite easy to put down (though I determinedly slogged through it), with characters who were maddening and an ending that was, as others have noted, a disappointment. The writing - turns of phrase and so forth - however, showed real skill and I think Ms. Hunter will someday write a very good book. This just wasn't it.If the other reviewers have been truthful and this book gets them reading others, than a public service has been done and thanks to Ms. Hunter for helping create new readers."},{"Title":"Waiting for the World to End","review":"I am quite impressed by this book. I have learned to make better decisions and to think longer on them from it and would recommend it to anyone. It has inspired me to follow my dreams further and to strive to succeed.

I think that Mrs. Hunter did a fine job on her work and hope to read some more of her books later on."},{"Title":"Waiting for the World to End","review":"The book, Waiting for the World to End was a real attention getter. It was like I couldn't put the book down, I always wanted to know what was going to happen next. I thought the plot was very well written and I was able to relate to certain parts of the book. The fact that Tom had a pseudo family because he was searching for what he couldn't get, made the book even more fascinating. Also since the story had Indiana as one of the settings added to the intrigue of the book. The part I liked best was the ending because it left a few doors open and inspired you to imagine what would happen later in their lives."},{"Title":"Waiting for the World to End","review":"Two weeks ago our class started to read the novel Waiting For The World To End, I had never liked to read in the past, but when I started to read the novel it was like \\"WOW\\", this book is interesting! I kept reading it and it was like I was in the story. It was like a dream. It captured me in the town of Indian River.When Tom Olsen was talked about, I could always relate our teacher with Mr. Olsen. Mr. Olsen is a good man in the story and Mr. Stelter is a good man in our life as an English teacher. I also can relate Mrs. Wendling to one of my best friend's mothers: she is loving, caring, and does a lot for everyone.To everyone that is going to read my review \\"thank you\\" for taking your time to read it. It means a lot to me. But more importantly take the time to read Ms. Hunter's book."},{"Title":"Waiting for the World to End","review":"I first want to say that Ms. Hunter has done an awesome job with this book. I've never been more interested in a book before. I'm not one to read, personally hate to unless it's a magazine with a one paragraph story, but this book I couldn't put down. Most books take a while to get into, but from the very first chapter I was interested. It made me feel like I was there with the characters, like a fly on the wall throughout their lives, as if I knew them personally. I really found myself to enjoy all the genres Ms. Hunter used in the book. Especially the poem Olsen said to himself, which told his life story. I am from Valparaiso, lived here all my life and when Ms. Hunter made the references to Valpo with her main character it was neat to understand exactly her description of the town. Overall it was just a good book, kept you on the edge of your seat, one exciting thing after another. It sometimes made me mad, but other times happy. There was a few times I was confused, I didn't understand why the characters made the choices they did until the end when it all came together.I have recomended this book to many poeple since I've read it and I would recomend it to anyone that wants a good book to read. It's excellent!!"},{"Title":"Waiting for the World to End","review":"Time and time before, I had always been stuck reading boring books for English class. Finally, I've found a book that I enjoyed to read. Someone who hates to read actually loves this book. Not only did I not want to put the book down, I was thrilled that I could relate to this book and understand it. Ms. Hunter expresses emotions of the main character boldly so there isn't any other doubt what he could be thinking. Ms. Hunter also makes the characters in the book loveable. You're yelling for the good guy to win everytime something seems complicated. Also, the styles of writing Ms. Hunter used to absorb your attention into the book made the reading more fun.I love the fact that some of the settings take place in Valparaiso. I live there, so it reachs me on a personal level knowing that Ms. Hunter matches every description of the town correctly, naming places that are really here, and having them in the right spot of town. She gives good detail into everything, so even if you haven't visited Valparaiso, you'll get the picture.From the first chapter to the very last word, I recommend this book to everyone. I admit it, picking up a good book to read is difficult. I'll make it easier for you right now, read this book."},{"Title":"Waiting for the World to End","review":"Depressed, sad, angry, frustrated, happy, and excited. These are the things I felt when I read Nicole Hunter's book Waiting For The World To End. She amazingly brings in so many emotions and feelings to this book. She portrays the characters as nieve in some ways. But that shows their innocence and understanding. Her book is great and should be read by anyone who is ready to open their hearts to a depressing, sad, joyful, and frustrating book."},{"Title":"Waiting for the World to End","review":"Nicole Hunter's book, Waiting for the World to End, is a unique mix of several genres which is sure to catch on. The style of this book took great creativity and I applaud her effort; however, this was not one of my favorite books. The characters in the book are simple and a bit dull. I had trouble feeling emotions towards the characters and the predicaments in which they found themselves. Some of the situations in this book were fairly predictable making it a boring read. I could have easily put the book down half way through and never given it a second thought. The entire time I was reading I was waiting for something to happen in the book to make it worth my time. That something never came. I was excited that the author chose to use the Indiana Dunes as a setting in her book and I do believe that to be a good decision on her part. I frequently visit the dunes and I was extremely disappointed with her description of a place that means so much to me. The Dunes are so beautiful and peaceful, I really would have liked their description to be more accurate and over all just a lot better. I have no doubt that Nicole Hunter's future books will be better and I will read them. This first book however, needs much improvement before being considered an average good book."},{"Title":"Waiting for the World to End","review":"I must admit I was not very interested in the book. I thought the author made Tom out to be this disgusting pig, who went for a married woman. I do have my dislikes about this book, but I did have a favorite part of the book and that was the ending. Waiting for the World to End just wasn't a book that I would tell someone else to read because it was boring and didn't really make me want to turn the page. I could have actually put the book down and not worry about what happened at the end. I look at this book as a really bad soap on television."},{"Title":"Waiting for the World to End","review":"Waiting for the World to End is an entertaining and poignantly heartfelt adventure into the soul of Thomas Olsen, chronicling his quest for personal freedom and peace of mind as a high school English teacher/basketball coach in suburban Indiana.A must-read for those who've ever pondered Existence... the novel offers insight into the mysterious life force driving the human race, while encouraging unity rather than division.Waiting for the World to End contains a depth that challenges the most intellectual and philosophical readers. However, the novel is crafted as a brilliantly simple, yet saturated story that appeals to all ages and both sexes.A fun and fulfilling read for everybody!!!"},{"Title":"Waiting for the World to End","review":"Waiting for the World to End is a beautifully crafted first time novel by Nicole Hunter. From the very beginning, I was intrigued at the richness of the story and complexity of relationships among the characters. Being a lover of poetry, I found the descriptive imagery in this book thoroughly enjoyable. This novel is a realistic portrait of the struggles of the human heart; I found myself stopping and thinking about the choices I had made in my own life. I would read, pause, and ponder. Read, pause, and ponder. With every chapter I read, it sent me into a new world of thought. Nicole Hunter is a talented word-smith. I highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys beautiful literature and thought provoking characters."},{"Title":"Waiting for the World to End","review":"Normally, I review a book as soon as I finish reading it. That is not the case with Nicole Hunter's Waiting for the World to End. This novel is so profound, so exquisitely crafted, and so thought-provoking that further mental distillation was required before I could attempt to sit down and attempt to describe it. The words appear on the printed page, but this story is written on nothing less than the human heart itself. It is a book about right and wrong, making and coming to terms with difficult choices, and faith - but the author is quick to point out that this not a religious story; at its essence, this is a human story. It is in fact an exceedingly human story. Guys, don't turn away from this book because you think it might be \\"sappy\\" or something; ladies, don't pass this one over just because the main character is a men's basketball coach. This is a book crying out to be read by anyone who has ever searched for meaning in life, tried unsuccessfully to forgive oneself for past mistakes, or experienced (or merely yearned to find) love of the noblest - and, by its nature, sometimes most difficult - form.Thomas Olsen would seem to be living one version of the good life. He is the head of the English department and head coach of the men's basketball team at Indian River High School in Indiana, and he is a local celebrity among the basketball-crazy citizens of the local area. He already has one state championship, and hopes (not to mention expectations) are high for him to claim a second title. In his early 40s, he could have his choice of any number of fawning females. The Thomas Olsen that everyone sees is not the real Thomas Olsen, however. Olsen is in fact a painfully lonely character molded incompletely in childhood by rejection and weighed down by the grievous weight of a painful decision he made two decades earlier. His is an empty body, long separated from what he considers his soul. Hunter uses pieces of poetry quite brilliantly in order to define the essence of Olsen in the most poignant of terms.Some of the missing pieces that Olsen has all but given up searching for now begin to turn up, however. He develops a fatherly bond with Ben Wendling, his team's star player, looking upon Ben as the son of his very soul. Then he meets Ben's mother Mary, and in an instant he glimpses everything he has been searching for his whole life. There is, of course, a problem - Mary is a married woman. This doesn't stop Owen from insinuating himself into Mary's life - quite obviously, at times. The two become especially close when Ben suffers a horrifying accident on the court. Mary is a very religious person, and Owen opens up to her in ways he has never done before, revealing a large measure of his heart and soul.The novel covers some six years of Owen's life. It is a story of constant pining, searching for life's meaning, doing the right thing no matter how unbearably hard it is to do, testing the waters of faith and prayer; most of all, though, this is a story of love in its purest, more soul-quivering form. I can't begin to do the novel justice; it's like trying to describe a deeply personal experience. That is exactly what Waiting for the World to End is - not a novel so much as a moving, heart-touching personal experience full of joy and sorrow, pain and relief, emptiness and fulfillment, and the most poignant form of human love. It's not a story you can ever forget because it becomes a very real part of you. Reading for entertainment is a fantastic thing, but the true wonder of reading is only reflected in the rarest of novels, one that makes you plumb the depths of your own heart and soul - and Waiting for the World to End is one of those rare examples of literature at its most powerful and enlightening."},{"Title":"Waiting for the World to End","review":"I am the sort of person who spends an inordinate amount of time watching movies of a decidedly low budget caliber. I spend so much of my time watching films that any spare time for books usually revolves around the drudge of forced reading for school. That is why it is such a delight to come across a novel like Nicole Hunter's \\"Waiting for the World to End.\\" There is more genuine human emotion in this novel about a man struggling with loneliness than in any book I have read in the last year. How moving and thoughtful is this book? Here's an indication: I sat down with Hunter's book intending to read only the first couple of chapters since I had several other important things to take care of. The next thing I know it is the middle of the night and I am halfway done with the book. I finished it upon waking the following day. I cannot convey to you how rare it is for me to do something like this. I can always put something down and come back to it later, even if I enjoy it immensely. Not so in the case of \\"Waiting for the World to End.\\" I had to finish reading to see what would happen to the protagonist Thomas Olsen.In a way Olsen is also his own antagonist. He's a man in the prime of his life, forty-one to be exact, and a man in an enviable position. His job as an English teacher at an Indiana high school coupled with his success as head basketball coach has endeared him to his students, their parents, the school's administrators, and nearly everyone else in town. Olsen is the sort of teacher students remember for the rest of their lives, the sort of teacher that inspires students to use some of their free time in order to paint an ornate mural on his classroom wall. Can you see why he's in an enviable position? Most people would give anything to find something to do in life that garners such admiration and respect from others. Problem is, all of Olsen's accomplishments are external. Inside he dies a little more every day because of loneliness and bad memories. His loneliness stems from his inability to find the right woman with which to share his wonderful life. The bad memories are legion, starting with a former girlfriend's terminated pregnancy during his youth and leading up to the present day with recollections of his unpleasant childhood. His parents, both distinguished university professors, failed to bond with their only son and failed to support his decision to teach high school.A ray of sunlight pierces the black veil surrounding Olsen's heart when he meets the beautiful Mary Wendling, the mother of Tom's star basketball player Ben. Her mere presence sends his mind racing, and subsequent encounters only confirm that this woman is the answer to all of Olsen's woes. He loves her in a way few people ever experience, but there are problems. Mary is married to a man who helped rescue her from a problematic youth. Moreover, Ben presents a significant barrier to any potential relationship. Tom worries that the boy will interpret any move he makes on Mary as a violation of their own close bond. That Olsen considers Ben Wendling the son he never had only further complicates matters. As the years pass by, the bond between Tom, Ben, and Mary grows stronger. Mary's son heads off to Tucson State at the same time Olsen gets a job offer there, so the two gain the opportunity to continue their relationship in a new way. Meanwhile, back in Indiana Mary encounters problems in her marriage to Virgil that could potentially clear the way for a liaison with Tom. Ben's impending wedding could finally be the time and place where Olsen conquers his eternal loneliness. Or perhaps not. It's to Hunter's credit that her novel refuses to deliver an ending of the type we have seen in hundreds of other books. Instead she gives us a finale approximating real life.\\"Waiting for the World to End\\" is a triumph, a book bursting at the seams with intense examinations of human emotions, characters struggling with their relationship to God, and the problem of reaching across the spaces between people in order to make meaningful and lasting connections. This last point is particularly relevant to the Tom Olsen character. Try as he might, he has great trouble connecting with people. He has friends at the school, certainly, and he befriends an elderly neighbor who lives across the street from him (a situation that has repercussions later in the novel), but he never seems to follow through on his relationships. It's quite rare that anyone ever shows up at his house, and when they do they don't stay for very long. His home is a symbolic reflection of his lonely personality. He's a bit of a recluse, but an unwilling recluse. On this point alone I connected with the book; I'm a lot like this character in that respect, as I don't let many people into my life very easily. I consider any book great when I can relate to it in some manner, and I related big time with \\"Waiting for the World to End.\\"I suspect most readers will find something to identify with in this book. In an increasingly impersonal age, where computers and e-mail often serve as substitutes for face to face contact, we can expect to see more and more Tom Olsens. Nicole Hunter has written a memorable book indeed, one that ought to become a bestseller if there is any justice in the world. I'm going to hold on to my copy for many years to come; I have the feeling it's going to be worth a lot of money someday."},{"Title":"Waiting for the World to End","review":"This book brings you into a thinking mode while entertaining you.A capable man who can make practical reality based decisions whodeclines to take control or make things happen in his personal life.

Our personal and cultural notions of family are also challenged via this fable aspect.Nicole Hunter is a master of the \\"show, don't tell\\" key to good fiction, and the majority of readers in the past two years have picked up on these subtle elements of the text, which accounts for the novel's popularity. Some people, however, have been disappointed because they missed these aspects of the story as they read.A reader who says Ms. Hunter's male narrator doesn't think or act \\"like real men do\\" simply reveals his or her own gender biases and stereotypes ~ which is exactly what Nicole Hunter wants to provoke in individual readers and in book discussions. If you go to one of her library events or book discussions, you'll see what I mean.A reader who criticizes \\"clich&eacute;s\\" in the text also missed the point ~ and the fun of personal reflection and good conversation about what makes a clich&eacute;, what purposes they serve in life and fiction, and the fact that one person's clich&eacute; is another person's sincerely felt truth. Who are we to pass judgment for the whole world on what is of value?A reader who criticizes the \\"religious propaganda\\" in the text reveals his or her own religious biases, and also misses the chance for conversation about spiritual matters and how deeply personal such matters are. Why are we so quick to pass judgment on beliefs that differ from our own? What about the human element of walking a mile or two in someone else's shoes, or trying to understand life through their eyes?I once read that a book review reveals the inner life of the reviewer, not the essence of the book.If you decide to read Waiting for the World to End, and like the challenge of looking deeper into a text, you'll find your time, money, and energy very well spent."},{"Title":"Waiting for the World to End","review":"I loved every second I got to spend with Tom and Mary, the main characters in Waiting for the World to End. Maybe it was because I could relate to both of them so much, maybe it was simply due to the writing.

As a high school administrator, English teacher, and coach for over a quarter of a century, the highest compliment I can pay Ms. Hunter is that upon completion of reading her novel, I immediately purchased a classroom set for my students. Hawthorne had his Hester, Arthur and Pearl. Ms. Hunter has created Thomas, Mary and Ben. Where one contemplates the consequences and effects of sin, the other guides one's soul to seek peace and tranquility. I found myself reminiscing. I devoured every word...page...chapter. This is not a book one reads and passes along. Rather, it will become highlighted, dog-eared, tattered, re-read; the cover, the pages, each word scintillating with one's scent. Ms. Hunter states that she writes with \\"a healing voice.\\" True enough, but she is much too modest. She writes with a voice that longs to heard over and over again. Whereas Hawthorne's Chillingworth states that he \\"knows not Lethe nor Nepenthe,\\" Hunter allows us to not only \\"forgive\\" and \\"forget\\", but forever remember not the sin or sinner, but the \\"saint\\" the man has become because he refuses to give up. This \\"tale of human frailty and sorrow\\" will be kept alive in history because the focus of Waiting For The World To End is not just \\"a surreal accident\\", but a \\"divine mystery\\" and \\"an eternal edict\\".--Randy Stelter; English teacher, basketball coach, Athletic Administrator, Wheeler High School, Valparaiso, Indiana"},{"Title":"Waiting for the World to End","review":"Waiting For The World To End is an excellent piece of writing that drew me in immediately. Tom Olson, from the start, intrigued me. Who is this guy and what is he about? The end of chapter one compelled me to go on. Olson's character unfolds through his own thoughts, memories, and reactions to people and circumstances.An abortion in Olson's past plays a significant part in his dealing with the present, but he tells his story. He doesn't pontificate, he just lives - feeling, thinking, acting, and reacting.Olson's romantic interest, Mary, a sincere and conscientious mother must find ways to cope with the not-so-pleasant consequences of a decision made in her youth. If there is any preaching in this book, it's not about pro-life or pro-choice. This story is also about Olson's search for faith. Some of the characters \\"preach\\" the gospel message in an obnoxious way that many of us have heard, but that is intentional and plays a part in Olson's spiritual journey.This novel is rich in imagery and meaningful references to other literary works. It tells a realistic story about difficult decisions people must make. As much as I wanted to keep reading, I also wanted to slow down to avoid missing the subtleties and complexities in the development of these characters.It's a thought provoking story and allows the readers to explore for themselves the meaning of \\"doing the right thing.\\" Now I have to go back and read it again.

Having taught the book to 6 different classes, I have witnessed the power of Ms.Hunter's words for so many students. The impact it has had has been incredible. So many students have come to me in confidence to say that her book has helped them make responsible choices. One student even shared with me how she wished she had read the book sooner for it would have made a huge difference in a choice she had made. Ms Hunter's words are powerful and it is beautifully written. Having read thousand's of books, Ms. Hunter has me re-reading hers for the seventh time. I will be teaching it again this year because it has impacted so many. Bravo Ms. Hunter for the courage, wisdom, and insights that your characters give to its readers.

What a delight to NOT be able to easily foresee, pages ahead of time, the actions and feelings of protagonist Tom Olsen and those characters that are central to his past or present life. It's equally a delight to see that Ms. Hunter has so successfully and smoothly merged description and dialogue, the former being neither spare nor overdone as to distract from the plotline, and the latter being so effortlessly real in its feel. The topic of belief in Christianity and God is significant to the plot of this novel (and, to some, may thus categorize it as a \\"Christian novel\\"), and in fact, within the early chapters of the story, this issue of Christianity and belief may even impart a level of discomfort in those readers who are not themselves Christians or who are conflicted about their Christianity. But that may be precisely what Ms. Hunter strove for! -- that is, to create a sense of discomfort in her reader that would make him or her even MORE able to empathize with protagonist Tom Olsen's own conflicted and questioning belief system. While some may feel disappointed by the novel's conclusion, it only left me with the happy anticipation of a possible sequel continuing the story of Tom Olsen!

I enjoyed the beginning of the book, but then it just began repeating itself over a span of about 250 pages. The sad thing about the book, is that after spending your time reading it, the end leaves you with exactly what you began the book with . NOTHING. There were really no deep twists in the book, since everything was so predictable. Every person has someone they want to be with, wheter its a fantasy or for true love, and thats how the book started. As expected, 250 pages later, the couple has the opportunity to get together, and leaves us with nothing. Some may like this, but I found it to be a waste of my time. I see Olsen as a stalker who could end up in jail. He is a bsketball coach with one player of his, who is also his student in english, whose mother he is attracted to, who he thinks of as his own. He had the opportunity to have a child, and chose not to, so now he finds a kid who isn't even his own and \\"loves\\" him, I believe, just to get to his mother. I do not see why Ben doesn't notice this, and even after that, Ben goes to Tucson College, and Olsen \\"happens\\" to get a job there as well. In the end, Olsen and Mary have a chance to get together, but after reading the whole novel we are left with nothing but our imagination."},{"Title":"Waiting for the World to End","review":"Waiting for the World to End follows the arc of an unfulfilled but enduring relationship between Thomas Olson, a basketball coach and English teacher, and Mary Wendling, the mother of Ben Wendling, with whom Olson takes on a mentoring, almost paternal role.Olson serves as the book's protagonist, and the reader is made privy to his profound sense of isolation and futility. This inner dissatisfaction is at odds with the general perception of Olson among his students, players, and the community at large. As the author makes clear, Olson's emotional journey, his attempt to regain some sense of engagement, is also a spiritual journey.While it is has some parallels in stories like Willa Cather's My Antonia, the author's treatment of the relationship between Thomas and Mary is intriguing and somewhat refreshing. The \\"forbidden love affair\\" plotline is so overused that it has lost all its power to shock and surprise the reader. By keeping the physical element suppressed and unrealized, Hunter is able to depict desire as something much more nuanced and much deeper. She also manages to address issues of God and faith without sounding either nave or smugly superior to non-believers: an admirable feat, and one that makes this book equally accessible to both groups. Poetry buffs should also thoroughly enjoy the book. Not only do various poems play a role in the narrative, and in the lives of Hunter's characters, but the author's prose in general seems to reflect a poetic sensibility.Beyond this, Waiting for the World to End figures to be accessible to just about everyone, with its intimate portrait of what Thoreau might call a \\"life of quiet desperation,\\" and its depiction of a love that is kept permanently at a distance.Reviewed by Carrie Cantor"},{"Title":"Waiting for the World to End","review":"\\"Waiting For The World to End\\" is a novel I highly recommend.

I find the thematic elements of: faith, loss of hope, and reclaiming your sense of self deeply inspiring.

Nicole Hunter's prose is lyrical, her words carefully selected, her sentences very skillfully crafted, her characters and venues realistically drawn. This novel definitely reflects the time, effort and care the author put into its creation.Her central characters may provoke empathy, or perhaps sympathy if the reader has lived through what Tom Olsen and Mary Wendling experienced - both victims of the classic middle America amalgamation of Catholic and conservative Protestant guilt.Tom, the child of two parents who should never have conceived, carries the emptiness of his childhood into his adulthood and wears it as a hair shirt. He is a highly functioning, very successful obsessive-compulsive. I would have welcomed the challenge he would have presented had he come to me when I was in private practice, and Freud would have exulted in pointing out Tom's efforts at sublimation.During Mary's adolescence one act of careless passion earned her parents' antipathy and rejection when their support might have given her a firmer footing going into adulthood. She accepts marriage with an older man who offers her love and support and the promise to securely keep her \`secret'; a secret that weighs continually on her being. Her life is carefully balanced until her chance encounter with Tom. Their attraction to each other is immediate and intense. However I would not use the term love to describe Tom's obsession with Mary, or Mary's gratitude and admiration for Tom.When I was a high school teacher I would have welcomed a class or two of the high caliber youngsters Tom Olson seemed to attract; extraordinarily motivated, exemplary in behavior; especially like Ben Wendling. As a college professor teaching in an RN program I experienced this degree of motivation, but not necessarily the exemplary behavior. As the reader may discern, I had some trouble accepting that subset of characters as real.The reader with grounding in the Christian faith will appreciate the honesty with which Ms. Hunter deals with her characters' spirituality or lack thereof. Those who do not may have trouble identifying with her characters' struggle to sort out their relationship with God. I do not believe, however, the author's intent was to either proselytize or evangelize.There are several meaningful bits of philosophy woven into the text; both cited and the author's own. They are pearls of wisdom of the kind a reader may embrace and find useful as he or she goes forward in life.The inveterate reader of genre will be disappointed in \\"waiting for the world to end\\". It is not a romance, has no elements of crime and detection, does not fictionalize an historical epoch, contains no blatant eroticism, or gratuitous violence, or is it populated with otherworldly beings. It is a portrayal of ordinary people living through their personal histories, experiencing success and failure, gain and loss. Those who prefer to escape by vicariously living dramatic and unreal lives through the pap produced by much of the American entertainment industry in all of its cloned forms may not find \\"waiting for the world to end\\" with its generous helping of real people living everyday lives to be an entertaining read. But for the reader who appreciates literary artistry Nicole Hunter should be your first artist of choice.The cover art is a complete enigma however."},{"Title":"Waiting for the World to End","review":"\\"Waiting for the World to End\\" by Nicole Hunter was a joy to read; one of those books that you can't put down once you've started it. I've never been to Ohio, but I felt like I was visiting as the story of teacher/basketball coach Tom Olsen, who is haunted by his past, unfolds. It reiterates that no matter how ideal a person's life may seem, they may be suffering from secrets they harbor. Several real-life issues bubble up that make the reader think while reading the novel, and long after the last page has been read. I think it's a home-run for a first-time novelist, and I look forward to reading more books from the talented Nicole Hunter."},{"Title":"Waiting for the World to End","review":"I really enjoyed the book. I like how it kept me on the edge of my feet, thinking about what was going to happen next. I liked how your characters Tom, Mary and Ben. They really made the book what it was. The think I really did not like was the way you ended the book. I wish you could have left me with an idea how Tom ended his life, but I do have a really good idea how it ended anyway. All in all I liked the book and cannot wait until your other one comes out."},{"Title":"Waiting for the World to End","review":"I thought this book taught me a lot about life, love, and the everyday challenges. This book also taught me about the good and or bad choices any person on any given day make. All in all I liked this book, although I thought at times that Olsen was being selfish and stubborn with the choices he made. The ending was the most surprising because it is not really what I expected to happen, but it was still a good book and I enjoyed reading it."},{"Title":"Waiting for the World to End","review":"\\"Waiting for the World to End\\", by Nicole Hunter, was a good book. It is about a man named Tom Olsen who struggles with a past decision, and the pull of his career and basketball team. He connects with one of his players, Ben, and his mother Mary, and becomes deeply involved in Ben's life. This book is very intersting. It will make you not want to put it down, but the ending was very disappointing for me."},{"Title":"Waiting for the World to End","review":"In the book \\"Waiting for the World to End\\" you will encounter with very interesting characters. You get to dive into the life of Tom Olsen and see that he's not as happy as what many people around him think he is. You will also leaarn about his personality and his addictions. The book manages to keep you interested the whole time because you can never tell whats going to happen next."},{"Title":"Waiting for the World to End","review":"\\"Waiting for the World To End\\" is a great book. I recommend everyone to read it. Once you've begun to read this book, you learn a lot of things about each characters and their struggles. You can see how Tom Olsen, who is a basketball coach at Indian River, deals with his one decision and how it changes his attitude and insicurities. It's filled with all kinds of issues and makes you think of all possible outcomes by the end."},{"Title":"Waiting for the World to End","review":"In \\"Waiting for the World to End\\", Tom Olsen is a middle-aged high school English teacher and basketball coach. He has never married and is haunted by the abortion he and his first fiance had 20 years earlier. He gets through daily life by not caring about much and having a beer or 2 every day. He meets his star player's mother, Mary, and instantly falls head over heels for her. He can never have her. His dream could become a reality, though, after a secret her husband Virgil has been harbouring coms out 3 quarters of the way through the book. It has many fate-determining events throughout the book and it never really loses your attention. The plot and characters were very well written and developed. It isn't, however, a favorite of mine."},{"Title":"Waiting for the World to End","review":"it was goodEIGHT EIGHTY TWO"},{"Title":"Waiting for the World to End","review":"Nicole Hunter did an amazing job writing this book. Nicole uses everyday life and problems into her characters she created, not just the perfect fairytale life. Hunter influenced everyone who read it. She keeps her readers entertained and created a twisted ending."},{"Title":"Waiting for the World to End","review":"I liked how Nichole Hunter developed the characters. They seemed like real people whose good and bad sides were shown. I saw the bad in Tom by the way he drank beer constantly, the abortion, slept with girls before marriage, lusted for a married woman, and cussed. On the other side I saw a caring man feeling guilty about the abortion, treated his students like sons especially Ben, and did a lot of good for the community. Since I want to be an elementary school teacher, I found myself reflecting on how he earned the connection that he had with his students and how he made literature come alive to his class. I like how Ms. Hunter told how Mary's and Tom's lives appeared to everyone and what they were really like. I also liked the symbolism of Mary's dog Romeo in the book. I thought the comparison between the \\"star crossed lovers\\" of Romeo and Juliet to Mary and Tom. I liked how part of the setting is in Valparaiso. At first I didn't like the ending, but when I reread it and reflected on it grew on me. I liked that it was realistic ending unlike the romance novels I usually read. In summary this book was very well written."},{"Title":"Waiting for the World to End","review":"The book, \\"Waiting for the World to End,\\" made me think about my own life and relationships I have. While I was reading I could always relate what was happening in the story to something in my own life. One example of this is when Tom first saw Mary and he was thinking about her when he was changing the oil in his car. Tom thought to himself that he was better than Mary's husband was. I once saw a girl I was interested in, but she already had a boyfriend. I just kept thinking to myself that I was better than her boyfriend was.Another point about the book is the ending. It makes your mind wonder about why did the writer end the book the way she did. One conclusion I came up with is that the writer may be planning to write a sequel. \\"Waiting for the World to End\\", is a wonderful book and it has related so much to my life that I am sure that it relates to so many more people feel the same way."},{"Title":"Waiting for the World to End","review":"\\"Waiting for the World to End\\" was a real touching novel. The characters could relate to so many people that I have met in my life. I liked the conflicts in the book between Tom, Mary, and Ben, between Tom and his mom, and between Tom and himself. For example, how Tom was falling for Mary, and how Tom and Ben were very close in and out of school and basketball. The relationship between Tom and his mom wasn't a great one because his mom always thought he could do better in life than what he had already done. Tom's conflicts with himself caused him to have a hard time dealing with the fact that he had an abortion a while back with an old girlfriend Alexandra, when to find out now that he does want a child of his own. Tom did not deal with that problem so well, so every night he would come home and he would try to drown his memories by drinking, and that caused him to have a hard time to keep a relationship with anyone. Over all I thought the book was very good."},{"Title":"Waiting for the World to End","review":"I thought \\"Waiting for the World to End\\" was an excellent book. It had a good plot and you could relate to the characters in real life. The main character is Tom Olsen, he is a basketball coach at Indian River and is an English teacher. Mary Wendling, is a homemaker and Ben's mom. Ben Wendling is Mary's son and plays basketball at Indian River. The setting was excellent for me because it took place in Indiana and the Dunes are near my house. Tom and Ben are like father and son. Tom showed how much he cared for Ben by helping him out after his Valparaiso incident. The ending is a cliffhanger though. This may mean there will be a sequel to this story. A sequel would help this story because all the unanswered questions would be answered. If you like good books that will keep your interest until the end you will like this book."},{"Title":"Waiting for the World to End","review":"The book was good in my opinion, but there were some things about the book I didn't understand. For the most part I got the general idea of the book. That the world will end for people but you have to live life to the fullest. Waiting for the World to End has a few good parts but the best for instance, was when the accident at Valparaiso happened because it showed true emotion and how much Olsen cared for Ben. What I didn't understand is what hapens to Virgil since the author already made him divorce Mary. It's also good though because the end of the book is like a cliffhanger leaving the end of the book open. Since the author left questions open at the end she will probably write another book."},{"Title":"Waiting for the World to End","review":"Waiting for the World to End to me was a very interesting novel. I thought that the book was a lot different from other books I have read in the past. The ending was not what I had expected but it was unique. Waiting for the World to End related to real life situations and controversial issues. The book showed that not everyone is perfect and everyone does make bad decisions in their lives. The book gave me faith and let me know that when life is bad to just hang in there."},{"Title":"Waiting for the World to End","review":"\\"Waiting for the World to End\\" starts slow but soon turns captivating. I was a little disappointed in how Ms. Hunter chose to end the book. Other than the ending, it was a good book and I recommend it for reading. Ms. Hunter uses great sensory details and her descriptions are outstanding."},{"Title":"Waiting for the World to End","review":"I had neutral feelings torwards this book. I didn't hate it, but I didnt like it. I thought the book was rather boring and was hard for me to get into. I did like how the story was easy to understand and follow. I do like that about books. I did not like how the book ended. In all the book wasn't bad but it was not my kind of book I would chose to read."},{"Title":"Waiting for the World to End","review":"The writer's much tortured syntax made me nauseous!!! It's worse than George W. Bush's. I could not finish reading the book because of the bad writing."},{"Title":"Waiting for the World to End","review":"Ms. Hunter's book was fantastic! Very seldom do I find a book that is as captivating as Waiting For the World to End. So many times I found myself relating to either Tom Olsen, Mary, or Ben Wendling. There are so many lessons that can be learned from this book that I will carry with me for many years to come. I strongly urge you to read Waiting For the World to End if you have not yet. I guarantee you will be able to relate to it in many differeny ways, and that you will find yourself savoring each page. 2 Thumbs Up!"},{"Title":"Waiting for the World to End","review":"Waiting for the World to End, in essence, is what we all are doing. Nicole Hunter has an amazing book full of intrigue, mystery, and fasination. Having only lived for eighteen years and reading this book I've found I can relate to almost every aspect, especially Ben. His character has helped me grow in ways I didn't even know I could, from a book. Mary and Tom's relationship has made me question those whom I feel close to and respect in their perception of me. The life lessons that were discussed in this book can have a real barring on today's culture and society. It can especially help concentrate on the morals and values of life in the twenty-first century and even life as a whole."},{"Title":"Waiting for the World to End","review":"I started to read this book in my English 11 class. I thought this book would be like all the other books that you read in school. I pictured a book about history or even a classic novel that puts you to sleep. This book was different. This book was not one of the books I normally read, but I found a strange attraction to this book. The real world conflicts of forbidden love and non-parental parents are things that people go through today. All in all I thought this book was great. It had everything a good book needs. It had a main character that the reader can relate to. The main character had to go through conflicts and in this book it is both internal and external so new conflicts arise though out the book. Of course, no story is complete with out a love story inside it and this book has plenty of that. Not only does it have love, but also it has forbidden love, which is the best kind.From start to finish I like this book. It showed the true feelings of a character and I think that that right there make this book a good buy."},{"Title":"Waiting for the World to End","review":"This book was very well written. It was easy to read and understand. The characters were explained in great detail. The conflicts were realistic in the aspect that you hear about the same types of problems almost everyday. For one example, abortion, you hear about abortion everyday and the problems people have with it. The setting of this book was very interresting. I would recommend this book to any high school aged person or higher. I have not read a better book for a long time."},{"Title":"Waiting for the World to End","review":"This book is amazing. I think no matter what age you are, some of the situations in this book will relate to you. It kept me interested until the very last word. In the very first chapter I knew that this is a book that I would want to finish. Then when the book was finally finished, I wanted more. The book made me feel like I was there because every situation was so real. A lot of the main characters in the book are like every day people that I meet or already know. I read this book in my junior year in high school, at the end of my basketball season, so my mind was almost always on basketball. When I was reading this book it took me away from basketball. It was that good, nothing else could do that for me. I would reccommend this book to anyone that is over 14."},{"Title":"Waiting for the World to End","review":"I really enjoyed the book. I couldn't lay the book down, so I went out and bought my own copy. I really don't like to read much, but this book I will read again and again. I love the way you describe the characters. You can really visualize everything that's going on. I really like books that do that because it feels like you are right there with the characters. My favorite character was Tom Olsen because he was an honest character. He would do anything for Ben. Towards the of the book I liked how Tom and Mary hinted towards each other how they felt about each other."},{"Title":"Waiting for the World to End","review":"This book was very good. Considering its the only book I ever read, I really enjoyed it. The ending was a little dissappointing but left more for the reader to think about. This book also has a lot of lessons to be learned in it. One thing I learned from the book is that you cant dwell on the past. You cant keep thinking what if or if only. You need to move on and think about the future because you cant change the past, but you can change what happens in the future."},{"Title":"Waiting for the World to End","review":"My opinion on Waiting for the World to end was excellent. I thought the book had a lot of meaning in my life. I like the story line of the book because it makes me keep reading to find out what is going to happen next. Most books have there fairy tale ending, but this has more, the ending is very unique. I have read books in the past, and have never read a book like this one. It shows that not every person is perfect and all have their bad times and good times. I love the fact that it takes place in Indiana, and I would recommend you reading this book because you will enjoy it very much."},{"Title":"Waiting for the World to End","review":"I loved the book,the charcters in the story relate to people in my life. I recommend this to people who really don't like to read,but you'll definitly enjoy this novel.If Mrs. Hunters listening I love the Corvette in the story, It's my favorite car.Anyway the book tackles all the major issues of today: abortion,religion,and life in general.I hope she makes a sequel. I'd buy it right away."},{"Title":"Waiting for the World to End","review":"I was so mad at this book when I first finished it. It took me a couple days to understand why Nicole Hunter wrote it that way, I was so mad with some of the characters. But now, I love the book. It is real-life. It's not a fairy tale, and first that disappointed me. I am used to reading books with the \\"cookie-cutter\\" ending. But I like this book more because of how it ends. Hunter did an awesome job of keeping her reader's in suspense the whole time. I recommend reading this book."},{"Title":"Waiting for the World to End","review":"In the novel, \\"Waiting for the World to End\\", you get sucked into a different world. A world where you feel as if you are living your everyday life with the characters of the book. The main character Tom Olsen, the all-star basketball coach, goes through many stages in his life. Tom knows many people and most think he lives the perfect life. When he's helping everyone , no one else realizes he's sturggling a lot with his own . If you can relate to many things such as love, lust, denial, sports, and joy, then this should be a novel that is on your list to buy next time your at the bookstore. Nicole Hunter is a brillant writer that always keeps you on your feet and guesssing what's going to happen next."},{"Title":"Waiting for the World to End","review":"In my opinion, \\"Waiting For the World to End\\" is a great book. In this book you will learn about a man named Tom Olsen. He is an english teacher and a basketball coach. He is haunted with a desicion he made many years ago. Mary, Ben's mother who is Olsen's best player on the basketball team is the person that Olsen is in love and obbsessed with. Once you get into this book, you dont want to put it down. This book can relate to a lot of people who read it in real life. I know I can relate to this book because basketball is a big part of Ben and Olsen's life and I love basketball. Also it is exciting how the book takes place so close to where we live. I would give this book five stars, but I do not like the ending, it is very dissapointing, but that's what I think the author, Nicole Hunter wanted, she wanted people to think long and hard about it. \\"Waiting For the World To End\\" is a great book and I would recommend it to everyone."},{"Title":"Waiting for the World to End","review":"This is the type of novel that stays with you and compels you to share it with someone who has either been a \\"Thomas\\" or knew a \\"Thomas\\"...particularly liked the plot twists that held my interest. But, mostly, I liked the author's voice...I got the feeling that this writer was definitely in-charge of her very well-drawn characters. Recommend it highly for anyone who enjoys a great read about the inner thoughts of an intriguing leading man."},{"Title":"Waiting for the World to End","review":"I am a normal senior in high school who does not enjoy reading books. Throughout my high school career, this is only the second book that I have honestly read. My first was Flowers For Algernon. The second I picked up the book and began reading the first couple of pages, your book caught my attention. From that day on, I would ask my teacher to bring it home so that I could even read it on my own time. I also would bring it to my friends houses to read. And wow! That is very unusual for me.Not only was your book a life lesson, but it is something that really made me think deeper thoughts, and understand other people's emotions better.I'm so glad that my teacher introduced this book to us and gave me an experience of a lifetime.I can't wait to meet you when you come to my school to talk to my class. You seem like a very interesting, and open minded person. Thank you so much for writing this unbeleivable book that I will never forget!"},{"Title":"Waiting for the World to End","review":"I really liked your book. The thing that I liked most about your book was it was filled with so much passion. I loved to hate your ending of the book. I believe that when you read a book and you dont like how it ends it means that the book touched you in some way, it made you feel and get connected with the people you read about. I know a lot of the kids in my class didnt like how it ended and i didnt either at first but as I got to thinking about it i believe it was the best way to end it. I just loved the way you wrote this book and how it had so much meaning behind every word. Another reason why I liked how this book ended was because most the time books end with everything working out just fine and everyone getting what they wanted, but how this ended was more of a real life ending something that could and most the time really would happen. I think you did a great job and i can't wait till you come to our schooL!"},{"Title":"Waiting for the World to End","review":"Waiting For The World To End is one book that can't be left untouched. Once you start reading it you will be sure to get hooked. It's entertaining, moving, and gets you thinking about your own life. The description and creativity she puts into her characters makes them really come to life. There are so many different struggles that each character deals with and she describes them so well. I was so enthralled by this book and I am sure anyone else who reads it will be too."},{"Title":"Waiting for the World to End","review":"This book is spectacular and I should know I have read thousands of books in my seventeen years of life. I love how Ms. Hunter shows Tom Olsen's feelings and what he is thinking. Most books I have read haven't shown as much. I also love the fact that she wrote the book to show how life really can be, how it isn't perfect and some people don't have have all the answers to make their lives complete. I can't wait for another book by Ms. Hunter, this was very enjoyable to read and I am ordering a copy for myself so I can read it again and again. I will tell everyone about Waiting For the World to End."},{"Title":"Waiting for the World to End","review":"This was my first book that I have read since I have been in high school and I am a person who does not like to read unless it is something like motocross magazines so I was suprised that I could not put the book down and actualy liked it. I think that a lot of the choices the characters had to go through in the story are like the ones in real life, and that is why I liked it so much. Another reason I think that I liked the story was because it is easy to understand. The only thing that I didn't like was the end I thought it was going to end with Tom and Mary getting together and I would have liked it to because they seem like they get along so good. Overall it was the best (actually the only) book I have ever read from cover to cover."},{"Title":"Waiting for the World to End","review":"Ms. Hunter throughout this book was able to invoke all the senses of the human capacity.Her writing style has that unique flare that hooks you in; you are capitavated after the first page. This book forces us to think of all the forces around us as people that make us do what we do, also she weaves in the inner thoughts of Tom that gives us as the reader an insight to who he is and why he is at the point in his life that he is. This book goes beyond the norms. It goes in a direction not easily predicted. You figure one thing is about to happen and it doesn't it something totally the opposite.\\"Whoa!\\" was the first thing I said after I finished reading this book. The ending just leaves you in utter amazement. You are left wondering why? and What? Ms. Hunter I commend you on your effort to write a book such as this. A writer with a message and a purpose is rare in these days, and you have acheived that for me atleast."},{"Title":"Waiting for the World to End","review":"I like that you used third person in the writing; I feel any other view would have lost the effect. I also liked the simplicity of the writing style; this made it easier to read and made it so that anyone could understand it not just those with a greater vocabulary.Tom is an interesting character and I feel you did a good job in bringing out the details of his personality. I also like the way you did a few flashbacks to explain parts of his past. You gave a good sense of time to the book because while I was reading it I could always tell what time of year it was which made it seem a bit more real.The part that was hard to keep out of my mind was the setting because I live near the Indiana Dunes and I figured out about where Indian River should be but knowing it's not there was a little irritating but I got over that quickly.I have heard of what the end has to bring but haven't yet read it; I do like what I have heard about it though. I appreciate that you don't have one of the completely overdone fairytale endings."},{"Title":"Waiting for the World to End","review":"The book \\"Waiting for the World to End\\" is so good that I could not put it down. In this book you meet the Indian River family ,and learn about an English teacher named Tom Olsen. He made a desicion in his past that haunts him for the rest of his life, and also gets in his way of making a move in his life that could make him happy."},{"Title":"Waiting for the World to End","review":"Like most teenagers, I don't like to read books. When I was told that I had to read this book I wasn't very happy, but after I started reading it I started to like it. This was a suprise to me because I usually don't like any books. I don't know what it was about the book that made me like it so much. I think some of it was the characters. I could relate to almost every character in this novel. This book feels like it is a true story and I think that is one reason that this book will have great success. There are many symbols. The titles of the chapters are one example of the symbols. The only thing that I didn't like when I first read it was the ending, but I thought about it and I figured that it was good but it isn't a typical ending for this type of story. Over all, I think this is a well-written book."},{"Title":"Waiting for the World to End","review":"Although the first read was a page turner,as I continued it was very apparent that a reread would be necessary. The use of sub plots was done quie well and in many cases I found myself being the actor. Perhaps 40 + years in education has that effect on you. Consequences of ones actions are both good and bad and we must learn to live with both, hopefully with emphasis on the positive. Life is a ministery and the field of education in some ways becomes or of a challlenge than religion its self. I found myself saying \\"this happened to me\\". I would hope that some one might say \\"Well done, you have been a trusted servant\\" I, say thank \\"You Ms. Hunter, This is a must read.\\""},{"Title":"Waiting for the World to End","review":"My class and I started reading this book in 11th grade English class. I really didn't like the book at first because I don't like reading books. After I got past the first chapter I was really into it. I didn't want to put down the book. Tom Olsen, the main character in this book, related a lot to me. Always caring for someone when he can't have them. Also he just likes to be alone most of the time. That really related to myself. I really can't believe that I got into a book like I did. It has high school life in it and it has college life in it too. Most of the book's setting is Indiana, in a high school named Indian River. If you're like me and you don't like to read, then this book will change your point of view."},{"Title":"Waiting for the World to End","review":"In the book, \\"Waiting for the World to End\\" there are many conflicts that arise between the six main characters. The first, and probably the most important conflict, is between Tom Olsen (an attractive, forty-something bachelor who coaches basketball and teaches English at Indian River High School) and his favorite student/athelete Ben Wendling's mother.Another issue is the fact that Olsen's best friend, Rakowsky, and his wife, are not able to concieve children, yet Rakowsky is the first person that Olsen talks to about the abortion. Still another, which unites all of the Wendlings, is how Olsen basically \\"substitutes\\" as a father figure for Ben during Ben's junior year. Virgil, Ben's father, is around in Ben's life, but Ben looks to Olsen more for fatherly advice than he does to Virgil, and because of this I do not feel that Virgil showed enough love for his son. Virgil is also a very church-oriented man, yet he does many sinful acts that contradict his beliefs showing yet again, another sign that he doesn't show enough love for his family.In his life, Olsen has dealt with problems starting with his not-so-swell relationship with his parents, to an abortion with his then-fiance\` Alexandra when they are still in college. These issues have shaped who Olsen is as well as why he does many of the things he does.Throughout the book we hear tales of Olsen's infatuation with Mary, his relationships with his many girlfriends, his inner anguish about the abortion that he tries to wash away with his nightly beer, and how he feels Ben is the son he never (and should have) had.I personally liked this story, up until the ending, because in the back of my mind I always had a feeling that Olsen and Mary should have been together all along. Knowing all of the chemistry between the two of them also made me wish the two of them would have just said something to one another, rather than bottling up all of their emotions even though everyone else knew as well as they did. I also feel that because Mary didn't give up her son even though she was impregnated at a young age, Olsen could finally end the pain he felt for having the abortion. They would have made the perfect couple and they would have both helped each other out. But what I do like about the ending is that it's real, and sometimes in life, there aren't happy endings in love and you can't always get what you want."},{"Title":"Waiting for the World to End","review":"\\"Waiting for the World to End\\" is a magnificently written book. The characters, plot line, morals, they all seem to make me think. Every time I would start to form an opinion about a character or an idea in the book, the story would change. I feel the characters play and important role in making this story so enjoyable. I feel that everyone can relate to one character or another at some point in the story. The things they go through and the struggles they have relate to everyday problems that we all have to face. Everything the characters do to get over their problems has a hidden message. Each way something works out for the characters ends up teaching a lesson in its own way. I feel these lessons and morals are the type to mean something different to each reader. I know these lessons may not mean to others what they have meant to me, however I feel they are beneficial to whomever may read the book. I feel this book was very enjoyable and it taught me many life lessons. I would recommend this book to anyone and everyone who is willing to read it."},{"Title":"Waiting for the World to End","review":"WHEN I READ A BOOK I DO NOT CHOOSE TO KEEP TRYING TO USE MY IMAGINATION I PREFER THE AUTHOR TO TAKE ME SOMEWHERE AND I DID NOT FEEL MUCH FOR THIS BOOK"},{"Title":"Waiting for the World to End","review":"\\"Waiting for the World to End\\" is a great book. I am not the type of person who enjoys reading books AT ALL, but this one caught my attention. I really liked the fact that it dealt with basketball and took place here in Indiana. Even though the book was fiction, so much of it seemed like it was real. The conflicts the characters faced were problems that people face every day and it makes you feel like you can relate to them. It also has a suprise factor at times. Some of the events seem to be predictable, but then others aren't. So, it keeps you guessing through most of the book. The end was a little disappointing to me, but I'll let you determine that for yourself."},{"Title":"Waiting for the World to End","review":"The dialogue in this novel is as stilted and ridiculous as its characters. Here's the premise: a grown man with a successful career in education meets the mother of one of his students and, after a few seconds, he's madly and deeply in love, the dilemma on which the rest of the plot depends. I was expecting the main character to metamorphse into a serial killer but it doesn't happen. This book is not worth anyone's time. It's author obviously thought writing a good book wasn't worth her time and it's definitely not worth yours."},{"Title":"Waiting for the World to End","review":"I realize I am in the minority here. The reason I purchased the book was because of all the excellent reviews, and perhaps my disappointment is due to unrealistic expectations. While I think the writing in the book is pretty good, and I like the use of quotes from other works, the characters are not well developed, and the story just kind of ambles along. I personally dislike stories that amble if the characters are not likeable, and I found the characters to be either unlikeable or one-dimensional. The reader is asked to empathize with Olsen, yet the tragedy that shaped his personality is given about 3 pages. Olsen in the present is selfish, and at best introspective, and I am just struggling with relating or even really caring what happens to him. The same goes for Mary. I don't think she really even gets much dialogue in the book, she seems more like a caricature and yet somehow we are supposed to believe this guy is so in love with her, he can barely function for a few years. The Mcormick character is so obviously a foreshadowing for Olsen in the future, it doesn't even seem clever. The story seems like it is aiming to be true to real life, yet the characters and their emotions seem completely contrived. I am going to finish the book, and hold out hope that the author's next work lives up to the hype."},{"Title":"Waiting for the World to End","review":"I have recently read the book \\"Waiting for the World to End\\", by Nicole Hunter. The characters in the novel are individually rounded in their own special way. It's like you know them in real life or you can relate to them in some way. Also the books setting is around my area, which makes it more interesting. I can pinpoint many of the places mentioned in this book. Overall, this was a good read and I would recommend it for anyone."},{"Title":"Waiting for the World to End","review":"The book Waiting For the World to End was a very good book. I enjoyed reading about what Nicole Hunter imagined. I think she did a very good job. She made me want to keep on reading. She doesn't just concentrate on just one subject, there are so many conflicts that happen in the book. There was always something new going and which made me want to keep on reading, she definitely caught my attention! The only thing is that, I wish she would have told us what happened with Tom and Mary, whether they were still friends and talked or never talked again after he told her how he felt. In her book she taught me a lot about life lessons and how I can be so lonely but yet live life to the fullest. Nicloe Hunter's book was awesome and one I will cherrish forever."},{"Title":"Waiting for the World to End","review":"I thought \\"Waiting For the World to End\\" was a great novel. The book had a lot of suspense and drama like a painful divorce and a death almost occurring at a basketball game. These events kept making me want to read the book even more. Tom is an English teacher and a basketball coach who falls in love with Mary. Ben is a high school basketball star and Mary's son in the novel. Ben is a character who I can relate to because he is my age. Also, I liked the setting that Nicole Hunter picked because it is 15 minutes away from my house. For example, part of the story takes place at Valparaiso University. It seems as if I could put myself in Ben's shoes. Virgil, Mary's husband, seemed suspicious to me throughout the whole novel. Therefore, I was not shocked with what Virgil did at the end. The ending of the book was not the way I expected it to be. This dismayed me and it turned out that my prediction was wrong. Overall, everything else in the book was excellent and this book teaches many life lessons as well. Also, if you're looking for your not so perfect fairy tale ending, then this novel is a perfect choice."},{"Title":"Waiting for the World to End","review":"From the very first line of this book to the final page, I was captured by the brilliance of the story of Tom Olsen. Olsen is a man with a haunting past and a miserable future. As the story goes on, we find that we could somewhat relate to this poor man and the cold life in which he lives. Olsen is in his early forties and is single. However, the one woman he falls for also happens to be happily married with a son. Throughout the story Olsen fights a never ending battle within himself. As time goes on, he learns to mask his feelings. But in the process, he slowly decays within his soul. Rarely do I sit down to read a book and usually I don't even finish once I've started. \\"Waiting for the World to End\\" truly grabbed my attention and has still not let go."},{"Title":"Waiting for the World to End","review":"I loved the book by Nicole Hunter \\"Waiting for the World to End.\\" She had so many awesome messages throughout the book. I learned to make wise and thoughtful decisions. Because I may later regret them and your decisions may also seem as if they are haunting you! For instance, in the book, Tom made a decision for an abortion with Alexandra. At the time it was a \\"good\\" idea, but now he is struggling in all areaas of his life because of that decision. I love how Hunter included something that almost anyone who reads it could connect to. Like for kids my age reading this book a couple things that could relate to us could be the new relationships with our parents, divorce between parents, One or both parents having a drinking or other type of problem, and also the issue of having a teacher/ student to get close to and have a family type relationship. For example, Tom and Ben's friendship was pretty close. Hunter just had a very powerful novel with a lot of potential. I would recommend this book to anyone who loves to read!"},{"Title":"Waiting for the World to End","review":"Easy to read, yet challenging to understand. This is a good story and an enjoyable read.

I liked how the book was easy to follow and that it showed the conflicts that Tom and Mary encountered.

She writes beautifully, creates atmospheres for the locations of her story that are palpable, paints characters so completely that they become visual, and spins a tale of love and life that is simple and direct in manner while complex in detail. She comes to this first novel well schooled and with the added currency of a devotion to her craft: she is the founder of Literacy Through Literature and when not writing, she volunteers as an adult literacy tutor with Project: LEARN in her home in Cleveland, Ohio. She is thoroughly grounded in poetry, philosophy, the great debate over the Right to Life, even the ins and outs of the game of basketball! All of this information serves as an introduction to an important new voice, but it also poses the conundrum of why this first novel doesn't become 'great'.But first the story: Thomas Olsen is a 41 year old English and Literature teacher AND winning basketball coach at Indian River High School in Indiana, a man loved by his students, their parents, his fellow teachers, his team, even is elderly neighbor Mr. McCormick who shares Olsen's sense of isolationism in a world busy with 'success'. Olsen's life has been one of aching to find meaning and love: his parents were distant and cold, and he continues to live in the regret of agreeing to the abortion of his high school sweetheart's pregnancy, a deed which has prevented him from finding a life partner. Olsen is particularly drawn to one of his top students and players, Ben Wendling, who represents everything Olsen would want in the son he never had and whose mother Mary touches his longing for love but remains a married woman inaccessible to him. A near fatal sports accident occurs and Olsen saves Ben's life, bonding him tightly to Ben's family and to Ben. Events occur and Ben goes to Tucson, AZ on a full college scholarship and serendipitously Olsen accepts a new job at the same university as JV coach.Time passes, circumstances change, and when climactic events occur back in Indian River, Olsen returns to be in Ben's wedding and to discover facts that bring Olsen to major decisions about his own life choices and changes. It is to Hunter's credit that she treats her readers with great intelligence and does not stoop to romance pulp fiction happy endings. She seems to understand the cycle of life and the consequences of choices and plays these to sensitive conclusions instead of pie-in-the-sky soap opera.Having said all of that, the one thing for this reader that keeps this novel from entering the pantheon of great books is the author's tendency toward the evangelical religious convincing that she places in the mouths of not only the clergy, but also in Mary and in the important character Ben. For example, the following is well written, but...\\"It doesn't matter what happened before...and it doesn't matter what happens later. God gave us free will. Whatever happens, you don't have to fight it - you can just keep writing your own story, your own way, no matter what's going on around you. And it's never too late; you must just make your life exactly what you want it to be, starting today. Like mom says - Begin; the rest is easy.\\" Too frequently the answers to questions raised by the author are attributed to God's will, and while there is validity in this response, it seems to prevent further fleshing out of story challenges.But that is only a small point of contention that for this reviewer withholds a star in this otherwise five star book. Hunter is so fine a writer that her future success seems assured. One last point about the publisher: the cover of this book is a rather odd, unflattering photograph of what appears to be a young lad putting the shot, an act that has nothing to do with the story and suggests that the contents between this distracting cover may be dealing with physically or mentally challenged children, which it most certainly is not. Small promotional glitches such as this may serve to prevent eager book shoppers from approaching this novel for the fine work that it is. Grady Harp, January 2005"},{"Title":"Waiting for the World to End","review":"This book is like watching a bad lifetime movie. The author, Nicole Hunter, does not do a very good job of writing a believable male lead character. The main character, Tom Olsen, is a lonely middle aged basketball coach with nothing to do but wallow in his own pitty and fantasize about one of his students' mother. He makes remarks that only men in sappy movies make. If you don't understand what I am trying to say read the book, however, I don't recommend buying it. Pick it up at your local library.

Sam Curzon, the author, creates characters (such as the nurse, Mary Bogan, with whom Legs supposedly had an affair) who simply never existed, and the dialogue contained in these pages is questionable at best.

What they present are not reviews but personal opinions. This is largely what the book lays out as a reason for the conviction of Betty Wilson. This woman was not convicted on any evidence or fact but on the testimony of a proven liar, schizophrenic, alcoholic, drug-addicted man that turned on his own men in Vietnam. Whether people agree or disagree with the verdict, people are supposed to be convicted on fact and not opinion. This book is eye opening and needs to be read by those possessing skills of discernment and reason. One can only hope that justice will prevail in the end although it appears that will not happen in this case."},{"Title":"By Two and Two: The Scandalous Story of Twin Sisters Accused of a Shocking Crime of Passion","review":"Author Jim Schutze has written some terrific non-fiction books in the past but this is his best one! Unlike most true-crime books, this one uncovers a judicial travesty where one twin sister was sent to prison for life and the other one acquitted for a crime they didn't commit. The first twin to be tried, Betty Wilson, was a controverial figure,in that she lived a life of luxury, had numerous affairs, some with black men, and cussed a lot. These traits were instrumental in paving her way into prison for the horrific beating death of her husband, a wealthy dentist. She was convincted on the incredible testimony of a known psychotic and drug addict,James White, with a rap sheet a mile long. He was given a written contract by the district attorney, that assured him of avoiding the electric chair if he would testify that the twin sisters were behind the murder of the dentist. Betty was painted as a promiscuous, alcoholic \\"slut\\" in the Tuscaloosa, Alabama courtroom and this is basically what sealed her fate. Her twin sister, Peggy, whose case was tried in Montgomery, Alabama, was acquitted on the basis of the identical testimony that doomed her sister. This time around, her lawyers pointed out the bizarre lies told by the killer who, by the way, was sent to a dentist to have his teeth capped for his trial appearance. In the jailhouse, he was awarded the status of mascot while he smirked and grinned at the imprisoned Betty. The author says frankly that he considered the twin sisters to be guilty of something when he first started covering the courtro testimony. But he said he gradually became outraged that the district attorney used a known psychopathic criminal to railroad the twin sisters into prison. The fact that it was election year and the DA wanted a high profile case to impress the voters for his re-election, contributed to this travesty. Betty Wilson is now serving life sentence without a chance of parole in the Tutwiler Prison in Alabama. Her twiwn sister, Peggy, is still working with attorneys to have her case appealed. In the meantime, the real killer, James White, is free after savagely murdering a man. The state of Alabama has been good to him for his crime."},{"Title":"By Two and Two: The Scandalous Story of Twin Sisters Accused of a Shocking Crime of Passion","review":"I like to read crime books in which, at the end, justice has been done, but such is not the case in Jim Schutze's *By Two and Two*. It tells the story of two Alabama sisters charged with conspiring to murder the husband of one of them. Although apparently neither woman was involved in the crime, one was found guilty and the other was not, because of personal, social and racial issues tangential to the case. In pursuing the investigation, well-meaning police were evidently manipulated and deceived by a career criminal who sought, and won, preferential treatment by helping them make a case against the women. The author himself was clearly disturbed by the outcome"},{"Title":"By Two and Two: The Scandalous Story of Twin Sisters Accused of a Shocking Crime of Passion","review":"This book is fairly typical of the mid 1990s. The Clintons were in the White House and the establishment was obsessed with racism. They could find racism under every rock and around every corner - and books about racism, especially in the deep South, stood a good chance of publication regardless of their other merits or lack thereof. The author, Jim Schutze, specialized in \\"racial\\" exposes and won awards from leftist organization for finding racism - he could find it in places where others might fail to spot it.In this book, Schutze maintains that a white \\"racist\\" jury in a city in Alabama convicted Betty Wilson of hiring someone to kill her wealthy husband in order to get his life insurance - worth millions. Another, heavily black jury in another Alabama city acquitted her twin sister after hearing basically similar evidence. Schutze's conclusion: the white jury was biased but the black jury was fair.The author claims that the husband's killer was coached by law enforcement to concoct a story that would incriminate the twin sisters. But he cannot explain the killer's motive - why he would kill a man he didn't know, had never heard of and as there was no robbery - he did not benefit monetarily or otherwise for his act. And he can't explain why the wife advanced him money hidden in a library book checked out in her name - or why the wife and her sister had so many documented contacts with the man - a man far below their social class with a criminal record.Don't waste time with this book- instead get Ken Englade's book \\"Blood Sister\\" - Mr. Englade doesn't have a social agenda."},{"Title":"By Two and Two: The Scandalous Story of Twin Sisters Accused of a Shocking Crime of Passion","review":"A few months ago, I saw this case on \\"48 Hours.\\" It interested me because I had knowledge about this situation that was not in the program, so I bought the book. Not surprisingly, Schultze is even more biased in the book than he was on the program.Betty: \\"He [Jack] insisted upon my having affairs.\\" That statement is so outrageous that it is laughable.Betty said that she had rather face execution in the Electric Chair rather than be locked up for life. I find that comical because if she is being honest, she should kill herself. She didn't. Yes, this is yet another outrageous lie by Betty.Betty is a patholical liar.Schultze either \\"bought into\\" her lies or isn't being honest in the book. When you buy it, do some independent research. Don't be fooled by Shultze's incredible lack of even basic legal concepts, and don't be fooled by his bias. He doesn't tell the entire story.Lord, they were tried by 2 different juries. Betty's sister wasn't sleeping with whomever she met that day. The defendants were different in many ways. It was Betty's husband that she had killed, not her sister's husband. The trial of Betty's sister and the trial of Betty are two completely different events. Schultze seemingly cannot understand that basic concept.Or, can he?I bet his book sold more copies the way he wrote it rather than it would if he had done his research and reported the truth as unbiased as possible.Could it be that Schultze is more concerned with $$ than with the truth?You decide.

C. Constantine. Balzic is described as &quot;a hokey, untypical detective who works from a bedrock of compassion and shrewd common sense.&quot; But do not let this bit of endpiece hyperbole dissuade you from checking out this mystery. Yes, there are some stereotypical elements in this novel--the chief hates the pompous district attorney Milt Weigh and the overly inquisitive reporter Dick Deitz, but this is also a chief of police who does not like his cops running around with guns (thing &quot;Destry&quot;). Mario has teenager daughters who are trying to tolerate his eccentricities, an elderly mother who remembers basically everything anybody has ever done in this town, and is friends with Father Marazzo, who is willing to listen to anything the chief wants to get off his chest.A man Mario has known since childhood is found bludgeoned to death with a Coke bottle on the platform of the Rocksburg railroad station. The damage is so bad Mario has to be told the name of the victim. From his initial investigation Mario becomes convinced that the man's stepson is the guilty party, but proving it is going to prove rather difficult for a lot of reasons. As the title indicates, this is only the first murder in the book and the tension builds as we wait for the second victim to drop. For Constantine characterization assumes more of an importance than the detective work in this novel, because Mario pays as much attention to the need for compassion as he does for the search for clues.This is a nice start. We get a good sense of the lay of the land, not only of Rocksburg but more importantly of the way Mario Balzic thinks and the way he feels. For me, this was enough to motivate me to move directly to the next story in the series, &quot;The Man Who Like to Look at Himself.&quot; Except for the Spenser for Hire series I have never really a lot of mysteries per se, and when I do it is character more than story that grabs my interest. Warning: Constantine does not divide his novles into chapters, so if you settle down to read this book intending to finish the first chapter before you go to sleep, you are going to by up all night.&quot;The Blank Page,&quot; the third novel in the series, begins when Chief Balzic receives a phone call from Miss Cynthia Summers who reports that she has not seen one of her student roomers for several days. Paying a courtesy call sounds a lot better to Balzic than working on the budget report until he finds the body of Janet Pisula on the floor of her room. The young woman has been strangled with her brassiere, wearing only her panties, with a blank sheet of paper resting on top of her body. The murder had happened sometime the previous week and nobody in the rooming house or on campus had noticed Janet had suddenly disappeared.By this point Constantine has clearly settled on a specific literary modus operandi. Lt. Harry Minyon, the blundering blowhard who was in charge of the local State Police barracks in the previous mystery &quot;The Man Who Like to Look at Himself&quot; has been temporarily replaced by Lt. Walker Johnson, who is more in the mold of Lt. Phil Moyer from &quot;The Rocksburg Railroad Murders&quot; in terms of providing support for Balzic rather than an constant impediment in the search for the murderer. By removing the set of stereotypical clowns getting in the way of Balzic's investigation, Constantine is able to keep the story's focus on the chief's interrogative skills.In the current dichotomy represented by television's &quot;Law & Order&quot; and &quot;C.S.I.&quot; franchises, Constantine's Balzic is clearly in the camp of the former. The focus here is not on forensic science or the ability to beat and/or shoot up bad guys, but rather on asking the right questions in order to gather the necessary information. Reading these books is waiting for the key piece of the puzzle to show up so that everything can fall into place, at which point Balzic can go bring in the murderer. These novels are not so much about police procedure as they are the lost art of interrogation. Of course, in Constantine's hands these interrogations rarely take place in a special room at the police station.&quot;The Blank Page&quot; is the best of the first three Mario Balzic novels, although readers who are captivated by some of the more colorful characters in Rocksburg may well wish Father Mazzo and Mo Vulcanas were more involved in the story as they were respectively in the first two books. Personally, I would like to see a bit more of Balzic's family, since they tend to provide nice counterpoints to the crime being investigated. But the most important other character in these novels to this point in the series clearly ends up being the murderer. I would not go so far a to say Balzic shows compassion for the murderers he catches (with the exception being what happened in the second novel), but there is certainly a strong sense of empathy and understanding towards the story they have to tell. But then, it is that ability to look at things from the perspective of others that is Balzic's greatest asset when it comes to solving crimes."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Trafalgar (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #4)","review":"In a previous review I had wished Cornwall would mix up the formula of his Sharpe series, proving the French proverb correct--I didn't at all enjoy getting what I wished for. Sharpe's Trafalgar is a hybrid novel of unlikely Romance and unlikely happenstance adventure wherein we are asked to suspend our disbelief that an army officer just happens to stumble upon the greatest naval battle since Actium. I did so grudgingly. After all can't Cornwall come up with his own interesting premises to drive a plot--or will we have Sharpe ricocheting across Europe in the Napoleonic Wars.Not only does our hero stumble into the battle at Trafalgar but he is introduced to Nelson who (naturally) takes a shine to Sharpe offering sage advice about being unnecessarily modest. Sadly, this is the plausible part of our tale with a seedy and wholly unconvincing affair between a baroness and the ensign taking center stage. Apparently aristocrats in the 19th century risked all--wealth, status and comfort for a roll in the hay. Why? They are bored. And realize how disagreeable an arranged marriage can be.Even if one assumes the Lady Grace is indifferent to class mores and proprieties, are we supposed to believe she is too horny to restrain herself in a venue that all but ensures discovery. Does it bother her 19th century sensibilities that she is an adulterous? Of course not. That her lover commits murder to silence blackmail? Whatever. It is all too absurd for words. Cornwall's strength was never character development but surely an editor could have pointed out that 21st century morality is inappropriate in a story taking place 200 years ago. I have no doubt adultery happened. I also have no doubt it didn't happen as described in ST.What saves this from being a silly stinker is the genuinely interesting description of 19th century naval tactics and life above and below deck. The battle of Trafalgar is rousing and the devotion Nelson inspires is well done. However, Cornwall seems to have ventured into the realm of romance with this one, and that isn't, in my opinion, a good thing."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Trafalgar (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #4)","review":"If you like Sharpe add a star. If you are a history buff you might want to remove one. Sharpe at Trafalgar only gets to Trafalgar in the last 100 pages or so. I think I would have been happier if the book had only been 200 pages long, but there was an awful lot of Sharpe before we got to the action. Admittedly I have never been able to finish any of the other books in the series"},{"Title":"Sharpe's Trafalgar (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #4)","review":"A land based version of Aubrey - Maturin Royal Navy series of novels by Patrick O'Brian.Very entertaining reading.........not deep but they move a long well - perfect for flights/vacation or chapter or two at a time occasions!!"},{"Title":"Sharpe's Trafalgar (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #4)","review":"Cornwell's main character, Ensign Richard Sharpe, came up through the ranks. He was awarded an ensign's commission due to his heroism in battle. Because he has not been schooled as a gentleman, he is looked down upon by his fellow officers. The enlisted men do not respect him because he was once like them. Sharpe is determined to make his own way. He is brave and treacherous. He does not suffer fools. And when someone has treated him unfairly, he holds a grudge, and takes his revenge when the opportunity comes.In this installment of the series it is 1805. England, France, and Spain are battling for supremacy of the ocean. In the seas around India, the French warship Revenant has been been harassing English shipping. The English warship Pucelle has been assigned to stop the Revenant. Sharpe is on his way home to England. Before leaving India, he helps the Pucelle's captain to regain some purloined goods.Sharpe has booked passage on the Calliope, an East India cargo ship. Traveling with him are several well to do merchants, Lord William Hale and his beautiful young wife Lady Grace.As the Calliope sails eastward, Sharpe and Lady Grace become attracted to each other. Soon they are conducting a clandestine affair. Unfortunately, fate intervenes. The captain of the Calliope believes that England is doomed to lose the war. He arranges to have his ship captured by the Revenant. In doing so, he steals his passengers prized possessions, including Sharpe's valuable collection of gemstones. Also, Sharpe and Grace's affair has been discovered by Lord Hale's personal secretary. The secretary attempts to blackmail Sharpe and Grace.Eventually, Sharpe, Grace, Lord William and his secretary are saved by the Pucelle. The Pucelle is pursuing the Revenant. As they chase the Revenant around the Cape of Good Hope and north toward Europe, Sharpe and Grace continue their affair. Just as they catch up to the Revenant, they find the British, French and Spanish fleets gathered for what will become the Battle of Trafalgar.As the battle rages around the ship, Sharpe fights for his life. Deep in the bowels of the ship, Grace also fights to survive. Lord William reveals to Grace that he knows about the affair. The climax of the novel reveals who will survive this day of terror and treachery.The last 60 pages of the novel describe the terrible sea battle that was Trafalgar. The pages fly by as Cornwell's description of the fighting draws you into the battle. You are there with Sharpe as he participates in the desperate struggle. Sea battles of this time were not fought as they are today. In this era ships fought side by side. Sharpe battles in a hailstorm of musket balls, grape shot and cannon balls. Cornwell's prose keeps you reading to learn the fates of Sharpe, his shipmates, and his lover.In my opinion, \\"a real page turner\\" is an often overused phrase used in book reviews. For me, I found that this description of Cornwell's novel was literally true.I enjoyed this book. It was a real page turner. And I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Trafalgar (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #4)","review":"Cornwell's heroic character falls to new levels of debauchery in this, one of the author's poorer efforts. Killing off the opposition comes a little too easily in this tale, and the adulterous, implausible hookup of Sharpe and his new romantic interest are far too rank for good entertainment. Sharpe is no angel in other Corwell novels, but in this one, he appears more the bad guy, full of deceit, passion, and revenge.Meanwhile, the battle scenes and nautical information are great. Like someone suggested, it might be better to skip the first part of the book."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Trafalgar (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #4)","review":"Very good read with a lot of action.

Richard Sharpe has no business being at the battle of Trafalgar. Despite this, Bernard Cornwell gives us an interesting and plausible story to get him there.It's still a bit contrived, but you'll forget all about it because the richness of the storytelling will have you feeling the deck swaying under your feet and you smelling the gunpowder in the air. I find this to be the most immersive Sharpe novel yet.There is a significant amount of the novel dedicated to the actual engagement at Trafalgar as you would expect from a Sharpe. It is terrifically paced and remarkably well explained at the same time. No mean feat. The movements of the vessels and the ebb and flow of the battle are easily understood. It's probably the best description of a battle I have ever read, including textbooks on the subject.Objectively I should only give the book 4 stars because Trafalgar is not where Richard Sharpe belongs. As reviews are subjective, I'm giving it a 5 because its brilliantly written and I'm a big softy so I really enjoyed the love story within this one."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Trafalgar (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #4)","review":"I learn History with Bernard Cornwell's books that mix it with adventure, epic, romance and a remarkable character like Richard Sharpe.

Another great historical tale that gives a participant's view of history.

Cornwell is a superstar in this genre and I have yet to read a bad work by him."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Trafalgar (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #4)","review":"Bernard Cornwell must be one of the very best historical fiction writers in the world today. Sharpe's Trafalgar is a gem. Highly recommended reading."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Trafalgar (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #4)","review":"It's the summer of 1805 and Ensign Richard Sharpe (who, not so long ago, was Private and then Sergeant Sharpe) has been on duty in India for six years. Having grown up in a workhouse and then on the streets of London, he regards India as much \\"home\\" as anywhere -- but now he's heading back to England to join a newly-forming rifle regiment. (Although, having been a \\"redcoat\\" since he was sixteen, he's not happy about switching to a green jacket.) But first he has to get there, and that means four months at sea. And his timing is such that he's destined to be off the coast of Spain in October. Fans of Napoleonic naval fiction will recognize what that means. Sharpe's voyage is eventful, first on an East Indiaman that's captured by a French ship through the treachery of the English captain. Then, after a week as prisoners below decks, the passengers on the Indiaman are rescued by the intervention of a British ship-of-the-line -- which just happens to be commanded by a captain of Sharpe's previous acquaintance. The captain indulges in an ocean-spanning chase of the fugitive Frenchman -- which includes some of the best descriptions in the book for those who know Hornblower and Aubrey -- and they all arrive off the southern coast of Spain at just the right moment. Meanwhile, first on the Indiaman, then on the warship, Sharpe has been carrying on an affair with the beautiful young wife of a coldly arrogant peer, to the secret amusement of practically everyone on board except the lady's husband, who may or may not be ignorant of the adultery. Actually, the two plots don't overlap much. The love story seems unlikely, given the difference in station between Sharpe and the lady, and the naval plotline seems positively forced, being just a way to allow our hero to be present at one of the greatest marine confrontations in European history. The adventure is all very well, but it does stretch credulity. And believability is ordinarily one of Cornwell's greatest assets. (I wonder if Sharpe is going to be present at Gettysburg, too.)"},{"Title":"Sharpe's Trafalgar (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #4)","review":"Richard Sharpe, Cornwell's Napoleonic war hero, takes to the high seas in this great book set during the Battle of Trafalgar.Sharpe is on his way home to join the newly formed Rifles battalion only to find himself entrenched in one of the most significant naval battles in history.If you have read anything Cornwell has written, you will see the same similar formula; however, Cornwell mixed things up a little by placing Sharpe on the high seas. Through Sharpe's good fortune, he is able to meet Lord Nelson and play an integral part in securing a victory for the ship he is traveling on.Of course, you also have to have the token love affair and the \\"enemy\\" who makes the mistake of crossing Sharpe only to find himself on the wrong end of Sharpe's anger.Mr. Cornwell's writing is very engaging, very interesting, and always a page turner. The Sharpe series does not blow me away as the Last Kingdom or the Warlord Chronicles did, but I will still read every Sharpe novel because they are just down right entertaining!!Thank you Mr. Cornwell!"},{"Title":"Sharpe's Trafalgar (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #4)","review":"This is the (chronological) fourth book in the Sharpe series. It follows the third immediately, so please start at the beginning if you have not done so. For those of you who have read the previous Sharpe books, review follows.On his way home to England, Sharpe sails with one Captain Peculiar Cromwell, and meets up with his old cordial enemy, Pohlmann. He also begins an affair with an aristocrat's wife. But traitors have sold the ship to the French, and he is captured. Once Sharpe and the crew are rescued, the hunt is on, which leads them to meet Nelson and fight in the Battle of Trafalgar. This is another very good entry in the series, even though I don't care for nautical fiction as much as I do reading of land battles. As always, the historical details of ships, battles, dress and speech are mostly meticulously rendered, mixed in with a perhaps more modern action-hero sensibility (perhaps some of Sharpe's actions, as a mere ensign, might have been frowned upon in reality). It is true that the characters in this entry are painted in broader strokes than in the previous ones (thus the 3 rather than 4 stars): the heroes are all brave, good and dependable and the villains are all duplicitous and craven. Still, it's a swashbuckling yarn, and great reading fun. Recommended."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Trafalgar (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #4)","review":"Richard Sharpe, the heroic rifleman, was created by Bernard Cornwell as a way of following the career of the Duke of Wellington in the Peninsular war.When that proved a roaring success Cornwell embarked on the production of some Prequels to show how Sharpe had risen from the ranks in India, and to show the early career of Wellesley at Seringapatam and Assaye.But Sharpe had to be moved from India to Spain, and Cornwell cheekily hijacked this opportunity to introduce his diamond in the rough to the other great British war hero of the Napoleonic era, Admiral Nelson. In the process Cornwell slips another ship of the line into the battle of Trafalgar on either side.Sharpes Trafalgar is a great swashbuckling novel in the best tradition of Hornblower. It moves from Conmen in India to Pirates on the high seas. There follows a nailbiting sea chase between two 74 gunners, culminating in the Battle of Trafalgar.Along the way is a love story, deception, blackmail and revenge, all the usual depth and richness of Cornwells back plots. And on the trip we learn a lot about the day to day routines of the great days of sail.Wonderful and colourful stuff. It's not literature, but it is great!"},{"Title":"Sharpe's Trafalgar (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #4)","review":"After my own 2-year hiatus from Sharpe, this was a good re-introduction.

Characters not quite up to his &quot;Rifles&quot; fellows, but still good fun."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Trafalgar (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #4)","review":"I've read all the Sharpe books and this is one of my favorites. It takes Sharpe out of his normal element(on land in India or Europe) and puts him aboard a ship. Cornwell still has the eye for detail aboard a sailing ship. While we know the outcome of the battle its fun getting there. Sharpe's shipboard romance is also a plus though I wish Cornwell would spice up the sex a bit!"},{"Title":"Sharpe's Trafalgar (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #4)","review":"Non-stop seafaring warfare action at its best! Richard Sharpe is the author's heroic army officer who boards a ship expecting a noneventful return trip to England after staving off rebellion against the British government in India. Instead, he finds himself involved in the Battle of Trafalger.The action never stops as Sharpe fights for the rights of outbound ship passengers, fights for the love of a beautiful woman and fights for his country. The patriotic fervor and courage of navymen is palpable as Corwnell writes of the daily rigors and dangers of serving on the ships of the day. But, at the same time, the brutality and goriness of war is described exquisitely. I was lifted by small victories and winced at death and injury.Most impressive in this novel is Cornwell's attention to historical detail. He even, much to his credit, includes a postscript at the end of the book to explain which parts of the book are fact and which are fiction. The characters are consistent and honestly portrayed. Sharpe, though heroic, is far from a saint. He breaks rules and laws to get what he wants just as he learned to get along as a homeless child. The wealthy in the book take advantage of the less fortunate to advance their desires. There is no adaptation of modern values and experience to distract from the time period here.But this is an adventure novel first and foremost. I had a difficult time putting this book down and was left wanting more when it ended. This is, unfortunately, the first book I have read in Cornwell's Sharpe series. After reading Trafalgar, it will definitely not be my last."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Trafalgar (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #4)","review":"Richard Sharpe is a soldier, and as such is much more comfortable on solid ground than upon the deck of a ship. That does not stop him from being in the middle of the battle of Trafalgar, however. The author is to be congratulated for getting Sharpe to be present at this historic fight, and also to be able to have a few moments of private conversation with Admiral Nelson on the eve of the battle. Cornwell writes quite knowingly about ships and sailors, and his account of the fight drips with authenticity. Sharpe, as usual, overcomes great obstacles, and aquits himself bravely. There's a love sub-plot, which adds spice to the story, and just the touch of class-consciousness that Sharpe has been experiencing since he became an officer. This series goes from strength to strength, and is well worth reading."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Trafalgar (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #4)","review":"Simply put another great book in the Sharpe series by Bernard Cornwell."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Trafalgar (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #4)","review":"In the hands of a lesser author, I'd be irritated with Richard Sharpe's ability to play a key role in seemingly every key British military action in the early 1800s. But thanks to Bernard Cornwell, I can dismiss petty contrivances and just enjoy the blasted books - and enjoy them I do.(And I'm also reminded of the two soldiers in Ken Burns' magnificent Civil War TV history who kept journals and managed to be in over twenty critical battles . . . sometimes truth is stranger than fiction.)Cornwell has written so many books that he does not feel the need for poetic titles. \\"Sharpe's Trafalgar\\" unsurprisingly puts Sharpe at, well, the Battle of Trafalgar. I know only a couple of Brits well, but from talking to them it's easy to see that Trafalgar is to Britain what Yorktown, Gettysburg, or D-Day are for the United States. There is nothing more stirring to national pride than a magnificent, critical military victory. So Cornwell can be forgiven if he jumps through a few odd hoops to have his favorite Army Ensign play a key role in the purely naval clash at Trafalgar.Sharpe needs to get home from India to join his new regiment, the 95th Rifles. Obviously, Sharpe can't walk back to England from India, and this allows Cornwell to \\"play Patrick O'Brian.\\" Sharpe learns the ins and outs of life on board a British naval vessel, including the close proximity of your fellow passengers, the problems of sailing with an uncooperative wind, and the perils at sea if your captain sells you out.Sharpe also spends a lot of time romancing the glamorous Lady Grace, inconveniently married to a British lord, a general in the Army who is more politician than soldier. (This, by the way, means \\"villain\\" in Cornwell's universe, and he's a good foil for Sharpe.)But the whole novel is really an excuse to get Sharpe to Trafalgar, where he meets Admiral Nelson and gets to wreak his unusual brand of havoc against the French navy. These latter chapters is where \\"Sharpe's Trafalgar\\" really soars, and it does so in both expected and surprising ways.First, the obvious - Trafalgar's a battle, and nobody writes a better real-world battle scene than Cornwell. Sure, it's at sea, but that doesn't slow down an author of Cornwell's talent.But what really makes the battle scenes at Trafalgar powerful is Cornwell's decision to give up portions of the narrative to Captain Chase, Sharpe's friend. I read and re-read several passages where Chase walks the decks of his beloved ship, hands clasped behind his back, as French muskets and cannon fire all around him. While keeping an air of nonchalance, Chase is terrified inside . . . and as such epitomizes the 19th-century British soldier. These are some of the best lines Cornwell has ever written.I am early into the Sharpe series, and I expect I may find a later book that I enjoy more than \\"Sharpe's Trafalgar.\\" If I do, that will be a happy day indeed."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Trafalgar (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #4)","review":"Another outstanding addition to the classic Richard Sharpe series. With Sharpe departing India and sailing aboard an English warship, he soon becomes embroiled with a renegade, an unfaithful wife, a wealthy and jealous husband, a scattering of nautical characters worthy of Kent and Pope not to mention some terrific descriptions of life at sea aboard a King's ship. The author once again demonstrates his uncanny ability of placing our hero in some dangerous prediciments, with some splendid details about ship board hazards and some rousing sea battles and some rather torrid romantic interludes as well. A worthy addition to the collection, filled with adventure, thundering battle and splintered decks, romance and sudden death. I hope that Mr Cornwall considers doing a few books featuring a new naval hero, his writing style would capture that quite well. Once again, Sharpe marches on."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Trafalgar (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #4)","review":"An homage to Patrick O'Brian's \\"Master and Commander\\", the series based on the British Navy of the same period. The fan of both will see numerous similarities.Sharpe's new friend, Captain Joel Chase, is the spitting image of Jack Aubrey. He's a bluff, good-natured fighting captain whose men would follow him through the gates of Hell, and he personally feels the same way about Admiral Lord Nelson. Sound familiar? He rarely flogs erring sailors. He loves his coffee. He pays for extra powder and shot out of his own pocket so that his crew can practice gunnery. And he's loyal to friends like Sharpe, who comes to Chase's rescue during a Bombay brawl with a dishonest merchant who cheated them both.There are other touches as well. Sharpe's struggle to climb the masts and perhaps avoid using the maintop's \\"lubber hole\\" refers to the same running gag about Stephen Maturin, Aubrey's friend and intrepid but without sealegs.Sharpe, a soldier, doesn't really belong at Trafalgar. But Cornwell contrives a plausible way to get him there, as Sharpe returns to Britain in 1805 to join a rifles regiment. The India books were fun but, after we've seen all those city walls stormed, all those rajahs plundered, and all those hideous Oriental tortures meted out, it's time to move on. Putting Sharpe on a ship, with its backstays and quarterdecks and scuppers pouring blood during battle, is a fine change of pace.Cornwell's battle detail is typically gripping. And in this book Sharpe finds a romance that, one senses, may be more fateful than those he's had in previous books."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Trafalgar (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #4)","review":"I was somewhat disappointed in this book. I always look forward eagerly to another in the Sharpe series, but this one was not one of Cornwell's better efforts, in my opinion. Still worth reading for we diehard Sharpe fans, however.Sharpe is on board ship and gets involved with a married woman. She and her husband are gentry but of course, she falls for Sharpe's good looks and rough demeanor. I found this a little hard to believe, especially taking place aboard ship with little opportunity for quiet and intimate meetings to develop the relationship. In the end, Sharpe has to handle the complications of keeping his affair a secret, and oh yes, the Battle of Trafalgar intervenes. Actually, the battle scene is handled well as is typical for Cornwell.Possibly I was disappointed with this book because I was reading the Richard Woodman &quot;Nathaniel Drinkwater&quot; naval warfare series around the same time. Maybe the naval setting was not the best milieu for Sharpe's (and Cornwell's) abilities. If you haven't tried the Sharpe books, I highly recommend you pick up _Sharpe's Rifles_ without delay."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Trafalgar (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #4)","review":"Sharpe's Trafalgar is a recent addition to the Sharpe saga although one of the earliest in chronology. While I had seen some of the Sharpe movies on TV, Sharpe's Trafalgar was my introduction to the books. As much of the action occurs at sea, it is has a quite different setting than the other works. Fortunately, the novel works well in the tradition of novels pioneered by C.S. Forester.Sharpe's Trafalgar begins with Sharpe making friends with a Captain of a third rate Royal Navy ship. Rating refers to the number of guns as the captain and crew are first rate. Sharpe books passage back to India on a commercial vessel and after some chicanery participates in a sea chase around the Cape of Good Hope and up the Atlantic, arriving at Cape Trafalgar on October 21, 1806. On board there are intrigues but it all takes a back seat to the Battle of Trafalgar.Cornwell has done a good job of writing a novel of wooden ships and iron men. Unlike the heroes of Forester, Woodman or Kent, his Sharpe has no official standing in the ship although we know that Sharpe won't miss out on any of the action when it comes. However, by establishing a friendship with the captain we are privy to much of the inner workings of the ship. Cornwell also provided a sketch of a typical ship so that a reader unschooled in naval literature will understand where everything is. The sailing details are minimal but I get bored with reading about the t'gallants being let out or the royals being reefed. If a reader found O'Brian impassible then Sharpe's Trafalgar might be a welcome introduction to the genre.Cornwell also does a superb job of describing the Battle of Trafalgar. Unlike the most notable writers of the genre Cornwell does not describe a naval battle in elegant terms. Essentially naval warfare is like a vicious, bloody street fight in which the two fighters get in close and kick, gouge and bite until one falls. The kicking of the downed fighter only stops when it is sure he will no longer get up. Trafalgar is brutal savage butchery and Cornwell excels in blood and gore.While Sharpe is the hero of the novel, not all of his actions are justifiable. Some of his actions are totally inappropriate and totally unacceptable even under the circumstances. Perhaps that's part of the interest in the series is that the hero doesn't always do the right thing. Paradoxically, I had the most sympathy for one of the villains when he gave his traditional- I'm gonna kill you and here's why- speech. The man made some good points. However, Sharpe's Trafalgar is a novel where the good guys wear white hats and the bad guys wear black, so to speak. Having a hero who does some unconscionable things and a villain who has some legitimate motivation for his evil, make it a little more interesting.One thing that Cornwell communicates very well is Nelson's charisma. Sharpe's Trafalgar has the best presentation of Nelson of any novel of the era that I have read. Not only does he present Nelson's power to the reader but he also shows how the Royal Navy would follow him without question. The brief passages that include Nelson are almost inspiring and certainly very inspired.Although Cornwell does not typically write in the hearts of oak genre, he could. Perhaps Sharpe won't go back to sea but let's hope that Cornwell's pen does."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Trafalgar (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #4)","review":"In chronological order, Sharpe's Trafalgar is the fourth book in the series. You could also think of it as an out-of-sequence book because it has little to do with the stories about Richard Sharpe as a soldier. In fact, unless you want to read a little about what it was like to be at the Battle of Trafalgar, you could skip this book and not miss anything important in the way of character development. Unlike the India books where Sharpe was continually fighting off deadly threats to his life, Sharpe is more concerned here with sneaking around with a married woman, a remote cousin of Sir Arthur Wellesley, Lady Grace Hale.The Napoleonic Wars were fought in Europe. Naturally, Sharpe has to leave India if he is to appear to save the day in all of those amazing battles on the continent. Naturally, he's going to pass by Trafalgar. Why not write a book about the battle and have Sharpe stumble into it? That's clear the thought process behind this book.As a result, you end up with a lot of plot \\"development\\" that is sort of filler before the main battle. Having never studied the sea battle, I found that the explanations were interesting and the story helped make the technology and strategy easier to understand. Had this been a novella that focused on the last third of this book, I probably would have graded the book as a five-star effort.The ins and outs of avoiding being swindled by ship chandlers, East India ship captains, and common seamen didn't seem all that interesting to me. The romantic side of the book wasn't too credible to me and didn't add much to my enjoyment of the story. If you think Bernard Cornwell's novels about Sharpe lack enough of a love interest, then you'll probably like this book a lot better than I did.The writing is quite good in comparing naval battles with the kind of fortress breaching that Sharpe engaged in during the three books in India. I don't recall reading another novel from this era that made those comparisons quite so explicit and interesting.By contrast, some of the dialogue is particularly bad. In fact, Cornwell makes fun of his own dialogue by putting words into the mouths of characters who don't agree that every ship's captain is a \\"fine fellow.\\"The unforgettable part of the book is the characterization of Lord Nelson who led his sailors to such a remarkable victory that day.Fire!"},{"Title":"Sharpe's Trafalgar (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #4)","review":"Bernard Cornwell is a historian first and storywriter second, at both he is superb. Trafalgar is possibly the most famous naval battle in British history and it just so happens to fit in with the Sharpe timeline. Naturally as a historian Cornwell would want to put Sharpe in this position and am glad he did. I found this book to amazingly interesting. The account of the naval battle is both detailed and gripping. He recounts the events with such accuracy its amazing how he made it seem so interesting and not just a report from a history book.The book has all the ingredients that make the Sharpe series so great, you just have to read it to love it.I give this book 4 stars, and it's well deserved."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Trafalgar (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #4)","review":"Yes, Cornwell has to jump through some literary and historical accuracy hoops to get Sharpe -- confirmed landlubber extrordinaire -- to Trafalgar, but, here, it just plain works. After a few preliminaries, Cornwell uses the heart of the book to tell the story of Trafalgar through the eyes of the redoubtable Ensign Sharpe. Yes, Sharpe gets more tail than your average movie star . . . and, yes, some traditional British cliches are present -- the nasty sneering aristocrat, and so forth, but Cornwell's sheer story-telling ability makes it one of the finest (along with Waterloo) Sharpe novels yet. The final hundred pages, even though the feature ships are fictional, tell the story of the great naval battle in more readable style -- while getting all the important details correct -- than any non-fiction book I've yet encountered. As the afterword teases, our hero must march again. If I can kick in my two cents, I'd suggest sending an aging Col. Sharpe to help the Greeks win their independence from the infidel Turks. All in all, a great read."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Trafalgar (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #4)","review":"Readers following Sharpe's exploits in chronological order will by now be familiar with the formulaic nature of these books. There is a climactic battle, a new girl, a troublesome villain and Sharpe finally prevails on all fronts. It never fails to be exciting and is always a lot of fun. This book is no different. The challenge, though, was to place Sharpe, a soldier on land, at the great sea Battle of Trafalgar. Well, Sharpe is now going home to England after three books of Indian adventures, and sure enough, he finds himself on a ship involved in the battle. Along the way he also comes face to face with Nelson. The improbable series of coincidences apart, what makes the book noteworthy is the comparison of sea battle to land battles, as seen through the eyes of a soldier. The shipboard routine will be familiar to readers of the Aubrey-Maturin series by Patrick O'Brian and certainly this book reads like one of those. I am a big fan of O'Brian and being familiar with naval cannon from his books have always been puzzled by the puny cannon used by the land forces of the Sharpe novels. In this book the point is driven home that a single line-of-battle ship in Nelson's fleet carried more guns than entire land armies laying siege to forts in India, and these were much larger guns by far. This is all the more amazing to modern readers when we consider the frail wooden nature of these sailing ships. Here then, is an illustrative example of true naval power.The book is historically accurate. Readers interested in an eyewitness account of the Battle of Trafalgar should try Tom Pocock's non-fiction \`Trafalgar: An Eyewitness History' released in 2005 for the bicentennial of the battle."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Trafalgar (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #4)","review":"Bernard Cornwell continues his incredible adventures of Richard Sharpe. With the series having explored nearly every aspect of the Napoleanic period in which the British were invovled, the author is running out of historical chronology in which to insert his main character.Cornwell has been re-tracking Sharpe's career ever since he finished the Peninsular War and Waterloo. Its a credit to the author's genius that he manages to make it work, but the lengths at which he must go in order to do so are getting a little thin now. With this book Cornwell devles into Patrick O'Brien terrority with Royal Navy nautical lore. He seems to have the nautical jargon down pretty good, although this land-lubber wouldn't really know if he was off or not!All the ingredients of the Sharp series are here. Some stawart companions, arrogant aristos who always want to bring Sharpe low, treacherous characters who are not what they appear, and a lovely lady of the blue blood who falls for Sharpe's manliness! We have seen this all many times before in the earlier series, but Cornwell still somehow makes it work! The plot moves along with the usual on the edge page-turner writing and after the slow build-up we explode onto the carnage and horror of Trafalgar where Sharpe gets to meet Nelson first hand and compare him to Wellsley!The battle scenes are Cornwell's forte and the blood, sweat and tears of Trafalgar become vivd before the reader's eyes. The carnage among the Franco-Spanish fleet was truly horrible and even through the British suffered much less severely, the stress and strain of the battle was no less for them. Cornwell describes this very well, even though Sharpe's penchant for killing continues to stack the body count in his favor. In the wholes series Sharpe has probably killed close to several thousand people! A bit unbelieveable perhaps, but Cornwell's supurb action writing still manages to hold it all together. Next stop, Denmark and the 95th Rifles! After that, Sharpe series shouid get a much needed rest."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Trafalgar (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #4)","review":"I dont enjoy reading books out of historical sequence, and I think BC struggles to find Sharpes Sea legs on this one - still a great read but not as enjoyable as the land based Sharpe's with his riflemen. I think BC tried too hard to simply get the Battle of Trafalgar as one of the stories in his series. But if you are a BC fan you will still enjoy."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Trafalgar (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #4)","review":"Although I am a fan of Mr Cornwall and have read almost all his books and own the entire Sharpe Series,I did not enjoy this book. Cornwall is one of my favorite authors but I was disapointed. Instead of the normal two three or more battles in a Sharpe book, there was one. The battle although good was not spectacular, I have read better in books by CS Forester, Dewey Lambdin, and Alexander Kent. Too much of the book was devoted to Sharpe's romance with a high born lady. The book in general was just not up to Cornwall's usual excellant standards. In conclusion I say boo."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Trafalgar (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #4)","review":"Sad to say Cornwell is losing his touch. He's still trying to get as much money out of the &quot;Sharpe&quot; character as possible. To do this, he puts Sharpe in just about every battle of the Napoleanic Wars. If you've read the previous Sharpe books, or watched the films, you'll be disappointed with this book. There are even some rumors that Sharpe will see action at New Orleans in 1815 (Sharpe's 'Gator) which is a MAJOR stretch. What next Mr. Cornwell; Sharpe Goes to the Alamo ? If you MUST read this one, check it out at your local library, but I don't recommend buying it."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Trafalgar (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #4)","review":"This is another entry on the Sharpe series. It is fun, entertaining and very readable. Cornwell's research is as excellent as usual. He takes some licenses for the shake of the story and continuity, but this is OK. Some people are outraged by the portrait of some of the real historical characters, but historical characters are rarely depicted accurately in historical fiction, so I think this can be forgiven. Besides, usually a more serious account of these characters is given at the end of the book on the Historical Note.Many people insist in compare this series with Patrick O'Brian's Master and Commander. I don't think this is fair for any of the series, they are different entities. What they have in common is that once you start you may get hooked and devour one book after another...And in the literary world today that is a rare and marvelous thing."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Trafalgar (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #4)","review":"Really enjoyed this as I do all of Bernard Cornwells books, Sharpe is on board ship and gets involved with a married woman. She and her husband are gentry but of course, she falls for Sharpe's good looks and rough demeanor. I found this a little hard to believe, especially taking place aboard ship with little opportunity for quiet and intimate meetings to develop the relationship. In the end, Sharpe has to handle the complications of keeping his affair a secret, and oh yes, the Battle of Trafalgar intervenes. Actually, the battle scene is handled well as is typical for Cornwell."},{"Title":"Sharpe's Trafalgar (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #4)","review":"The best series I've ever read - can't wait for the next book"}]`),G={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:x},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:A,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(s=>setTimeout(s,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},S={class:"card-container"},M=["disabled"],H={key:0},P={key:1};function B(s,a,n,c,r,i){const u=g("PoemCard");return e(),t("section",null,[a[1]||(a[1]=o("div",{class:"top-banner"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),o("div",S,[(e(!0),t(f,null,y(i.visiblePoems,(h,m)=>(e(),w(u,{key:m,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(e(),t("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:a[0]||(a[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(e(),t("span",P,"Loading...")):(e(),t("span",H,"See more"))],8,M)):p("",!0)])}const D=d(G,[["render",B],["__scopeId","data-v-3857aa34"]]),j=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"guide/60.md","filePath":"guide/60.md"}'),W={name:"guide/60.md"},q=Object.assign(W,{setup(s){return(a,n)=>(e(),t("div",null,[b(D)]))}});export{j as __pageData,q as default};
