The reader is left wondering where just where did all of these event happen? Second, the text is too obviously derived from lectures, in that it often repeats and reasserts points that the reader has likely accepted several chapters ago. This makes for dull reading.

A wonderful book to feed and encourage the soul of anyone on a spiritual journey."},{"Title":"Run to the Mountain: The Story of a Vocation (The Journals of Thomas Merton, Volume One 1939-1941)","review":"A good friend of mine sent me all seven volumes of Merton's journals. It was a gift of immeasurable worth and value. I will no doubt still be reading through these wonderful books for years to come.Having just finished the first volume, \\"Run to the Mountain,\\" I stand in awe of the sheer depth and scope of the life we've each been given. The life presented here, that of Thomas Merton, is remarkable in many ways. \\"Run to the Mountain\\" is the chronicle of the years when he started instructing English in college up to his entry at the Trappist monastery in Gethsemani Kentucky.Beyond the external events of his times (the late thirties and forties) lies the bigger story of Merton's eternal destiny. Not since my own salvation have I encountered a story which so clearly illustrates God's pursuing love and grace. The reader can palpably feel Merton being called by God in these pages.It is quite tempting to imagine what might have become of Merton had he not heeded his call. These pages (and most of his later works) make clear his incredible power as a writer. It is not hard to imagine that he would have become at least as, if not more famous than Jack Kerouac, his fellow student at Columbia. It is one of the great \\"what ifs\\" (and there are several) of Merton's life.It is a great thing to be able to read about Thomas Merton's journey--to see him be changed and opened. It is an even greater privilege to take his thoughts and words with me on my own journey. This is one gift I am trully grateful for. Get this book.

Written so near to his death when all is still clear in one's mind, I feel this gives the book the edge over some others that I have read claiming to be the life story. As an example, we all understand that Bruce hurt his back badly at one point in his life and it is common knowledge that he was laid up for many weeks/months. What is not clear is not is how this came about - some stories say that he got in a fight and was kicked in the back whilst others say that he had bad muscle spasms around his spine causing pressure on nerves etc which grew to be too much. However, in this book Linda states that she found him in agony in the gym (and this rings true from personal experiences with students) on the floor unable to move due to attempting to deadlift (stiff legged) a 200 lb barbell - which if he could achieve would enable him to stand up even if a grown man had got him in a head lock or similar. This all rings true to me and makes the other stories less believable.

However, he also would have meant a giant who has, almost three centuries later, become almost an unknown within the history of astronomy. In _The Transit of Venus: The Brief, Brilliant Life of Jeremiah Horrocks, Father of British Astronomy_ (Weidenfeld & Nicolson), Peter Aughton, who has written before on the voyages of Captain Cook and on Newton, puts Horrocks into his rightful place. It would be too much to say that he gives us a full picture of Horrocks and his work, for the mass of materials about the astronomer is just too meager. However, Horrocks was a brilliant astronomical observer and theoretician, and Newton knew it then as we should now.There was in June 2004 a transit of Venus, only the fifth since Horrocks watched his in 1639. A transit occurs when Venus seems to cross the face of the Sun, and was important in those days because it could be used to calculate how far the Sun was from the Earth. He studied Kepler's work at college in Cambridge, and trusted Kepler, but not blindly; he discovered that Kepler, who had correctly predicted a 1631 transit of Venus, had mistakenly missed a transit that was coming in 1639. Horrocks only realized this with a month to spare, but he was ready to trace the planet crossing the Sun; he did so by training his telescope on the Sun and projecting the picture upon a screen within a darkened room. It was his mathematical analysis of the movements and timing of what he had seen that enabled him to confirm that Venus was moving in an elliptical orbit around the Sun, just as Kepler's laws had implied. However, a clear view of the planet crossing the solar disk showed it to be much smaller than Kepler had thought, and the calculated distance between the Earth and the Sun was far larger than any previous astronomer had come close to considering. Copernicus had estimated the distance to be 7.5 million kilometers, Kepler 22.1, and Horrocks weighed in with 95.4. Even then, he was well below the real figure of 149, but it can be said without exaggeration that he was the first man who had an inkling of how big the solar system really was.Horrocks wrote up his account of the transit, and also went on to show that the Moon tracked an elliptical, not circular, path around the Earth, although the path of the Moon wobbled irregularly due to the gravity of the Sun. He also showed that Saturn and Jupiter were vastly larger than the Earth. Astonishingly, he made these discoveries when he was only twenty-two; only a year later in 1641 he was dead. There is no evidence about the cause of his death. His account of his researches was not published until 1662, and he was belatedly recognized as a genius by the new Royal Society. His work was revolutionary at the time he did it, but was not as influential as it could have been, if he had been within the mainstream of British science rather than observing and theorizing near Liverpool, if he had lived longer, and if Britain were not torn by its Civil War. Newton, in his monumental _Principia_, gave special credit to Horrocks for divining the elliptical orbit of the Moon. His influence might be small, but his importance as an observer and as a theoretician (those qualities are not often so well combined in one person) is clear. As much as can be known about him is in Aughton's necessarily brief but admiring review, from which readers will get a good idea of how astronomy was done at the time, and a welcome introduction to an original thinker."},{"Title":"The Transit of Venus: The Brief, Brilliant Life of Jeremiah Horrocks, Father of British Astronomy","review":"This is an interesting, if frustrating book. Mr. Aughton does yeoman work in compiling and organizing a great deal of historical and genealogical information and presents his story in a workmanlike, even occasionally a fascinating manner.Like most casual students of the history of astronomy, I was aware of Jeremiah Horrocks as the first person to observe a transit of Venus, but I knew little of the brief life and fascinating times or Mr. Horrocks. I am most grateful to Mr. Aughton for making the details of Horrock's life and times accessible to a more general audience. Nonetheless, the deficiencies are distracting and annoying.The frustration arises from numerous factual errors and misconceptions that riddle this otherwise delightful book. Let me cite some of the more egregious and indisputable errors. First, in his description of Galileo's \\"Dialogue\\", he states that the book is a dialogue \\"between\\" Aristotle, Ptolemy and Copernicus, when in fact the characters are named Salviati, Sagredo and Simplicio, who represent the viewpoints of the Copernican, an intelligent layman and the traditionalists, respectively.Next, he consistently and repeatedly attributes planetary parallax to the rotation of the earth. He seems confused by Ptolemy's accurate account of diurnal lunar parallax and planetary parallax. See, Figure 7, for instance. Actually, during one night the earth's orbital motion (as opposed to rotational) motion is more than 30 million kilometers, while rotation adds fewer than a paltry 13 thousand additional kilometers. In principle, with perfect angular measurements, one could tease out the effect of earth's rotation, but he does not convey any sense of this. And Horrocks measurements were nowhere nearly good enough to furnish a reasonable value of the astronomical unit.One last egregious example, near Figure 11, discussing the time of sunrise and sunset near the December solstice will suffice. Mr. Aughton attributes the fact that sunset occurs earlier in the day shortly after the solstice than on the day of solstice to the eccentricity of the earth's orbit. The sun would, in fact, set early in the day in the days prior to the solstice, and rise later in the day afterwards, even if the earth's orbit were perfectly circular, though the precise values would be different.Aside from these indisputable factual errors, Mr. Aughton seems to be spreading popular misconceptions about the history of astronomy, misconceptions that every serious historian of science should resist. Foremost is the dismissive summary of the Galileo-Vatican controversy. One would never suspect from this summary that Pope Urban had read the manuscript of \\"Dialogues\\" and had personally asked his friend Galileo a few reasonable questions about the treatment of tides. Galileo told the Pope that he would fix it in the final version. His \\"fix\\" was to have the Pope's questions place in the mouth of the doltish character Simplicio, only to have them dismissively swatted aside by the all-wise Salviati. When Galileo's enemies used the Inquisition to attack him, his former friend, Urban VIII, was not there to help him. It is an embarrassment to supporters of Galileo, that the Pope's question was reasonable and Galileo's response was not. An explanation of the tides would have to await Newton, for alas, Horrocks died too young.In addition, he states that Copernican astronomy was \\"simpler\\" and more accurate than Ptolemaic. Tell that to Horrocks, who was quite dismissive of Lansberg, a Copernican. Actually, Copernican astronomy was more complicated than Ptolemaic, in that it required more, not fewer, epicycles and lead to more laborious calculations. Copernicus could not likely have been more accurate than Ptolemy, since he used Ptolemy's observations and predictions as a starting point. Today, we would describe Copernicus' work as a translation of coordinates, and not necessarily to a more useful set of coordinates.Mr. Aughton's writing is pedestrian, but his subject is transcendent. Mr. Aughton certainly conveys enough of the story to keep one reading, especially if one is interested in the history of astronomy. I live in Massachusetts, and I found the links between Cambridge University and the Puritan founders of the Commonwealth especially interesting. He certainly conveys the anguish and waste of the religious wars in England at the start of the 17th Century.If you are interested in the history of astronomy, and in one of its little visited and under appreciated heroes, do read this book."},{"Title":"The Transit of Venus: The Brief, Brilliant Life of Jeremiah Horrocks, Father of British Astronomy","review":"The accomplishments of Jeremiah Horrocks, as depicted in this book, are truly astounding. The author carefully reconstructs Horrocks' genealogy, his brief life and his ground-breaking work in astronomy, amidst the backdrop of seventeenth century England. The book is well-written, clear and engaging. Less appealing to me was that the book contains many passages reproduced in the original old English. This slowed me down a bit since I found them cumbersome due to the different spelling and sentence structure characteristic of the period. On the other hand, this may be inevitable, at least to some degree, because of the book's subject matter. Overall, this is an interesting read that would likely be particularly appealing to astronomers at all levels."},{"Title":"The Transit of Venus: The Brief, Brilliant Life of Jeremiah Horrocks, Father of British Astronomy","review":"Since the dawn of history, every civilization has seen men who studied the skies. In Europe and Asia, astronomers existed in Babylon, Egypt, India and China. In America, the Incas and Aztecs built pyramids and temples which showed knowledge and fascination with the sun, moon, and stars in the night sky. England had Stonehenge.There's not much factual knowledge about Jeremiah Horrocks shortlife; there has been only one other biography to surface, published in 1859 by A. B. Whatton. Photographs show the area and places he lived as he moved about. Born in May, 1618, he was only fourteen years old when he entered Cambridge on July 5, 1632. Just seven years later (1639), he was knowledgeable about the solar system and his observation of the primitive set-up he used in Carr House to view a rare celestial event, the \\"transit of Venus\\" was documented. It is similar to the way we are encouraged to watch the eclipse of the sun so as not to be blinded by the strong rays. He died in 1641.The Royal Greenwith Observatory was founded in 1675; John Flamsteed was appointed as the first Astronomer Royal. However, Jeremiah Horrock is known as the \\"Father of British Astronomy. This book was released to coincide with the June, 2004, viewing of Venus moving across the face of the sun (for only the fifth time since the 1639 occurrence: about every 73 years or so).My son Geoffrey earned his PhD in Astronomy at the University of Chicago and learned how to handle the monster telescopes at Kitt Peak as a grad student way out there in Arizona.Peter Aughton has written ENDEAVOR, RESOLUTION, and NEWTON'S APPLE. He teaches at the University of the West of England and a Fellow of the Institute for Math. In 1970s he was involved with the Concorde supersonic airliner.

Basic concepts and procedures are discussed ranging from the role of experiment, probability, and statistics to the nature and structure of hypothesis and theory. Appropos of that topic, I thought I'd discuss somemore concepts related to that here. Specifically, I recently came across a discussion of the &quot;structure of science&quot; and how that differs from pseudoscience and non-science activities. But just exactly what does &quot;structure&quot; mean in regard to science?First of all, the word 'structure' is much too general and doesn't really mean much by itself. However, if we take it to mean the actual structure and nature of theory building in a particular discipline and also the scientific method actually employed, we are getting somewhere, as even the physical sciences differ more than one might think, even in regard to something as seemingly basic as scientific methodology, and we can contrast and compare them with regard to these two requirements very easily.But in order to determine and compare their differences, we will need a couple of basic definitions. First, what is science and what is scientific method? A good starting position is that science is a combination of at least two things--the hypothetico-deductive method combined with some sort of empirical validation. Notice I say &quot;empirical&quot; and not &quot;experimental,&quot; since this will come up later. A stronger definition would require some form of experimental validation, such as what occurs in experimental physics and experimental psychology. A good basic definition of the experimental method is that it consists of systematic variation under controlled conditions in order to determine causal relationships. So a scientific discipline could be said to be one that meets these two criteria. So far so good.The problem with this definition, although it is almost universally accepted, is that even among the physical sciences, there are interesting exceptions. For example, take the science of planetary astronomy. No-one can start and stop the planets in their orbits to make experiments, and yet no-one doubts astronomy is a science, because it can make predictions about eclipses down to the second that are valid, and yet planetary astronomy seems to lack one important aspect of science. Hence, astronomy is an empirical rather than an experimental discipline. But it's still considered a science since it produces models that make very accurate and verifiable predictions about reality, and there is no better test of a science that its ability to make accurate predictions on the basis of observations. (Also, anybody who thinks planetary astronomy isn't a real science should try picking up a textbook on something known as Lagrangian Mechanics).This implies that a better definition of science is the ability to make and validate predictions. This is not a bad idea, and is basically the definition of a theory. There is a lot of confusion about what a theory is in science, but if you keep that one criterion in mind, you can't go far wrong. Occasionally you will see it said that theories differ from hypotheses in being more complex and broader in scope, but although this might be true sometimes, this isn't a really a true distinction between hypothesis and theory. The only real difference between a theory and a hypothesis is that a theory has been tested more times and has more experimental validation, and so greater confidence is therefore placed in it.But getting back to the our discussion of comparative differences in theory construction and method, we run into further problems when we come to the historical sciences, which include disciplines such as historical geology, many areas of psychology, and many areas of biology. But first, we need a definition of historical versus non-historical science. A good definition is that sciences like physics and chemistry are concerned with phenomena controlled by presumably universal natural systems that are non-historical, that is, independent of the time at which they operate. However, biological organisms and even the earth itself are historical entities whose characteristics may change through time, and whose workings may depend on historical laws that are not unchangeable and invariant, as in physics. This is the difference between historical and non-historical science.So now let's consider the situation in historical geology. Instead of the deductive prediction of future events from known, present causes, it turns the scientifc method on its head to become inductive inference of ancient causes from their historical results. Hence, historical geology doesn't appear to be a science in the usual sense, and yet nobody doubts that it is indeed a real science, because, well, basically because it works, and no-one is too worried about its rather strange logic and methology.I could go on further about this, but this is a pretty long review already and will do for a basic discussion of the topic of how several of the sciences differ in regard to their theoretical structures and scientific methods. There is another distinction one could make, say, between the mathematical sciences and statistical sciences because there we find differences in a science's ability to connect causes and effects reliably, with the difference being one of deterministic versus probabilistic causation, but as this is already a longer review than I intended, as I said, I will stop here. I hope you found my little discussion of the nature of theory and structure in science useful."},{"Title":"Mel Bay's Celtic Encyclopedia: Mandolin Edition","review":"Great mandolin reference for those who like Celtic music on the mandolin.

Despite the challenges that they encountered, this steadfast foundation never waivered. The previous reviewer somehow missed the most poignant message of their story. Racism is the ever present snake in the garden. As recounted in Shirlee's first book, The Sweeter the Juice, the issue of color and race in America is a powerful destroyer of families. However, Shirlee and Harold have managed not to succomb to the bitterness that bigotry and hatred can breed, but have built a life together and contributed to the greater good of sociey, reflecting their love for each other.

They have struggled and perservered. I especially enjoyed Harold's story and &quot;getting to know him&quot;.

I was not disappointed. I could hardly put it down. My family teased me because I was so enthralled with the book I tried to stand at the stove and cook and read it simultaneously. Needless to say their meals suffered somewhat. I thoroughly enjoyed this book because it showed a couple really committed to their marriage vows. They loved and supported each other through thick and thin, good times and bad times. Harold has stayed in love with his wife for forty years and has always remained faithful to her. Shirlee kept loving her husband and believing in him even when his jobs did not always work out. She always thought about what was best for her husband and the children when she made decisions. I enjoyed seeing their commitment to each other. They did not paint themselves as perfect to the reader either. They honestly admitted their faults and shortcomings. They had their share of problems with job changes, raising their daughters, dealing with their extended family, and having to deal with racism. But I admired how Shirlee and Harold could communiate with each other and talk things through. Harold seemed to really listen to his wife and respect her opinion. Being the daughter of a prominent Baptist minister, Shirlee relied on her faith throughout the years to to get her through the hard times. It was a good lesson for me to see her strength and grace in facing challenges. It did not matter to me that they were well educated, were upper middle class, and were part of the so-called &quot;black bourgeois.&quot; What really captivated me was the committed love they had for each other, their family and friends. I will cherish this book and let it serve as an inspiration and guide to me in my marriage."},{"Title":"In the Garden of Our Dreams: Memoirs of a Marriage","review":"This is a wonderful story about two people who meet, fall in love and marry. But the story does not end there. It is not a fairy tale. The authors share their story of life, love, hardships and experience during their marriage.I like the way the book is written in alternate turns of the wife's voice, then the husband's voice. As the adage goes, &quot;There are two sides to the story.&quot; I enjoyed reading each spouse's version. If you've ever wondered what goes on in a successful marriage, this book provides you with one couple's story.Fafa Demasio"},{"Title":"In the Garden of Our Dreams: Memoirs of a Marriage","review":"When I first heard about this book I was skeptical. What on earth could these two people - two black people - tell me about marriage. The book offered no titilating sex and no violence. It was all about love. Loving yourself, your spouse, your family and life. The Haizlips have had an incredible life together. Charmed may be a better word to describe their marriage. What I liked most about the book was the message: life is what you make it. I found myself rethinking about a lot of times when I have complained about little things; not appreciated people I loved, and have been afraid to take risks. As we all know, love and marriage are risky, but it was such a pleasure to read about a couple who willingly dived right in and showed me just what a marriage could and should be."},{"Title":"In the Garden of Our Dreams: Memoirs of a Marriage","review":"A fascinating read! Shirley and Harold helped us relive the past half century, but through the eyes of two engaging, literate, and thoughtful black Americans. We delightedly compared their courtship and marriage with our own. They lived through and raised children during the same searing events of our era, with the privileges of the well-educated, but the soul and conscience of those still trying to find a place at the table. The book makes you laugh, cry, and think deeply about the path forward for this remarkable country we are part of."},{"Title":"In the Garden of Our Dreams: Memoirs of a Marriage","review":"I picked this book up at a sale, not really knowing what it was about. The topic was compelling, I was really hooked (and saddened at times) on the description of the lives of a intelligent, accomplished couple of color from the late 1950s to present. I enjoy reading autobiographies, I feel that the writing in this book could have been presented in a more interesting manner. It was hard for me to be sympathetic with their money troubles as I felt was expected, given the frequent descriptions of expensive clothing, jewelry, antiques and travel. Not to diminished the personal details provided in the autobiography, still overalll I finished reading the In the Garden of Our Dreams feeling as though the authors needed a bit of cash so they came up with this book. I do plan to read Shirlee Taylor Haizlip's The Sweeter the Juice, I expect to find it a similarly compelling read."},{"Title":"In the Garden of Our Dreams: Memoirs of a Marriage","review":"This is the story of two people who found love and friendship and strength in their life together.

It details their life together in a realistic way, drawing the reader into the story with historic references, detailed portraits of key characters, and an intimate look at Black society on all sides of the tracks. The authors pique and maintain the reader's interest by telling the story in two voices. Most importantly, they show that it is possible to have it all--love, family and career--in the framework of a committed marriage."},{"Title":"In the Garden of Our Dreams: Memoirs of a Marriage","review":"I work at a women's organization where Shirlee Taylor-Haizlip is Scholarship Chairman, and I can say from personal experience that the Haizlips are not &quot;kidding&quot; anybody. The joke is on one of the previous reviewers, who discerned &quot;interracial&quot; from 306 pages of wit, candor and history. The Haizlips are as inspirational as their novel. They are gracious, genuine and clearly devoted to one another.I related to many aspects of their story, but also learned from its historical context. Above all, I simply enjoyed it. I laughed, and nearly cried, out loud. Read the book and you will want to share it.

It is obvious within seconds of picking up this book why the author had to use pay to publish crap peddler, iUniverse to get this trash on the market.When I came across this book I was looking for something to use as a supplement to McGee & Stuckey's The Bountiful Container. I wanted a book that would get more in depth into building organic soil and using organic pest control and fertilizers. I was also hoping for more than three (well known to most gardeners) suggestions as to which companies would carry good organic seed and product selections. What I got instead was a lesson in internet book buying (check the publisher first).Logan's book contains very little information that can't be found in the average gardening book. She does almost nothing to address the specific issues relating to container gardening and organic gardening. She addresses the issue of organic gardening in a lecturing tone by constantly pushing why organic is best, but barely touching on how to garden organically. Her section on pest control dedicates an entire page to a photo of her dog, yet doesn't give any information on how to identify different pests or how to create organic solutions. The few solutions that are mentioned are simply glanced over as though the reader already knows what they are and how to prepare them. The fertilizing section is similar in that she lists a few organic fertilizers, but doesn't make it clear how or in what potencies they should be used.The information contained within this book is limited and basic. The formatting is clearly designed to maximize the amount of space the information can be spread into. The author clearly uses the same tricks high school students use to spread a three page paper into five pages. The primary section of this book takes up only sixty four pages (twenty of which are dedicated to poorly taken full page black and white photos), the majority of which is dedicated to lecturing on the evils of chemicals and very basic gardening information. The remaining forty or so pages are dedicated to a glossary that could fit into half that if each letter wasn't started on a separate page. Ultimately, if the author were to use a normal font size and less spacing between sections, the entire book could probably be fit into less than fifty pages. By removing the filler, the portions of this book relevant and useful to organic container gardening could be fit into a pamphlet.I've learned my lesson. Don't waste your $12. If you want a book that addresses container gardening well (and contains at least as much information about organics) get McGee & Stuckey's The Bountiful Container. When purchased through Amazon it even costs less than this waste of paper."},{"Title":"Hell and Hazard, or William Crockford Versus the Gentlemen of England","review":"From the dustjacket of the book:There are today a number of aristocratic families in England who still suffer from losses sustained by their ancestors at the hands of William Crockford, father of modern bookmaking. Crockford, born in squalor near Temple Bar in 1775, was endowed with an amazing ability to calculate odds more accurately and shrewdly than his fellows. In fact, he soon amassed enough money to open gambling halls all over London.In 1828, he opened Crockford's Club, in the heart of Mayfair. Its members were the cream of Society; its cuisine the best in Europe. And behind this facade of respectability, Crockford accumulated a huge personal fortune and beggared half the aristocracy of England.This is the complete and sordid story of one of the first men to understand what has become basic to most successful forms of vice: that to succeed, vice must be engaged in luxury."},{"Title":"War of Our Fathers: Relics of the Pacific Battlefields","review":"Richard Marin has captured, in a most compelling fashion, extraordinary images of strange relics from this incredible war. I was lucky enough to get a copy of the first edition of this book and it was sold out before I could buy others as gifts.As a photography book, it is great! Most images are infrared and render these abandoned instruments of war an other-worldly quality. The book also includes portraits of various people who fought in the war and who describe what happened at the various areas photographed. Each image is superb! As a history book, it is great! Each section of the book presents a short narrative about the geographical area photographed, why it was important to the various armed forces' strategy during the war, what ultimately happened in the area, and includes beautiful maps showing the reader exactly where the images were taken.But, forget the photography and the history, and the book remains an unbelievable accomplishment!!! Mr. Marin takes us to the other side of the world -- to places we have never been, and probably will never be. It is staggering to consider what Mr. Marin must have gone through to locate these sites, photograph them, find people who fought there, interview these people, and to tell a story about each.For those of us too young to have participated in the war, it provides us with a concrete visual record of the real relics from the war. Because of Mr. Marin's incredible photography, these still images have more impact that any hollywood reenactment of action and blood and guts. The instruments of war photographed here remain blemishes on the earth to this day! It is staggering. For people who participated in the war, I am sure this book has even greater impact.Buy this book -- and then buy another copy and spread the word!"},{"Title":"War of Our Fathers: Relics of the Pacific Battlefields","review":"I agree completely with the previous review.

I would love it more if the author concentrates more on the main characters but there's no rule that states a book has to be about just a couple. The fact that the pair has a common interest and that they eloped when they were young and they're still attracted to people who share their talents and interest is very interesting. A good read one that gives you another view of the glorifying main characters."},{"Title":"Your Wicked Ways","review":"In all the years I've read books, ordered books, paged through books, browsed libraries I have never found anything like this.I ordered A WILD PURSUIT & YOUR WICKED WAYS by author Eloise James. Had not read an Eloise James book but decided to check them out. Two books arrived quickly, I was in bed with a very BAD COLD. Opened both books, checked publication date so I could read them in order as they are part of a series with the same characters. Copyright dates both 2004.Started reading 'Your Wicked Ways' and immediately did not like it. The story was confusing with all the references to characters that had not been introduced yet. A titled husband living for years in his London mansion with his musically talented mistress installed in his wife's suite while the she the heroine, his Countess, lived with her aunt. I finished the book but did not like it. The next day I picked up the second book in the series 'A Wild Pursuit' but still in bed with cold, hoped 'A Wild Pursuit' would have a better story and was, desperate for something new to read. As I started reading the first page I finally figured out that I had two copies of the same book (Your Wicked Ways) with two different covers and titles. The 'A Wild Pursuit' cover contained the 'Your Wicked Ways' story.This author is cranking out several titles very quickly, still how could such a mistake happen and how many other books with the wrong title and cover are out there. I was going to tell this all to Amazon.com and get a refund, now I think I will put the books up for sale on EBAY in the 'oddities' category.I rate this book at a generous two stars and will not buy another by this author. She can write, but the plot and content are not romantic and were often sad I thought. The parts about composing music were fascinating. There may be a market for this type of romance book but it does not belong in the English Regency period category. And it does not in any way 'bring to mind the best of Amanda Quick and Judith McNaught' as one inside cover blurb gushes. This book is more reflective of morals and behavior of the 21st century decked out in 17th century costume. It is unnerving to not be able to tell which book you are reading by the cover. And it is irritating to buy English Regency romances and get something quite different."},{"Title":"Your Wicked Ways","review":"This is not your average romance. The characters are well-rounded, real people who I rooted for all the way thru, the process of falling in love is real and dramatic, and the sex is so hot it singed my fingers. I've never read Eloisa James before, but I understand this is the fourth in a series and I can't wait to read the others. She's a great writer who delivers the goods! Buy this book!"},{"Title":"Your Wicked Ways","review":"I enjoyed this book for exactly some of the same reasons other reviewers disliked it. It had a very fresh premise and it kept me turning the pages because I honestly didn't know what was going to happen next. Helene starts out as a very sympathetic character and I felt that Rees was going to end up that way. Eloisa James never disappoints. Her lovely prose has such a ring of authenticity that you almost feel as if her characters and their situations could have really existed in Regency England. A fabulous read!"},{"Title":"Your Wicked Ways","review":"In this Regancy Romance, a husband & wife get along so badly that they have lived literally separate lives for years--in different houses. The wife approaches her husband saying she wants a divorce and a child. The husband says no way, he doesn't like her enough to go through the expense of divorcing her and encourages her to find a lover/potential husband with the guts to front the divorce costs & political maneuvering for her.When the wife calls his bluf and starts to do just that, the husband's personality totally changes. His new policy is \\"move in with me or I'll ruin your life\\" plus a healthy dose of \\"have sex with me to get pregnant\\" and \\"you'll play 2nd fiddle to my mistress, who will be living with us\\". Blech.On top of the repulsive and inconsistent plot, both husband and wife are 100% unlikable. Avoid this turkey."},{"Title":"Your Wicked Ways","review":"One of the things I like about Eloisa James is the fact that her plots are generally more multifaceted than many romance stories out there. I also thought this plot, an estranged husband-wife coming together to \\"sire an heir\\", was more novel than most romances. The story was generally a good read, but James seems to have gotten lost in some of the details, dropping areas of the storyline that could have been more developed. I think the relationship between Helene and her husband, Rees, could have been fleshed out more. There were aspects of the plot such as the orphan Meggin, that seemed unnecessary as they did not further the plot or character development. At several points in the books, I stopped due to frustration from the fact that I couldn't tell where James was going with the story. Sometimes that is good, and I'm surprised by the twist. However, with this story, I left feeling frustrated.The novel isn't bad, and I would happily read it again, but James has done much better in her other books. All of the elements were there for a much stronger story, I guess that is why I'm slightly disappointed."},{"Title":"Your Wicked Ways","review":"I can see there are mixed reviews about this book, but I have to say I loved it. I Loved the unfurling of the romance between Rees and Helene, learning how they had made mistakes previously but came together through their love of music. I loved the romance between Tom and Lani which added a little additional electricity to the book. And I loved finding out about Esme, whose romance has threaded through all the books in this series. A great end to a great series."},{"Title":"Your Wicked Ways","review":"Lovely!!! Buy the whole series. It's the only true way to enjoy it. Buy them all if for no other reason to understand Esme. You won't regret it."},{"Title":"Your Wicked Ways","review":"The last of the DUCHESS IN LOVE sequels is the story of Helene and her estranged husband Rees, Earl of Godwin. Helene desperately wants a child but given the fact that she and her husband have lived apart for years, she has no hope of conceiving one. She decides to brave scandal and ask Rees for a divorce - which he flatly refuses to give her. She then decides that she'll just take a lover and get her child that way - serve Rees right! She basically gets a makeover, cutting her hair and dressing more fashionably and daringly the better to lure a potential lover. And attract men she does - most particularly the Earl of Mayne who becomes infatuated with the new Helene. But Rees discovers what she's up to and thwarts her plans by stating that if she wants a child, she'll have to have it with him. They agree to a secret one-month reunion in order to make a baby. What an eventful month it is!We also meet Rees' estranged brother Tom (notice how Rees is estranged from everyone in his life?) who happens to be a vicar, and Rees' mistress Lina, an opera singer whose only real remaining appeal for opera composer Rees is her voice (they stopped being lovers months ago). Lina is not a \\"fallen woman\\" per se. She truly fell in love with Rees (he fell in love with her voice) but has become disenchanted with him and now has nowhere else to go. Besides, Rees has promised her the lead in his new opera so she continues to live in his house. But we can see the budding attraction between Tom and Lina. While Tom and Lina are sweet and likable characters, I have to say that Rees just may be the most selfish leading man I have ever read! What's weird is that I found myself liking him a bit anyway - just as everyone in his life does! He occasionally displayed that \\"little boy lost\\" quality, though I think the author could have made him a bit more likeable. He's a lousy lover who has never learned how to give a woman pleasure in bed (the reason that his marriage to Helene fell apart). But when he and Helene reunite for baby-making purposes he does try to make it good for her to avoid the mistakes of their first times together - and he does improve as the story progresses! But I can imagine that many readers will find no redeeming qualities in Rees and that's a shame and a big fault with this story. He never really acknowledges the changes in Helene, though I suppose you are supposed to get that he has loved her for herself all along? Anyway, I think you get the gist of how this ends but not until the epilogue do we finally see the kinder, gentler, less self-involved Rees. Though not a great book, I enjoyed it despite the failings of Rees' character. One question, though: What happened to Carola? I thought all four of the friends would make an appearance in this last DIL sequel and was a bit surprised that she was not even mentioned.I have a feeling that we will be seeing the Earl of Mayne (one of Helene's suitors) in a story of his own someday. His character received quite a bit of development for a secondary player. If so, I look forward to it because he was really sexy!"},{"Title":"Your Wicked Ways","review":"In 1806 Helene and Rees Holland eloped in what seemed like a love match. However, something went wrong and a decade later they live apart with Helene wanting a divorce so that she can marry someone else. She has no suitor, but desperately wants a child like all her friends. She asks Rees one more time to free her and he refuses but offers her a stipulation that if she finds a man willing to stand by her side in court he will grant her wish.An angry Helene decides scandal is her solution. She will find a lover to impregnate her. At a ball she dresses as Cinderella and meets her Prince Charming. However her regal lover turns out to be her toad of a husband. Rees has known all along that he still loves his wife, but though he is a composer he has never told her his feelings as he feels she hates him. Now that he has finally returned to her bed, he plans to re-win her heart as he has tasted nectar for the second time, but Helene is a stubborn foe who has had a decade of neglect.Though the audience will wonder why the lead couple fails to communicate, Regency romance readers will take plenty of delight with this charming second chance at love tale. Helene is typical of sub-genre heroines while Rees is atypical as an artist whose works clutter everything and everywhere. He makes the tale fresh and worth reading as Helene has to decide whether she can live with his so-called wicked ways that include courtesans and Russian dance troupes, something she could not ten years ago.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Your Wicked Ways","review":"I pretty much hated this book. Rees was one of the most unappealing heroes ever created and Helene was Ugh! I couldn't stand either one of them. I felt they really deserved each other, as opposed to messing two other people up. I cringed when Helene got hooked up with Mayne. Now, he was delicious. I hope his story will be forthcoming. I actually liked the romance between Tom and Lina better than the main couple. I don't know what it was, but Rees and Helene just never triggered my imagination. From the description of Rees, I got a not very appealing image of him. I think what I really disliked about Helene were her friends. I am not an Esme fan. In fact, I think she is one of the worst female characters ever written. I like my heroines to have some principles and I don't think Esme has any. I try to never read anything with her in it, so I am sure that colored my impression of this book because she was a prominent figure in it. This is almost as bad as James' other book about sluts-- A Wild Pursuit. I hated that one, too."},{"Title":"Your Wicked Ways","review":"If you want a meal, you order Eloisa James. If all you can handle is a soft serve, there are plenty other options out there for you. Ms. James has a poet's gift with language, a satarist's voice and a Sex In the City appreciation of the physical aspects of a love affair. I LOVE Eloisa James. Please, please, please keep up the dynamite work!"},{"Title":"Your Wicked Ways","review":"I don't usually write reviews, but I was checking to see if Eloisa James had written any other books -- I adored this book! I didn't find anything lacking: it was a really sexy, funny book that sent me straight to the computer to see whether she'd written any that I haven't already bought--she hasn't :("},{"Title":"Your Wicked Ways","review":"Ms. James' books are usually quite fun, quite entertaining, and a lovely way to pass an afternoon or evening. This one wasn't nearly as bad as some reviewers see it, but it is not one of her best.First, it's clear from the start that neither party is innocent in the dismal state of affairs. Helene is under her mother and her upbrining's thumb, Rees his father. Neither character, from the hints and comments dropped, ever got over the other one but shielded themselves with what was expected of them to get through it. So, no, they weren't perfect, no they were sympathetic part of the time, but they were human and that is, sometimes, a nice change of pace.I didn't know if I'd enjoy these two when I got the book, but it was raining outside, so I made the plunge. I'm glad I did. I'm not sure I'd read it twice, but maybe three or four years from now, when it will be new and fresh, I'd like to give it another go. Mostly because Ms. James' does make her characters stand out on the page in this book. She does actually give the hero and heroine personalities, foibles, and interesting dark crannies so that the reader enjoys getting to know them.If you want characters that make no sense and have motivations that are only partially drawn, she has some other bad ones out there."},{"Title":"Your Wicked Ways","review":"The hero and heroine, both music geeks, married too young. Their emotional maturities were stunted so for the last ten years every thought or word about or to the other, based on that one horrific year they were together, is acrimonious. If you can believe it, these two had the least complicated story line in the series. For me, their story, like all the others, equates to their realizing they must cast off their childish ways and beliefs (see Corinthians 13) and embrace the responsibilities of adulthood. All's well that end's well is an apropos summary here. The author began her journey with this series almost ten years ago when scintillating sex in romance novels was in its heyday and complicated story lines rivaling Gone With the Wind had to be told in half the number of pages. It's been interesting to observe the trends in romance writing through the years. I hope the author reads these reviews and gets a kick out of them."},{"Title":"Your Wicked Ways","review":"I actually liked this book. What I enjoyed about it was that the hero and heroine were not perfect (how refreshing!) and they were both insecure about a lot of things...but when they spent time together and learned to know each other better as real people, not as their fantasy images of a husband and wife, they were able to grow close again and rekindle the love they started out with. It's clear (to me at least) they were always meant to be together, and that Rees's nastiness wasn't really his true nature - he's really much more traditional than the impression he likes to give; this idea is solidified especially when discussing Tom and Rees's father. I was able to forgive Rees's behavior because everyone has misunderstandings with their spouse or loved ones at some point. I do think that having your wife and mistress live in the same house is really terrible...but I think at that point Rees wasn't really sure how to make the situation work - I think he felt bad about kicking Lina out, and was still annoyed at Helene (she was a reminder of his inadequacy), so he allowed the wife and mistress set-up. I also enjoyed the musical part of this book, because I am a musician, an opera singer specifically, so it was cool to read about that (although Eloisa clearly isn't a musician, because she made one or two musical mistakes, but for a non-musician, that's still pretty good).I LIKED the characters of Rees, Helene, Tom, and Lina - I thought they were much nicer people than the rest of the characters in this series. I felt that any nastiness that occured was explainable, but many of the other characters just seemed plain mean, nasty and like they were part of a television soap opera. I can't stand Esme; I don't understand why Helene is friends with her. They seem incredibly different. Even Mayne, who I had read in the Essex sisters' series (which I read before this series) and liked, isn't quite right in this book - he's too nasty, and/or cares too much about Helene, which doesn't seem to fit with what I know of him in the Essex Sisters books. I don't think he is really in love with her, I just think his pride is hurt.I felt like I could actually relate to the four I mentioned before in some ways, so that's probably the main reason I liked the book.That said...this series is very weak on the whole (HATED A Wild Pursuit, especially). I thought James' Essex Sisters series was half-way decent (not fantastic) but better than this series. There are way too many subplots and unlikeable characters in these books. There's something good about Eloisa James that keeps me trying to find books of hers that I really like, but I haven't been successful so far. I don't know if I'll keep this one or not."},{"Title":"Your Wicked Ways","review":"The book I purchased was a paperback in almost new condition and it was received very fast."},{"Title":"Your Wicked Ways","review":"I read the book in two days, and it was an easy and entertaining reading. This is my third book by Eloisa James and I really enjoy that there is more than one story line in the book. If you read the previous two, you will get to see your favorite characters from the previous books. However, I also like the fact that the book is written so you can read it as a stand-alone as well.It is a little hard to belive that a \\"straight as arrow\\" lady as Helene Godwin is, would change that much and become all passionate and sexual. It really does not happen overnight, but it is a romance novel after all. We all are looking for something nice and exciting in books and Eloisa James delivers.Overall, without giving away the mail story line or lines, it is an easy and enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Your Wicked Ways","review":"Well, after reading so many reviews for the book and finding most of the reviewers not exactly liking it, I can truly understand. Still, I'd like to point the good stuffs of the book.I have to admit that Rees did not exactly beg for Helene's forgiveness in the way I'd like him to.. ( Like groveling..), he made it up by in my opinion the best he could give. He's a musician, and people of arts don't really care of other people's feelings. Still, he made an effort to give her words that on other people, may find as nothing but Helene understood what he was trying to tell her and listened to her heart.The lacking bit is where there seems to be too much of romance between Rees's brother and his mistress. I skipped most of that part, choosing to read parts of Helene and Rees because despite what other people say, I think they truly are well-suited, the chemistry was indeed there and they understood each other more than they understood others.Okay, I didn't liked the part of them living estranged for TEN years, but recall that both of them weren't very happy living apart and Rees spent the the first month after Helene was gone, drowning in alcohol, and he DID told her in the end that 'he was in love with her' and 'that he never did enjoy all those rakehell days particularly the dancers on his dining table'.Recall also, that he was madly jealous to catch Helene with The Earl of Mayne ( was that his name? I'm not sure..), murderous enough and the fact that he refused to divorce her may held a deeper meaning than reputation. Like, love??Helene was desperate to have a child, and that was the reason she agreed to his proposal. She did add conditions though, that bedding his mistress is strictly prohibited during her stay there and that it would only be for a month.The epilogue was also one of the best ending I've ever read. They were comfortable with each other, still shared their passion for music together by continuing to write songs on the piano and finding intimacy every oportunity even while sitting by a piano! So, overall I think this book was worth it and that readers should read and find deeper meaning in it.Buy it, cuz I think it's a keeper and a book that'll make you belief that God works in many ways and that it was a second chance in life."},{"Title":"Your Wicked Ways","review":"I have read every Eloisa James book and was really disappointed with A Wild Pursuit - but she has redeemed herself with Your Wicked Ways.

Now I am hoping her next book is about the Earl of Mayne."},{"Title":"Your Wicked Ways","review":"i have just read Your wicked ways by Eloisa James. I have to say i am very disappointed in this book. Actually it is one of the worst books i have read.The main character in the book has been estranged from her husband of 10 years. During that time she has been celibate while he has had an mistress and let the mistress sleep in their house in the heroine's chamber. (That alone is awful but it gets worse.)The heroine decides she wants a child, so she tries and find a stud. I have to say that she did find one, (one i actually liked). It seemed that he really cared for her maybe even loved her. But she decided to go and live with her husband again. The kicker is that she would live in the same house with him and the mistress and sleep in the nursery. WTH!!!!!!! The heroine actually went for that.I was like this woman has no self respect. Every character in this book thought she was crazy. And the husband had the gall to think this was all okay.Well the stud really liked her and was going to call her husband out for this. He said that no man should treat his wife like that. Do you know that the heroine at this point started to not like the stud because of this.!!!!!!! This book was pointlessNow for one of the worst turns in the book. The author tried to make the stud into a bad guy. He had done something to disaparge the heroine's reputation. He was supposed to be a cad for this. Who cares if the husband had the mistress in the house and the wife in the nursery. WTHThis was awful. The heroine was disgrace. The hero was a piece of trash. Are we suppose to like him? And he still did not atone for having the mistress in the house in their bed. If anyone else has read this book let me know. This has to be the worst of the year"},{"Title":"Your Wicked Ways","review":"In a rather strange way, &quot;Your Wicked Ways&quot; made for some rather compelling reading because of the enormous sympathy I had for the heroine, Helene, and because of the minor romance subplot involving the 'hero's' brother and his sometime mistress. However, a small word of warning: if you think that this is going to be the kind of romance novel where the heroine teaches her errant husband a much deserved lesson -- think again. Much as I found myself unable to put this novel down, I was really chagrined that far from making Rees pay for his past callousness, Helene actually apologizes quite a few times for being a quick tempered wife!Helene was barely seventeen when she met and fell in love with Rees, the Earl of Godwin. They eloped. But their marriage turned out to be a disaster mainly because Rees turned out to be an insensitive brute both in and out of the bedroom. Unable to cope with Helene's anger and disappointment, Rees threw her out; and husband and wife have been living apart for the past ten years -- him a life of dissolute debauchery, and she a life of chaste good behaviour. Now, however, things have become desperate for Helene. She wants to have a child, but Rees won't give he a divorce. And so with her friend's, Esme, encouragement and support, Helene decides to shed her nun-like ways in order to snare herself a lover. But when Rees learns of what she's up to, he makes (or threatens rather) an unexpected offer: he will father the child she so desperately wants if she will come back home. After a decade to bitter humiliation at her husband's hands, can Helene trust the man to keep his word?While many readers may find &quot;His Wicked Ways&quot; disappointing, I did think that Eloisa James was successful in accomplishing what she set out to do (I think). I believe that the authour wanted to show how a heroine could still be attracted to and care for the hero, even if he is an insensitive boor. It was apparent that Helene still had feelings for Rees, feelings that readily came to the fore once they were living together again and working on his opera. And I think that the authour also wanted to do something slightly different be showing us that not all romance heroes are masters of lovemaking, and I did think that it was nice to see that this second time around, Rees was much more sensitive to giving Helene pleasure. Unfortunately, these two factors were not enough to counter the things that made me cringe. Like the fact that Rees was an insensitive clod for much of the book -- and not only towards Helene, but also his 'mistress' and his brother. (By the way I rather liked the romance that developed between the mistress and the brother -- it was romantic and actually quite thrilling). His refusal to give Helene a divorce, his shameful proposal that Helene live with him and his mistress in the same house while Helene was trying to conceive, and his absolute refusal to see his faults, were a real put-off. Ms James does try to soften Rees by implying that his bad childhood was at the root of much of his insensitive behaviour; but since she didn't really go into this very much, it was hard to forgive Rees his insensitivity and root for Helene and him to have their happily ever-after ending. Also, Rees didn't really grovel enough for my liking. In fact Helene did far too much apologizing for her part in why things went wrong between them in my book. So is &quot;His Wicked Ways&quot; a worthwhile read? I found it difficult to put the book down -- full of sympathy for Helene, I had to keep on reading to see what else Rees would do/demand of her, and how it would all end. So that in that sense, the book was a compelling and well written read. But I was truly put off by the 'hero's' behaviour and by Helene's meek acquiescence to the demands he places on her. So that on the whole I'd vote it a 3 star read."},{"Title":"Your Wicked Ways","review":"Helene Godwin has been living apart from her husband for over nine years, ostensibly because of physical incompatibility. She believes herself to be frigid and unappealing to men, since her husband had found her insufficient and replaced her with opera dancers and mistresses.However, all of her friends are having children, and Helene sees her biological clock ticking away. When her husband refuses to give her a divorce, she decides to have an affair. Her friends help make over her wardrobe and her makeup, and sure enough, at the next ball, she draws men like flies. Including her selfish jerk of a husband, who decides that if she's that determined to have a child, it might as well be his, since it will be his heir.Amazingly, in all these years, the selfish jerk has still not learned how to satisfy a woman. And he has the nerve to insist that Helene move back to their home for a month while they are trying to conceive a child. . . as long as she occupies the nursery, because the master bedchamber is already occupied by his longtime mistress!Why would anyone with any dignity accept these terms? I have to admit that this situation spoiled the rest of the book for me. Although the author tried to ameliorate Rees' character by explaining that he was a virgin when they were first married and that he really wasn't all that crazy about his mistress (who, by the way, wasn't REALLY a doxy after all, despite the fact that she had lived with him as his lover for several years), it wasn't convincing.Come on. This guy sounds like a politician I knew once. Hardly a romantic hero. Don't waste your time with this one."},{"Title":"Your Wicked Ways","review":"I was looking forward to this book having read the previous ones in this series however, it was a disappointment. Rees is just awful and his character didn't get any better. Helene gave in to him at every point. For a woman who lived apart from her husband for 10 years, you would think she would have developed some backbone and maybe a brain to go in her head. The entire premise was faulty and not in the least romantic. The idea of having a mistress esconced in the house with his wife as romantic would require me to suspend my brain from functioning. Although well written, the plotline and characters leaves much to be desired! I truly hoped and expected a better book from Ms. James!"},{"Title":"Your Wicked Ways","review":"I wish i could give it no stars. This book made me cry in frustration. I literally threw it against the wall and tore it up. It does indeed start well with a promising premise, but the moment the heroine starts to come into her own (and meet a great new guy) the jerk of a husband returns. Make no mistake, he is a jerk. Self -centered, inconsiderate, mean, and downright cruel at times to Helene. I couldn't fathom why she would want to be with him. I don't want to give the plot away for anyone who wants to read it but he treats her in a way that no woman should be treated and she takes it! She just goes along with every stupid demand he makes on her. It was surprising that a woman who could stand to be away from him for 10 years would give in so easily.All of the secondary characters are fascinating. And although I tore the book up in frustration, I would like to read other books by this author. But don't read this one if you have any self respect."},{"Title":"Your Wicked Ways","review":"When I read a romance novel I prefer the hero to have honor and integrity. The qualities that Rees did not possess. Considering that he cheated on his wife and put her into degrading positions such as forcing her to live with his mistress. What really disgusted me was how accepting Helene was of Rees's behaviour and even took the blame for it. If she have had any self-respect she would have stood up to him. All in all the story was shallow and meaningless. I was not convinced that the Rees loved Helence or even knows the meaning of love."},{"Title":"Your Wicked Ways","review":"Having read Eloisa James' last book &quot;A Wild Pursuit&quot; and finding it thoroughly lacking, I was a bit skeptical about this one. The story is about Helene, Countess Godwin, and her estranged husband Rees. She wants a divorce, he doesn't, she changes her mind and now wants a baby, he agrees only if she moves in with him. While the scenes between Rees and Helene were intriguing, Eloisa James left me wanting more; I found myself skipping the pages that did not involve them (and believe me, there were a few).All in all, &quot;Your Wicked Ways&quot; was a good romance, I could feel the chemistry between the two protaganists, and I would have given this book a full 5 stars if only the author had concentrated more on them and less on Helene's friends."},{"Title":"Your Wicked Ways","review":"I thought this book had a lot of great potiental, but in the end it just did not live up to what I have come to expect from Eloisa James. This book was so predictable that I had to really push to finish it. I found that Helene was not all that wicked after all; more like dimwitted and Rees was just a spoiled, out of control, baby that really needed a swift kick in the butt more than he needed Helene. I was very disappointed that Helene, who is supposed to be this head strong woman would move back in with Rees while his mistress still lived there! That showed a lack of good judgement that any really head strong woman would never of had. I was not impressed with how easy it was to put Rees and Helene back together as a couple with all the other things that Rees was doing in the story showing that he had not changed at all. I gave this story a 3 stars for the subplots that it had, because if Rees's brother was not part of the plot then I do not know that I could have finished this book. I hope with future books Eloisa James goes back to writing with her usual flare for romance and humor."},{"Title":"Your Wicked Ways","review":"I am so sorry I bought this book, The heroine has no back bone and let's her horrible husband walk all over her, He made his wife live in the same house as his mistress and had the nerve to make his wife sleep in the nursery while his mistress slept in the master bedroom! When I read this I knew the book could not be redeemed, no woman would ever put up with this no matter how much she wanted a child. If you want to read about a dumb heroine with no personality and a stupid hero with no decency who when combined have no passion between them, then this book is for you, But if you enjoy reading good romance novels, please skip this."},{"Title":"Your Wicked Ways","review":"Forget the extremes of characterization and give this book four stars if only for its daring premise: the hero is not an accomplished lover, and the heroine is not unknowingly sensual or alluring-- at least until she is transformed as a result of a temper tantrum. Any admirer of this genre will soon surmise that all the males in romance fiction are masterful and considerate lovers. Makes the average female wish she might have been born in another era. True, these English males are prone to make stupid mistakes because they fail to communicate at some dramatic juncture, and thereby hangs the suspense of the tale.This is a nice read because it goes against the grain. This hero is clueless about what women want from a man. The heroine is much more in line with the stereotyped female of her era--clueless about sex and love between men and women, though she does have female friendships down pretty solid.The funniest quirk of the book is, it begins with letters dated in March 1816 and ends, presumably a year (or 3?) later, with letters dated January 1816. Editors slipped up there. This, however, is not critical to the plot, which constitutes a mild summer suntan read. If your budget is tight, get it used and enjoy!"},{"Title":"Your Wicked Ways","review":"I wish I could give a no-star rating. This is one of the absolute worst male lead characters I've ever read. Rees is abusive, vicious, selfish and cruel. The heroine is weak and rather pathetic. Even keeping in mind the time period, this relationship is deeply unhealthy and abusive.I've enjoyed other books by this author but this was a complete failure."},{"Title":"Your Wicked Ways","review":"Ok, I read so many reviews talking about the wife and mistress together theme. This book is not about that. Yes, the wife comes to the house with the mistress in residence, but the mistress is not really a mistress anymore but more like a house companion to the lonely husband. First of all, they have not had sex for a long time, and the mistress is the first to admit that the husband was never truly interested in her in the first place, he have had relations with her simply because he liked her voice and she was available for the rest of it.The husband admits to be a juvenile for most of his days, and after his wife left him for 10 years, would you really expect a man to live without sexual intercourse for more than 10 years? Specially when the said wife gave no reason for leaving in the first place? Come on people, it is unrealistic even in romance.Anyways, this book is not about perfect man and perfect woman falling in love, it is about two people who married too young and innocent in the first place to have a chance at making it, but they did love each other, so much so, that such love lasted them enough time to grow up and find any excuses possible to get back together and see if they could make it work. It is about imperfect people giving themselves and their relationship another try after maturity has come to them.The thing that may be a bit confusing to some is that this underlying chance they give each other is not spelled out, but found unexpectedly by them, and where it hit them by surprise. The husband and wife do not realize that they are actually in a learning process of what it means to compromise and rediscover oneself, they simply realize they need to work together for a purpose, but the realization of the love they have felt for one another all this years comes unexpectedly to them. This is a couple that works through their insecurities and compromises, but told in a witty and funny dialogue and like a comedy more than a serious manner. It exposes what happens when couples don't communicate what they feel, and instead spend their days assuming what the other feels instead of simply sitting down and talking like adults. How many couples do you know that have broken up and think the worst of each other simply because they assume what the other is about instead of having an open and unguarded conversation? i know many divorces that come because of it. This story is precisely about that.Eloisa James is a writter that moves you along in a story through funny dialogue and situations of comedy, while at the same time giving you a hidden and deeper meaning to human relationships. This is not a tragedy or serious novel, this is a comedy romance that makes you think about real human relationships and how to handle hard situations with a more optimistic attitude. It is certainly not for teens, or people who want a classic tragedy-romance with alpha male and perfect female, it is for people who want to learn about real human relationships in a funny and entertaining way.At the end, read it and make your own conclusions, if nothing else, you will laugh a lot."},{"Title":"Your Wicked Ways","review":"Eloisa James is one of those authors (for me, at least) who is either hit or miss -- most often miss. Bored one evening, I decided to give this novel a shot (hey, why not?). It was a mistake. I won't bother summarizing the story since so many previous reviewers have already done that. Instead, I'll *try* to justify one \\"good point\\" that the novel might have had.True, the heroine was insufferably weak-willed, and the \\"hero\\" more of a bastard-boor than a dashing lord. However, the m&eacute;nage &agrave; trois between the earl, the countess, and the mistress was surprisingly...evocative of the Duke and Duchess of Devonshire's marriage at the turn of the 18th century. So if that was what James alluded to (albeit comically), then props for her. If not, well, there's not much saving grace left to say for this book."},{"Title":"Your Wicked Ways","review":"Gosh, almost didn't get this book after reading some of the reviews but am glad I ignored them. JMO, but if one reads this book in the spirit intended it is a lot of fun & quite charming. The characters are well drawn and the dialog very funny. Don't get why folks were critical of this story -- of course it's probably improbable, it's a romance novel...just enjoy it."},{"Title":"Your Wicked Ways","review":"Now, this was not fun! The charm found in Ms. James' \\"Wild Pursuit\\" was missing from this sequel. Although the book was a pleasant read, the enchanting jealousy and the incredible lust found in the parent book wasn't found in these pages.This is a story about beginnings, a second chance at love for two pathetic people. Helene Holland wants to get on with her life, she wants a divorce from Rees Holland, the miserable man she married many years ago. But more important, Helene wants a life filled a child. Helene wants a baby. However, she must conceive a child before the divorce, to avoid a beastly scandal.Over afternoon tea, Helene and her lady friends draw up the plans for the fertilization. Helene needs a donor, someone she can entice to her bed. Dumbfounded by his wife's plans, Rees decides to provide his services -- but at a cost. Rees Holland will supply the much needed assistance, if Helene will assist him with his project - a mediocre opera. Yet incredibly, this deplorable man is not finished with his demands. If Helene truly wants a baby, she must live in his home and coexist with his mistress. What an idea!With such a farcical storyline, why did I rate the book 3 Stars and not something lower? Because the author pens a good subplot working with Rees' mistress and his brother, Tom. Their scenes together are the highlight of the book. I enjoyed seeing Lina, the story's soiled dove, achieve a happy ending. A shame Eloisa James did not devote \\"Your Wicked Ways\\" thoroughly to this couple.Eloisa James can entertain her reader. Her writing style is smooth and humorous, and her characters have unique interests, but the trick to a good page turner is delivering a satisfying story. The Rees and Helene story is too empty.Grace Atkinson, Ontario - Canada."},{"Title":"Your Wicked Ways","review":"What to say about this book - Well I have read the other reviews and Rees is a bit unappealing and Helen is so unsure of her self because of the damage Rees has caused in the past. But having said all that I found I liked this book. It goes against all that I believe in when reading romance novels. I like rakes,(reformed) they must be tho. But Rees is not really a rake and if he was he was a horrible one.He asks Helen to move in with him. The wife he has spent years and years ignoring because she wants to have a child with someone else since he will not give her a divorce. So he ensures that he will father the child by bringing her to his home with his mistress living there also. But during this story Helen changes - her hair, her dresses, her personality and with favorable results. And boy does Rees like those changes. So much so that he can't fail to stop thinking about his wife.There relationship changes over the course of this book. Rees and Helen both realize things they said and did wrong. Maybe thats why I like this book was the discovery they made about themselves. If Rees would have cheated on Helen during this time or reverted back to his old ways it would have been disasterous but he did none of those things. Mid way through the book till the end he could not keep his eyes and hands off her. And there sexual discovery was just as important. He seems to really love Helen and her body when before he thought of her like a scarcrow. Well this hero does end up seeing the error of his ways.This book is not for everyone, but I did seem to enjoy it."},{"Title":"Your Wicked Ways","review":"If you're tired of the same old plots being recycled, this book is for you. The plot is unusual and so fun. And there is something so fresh and lively about James's writing style, it really keeps things moving along. The humor is great too! I hardly ever laugh out loud while reading, but with this one, you just have to. My favorite aspect of the book is the hero--who would ever think that a hero who starts off being bad in bed could end up being so sexy? I really encourage anyone who loves sexy, funny romances to give this a try. You won't be sorry!"},{"Title":"Your Wicked Ways","review":"I've read all the reviews here and have to disagree with a lot of them. I liked Rees and Helene. What spoiled the book was that EJ used such a plot to bring Helene back into the house. What self respecting woman would do such a thing? Even for a baby. I did not like the supposed love story with the brother and ex-mistress. I ask you would you like to spend the rest of your life in constant association with a woman when ever you saw her reminded you she slept with your husband? If this doesn't bother you then you will love this book and feel cheated their story was not the main focus of this book. Too bad EJ didn't use a different tack to bring out her H/H love for each other and maybe let Helene have a little fun making Rees jealous. Why must there always be a mistress in the background making the wife seem like an imbecile for staying with a hero that loves? her but fools around? On the whole I enjoyed the story( I just skipped the parts with Tom and Lina) I will read future books of EJ because I like her way of writting for most parts."},{"Title":"Your Wicked Ways","review":"Wow just when I think Eloisa James has done the best work she can do and that she'll never top herself she blows me away again. I loved everything about this book: the characters, the story, the writing, all of it. Rees was a fitting adversary for the very strong Helene which also made him the perfect love for her too. I couldn't wait to see how everything turned out and was up late reading several nights in a row. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Your Wicked Ways","review":"Helene Holland, Countess Godwin, has been living apart from her husband, notorious rakehell Rees Holland, for the past nine years. In the interim period, Rees lives in their home with his mistress and taints their family name with all manner of scandals. Rees' brother, Tom, has become a vicar in a nearby town. When Tom comes to visit and Rees makes Helene an offer she can't refuse, all sorts of mayhem ensues for this noble family.I found this novel more boring than anything I've read in awhile and only finished it because, at the time, there was nothing else to read at hand and the library was closed. Helene , has nothing to offer in the way of a romantic heroine besides constantly-shifting morals and a lack of virtue. I found it ridiculous that a woman of her stature would even consider living with her husband's mistress in the same house, yet alone with mistress having her bedroom. It was completely unacceptable and no amount of inner dialogue on James' part would make me think any different. Conversely, Rees Godwin had no love for anyone but himself and his music. It's ridiculous to even suggest that he could think of someone else when he invited his wife to live with him so that she can help him write his scores (try using your own talent to get ahead) and insists that his opera singer mistress stay so that she can sing what he's written (as though there are no other artists in the world. He even mentions himself that she isn't that wonderful a singer).Overall, James made a valiant effort and failed miserably. The subplot with Rees' brother the reverend falling in love with his mistress is laughable and never really gains any sort of momentum. I would not recommend this novel to anyone who enjoys Regency romance with strong plot as well as a couple to whom you can feel a sense of kinship. I was glad when the reading experience was over."},{"Title":"Your Wicked Ways","review":"Eloisa James has a witty style, but I find myself disappointed in this book. The fourth of a quartet, I was hoping for more zing in Rees and Helene. Ok, so I know from past books that Rees is an ass and Helene can be a touch judgemental, but here was a chance for them to shine.I agree with other reviews that the secondary romance of Rees' brother was much more interesting. I found that for all the build up, there was definitely something lacking in the final tale.Helene finally breaks loose from her shell, determined to have a child no matter what her ass of a husband thinks. He's had a bevy of women in his bed. Not to mention that he's installed his latest mistress in what are supposed to be HER chambers in the house they shared before their youthful marrige fell apart.What we have learned from encounters and hints in the past books is that Helene loved her husband and they ran off together, creating a scandal in their youth. But neither of them were happy about it afterwards. Apparently young Rees was quite bad in bed. Quite. (No wonder Helene was never tempted to stray.... She thought it was no good anyway.)After all her friends find love and start families, Helene decides to fight for her dream of having a child. She wants a divorce. Too bad Rees won't allow it. Too costly and scandalous. (Of course, this from a man with a mistress in his wife's chambers.)After Rees finds out she is determined to have a child no matter what, he decides he better take some action.What follows is not quite what I hoped. Instead of making him beg or work for her love again, Helene follows his dictates. Instead of experimenting with the power she has discovered she has over other men, she gives into his demands.Rees is not really a likeable man. I was hoping that with Helene coming out of her shell, she would be given a chance to test her wings. Maybe I was looking for redemption in Rees case.I give her a 3 only because I know she is capible of a better story. Eloisa James is clever, creative and witty. I look forward to more books from her. I'd say that this one is not the best one she's written, but I'm definitely waiting to read more from her."},{"Title":"Your Wicked Ways","review":"I was waiting for Rees and Helene's story but once I read it found that it just lacked....something. I was intrigued by the chemistry between Rees and Helene but was bothered by the romance between Rees's brother and Rees's mistress. I felt like Eliosa James spent too much time on that love story rather than devoting more of the time to Rees and Helene and that made the story somewhat lacking."},{"Title":"Your Wicked Ways","review":"I started this book not expecting much based upon other reviews. But having read Eloisa James' books before and thoroughly enjoyed them, I thought I'd take a chance.Once of the special things about Ms. James books is that her characters and plot lines are a little off the beaten path so to speak. That is to say, she just doesn't churn out the typical Regency Romance with the dashing hero, brave to a fault, devilshly handsome, sometime cad, master of the bedroom, need I go on.....? No, her characters have some flaws - not a lot of them thank God or they might be totally irredeemable, but enough to see them through the growth process in the story line.In this story, we have two very young people, Rees the Earl Godwin and Helene, who were initially drawn to each other for a variety of reasons, and run away to Gretna Green to get married. They both share a passion for music and believe this mutual interest plus their love will be all they need to make a good marriage. However, they soon discover that marriage takes more than a few songs and stolen kisses to make it work.For one thing, the wedding night left a good deal to be desired. Shy and uncertain about what to expect, Helene felt inadequate. Her husband, also leery of the night before him, stayed down in the tavern a little too long and arrived at their bedroom completely foxed. [The reader will not discover what caused this disasterous first night until later in the book when Helene and Rees finally confess their fears and disappointments about that night and learn that both of them had been virgins.] The marriage starts off badly, and leaves both mentally scarred about their respective inadequacies. Finally, in a fit of temper, Helene throws the chamber pot at her husband; and Rees, who has had enough of this unsatisfactory marriage, throws Helene out of his house. She then goes home to live with her mother, and for nine long years is virtuous and miserable. Though they stay married, Rees goes on to live the life of a supposed &quot;Rakehell&quot; breaking every taboo mostly to irritate his demanding father and miserable becasue he misses Helene.As the years pass Helene realizes that she would like to have a child. She asks Rees for a divorce and he refuses because of the damage that it could do to their reputations. After Helene receives a &quot;make over&quot; in her wardrobe to more sensually show off her lovely figure, and a completely new hairstyle that enhances her lovely face, Rees sees her in a whole new light. He decides that if she must have a child, it should be his; and after some length of discussion finally persuades her that she should move back into his home for a month until she conceives.From there the real romance begins, but not in your typical way. For one thing, Rees insists that Lina, his opera singer and former lover remain in his house so that she can practice his songs for the opera he is writing. This brings about some amusing and awkward moments between Helene and Lina.As Rees and Helene mature, each learn the pleasure of discovering who their lover really is. It is delightful to watch them grow together to finally understand that what brought them to each other initially could be built upon and transformed into a truly beautiful marriage of mind, body and spirit. (I don't mean to be cliche here, but that's how I saw the book. In one sense it sort of reminded me of &quot;Enchanted April&quot; as the characters who thought they knew all about each other found entirely new and attractive aspects to their loved ones - facets that they had never appreciated or understood fully before.)There is a secondary plot concerning Rees' brother Tom, the Vicar, who oddly enough falls deeply in love with Rees' former lover, Lina. It seems Lina has outgrown her relationship with Rees and hasn't been intimate with him for over a year. She and Tom, however, set the sparks flying whenever they're in the same room.I found this book to be delightful and a real change of pace from the usual Regency Romance. Although none of the characters has the sort of perfection that I also love in Regency heros - you know tall, dark, handsome men, too charming for their own good to hide their tortured souls because of some life altering event in their past..... Rees is nothing like this. Oh, he's a rebel alright, kind of a Regency &quot;Bad Boy.&quot; But it's fun to watch him grow in character, and of course, Helene is right there with him learning about herself and gaining self-confidence along the way.A great book with a lovely ending, and one I recommend to all."},{"Title":"Your Wicked Ways","review":"Eloisa - what were you thinking???? The hero was so revolting, but I kept reading thinking that something was going to be revealed that explained that it was all a pretense and that he had some positive qualities.....hmmm no such luck! He bumbled through having sex, accidentally discovering a \\"nipple\\" and surprised that touching it could produce pleasure ..... pleeeaaaseeeee! This book was so bad, that I think it will be a long time before I even consider, let alone read another Eloisa James. Pity, I had enjoyed some of her other books."},{"Title":"Your Wicked Ways","review":"This novel goes beyond many other books set in this period of this style. Rather than exploring the first bloom of love, it opens the door to a love that has been tried and failed in its first attempt.Helene is uptight and puritanical in her beliefs. Her husband is a rakehell. They haven't lived together in ten years. Helene desperately wants a child, but Rees will have nothing to do with her in marriage or in bed. She requests a divorce repeatedly and even attempts to have an affair. Rather than granting her the divorce, Rees comes up with a scheme to give her a child and get help with his musical that he has been struggling with.The reason I enjoyed this book so much is that the relationship between the two leads seemed real. Both had grown in their own ways (neither extremely positive) while they were apart, but neither had reached their full potential. Together, they can make positive changes and be happy, unlike when they were apart. I read the reviews complaining that Rees was abusive and Helene was a poor character for taking him back. I think they were both wounded by love (as we all are) and afraid to take chances. Rather than placing blame, enjoy the novel for the growing up the leads do and the love they find in each other. It is a novel of depth, rather than an easy read like many other books in this genre."},{"Title":"Your Wicked Ways","review":"I love historical romance, but find perfect sex (or marital harmony) between relative strangers to be jarringly unrealistic. Helene and Rees are immature virgins when they elope. Although they are actually very well matched, they make a mess of things because they don't have the wisdom or experience a good marriage requires.Helene is hyper-critical, and blames Rees for all her negative feelings instead of trying to figure out what's really going on. It is so enjoyable watching her learn how to be a true friend from Esmee, devote herself to using her musical talent, and discover that she is uniquely beautiful. Once she knows herself better, and goes after her priorities, her confidence soars. Then, she's ready to discover the pleasures of her body, and finally, fall in love with her husband on a much deeper level.Rees has no relationship skills, has not become his own man due to baggage from his father, and is realistically clueless on how to please a woman in bed. Add to this, his low self-esteem and tendency to shut out everything except his work, and he has a long way to go. I especially liked the reconnection with his brother, which helped Rees see that he is at heart a loyal, good man.As they became truer to themselves, they are better able to understand each other. Finally, Rees can see Helene as his precious, sexy, musically gifted wife, and Helene can see Rees as her rugged, hot, musically inspired husband. And they see themselves through the other's eyes, and it is good."},{"Title":"Your Wicked Ways","review":"This book was practically unreadable. For those who read the previous books in the series, the only interesting part of the story was the Earl of Mayne, whose story is apparently told in yet another series about 4 sisters. While Gina and Esme appear in the book, where is Carola? Poor Helene, she is desperate for a child. She has asked and asked her cheating, dirty husband for a divorce so she can have one with someone else. He refuses. She decides to have one anyway, obviously with a man not her husband as they have not lived together for 9 years. On page 192 of this book, Rees, Helene's cad of a husband, tells her, \\"If you have a child with Mayne, I will make its life a misery, I will divorce you. Did you know I keep your dowry in the event that we divorce? How will you raise your child?\\" He continues on, \\"As a divorce woman, you will have to live in the country. You will rent some small house someone. Your child will go to the parish school. If they allow bastards to attend.\\" And he goes on being even more cruel. When Helene asks why would you do such a cruel thing he answers, coolly, your are my wife and I want you in the house\\" In order for this book to work, there has to be some redeeming characteristics in Rees and after reading the entire book, there are none. Even after Mayne, in a fit of jealously, lets the cat of the bag about Rees, his mistress and Helene, where is Rees in defending his wife in a situation he made? The fact that he is not even brought into the picture to fix Mayne's gossip, well, that says much, does it not. They did not even bother include him as he is too much an ass to be of assistance. There was absolutely no accountably for Rees in the entire book regarding his actions and that is just wrong. While I know the author wrote the story based on women she knew who would do anything for a child, and even if the reader can get passed the absolute barbarity of Rees to accept Helene's desire for a child which meant she must give up any shred of dignity or self-respect, the fact that Rees was really did not realize how much a bastard he was, how frankly stupid Helene appears in taking him back with so little acknowledgement of the wrongs he put forward is just, well, dumb and makes the story fail. Why was Helene always apologizing anyway? This was not romance. It is an episode for Dr. Phil where he would tell Helene, get some confidence and find yourself a real man. This book puts women's intelligence back hundreds of years...."},{"Title":"Your Wicked Ways","review":"I was so dissappointed in this book.

In the Arab region, the jihad is the capital of the world where brothers go to help their fellow brothers and paradise is where all martyrs are destined as a reward for their jihad on earth. Cycles of hate and tunnel vision repeat an unending loop.A complexly engrossing work of fiction from a woman's perspective detailing the deepest emotions intertwined with ethical and intellectual comprehension, this tale pulls the reader smoothly into its field and subtly presents a mirror for one's own evaluations. Ticket to Paradise serves a paradox of this phrase in a delectably thought provoking and intriguing scenario as the panoramic drama unfolds and we watch spellbound the personal growth that springs from courage to embrace changing awareness.9/11 showed just how messy and complicated life on this planet of countries with differing faiths and cultures can be with the political arena and very personal responses of her citizens. In the face of supposed elevations of enlightenment, culture often ensnares its people in bigotry and racism precipitated from religious doctrine despite the great teachings of spiritually aware text.The riveting tale touches the heart and soul of passionate women of intellectual bent and presents a microcosm vs. macrocosm view of faith and cultural doctrine as we watch individuals and society come to grips with these facets, including the place of women and social facades. The bright and torn protagonist as a British star reporter stands on the brink of self-revelation in her personal evolution and mainstay choices which ultimately route the path of her and other's destinies. She must weed and eradicate unsuitable relationships, no matter how fascinating to find the strength to follow her newly developed beliefs into her own scope of conviction for her personal and romantic arenas as well as her world viewpoint. Interviewing her own integrity, colored by treks into Palestine and the Arab world as an investigative reporter of human import, leads her to distinguish between the definition of martyr and terrorist.Ridley's work exists as an outstanding source of political reality, choices, particular and firmly held beliefs and their consequences. A final twist leads the reader to feel a bit out of phase - and that is, of course, the first step to re-evaluation. One must face the fire and be true to the inner calling."},{"Title":"Ticket to Paradise","review":"After reading an article by Yvonne Ridley in Muslims Weekly I decided to warn you of her anti-American position."},{"Title":"The Pretext (Green Integer)","review":"This is ninth in the list of Rae Armantrout's books opposite the title page. Much seems familiar -- wry tact, a quick, glancing line, sly dreamlike stop-and-start narratives set in plain suburban circumstances -- but what seemed fresh and promising in 1978 feels indispensable now.

General audience or specialists? \\"Japanese Mandalas\\" has its cake and eats it too, for it is wonderfully written to appeal to both the curious beginner and the enthusiastic initiate. And as a book it is both a detailed and well thought-out discussion of Japan's amazingly complex diagrams of sacred geometry and geography as art objects--categories and types, materials and media, aesthetic value and cultural importance--AND a carefully-researched and thought-provoking exploration of their religious symbolism, ritual significance, and spiritual depth. The overall tone is also appropriately scholarly and objective without being reductive or dry and pedantic, and a precarious balance is deftly maintained between generality and specificity--and believe me, when it comes to mandalas it's easy to lose the forest for the trees and vice versa.The author aptly divides mandalas in Japan into three categories: Esoteric, Pure Land, and the Kami-Worshiping tradition (avoiding the anachronistic term \\"Shinto\\"). This includes the Taizokai and Kongokai Mandalas of Shingon and Tendai Buddhism as well as variants focusing on specific deities or sets of deities, works depicting Amida's Pure Land like the Taima Mandala, and sprawling landscapes depicting the Kasuga and Kumano Shrines and their complex weave of what might seem to us like disparate religious traditions. This in itself is impressive, but Grotenhuis also convincingly and counter-intuitively demonstrates how these three varieties are interrelated and even inter-referential. Highly innovative and insightful considerations of the Indian and Chinese antecedents for the mandalas are also given and elaborated with properly nuanced caution and reserve, and the author's freshly original look at concepts of sacred geography, social ranking, and city-planning in pre-Buddhist China as these inform the design and imagery of all three mandala types is eye-opening and very much as believable as it is unorthodox.The book is also profusely illustrated, as is of course warranted by the subject matter. The twenty-two color plates, besides being intrinsically beautiful, are clarity itself. The 104 black & white illustrations also get the job done for the most part. Yes, for the most part. That said, it must be remembered that many of these mandala are large, expansive works filled to the brim with a profusion of delicately fine details; most of them are also centuries-old and more or less worn down and abraded here and there if not everywhere. Reducing these in size is bad enough but a necessary evil, but then reproducing them in shades of gray sometimes makes it really hard to see what the heck's going on in the picture even if you have reasonably good eyesight and kind of already know what you're looking for (two assumptions the publishers shouldn't be taking for granted, at that). Then again, printing every illustration in color would shoot the price of this book through the roof, so it's hard to say what the solution is exactly. One way Grotenhuis gets around this problem is the inclusion of detailed close-ups, but she tends to make less and less use of these as we get to the shrine mandalas--and this is about where you'd want them the most, maddeningly enough. In a few cases one gets a guided tour of millimeter-sized dark gray blurs against a slightly darker gray background. Whew. Still, I don't want to make a mountain out of a molehill. In the final analysis this is an excellent book both textually and visually and it should greatly appeal and be of use to anyone interested in Japanese Religions, Asian Art History, and/or Iconography, Geometry and Geography in Sacred Art as a whole."},{"Title":"Japanese Mandalas: Representations of Sacred Geography","review":"Professor ten Grotenhuis' book deserves a wide audience. Anyone interested in religious art will be delighted to find images of exceptional beauty illustrating a readable yet authoritative introduction to the worlds of the Japanese mandala. Specialists will be equally delighted to find that ten Grotenhuis offers engaging, fruitful new ways of thinking about these pictures, for instance by placing Buddhist images in the context of pre-Buddhist Chinese texts."},{"Title":"Japanese Mandalas: Representations of Sacred Geography","review":"A beautiful and very well written and illustrated book.

I found the text too small and too long to be read by 7-year olds. The subject matter was at times questionable for youngsters of this age. This is not to say that the selections are worthless. There were a few classics and a few that I had never read but have grown to love. Still, out of 19 stories, I found just three that I would consider gems. One of those has a strong Christian message and is not appropriate for public school. Therefore, I don't feel this is the best set of stories to read to your child.Why 3 stars?:If you want an extensive library of stories to read to your child, then perhaps this could be an addition. However, you will need to screen everything first. Your child will have heard many, may be scared by some and bored by others. If I were you, I would leave this one at the bookstore.

The USSR was replete with \\"gods\\" but God was not allowed, nor His Book, nor His children... of all things, they choze the Bible to ban and Christians to kill. It is like Parents killing their children for being polite or kind. Anyway, she told me now she lives in sadness and often cries. She said America is fast becoming identical to the USSR from which she fled for her life. And I see a review of this book that says a \\"Christian\\" story makes a book unfit for Public Schools, schools who spent their first 200 years with the Bible and prayer and Christian Theology as their cornerstone and foundation.... even the writers of the US Constitution lived with Christian Public Schools and had NO objection. Here we have just another reiteration of a law from hell transforming America from the USA to the USSA. We send our children to die in wars we will not let them win while we adults do not even have the courage to demand that God not be censored in Public Schools. Jesus said we should let the little children come unto Him, and not forbid them, and if they are forbidden in Public Schools to come to Jesus then the schools should be eliminated or returned to their state as they were a hundred years ago. Who are these scoundrels and evil men and women forbidding Children to come to Jesus in Public Schools.. and where are the gallows high enough to give them their just reward? Why are we so cowardly before these evil people? A thousand hangings of one of these anti-Christian public school enforcement people would be kindness compared to the eternal punishment that awaits them... Jesus said, it would be better that a millstone be tied to their neck and that they be cast into the sea than to forbid Jesus from school... as I understand it. Alas, gutless and nonchristian politicians, lawyers, judges, and citizens do not travel the road to hell alone... they cart as many children with them as possible... and all the while congradulating themselves on their \\"holier than thou\\" tolerant \\"angel of light\\" status.

Comments describing Toni Morrison's poor grasp of the English language, the unorganized, sloppy writing style, and the characters' unbelievable motivations baffled me. And then there was the confused reader from Columbus, Ohio who believes the novel is about devil-worshipping. But what struck me the most was how many teenage readers didn't understand the novel. Guys, you're making us look bad! There is nothing in Beloved that an average reader should have difficulty with; anyone who abandons their expectations and opens their mind to the writing style will thoroughly enjoy such an engrossing novel. The writing style is not sloppy and unorganized, it was a carefully planned randomness, an attempt to imitate the way &quot;rememories&quot; surface in a person's mind. This is how the novel progresses--the characters recall memories in response to the slightest stimuli, thinking of the past daily the way we all do. And it is their pasts which become the characters' motivations in the present, guiding their actions and branching the plot into an ever-expanding chokecherry tree of intrigue. Does the novel wrap up all of its loose ends? No, it doesn't even come close, but that, once again, is a result of the experimental (and successful!) writing style. There is no true end, and no true beginning; like time and memories the novel is fluid. As Toni Morrison herself said, the past is infinite, as is the world of BELOVED."},{"Title":"Morrison's Beloved (Cliffs Notes)","review":"Beloved was one of the most outspoken novels I have read in my eighteen years of life.

It was perceived by the other people as real but only because Sethie had made it this way. When Halle comes to visit the house, this is where one of the core themes of the book starts. Sethie can live only with guilt of her lost child. She feels that she doesn't deserve the right to be truly free in life and for her children's sake. Halle becomes a &quot;Diversion&quot; so to speak. He becomes a symbol of freedom for Sethie. Sethie is able to feel love? She is able to vaguely forget or Disremember what has happend to her and condone Halle's love. Halle symbolizes freedom in this book and freedom comes to free Sethie's guilt from bereavement. The spirit appears in some sort of surrealistic form to relapse and plauge Sethie's guilt. Just read the book on my own and this is my own opinion or general jist of what the book was about.

After 10 or 12 lessons -- about an hour's worth -- I could string a few original sentences together in a pinch and I was starting to think in Spanish a little. I'm not doing it in a car so it is very noticable that the lessons build on a highway driving theme but you gotta start somewhere and highways are as good as any place. The pronunciations are academic, not like Spanish speakers really talk but isn't that always the way?"},{"Title":"Drive Time: Spanish (CD): Learn Spanish While You Drive (All-Audio Courses)","review":"This is James from James Spanish (the learning Spanish blog). Using audio courses while you drive is a great way to learn a language. The Drive Time series is presented completely on audio, with no accompanying textbook exercises to complete, so you can learn completely while behind the wheel. There is a handy reference book, however, which provides a written guide to everything covered in the audio course. As well as conversation, the CDs also cover some basic grammar, giving an all round understanding of the language.The CD audio course breaks in beginners gently, with easy and simple exercises to introduce new learners to the language and pronunciation before moving on to more complete lessons. In fact, the first CD in the course is called an \\"on ramp\\" and is specifically tailored to easing students into the learning experience before really moving on to the core material. This is a nice inclusion, and great for beginners or learners who have found themselves a bit intimidated by other courses that demand a high level of understanding from the get go. That said, the conversations are not translated every time, and a certain level of basic Spanish is expected in order for you to understand what is being said.The speed of speaking increases throughout the course too, naturally encouraging you to tune in to native speakers. For this reasons, this course is ideal for any student wanting to improve their conversational skills and comprehension. The course lessons steer clear of the repetition model used by many other courses, focusing instead on teaching you as you listen. One of the main complaints from Spanish students is that while they can understand the clearly spoken Spanish in their lessons, when they hear native speakers talking they get lost and cannot understand. This course deliberately avoids artificial speech patterns, making your ear tune in carefully to what is being said. The narrator speaks in a natural way, not pausing between words or over enunciating, so you can get used to listening to how native speakers talk.While you may want to pair this course with study materials that teach more vocabulary and grammar, this set of CDs is a great way to build on your conversational skills.In closing my review of this product, I'd like to share with you the three Amazon products that I have found most helpful in my pursuit to learn Spanish. If you are truly serious about achieving fluency, I'd recommend getting all 3 of them if you can afford it.1.Lights, Camera, Spanish (Book + DVD): Learn Conversational Spanish by Watching a Romantic AdventureThis is actually a 90 minute movie for Spanish-language learners. It gives the option to watch the movie with subtitles but I'd recommend not using them to improve your Spanish. This \\"movie\\" also includes a workbook so that you can reinforce the Spanish vocabulary words and phrases from the film. The workbook also has lots of exercises to keep you engaged in the film. But be prepared to hear Chilean accents. Although pleasent to the ear, the accents from Chile are very different from most Latin American accents.2.Verbarrator Version 1.1 (Windows Version)This software replaces the traditional verb conjugation books and makes learning how to conjugate Spanish verbs an interactive and fun activity. This should be a required resource for anyone who wants to improve their ability to conjugate Spanish verbs. Especially anyone who is challenged by the drudgery of learning how to conjugate Spanish verbs and who is looking for a new way to make learning how to conjugate Spanish verbs an easy and fun activity3.Diccionario esencial de la lengua espanola de la Real Academia Espanola (Spanish Edition)If you are really serious about speaking the language fluently, then at some point you will need to replace your Spanish-English dictionary and get a pure Spanish dictionary with both the vocabulary words and the definitions entirely in Spanish. I use this one only because it was highly-recommended by a friend from Spain who teaches Spanish. According to him, in academic circles in Spain as well as Latin America this Spanish dictionary is the standard."},{"Title":"Drive Time: Spanish (CD): Learn Spanish While You Drive (All-Audio Courses)","review":"Most people who reviewed this stating its great for beginners have probably only listened to the 1st CD. The first CD is a very steady and well paced introduction to Spanish. When I started the 2nd CD the pace of new words and spoken dialogue increases 10 fold. It give me no time to learn and rarely there is any repetition. The narrator changes between CD1 and CD2 and I have a feeling these CDs were designed as 2 different learning packages but for some reason other another were slapped together very last minute and sold as a single package. I have listened to the CD's while walking the Dog several times. I have picked up words and grammar but overall I dont think its a good package."},{"Title":"Drive Time: Spanish (CD): Learn Spanish While You Drive (All-Audio Courses)","review":"At first it was helpful. But by the second CD it was all over the place aDrive Time: Spanish (CD): Learn Spanish While You Drive (All-Audio Courses)nd I could not keep up."},{"Title":"Drive Time: Spanish (CD): Learn Spanish While You Drive (All-Audio Courses)","review":"If you already know some Spanish, this will unfortunately be a waste of your money. I study Spanish a lot, but don't speak it, so I like to keep on trucking along getting a little Spanish in my ears each day. I purchased this because many reviews said this wasn't for beginners, but let me tell you, I am bored to tears listening to them explain that there are masculine and feminine words, that the word \\"the\\" is \\"el and la\\", and how to say the time. Even if you are a beginner, this would not be comprehensive enough on it's own, and you'd need classes or Rosetta Stone. Disappointingly, I am still on the search for more well-made audio programs. I would recommend Learn In Your Car Spanish, not too much beginner material there and it acts as a good refresher."},{"Title":"Drive Time: Spanish (CD): Learn Spanish While You Drive (All-Audio Courses)","review":"This is great if you are not a beginner learning Spanish. Starts slow but then the tempo of each lesson increases quickly. Love this concept of learn while you drive."},{"Title":"Drive Time: Spanish (CD): Learn Spanish While You Drive (All-Audio Courses)","review":"This is a great product for someone with previous Spanish experience. My only complaint is that it starts off too slow, then plummets into advanced with the second CD. I took two years of Spanish in college and have built up a decent lexicon, but even I had to listen to most lessons twice to understand exactly what the speakers were saying. After about the third CD, they stop breaking up the sentences for you to repeat, and I had a hard time remembering what they'd said about half-way through the sentence. But if you don't mind going over the lessons several times, this set will certainly build your conversational skills."},{"Title":"Drive Time: Spanish (CD): Learn Spanish While You Drive (All-Audio Courses)","review":"Love this CD. I am a student of the Spanish language. This CD makes me think--Appreciate the speedy service of Amazon. Dale"},{"Title":"Drive Time: Spanish (CD): Learn Spanish While You Drive (All-Audio Courses)","review":"Definitely great for people on the go or who just don't have time at home to devote to learning Spanish or taking a class. It can get a little fast sometimes and tends to throw a LOT of information at you in short amounts of time, so it's extremely important to have a native speaker with whom to practice what you learn to solidify it in memory. The only downside is the fact that many phrases, when they were recorded, were cut off just slightly at the beginning, so it's sometimes difficult to hear what the native speakers on the CD really said. This can make it extra challenging for someone with no Spanish background or who just wants to hear clearly what was said to be able to imitate. This is the main reason why it's so important to have a native speaker in real life to practice with. Overall very good product, though. I've learned a lot with it so far in just the first few weeks of owning it."},{"Title":"Drive Time: Spanish (CD): Learn Spanish While You Drive (All-Audio Courses)","review":"I found this is a good starter to restart your spanish practicing. It's not for beginners. They touch the very basics very quickly and well if you don't know how to play with the inflections and all the good differences between the languages, I could see someone getting lost easily. It's not a bad product. Only thing is the pauses to repeat or to think about what you have to say is too short and usually you're saying it as they repeat the answer you just said. Other than that, I am very happy with the purchase and I like how it's easy to use in the car. Beginners in the language beware!"},{"Title":"Drive Time: Spanish (CD): Learn Spanish While You Drive (All-Audio Courses)","review":"perhaps not advanced enough for someone who has some spanish but for the raw beginner this is a good one - drive listen and learn!"},{"Title":"Drive Time: Spanish (CD): Learn Spanish While You Drive (All-Audio Courses)","review":"Easy to follow even though I am an American. However, I have not yet listened to all CD's, only the first one, but so far it has been easy to understand, and seems to provide constructive learning."},{"Title":"Drive Time: Spanish (CD): Learn Spanish While You Drive (All-Audio Courses)","review":"When stay long time in traffic the best thing to learn new language. Simple and good game, but not a real lesson."},{"Title":"Drive Time: Spanish (CD): Learn Spanish While You Drive (All-Audio Courses)","review":"My order with All New Books was placed on 2 December 2009 Two months later (4 Feb 2010) I am still awaiting delivery of the CD \\"Drive Time: Spanish (CD): Learn Spanish While You Drive\\"I cannot recommend the service received from All New Books."},{"Title":"Drive Time: Spanish (CD): Learn Spanish While You Drive (All-Audio Courses)","review":"This lesson started out at a pace a beginner could manage. After the first two or three sections, though, the pace picked up rapidly and I felt like Lucy in the candy factory. There was no way to keep up or comprehend what was being said, much less learn anything.After listening to the CD's over and over, some words were discernable and the small book helped as a reference. This CD should not be used, however, unless you are intermediate Spanish and need a refresher or more conversational experience."},{"Title":"Drive Time: Spanish (CD): Learn Spanish While You Drive (All-Audio Courses)","review":"I am starting spanish from ground zero. I knew how to count to ten, but that was all.I was very pleased as I worked my way through the 1st CD -- I really felt like I was learning. Feeling pretty stoked, I went on to the 2nd disc. Whoa! I was totally lost. The 1st disk is called the \\"on-ramp\\" before the lessons on discs 2 - 4.It really seemed to me that discs 2 - 4 might have been the concept for the package and somebody said, \\"this is too hard, let's add an introductory disk\\". The english-speaking narrator and the spanish speakers are different from from disk 1 to disk 2 as well, lending support to my theory. The main problem (after disk 1) is that they just start speaking spanish with very little repeating and I haven't a clue what they are saying.I haven't even listened to disks 3 & 4. I'm going to try another program."},{"Title":"Drive Time: Spanish (CD): Learn Spanish While You Drive (All-Audio Courses)","review":"Not very good sound quality and very difficult to understand. The gentleman who narrated did not enunciate well. The format of the questions and conversation did not flow easily like other language CDs I have purchased."},{"Title":"Drive Time: Spanish (CD): Learn Spanish While You Drive (All-Audio Courses)","review":"I wanted to brush up on my Spanish. I found the 1st CD slow but the other 3 were very helpful and well done. People think I am talking to myself in the car, but with cell phones in cars, people don't think you are strange anymore. I find it an easy way to improve my Spanish and fun. I recommend the Living Language System to anyone. Drive Time Spanish is one of the better versions for improving your Spanish that is available."},{"Title":"Drive Time: Spanish (CD): Learn Spanish While You Drive (All-Audio Courses)","review":"I bought this before I had read reviews on it because it was the cheapest cd's you could get.............more bang for the buck. After I read the reviews, I thought woe is me. Sounds like a waste of money to me! Much to my surprise, I really am using it. It's in my car of course, and I run the cd's over and over again. They seem a bit past me, but they are extremely helpful and well worth the little money that it is. My only complaint is that they don't give you much time to repeat occasionally. Plus sometimes they don't translate some of the conversations, expect you to know it I suppose. Still despite these complaints which may loom large to some, I find myself really getting a lot out of these cd's and recommend them to anyone from advanced beginners, intermediate to advanced. And the price is right!UPDATE I have since learned that it is necessary to use more than one program so now I have several programs and I use them all while driving around and going places."},{"Title":"Drive Time: Spanish (CD): Learn Spanish While You Drive (All-Audio Courses)","review":"Most students wish more \\"conversational\\" practice was included in the learning spanish products they buy. This is exactly what Drive Time Spanish gives you.Yes, the speakers talk to fast, and don't pronounce as cleary as you would like. But that's how it is in the real world.A very good product for those who have used \\"Learn In Your Car Spanish\\" or \\"Behind The Wheel Spanish\\" and would like to move on to conversational spanish."},{"Title":"Drive Time: Spanish (CD): Learn Spanish While You Drive (All-Audio Courses)","review":"This audio collection is a definite tool if you have had previous exposure to learning spanish. If you are a beginner with no experience in learning the lanuguage, this series probably moves too fast for you and is a little more difficult to comprehend. I had 4 years of spanish in high school but had a 4 year lull where I didn't study the language so I lost a lot. This CD set offered a quick reintroduction to the language on the first CD and then takes off into some of the grammar and a lot of dialogue. This is a very valuable tool in learning to feel comfortable speaking the language. I listen in the car on the way to work and back and have listened to each CD several times so it sticks in my brain. I would reccomend to anyone who has taken at least a year of spanish in the past and feels comfortable with the basics such as pronouns, simple phrases and some verbs."},{"Title":"Drive Time: Spanish (CD): Learn Spanish While You Drive (All-Audio Courses)","review":"the first cd was good, the second went to major grammer and was difficult to learn from. would not recommend this for beginners."},{"Title":"Drive Time: Spanish (CD): Learn Spanish While You Drive (All-Audio Courses)","review":"CD 1 starts off great! The speaker reviews words over and over, and they're used in sentences repeatedly. It moves nice and slow, which is valuable when you're trying to drive (Drive Time...)By CD2 they quit the repetition, and they speak the words so quickly, there's absolutely no hope of keeping up.I gave up"},{"Title":"Drive Time: Spanish (CD): Learn Spanish While You Drive (All-Audio Courses)","review":"i think this is worth the money. there was a lot to learn for this reasonable price. the first cd is very good, excellent for beginners. the next 3 are much more difficult. i understood all of the material, and it was a great review of what i already knew. however, i still do not feel like it helped practice speaking in conversations, and this is what i was hoping to learn from this product."},{"Title":"Twilight of Empire: Responses to Occupation","review":"Many political books -- no matter what party they are from -- are ill-conceived rants that make people mad, rather than making them think. Perceval Press's &quot;Twilight of Empire: Responses to Occupation&quot; breaks that trend with understated, thought-provoking essays on the controversial Iraq war, which provide a pat on the hand and a punch to gut at the same time.Amy Goodman's introduction at the start makes you start to think about the motives behind the war, and question what goes on behind the curtains. Then it's a look at Iraq itself, and at the damage wrought both by Saddam and by American troops. It's sobering, and more than a little shocking.Mike Davis offers a rather stretched glance at empires, invasions, and the difficulties that come after them. Naomi Klein offers economic glimpses at financial motives behind attacking Iraq; women's activist Jodie Evans provides her journal insights from Iraq itself; and Ambassador Joseph Wilson puts his extensive knowledge of the Middle-East to use. Publisher Viggo Mortensen offers a quiet, bleak prose poem, &quot;Back to Babylon.&quot;No war in decades has inspired controversy the way the present Iraq war has. And the general reaction to it is to knee-jerk. But &quot;Twilight&quot; wisely avoids propaganda, whining, ranting and name-calling. Instead, most of these writers merely present their opinions and stimulate the readers' thoughts. Some have even been to Iraq to see what has happened with their own eyes.Whatever your political leanings, it's impossible not to be shocked by the deterioration of Iraq that is shown to us here, a crumbling country which is being weighted down to the breaking point. The political commentary is secondary to the vivid pictures of Iraq -- a place most people have never seen -- and its struggling people by those who have seen the aftermath.Lynsey Addario's photographs prove an effective illustration of the essays. They're bleak, stark, and often very disturbing. There are pictures that are saddening looks at the struggling Iraqi people, and some that are simply appalling on a moral level, like an soldier goofing off in Saddam's pool.Whatever your thoughts on the Iraq war are, &quot;Twilight of Empire&quot; is worth checking out, if nothing else to make you think, reconsider, wonder, and sympathize. A powerful and disturbing book."},{"Title":"Twilight of Empire: Responses to Occupation","review":"An excellent collection of essays, interviews and photographs. Jodie Evan's (co-founder of Code Pink: A Women's Movement for Peace) journals provide first hand accounts of her experiences in Iraq, painting a vivid picture of the devastation, chaos and the continuous struggle of the Iraqi people -- they also depict the struggle those who wish to help will encounter. Christian Parenti's essay likewise offers another first-hand account of Iraq, but this time of the lives of US soldiers and how they have been tricked and mistreated.Former Ambassador Joseph Wilson lays out how the US deceived the American people into supporting a fallacious war and Naomi Klein's wonderful essay clearly defines who exactly stood to gain from the war in Iraq. In an interview with Kristina Borjesson, she explains how in order to gain accurate news reporting it is important to seek out more reliable sources, such as the foreign press, who aren't pressured by the administration to present a favorable view.While all political books have agendas, Twilight of Empire strives to present information fairly and to connect the dots that are sometimes difficult to find. And Lynsey Addario's stunning and compelling photographs are not to be missed."},{"Title":"Twilight of Empire: Responses to Occupation","review":"Though not a gigantic read, this brief book clearly details what is being done with our tax dollars to the impoverished people of Iraq. Along with some really strong photo documentation, this book includes an excellent collection of essays by some very important writers on the left like Amy Goodman, Howard Zinn, Christian Parenti, and Mike Davis. My favorite essay however was the one written by Naomi Klein, author of \\"No Logo\\", another crucial book. In this essay, Klein talks about the need to bridge the anti-war movement with the global justice movement. This is a discussion very much needed in the peace movement, because until we build a fair and truly democratic economy, we cannot possibly end the tragedy of war. Not only is this a good (though depressing) read, it's an excellent tool for public education. Buy it and then share it with friends! Why not donate a copy to a school or a public library?"},{"Title":"Twilight of Empire: Responses to Occupation","review":"I was actually looking forward to reading this, but invariably it degenerated into the knee-jerk anti-war rhetoric which while emotionally satisfying, is less than useful from a rational assessment of the war's consequences.More specifically the musings of such international relations luminaries such as Viggo Mortensen and Ambassador Joe Wilson give this book a decidedly ideological rather than critical/academic analysis. If that's what you want, then you'll love the book.If however you want something a bit more intellectually satisfying, try \\"Cobra II\\" or \\"Fiasco.\\""},{"Title":"Twilight of Empire: Responses to Occupation","review":"In reading this collection one would think that the US intends to plunder and pillage Iraq while at the same time destroying their social, economic, and political fabric. We are responsible for their treatment of women, poor economic choices, Saddam's palaces, and the destruction of the World Trade Center. This is complete left-wing drivle that uses blinders only to exploit negative events and completely ignore anything positive occuring in Iraq today. If you're looking for an objective review of conditions in Iraq today stay clear of this one."},{"Title":"The Heart Of A Father","review":"This book is truly a masterpiece of thought. It takes fatherhood full circle, from the moment you hold your first child in your arms, to mentoring your grandchildren as you watch them grow and mature. This book is comprehensive in its content and practical in its application. I would highly recommend it for fathers in every stage of life. Grandfathers will have the joy of reliving their early days of fatherhood, while young fathers will find in these pages a wealth of preparation for the future. It is an easy and enjoyable read and will captivate you from the very first lines."},{"Title":"The Heart Of A Father","review":"This book has two very good strengths, especially for soon to-be dads. One, it stresses the importance of objectively evaluating the effect of your own dad on you. Two, it gives an insightful review of the developmental stages of children."},{"Title":"The Vampire: A Casebook","review":"The vampire of literature and films is perhaps too familiar, but the underpinnings of the legends in the folk traditions of southeastern Europe are quite different from the popular image, and more interesting.Eleven fascinating essays by scholars in Slavic studies, anthropology, history, and psychiatry here illuminate this dark corner of primitive imagination, show how such a seemingly bizarre belief is tied to certain folk practices of exhumation, bring the studies up to date with cases of modern &quot;vampires&quot;, and offer a psychoanalytic interpretation of the phenomenon. (The &quot;score&quot; rating is an unfortunately ineradicable feature of the page. This reviewer does not &quot;score&quot; books.)"},{"Title":"The Vampire: A Casebook","review":"If you are interested in getting behind the fiction to the facts of vampires, this is an excellent place to start. The collection of scholars who wrote essays for this volume come from anthropology as well as psychiatry, with historians as well as students of Slavic culture. Consequently, you are bound to find one perspective on vampires that will suit your personal inclinations. More importantly, taken as a whole the book provides a broad spectrum of academic study of the popular phenomenon."},{"Title":"The Vampire: A Casebook","review":"awesome! it was in perfect condition and it will really help me with the classes I'm taking! thank you again!"},{"Title":"The Vampire: A Casebook","review":"The Vampire--A Casebook, is fairly informative. It makes the observation in the first chapter that the word Vampire is actually of serbian origen, not transalvanian or hungarian as many people think. It is edited mostly by college professors none of whom seem to believe in any kinds of vampires as being real. One guy teaches a class on vampires at the University of Virginia. He edits the chapter of the book which deals with seventeen or so brief--one paragraph--reports of peasents in Romania's accounts of what vampires do. They're capable of drawing illusions of enchanted forests in so doing converting a hapless victem who believes the illusion into a vampire. The chapter on the greek vampire points out differences and variations of customs from other regions' as well as the similarity of: one way of making a vampire is to have a cat (or sometimes any other object) cross over a corpse. The grusome cover of this book will grab your attention."},{"Title":"The peaceful palate: Fine vegetarian cuisine","review":"I recently went vegan and asked a vegetarian friend if they could recommend a starter cookbook. She let me borrow her copy of \\"Peaceful Palate\\". Since I've read it, I've been hooked. My favorite recipes are the \\"Dolphin-Friendly Mock Tuna Salad\\" and the \\"Neat Loaf\\". It has opened my eyes to the world of Veganism and I don't think I would have been as successful without it. The recipes are easy to make and the tastes are incredible. The first 20 pages are also loaded with helpful hints, kitchen staples and other interesting information. I highly recommend this book for anyone wanting to start a vegan cookbook library."},{"Title":"The peaceful palate: Fine vegetarian cuisine","review":"This is the healthiest vegan cookbook that I own. The recipes are low in fat and are simply delicious. The recipes are also hearty and filling. I made Neatloaf for my husband on our second date and he loves it. He makes it himself now, along with the Magic Chocolate Cake, Carrot Cake and Banana Cake. The Chili recipe is fantastic, as are the Garbanzo Rollups. We also love the Pasta with Peanut Sauce and the Thai Noodle Salad. This is my husband's favorite cookbook and he's not a vegan. ... I can't wait to receive Fat Free and Easy in a few days. I'm sure it will be another Jennifer Raymond success."},{"Title":"The peaceful palate: Fine vegetarian cuisine","review":"I have a well-worn copy of the first cookbook by Jennifer Raymond and knew that her recipes were relatively simple to prepare and very tasty. The Peaceful Palate includes a nice variety of offerings, without a lot of exotic (hard to find) ingredients. This would be a good book for anyone who wants to experiment with vegetarian cuisine to improve their eating habits. The Intro section of the book includes a lot of useful info, including items to stock, suggested menus and other tips on healthy eating."},{"Title":"The peaceful palate: Fine vegetarian cuisine","review":"One of the best vegetarian cookbooks I have come across. Everything is delicious and easy to make."},{"Title":"The peaceful palate: Fine vegetarian cuisine","review":"I picked up this cookbook several years ago at a vegetarian food festival. I have several great cookbooks, but I find myself checking this one first most of the time, because the recipes always turn out great. Everything I've made from this cookbook has been delicious. Highly recommended for new vegetarians/vegans and anyone looking to add a great, healthy cookbook to their collection."},{"Title":"The peaceful palate: Fine vegetarian cuisine","review":"I have a lot of vegan cookbooks, and this one remains my all-time favorite. It's classic. The recipes are easy, and the ingredients are likely already in your pantry. I have given this book as a gift multiple times. The book may be especially helpful for those who are cooking vegan for the first time, but it's a must-have for long-term vegans as well. One feature I like (among many) is that for some recipes the author provides alternative cooking methods for readers who use slow cookers. Buy this book. You'll turn to it again and again, I promise."},{"Title":"The peaceful palate: Fine vegetarian cuisine","review":"I have quite a few vegan cookbooks in my cabinet now. Sadly this was a disappointment. I hopes to get some really great and simple vegan ideas for family dinners. This was not out of the ordinary. There was not anything in this book I couldn't easily find online or in my other books. No pictures either. Given the chance, I would not buy this again."},{"Title":"The peaceful palate: Fine vegetarian cuisine","review":"This is one of my favorite vegan cookbooks to give to people who are interested in exploring vegan eating. The recipes are often familiar, traditional foods but made with vegan ingredients. There is really good introductory material about veganism, nutrition, and various ingredients that may be unfamiliar. The format is nice and the books lays flat. Recipes are relatively short and simple, yet still interesting and flavorful. I recently bought this book as a gift but have had my own copy for at least 10 years. I use it more often than my other many vegan cookbooks. The \\"neatloaf\\" recipe is amazing! So is the banana cake! My non vegan co-workers can't get enough! Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The peaceful palate: Fine vegetarian cuisine","review":"This is the best cookbook I own! I have dozens and dozens of veggie cookbooks but I use this one over 90% of the time. Her recipes are easy to follow and yield wonderful results. I particularly recommend the Green Velvet Soup and Truly Terrific Tacos. Both are family favorites at my house. In fact, I always make a double batch and freeze some for later.No mater if you are an experienced vegetarian chef or you've never eaten a meal without meat, this book is for you."},{"Title":"The peaceful palate: Fine vegetarian cuisine","review":"this was a good basic vegetarian cook book. In it's day it was a breakthrough, somewhat outdated now with some of the newer books."},{"Title":"The peaceful palate: Fine vegetarian cuisine","review":"This might be a good buy for an established vegetarian, but not for someone who wants to add more vegetables to their diet. A lot of recipies call for many (up to 10) ingredients, some of which are not commonly used. Why should I buy rice vinegar, cider vinegar, buckwheat flour, or something called tahini just to try it in one recipe. I am not saying the recipes are bad, they just look intimidating."},{"Title":"The peaceful palate: Fine vegetarian cuisine","review":"I just bought The Peaceful Palate about a week ago, and I've already used it several times. I love buying veggie cookbooks and collecting recipes, but this one stands out. I can make most of the recipes in it just using the ingredients I already have in my kitchen -- I do have a well-stocked pantry, but that's still unusual. I would recommend this book for beginners, busy people and those who sometimes just forget how easy it can be to throw together a healthy meal (like me!)."},{"Title":"The peaceful palate: Fine vegetarian cuisine","review":"Friends keep asking me what to get for someone who has just started cooking or turned vegan. Hands down, this is the one and only book I recommend. I bought it four years ago and still use it weekly. It has fool-proof cornbread, hummus, split pea soup, tacos, masoor dal, Thai noodle salad, oatmeal cookies---all the vegan stand-bys. For breakfasts, the scrambled tofu is good, though I had bad luck with the french toast and sourdough pancakes. I really appreciate the nutritional information provided for each dish. The pantry-stocking pages are excellent, as is the overview of nutrition and veganism. For beginners, the book's chief asset is its brevity: my first vegan cookbook was too big, and it took me way too long to sift through it and plan the week's meals. This has everything you need for months of great cooking, without much fuss. And its wide pages lay relatively flat, which makes it easier to use in the kitchen. A must for the new vegan or cook in your life."},{"Title":"The peaceful palate: Fine vegetarian cuisine","review":"As recent converts to a vegetarian lifestyle, my husband and I were desperate for nutritious, low-fat, delicious recipies. After looking at countless veggie cookbooks, we found The Peaceful Palate. Every recipe we've tried has been wonderful! So far we've given away at least twenty copies of the book to friends and relatives who have expressed an interest. We should apply for a volume discount!"},{"Title":"The peaceful palate: Fine vegetarian cuisine","review":"I have been a vegetarian for 24 years, and a vegan now for just over one year. Last year I ordered a number of vegan cookbooks, but this is the one I return to again and again. It is a very simple cookbook - it truly does feel peaceful - no fretting over unusual ingredients or fussy preparations. It is just simple, delicious food. If you are a new vegan this is a great book to start with, and, as I've found, a great one to stick with."},{"Title":"The peaceful palate: Fine vegetarian cuisine","review":"This was the first cookbook I found upon deciding to become a vegan; I consider this to be a stroke of great luck. Ms. Raymond does a fantastic job of setting you up for healthful cooking: She helps you stock your pantry, explains foods which might be new to a beginning vegetarian, gives nutrition information, and included a cornucopia of easy and delicious recipes. She does not rely on attempts at mimicking foods which contain animal products, but supplies foods which stand easily on their own two feet. Even I, a kitchen klutz, get excited every time I open the book. A must for any kitchen, vegetarian or no."},{"Title":"The peaceful palate: Fine vegetarian cuisine","review":"My husband and I are not vegans, nor are we even vegetarians, but the recipies in here are so delicious and simple to make that we usually end up making them again and again."},{"Title":"The peaceful palate: Fine vegetarian cuisine","review":"This is a fabulous cook book. There is nothing overly exotic so it was very easy to find all of the ingredients. I served the Tempeh salad sandwich to my meat eating family and none of them knew the difference, infact they said it was the best sandwich they've ever had! The carrot cake with tofu cream frosting was incredible and was finished all in one evening. My mom loved the coffee cake and insisted I not forget to give her the recipe. I can't wait to try all of the recipes. Thank you Jennifer Raymond!"},{"Title":"The peaceful palate: Fine vegetarian cuisine","review":"If you are a person wanting to expand your daily veggie intake, this is the book to get. A lot of vegetarian meals from other cookbooks taste like they are missing something. The stuff in here (my favorite is the Winter Squash and Hominy Stew) is enough for the heartiest of appetites."},{"Title":"The peaceful palate: Fine vegetarian cuisine","review":"Raymond easily could have titled this cookbook \\"Quick, easy, and delicious\\"! The split pea soup is one of my favorite cold-weather recipes, and just about everything I've tried in this book has been great. Highly recommend.Easy to read recipes with simple, common ingredients.It's my #1 cookbook."},{"Title":"The peaceful palate: Fine vegetarian cuisine","review":"&quot;The Peaceful Palate&quot; by Jennifer Raymond is full of delicious easy-to-make recipes that don't require any strange or hard-to-find ingredients. Between me and my mother-in-law, we have made a dozen of the recipes and each one turned out well. As an alternative to an overly sweet birthday cake, I have made the &quot;Applesauce Cake&quot; several times with the &quot;White Delite Frosting&quot; or just a sprinkling of cinnamon and powdered sugar. I like to give this book as a gift to friends and family, so that they can see how easy and tasty vegetarian cooking can be."},{"Title":"A war to be won: Fighting the Second World War","review":"Plain and simple, this is an amazing book, surely the best one-volume military history of World War II out there. Murray and Millett nimbly and ably cover all the war's theaters on land, at sea, and in the sky. The research is solid; the analysis is top-notch; and the writing is crisp and clear. I can say this of few books published by university presses, but A War to Be Won was a pleasure to read from start to finish. Even when chapters aren't as tightly written as the rest, they are interesting and insightful; this is true, for example, of the material on the Pacific Theater. Where the book really shines -- in both its argument and its prose -- is the Eastern Front. The authors engagingly describe what for many American readers is an (unjustly) unknown front that involved millions of German and Russian troops in some of the war's largest, most brutal battles. Specialists might debate their assessment of the Soviets' operational excellence, but Murray and Millett present a solid case. In any event, it surely whet my appetite for more specialized reading on the Eastern Front. Such is the case throughout the book, where the authors' presentation encourages further and deeper exploration.With its explicit focus on operations, the book doesn't fully explore strategy, diplomacy, tactics, or the experiences of individual soldiers and sailors. So if you're looking for those perspectives, you might want to turn elsewhere. But for an account of World War II at the operational level or simply for a solid overview of the war, you can do no better than A War to Be Won."},{"Title":"A war to be won: Fighting the Second World War","review":"\`In the course of the twentieth century, no war looms as profoundly transformative or as destructive as World War II. Its global scope and human toll reveal the true face of modern, industrialized warfare.'Thus begins the volume \`A War to Be Won: Fighting the Second World War' by Williamson Murray and Allan R. Millett. Murray, a fellow at the Institute for Defense Analysis, and Millett, professor of Military History at Ohio State University, has collaborated to produce a volume that looks at the World War II in almost exclusively military terms, with detailed (if not always precisely accurate) analysis of battlefield plans and progresses, logistical situations and problems, and (to a lesser extent) political and economic considerations behind the military decisions. Murray and Millett are very direct in this focus:\`In this book, we have concentrated on the conduct of operations by the military organizations that waged the war. We have not ignored the strategic and political decisions that drove the war, but what interests us most are the issues of military effectiveness.'Perhaps more true than anywhere else, on the battlefield those who forget the past are doomed to repeat it, and, in fact, are most likely doomed to failure because the enemy most likely has consulted history.This book looks at the origins of the war (chapter 1 and chapter 7), follows the military progress through the European, African, Atlantic, and Asia-Pacific theatres of warfare, and concludes with two broader chapters, one entitled \`Peoples at War', which examines civilian efforts toward the war in areas of industry, labor, civil defence, and basic food-production; and a second entitled \`The Aftermath of War', which looks very briefly at issues of resettlement, reparations, war crimes, and the political state of affairs after the war.The opening chapters are very telling regarding preparedness in the face of a potential adversary -- the state of British and French forces at the outset of the war, even in the face of an only-somewhat rearmed Germany made their position difficult, and indeed they were thoroughly routed in short order. However, the fault was not merely technical or logistical, but also involved poor planning and preparation on the part of officials who could or would not grow beyond then-traditional methods of warfare, most having derived from the experience of World War I.Despite its attention to all theatres of war, this remains a very Euro-centric book. The true starting date of World War II in increasingly under debate -- not all scholars subscribe to the September 1939 invasion of Poland as the beginning of the war, but rather the beginning of the European theatre of events. Japanese forces had been at work in Asia prior to this -- indeed, one could say that the first and last shots of World War II were fired in the Manchurian plains.This is a relatively minor point, however, and one that will most likely not occur to most Western readers who are accustomed to the portrayal of World War II in this manner.The chapter on the conclusion of the Asia-Pacific war addresses, but not in detail, the decision to drop atomic bombs on Japan; more detail in the proposed invasion planning of Japan would have been helping here -- the recent book \`Downfall: The End of the Imperial Japanese Empire' by Richard Frank does an excellent job at showing the difficulties that faced the Americans and other Allied forces as they contemplated a full-scale invasion of Japan, including the misperceptions of Japanese strength on the island that would have made the battle the most costly in human terms in all of history.This book, however, is a good survey of the military aspects of World War II, and fills in many gaps for those of us who have concentrated primarily on the political issues and only peripherally on the military engagements."},{"Title":"A war to be won: Fighting the Second World War","review":"This is the best single book on World War II. I have shelves of WW II books in my libraries in Montana and Ohio, and I served in WW II for three years in the ETO -- this volume is indispensable.It provides the big picture of the overall war and offers insights into strategies and leadership that are most revealing. I have communicated with Millett and commended him on his handling of the &quot;blunder at Antwerp&quot; and his assessment of Montgomery's role in this huge mistake. Very readable. Well documented. It is essential for anyone obsessed with WW II. I referred to this book frequently in my writing of &quot;We Made the Headlines Possible.&quot;"},{"Title":"A war to be won: Fighting the Second World War","review":"&quot;A War to be Won&quot; is a well written and researched novel that offers a complete analysis of both the Pacific and European theaters. It offers some refreshingly sharp rebukes of tactical decisions made by various generals, and from previous readings, I tend to strongly agree with the authors. For example, the vain and pretentious Gen. Douglas MacArthur, who the authors failed to metion was nicknamed &quot;Dugout Doug&quot; by his frontline troops for his failure to leave his sheltered underground quarters during the seige of Luzon and Bataan, is given no quarter. To quote the authors, &quot;When he was good, he was very good, and when he was bad, he was horrid.&quot; (page 185) His ill conceived conquest of Manila, coincided to his 65th birthday, was but a string of blunders by MacArthur, but his brilliant success also does not go unnoticed. The authors also make note of the most productive U.S. General in Europe, &quot;Old Blood and Guts - (His Guts, our Blood)&quot; Gen. George Patton. His hard driving style was really just a variation of the German &quot;Blitzkrieg&quot;, but highly effective, and unfortunately not a trait shared by other cautious American Generals. This is repeatedly demonstrated by the authors. It is also interesting to note that the Author's mention of superior Generalship of the Axis, such as Field Marshal Manstein and Guderian, to name a few brilliant German tacticians, and General Yamashita, the &quot;Tiger of Malay&quot; who refused to committ suicide, as he knew his imminent execution might save his soldiers lives. He was indeed executed, and it is intersting to note he was much more concerned with sparing his soldiers blood than MacArthur seemed to be in the spilling of those under his command. This book moves along quite rapidly, and only becomes more engrossing as you get further involved in the compelling story of a world gone mad. For a better written and more personal look at this War, I strongly recommend &quot;A History of the Twentieth Century, Vol.Two: 1933-1951&quot; by Martin Gilbert. It is superbly written and researched, and is a more personal view of this entire war, with less emphasis on unit designations and troop counts. At over 900 pages, it is so well written I have read it twice. It also contains over 40 maps, but I am taking nothing away from &quot;A War to be Won&quot; Provacative and factual, this novel is a must read for the serious student and casual reader alike. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"A war to be won: Fighting the Second World War","review":"I don't have the historical background that some others who have written reviews do, but I am fairly well versed in WWII history and at times this book seemed to worry too much about whose unit did what. I understand the major players both politically and militarily and appreciate the book identifying who was in command of certain armies and whatnot, but it gets a little bogged down when the author says it was the 82nd regiment of the third army in wherever. Again, I know that is important to military buffs, but to the average reader it makes it hard to follow. Especially when multiple units from both sides are being listed and then it says how they moved across what terrain and whatnot. The author could have made it a little easier to understand with a few fewer details and I think the gist of the story would have been stronger and easier to understand.One thing I did like about the book was the way in which it covered the war as two separate theaters. I also liked the fact that it covered the aspects of the war in sections. It would have been WAY too difficult to follow if naval campaigns were tied in with air campaigns and land campaigns just for the sake of chronological awareness.The big question I had the whole way through by the way was, who did a good job strategically during this war. It seemed like every move made could have been better according to the author. The bombing campaign crippled Germany at the cost of a lot of personnel and equipment true, but it did really effect the outcome. And, the battle for the Phillipines was an Allied victory, but in this book it was portrayed as almost a victory that wasn't worth the cost. To me, the authors editorialized things a bit much.It did help to describe some of the generals and major military leaders, although I noticed Patton got a better review than I had read before. And, Omar Bradley wasn't as well thought of as I read in other books. Also Halsey wasn't as revered. I knew McArthur would get slammed though and probably rightfully so although a career Army guy might say otherwise.This book was good, but if you are worried about a less detailed, more political view of WWII there are probably better choices."},{"Title":"A war to be won: Fighting the Second World War","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book and find the points of analysis to have been very insightful.My take away of outstanding points from the book: 1)The authors rightly do not absolve German generals for their part in the human rights abuses caused by the Nazi throughout Eastern and Western Europe. 2)The large scale and scope of logistical framework needed by all the Allies to pick up the pace of the offensive against Nazi Germany from July 1943 onward. 3)The rich net of personalities on both sides and how military and political organizations evolved to weed out dependence on personalities. 4)A thorough investigation of the intensity and depth of the fighting on all fronts. 5)A very credible and rich story on the Allied bombing offensive in the West. 6)A clear and reasonably detailed discussion on the fighting capabilities of each major country fighting. 7) Clear and effective presentations of the major organizational weaknesses of the Axis Powers.Here's how the book could have been better:1) As a read the book was generally excellent. However at about page 400 the authors could be accused of not getting their graduate assistants lined up -- the paragrahs become choppy and not linked together as tightly as earlier on. There was a vague feeling that the authors had run out of gas.2) The book could have benefitted a little more by diving in more deeply at some key points: i.e., more discussion on all the strategic options facing Britian in May of 1940, i.e. the status of the Exchequer, cease-fire initiatives dogging the Cabinet.3) The emphasis on personality was an enhancement and there were certainly many interesting and unusual insights presented but the authors did not drive home to the point -- did the personalities influence key decisions? or were organization checks and balances able to keep the machines going? Why were the Allies so successful at making their personalities and the Axis not.4) The authors temptingly bring up the concept of key actions by a few people that changed the outcome but do not follow through with enough examples --- i.e. Basilone at Guadalcanal, Guderian at Moscow.5) Key facts that could shed new light on situations are left out with amazing frequency (showing the author's slant), i.e., the discussion on American submarine devlopment and capability overlooks the fact that American diesel techonlogy resulted in too many cracked blocks and that German diesel technoology had to be licensed to correct the situation.All around a great book on World War Two."},{"Title":"A war to be won: Fighting the Second World War","review":"I've always thought that a single-volume history of WWII was an impossibility, but these gentlemen have carried it off. They move from theater to theater with the skill of novelists; they eschew the weasel word &quot;Nazi&quot; unless they're actually talking about the German political system; and they deride the conventional wisdom about the ineffectiveness of the Anglo-American bombing campaign. (Germany had 10,000 flak cannon targeted against Allied bombers, compared to 8,200 against Russian tanks. How different the war in the east would have been, if those 10,000 guns and 500,000 Luftwaffe gunners and support personnel had been freed for the eastern front!)The commanders fare rather badly. The authors detest MacArthur (no surprise there) but are equally harsh on Bradley, Clark, and King. Montgomery gets mixed reviews, as does Rommell and the German high command, most of whom were thorough-going Nazis with little grasp of strategy. Indeed, the only place where the German military gets unreserved praise is for its mastery of &quot;combined arms&quot; on the battlefield. Time and again, Allied armies fight isolated battles against a weaker German force that prevails (or at least escapes) by virtue of the fact that air, armor, infantry, and artillery worked together, and this across the entire front.Japanese commanders get off more lightly--they accomplished so much with so little--but the brutality of the Japanese military still sickens after all these years. The same of course is true of the German military, and not just in the east. (Americans who get bent out of shape over the execution of Private Slovik should know that between 13,000 and 15,000 German soldiers were executed for subversion, desertion, or disobedience in the front lines--not to mention tens of thousands sent to near-certain death in penal battalions.) The difference really comes down to numbers: the Japanese murdered their captives by the hundreds of thousands, while the Germans murdered them by the millions. They were rogue nations, and God protect us from seeing their like again.&quot;A War To Be Won&quot; has errors and omissions, of course--no two men can get everything right with respect to the greatest catastrophe of the 20th century, if not all human history. But what a great try!"},{"Title":"A war to be won: Fighting the Second World War","review":"The collection of countries that later formed the charter members of the United Nations enjoyed overwhelming force against Germany, Italy, and Japan, so the \\"Axis\\" never had a chance to win their war of global aggression, right? Wrong, according to Williamson Murray and Allan Millett in \\"A War to Be Won.\\"The long odds against an Axis victory didn't mean that it couldn't happen. For about a year (June 1940-June 1941), Germany and Japan seemed unstoppable. The fact that they were eventually halted required considerable sacrifices of \\"blood, sweat, toil, and tears,\\" to use Winston Churchill's memorable phrase. And as related in Chapter 14 \\"The Killing Time,\\" the bulk of the killing took place after the Axis had been theoretically defeated at Midway, El Alamein, Stalingrad, and elsewhere. In the end, the Allies won World War II because they adequately defined and met their operational objectives. The Axis, after initial success, did not. Murray and Millet do a great job of spelling out how it all happened.This book as been criticized elsewhere as being \\"Eurocentric\\" but the authors do a better job than most of bringing balance to their view of the war. For instance, six out of twenty chapters (30%) are devoted to the Pacific War. They spend another four chapters (two at the beginning, two at the end), analyzing the causes and consequences of the war. The remainder of the book is an even-handed discussion of the fighting in the Europen Theater of Operations (ETO). Although these campaigns are included, there is no celebration of American victories in North Africa, Italy, and Normandy, only a discussion of grim necessity.One word of disclosure: I can be considered a fan of Dr. Murray's, having taken and \\"aced\\" his military history course at Yale in the fall of 1976. I have, however, never met Professor Millett, and am judging his contribution as a stranger."},{"Title":"A war to be won: Fighting the Second World War","review":"As a one volumn summary of the fighting of WWII, this book has no equals, far surpassing John Keegan's popular history of the war. The discriptions of the campaigns and battles are clear and the evaluations and conclusions are well reasoned although occasionally controversial. The authors, correctly in my opinion, conclude that Bradley was hardly a &quot;GI's general&quot; as he is usually discribed. Most important, they suggest that Montgomery may have intentially failed to clear the approaches to Antwerp so that there would be only enough fuel for his army to advance. If true, he should have been shot for treason.One reader compared this book favorably to A World at Arms. This I think is not quite correct. The latter book is a political/economic analysis, and it has no peer. I expect it will be in print, in 2100 C.E. It is not a military history and not comparable to this book. Buy both!"},{"Title":"A war to be won: Fighting the Second World War","review":"While this is a serviceable account of World War II, it adds nothing new to the many one-volume histories that have been published in recent years. It is popular, not scholarly, with no footnotes. The book's priorities are old-fashioned, with the Eastern Front (where Germany committed two-thirds of its strength) being disposed of in one chapter and a few subsequent sections. The analysis and the prose are competent but hardly outstanding. I can see no reason to recommend this book over the much more comprehensive and thoughtful &quot;A World at Arms&quot; by Gerhard Weinberg"},{"Title":"A war to be won: Fighting the Second World War","review":"For me, this book has three unique virtues: as a single volume in which a wealth of solid information is conveniently organized; as a cohesive narrative of the Second World War; and as a critical analysis by two eminent war historians of the most important themes, causal forces, participants, ambiguities, and decisive events involved throughout that extended global conflict. For most readers, there is probably more information than they need or want. Many readers will have greater interest in Asia than in Europe...or vice versa; greater interest in naval battles than in land battles...or vice versa. My point is, the breadth and much of the depth of the Second World War are examined by Murray and Millett about as well as is possible in any single volume. Their Index is adequate to most readers' needs but perhaps (in the next edition) it could be developed in somewhat greater detail to accommodate those readers who have much more specific interests. The authors' notes for each of the book's 20 chapters suggest a wealth of supplementary sources for those readers which enable them to explore such subjects in greater depth. It is worth noting that a great deal of intelligence data (eg concerning code-breaking technologies such as the Ultra machine) did not become available until the 1970s. Decades later, the authors draw upon this information when explaining the implications and consequences of key strategies. Obviously, such an analysis could not have been possible while World War Two was in progress, nor during the years immediately following its conclusion in 1945."},{"Title":"A war to be won: Fighting the Second World War","review":"In World War II history, one is apt to get either the dry narrative of John Keegan (whom I otherwise like) or self-serving memoirs. Now, with &quot;A War to be Won,&quot; we actually have two scholars who write as if sitting back to explain, in an almost conversational style, what happened in the second part of the 20th century's Great War, aka World War II.Unmentioned among the other reviews is another single-volume WWII history which deserves mention - Robert Leckie's &quot;Delivered from Evil&quot;. (There is also Calvocoressi, Wint and Pritchard's &quot;Total War&quot; which I haven't finished.) I don't think Leckie has the scholarly depth of Murray and Milett, but his is the more comprehensive of the two works. For example, Leckie devotes six chapters to Guadalcanal alone. However, despite the endearing quirkiness of Leckie's prose, I think Murray and Millett come off as more polished and authoritative.Unfortunately, the authors have run afoul of a MacArthur groupie, who has deducted a star for their daring to tell the truth about the vastly over-rated and bombastic Army commander of the Pacific theatre. On the other hand, I might have faulted the latter for their high rating of George Patton, were this is a purely &quot;operational&quot; history; and Patton's rabid anti-Semitism - Eisenhower had to drag him kicking and screaming &quot;lousy Jew&quot; epithets to bear witness to the concentration camps - and dangerous political naivet&eacute; are irrelevant in that context.As for me, I must deduct a star, not for the style or substance of the authors but for the dreadful - or should I say non-existent - editing of the book. This has become an all-too-common problem among publishers today: editors who don't edit. Would you believe!"},{"Title":"A war to be won: Fighting the Second World War","review":"This book is a must read for those who want to know about WWII. The book is a gem for anyone, no matter their background. I think the high school student or the PHd candidate will find something in this book that will enhance them. The book flows almost like a novel. It is almost like reading the old series \\"world at war\\". The authors also make it interesting and present a deep perspective on the war. They do an excellent job blending the story from the strategic to the operational phase without missing a beat. The book also covers all sides of the war, the air war, the sea war, and the land war from the point of view of the nations involved. It doesn't touch the individual side, but that is unrealistic in a comprehensive story. The book is very well documented. It is a good first start for any research project.The book doesn't just gloss over the big parts of the war. The book does an excellent job of covering the forgotten parts of WWII like china Burma theater, the home front, and little covered parts of the eastern front like the Germans in the Caucus Mtns. They also cover the things like the plight of the jews, politics of the event and other such things. The authors also do a good job of incorporating statistics to tell the story that enhances things, not distort or distract from the main points. The authors does a good job of both presenting the facts and sliding in his opinion on things. They do that in a way which enhances the story, not detracting from it. This book does slant to the American side but that isn't all bad. It does touch on the other side of the story from time to time. Overall it is a treat to read this book."},{"Title":"A war to be won: Fighting the Second World War","review":"Without a doubt, &quot;A War To Be Won&quot; is an impressive achievement from a historian's perspective. It is quite simply the best one volume military history of World War II that I've come across, and one which will be regarded as the benchmark to be measured against by others in the future. Authors Williamson Murray and Allan R. Millett offer succinct, insightful analyses of the major land campaigns. Their analysis of naval battles is splendid too, though not covered in as much depth as those on land. I greatly appreciate their assessment of major Allied and Axis military commanders; US General Omar Bradley is shown in a rather unflattering light as a cautious commander who wasted his troops' lives on the battlefield; US General Douglas MacArthur is portrayed accurately as an egotistical prima donna whose leadership qualities were vastly inferior to those shown by Generals Eisenhower and Patton. This book benefits from much recent scholarship from hitherto unknown primary sources in Eastern Europe and elsewhere. Those in search of a splendid one volume military history of World War II need look no further."},{"Title":"A war to be won: Fighting the Second World War","review":"This volume, written by two veteran historians, is in the same league as Gerhard Weinberg's \\"A World at Arms\\" and Martin Gilbert's \\"The Second World War\\" for the authors of this book have produced, like the others mentioned, a concise, scholarly, very credible and informative summary of the largest and most costly event in our history. Of the three books, this is my favorite for it specializes in the operational aspects of the war. Not only are many engagements covered well but there is also a wealth of personalities discussed and statistics presented.The authors not only discussed the facts of these events and people but also add their own analysis and comments which greatly added to the experience. The list of leaders and commanders discussed is extensive and covers all the major countries in the war, both Allies and Axis and the authors bring out the good and the bad. The usual key people are included but there are also politicians and lessen known commanders that will surprise you. The index is extensive and will help you find the people or event wanted. The pros and cons of key weapons like tanks and planes were also discussed as well as the atomic bomb. There is some prior and post war discussions but its not extensive. There is no anecdotal experiences included.The book is laid out chronologically so you could be reading about von Bock driving toward Moscow and then in the next chapter you have Pearl Harbor being attacked. I would have preferred separating the Pacific War from Europe but it has certain advantages this way. The coverage is roughly 60/40 with the Pacific getting the smaller space. China, Burma, Singapore are included.There are a number of good maps and many photos that cover both theaters. There is also an Appendix and a Notes section but no Bibliography. I noticed a couple of errors but in a volume of this size, it wasn't rampant.The war was too large, too extensive to call one book definitive but the coverage in this book is admirable. There is coverage in this 612 page narrative that is not in the other two books mentioned but it can also be said they have coverage that's not in this volume. Owning all three would be a small investment in discovering the mammoth scope of this war."},{"Title":"A war to be won: Fighting the Second World War","review":"This is a brilliantly written book. It is difficult to think of World War II without using words like mammoth, horrific, casualties, convoluted, sacrifice and bravery ... to describe the events that shook the world to its core. But Williamson Murray and Allan R. Millett's book, \\"A War to Be Won: Fighting the Second World War\\" comes as close to describing the events that will dominate our memory for generations to come.\\"A War to Be Won\\" is a bit too complex for the beginner, but for the more studious and scholarly reader of World War II literature, this book is a treasure trove of knowledge. World War II was the greatest and most complex undertaking in all of human history-not to mention devastating destruction. Yet the authors approach their arduous task like puzzle masters dividing the pieces of that world conflict into sea, air, and ground campaigns. They also cover the political and military strategies utilized by both Allies and Axis powers. Their formula for dividing the war into sections allows the reader to better grasp the intricate concepts of World War II.The authors continuously analyze not only the campaigns, but the military and political leaders behind the decision making process illustrating their grand victories and poignant defeats that affected multitudes of troops and civilians on both sides of the conflict. Portraits of the military leaders are an integral part of the book, wherein their strategies and tactics are described and analyzed in detail for their effectiveness and ineffectiveness.\\"A War to Be Won\\" was itself a massive undertaking by Williamson Murray and Allan R. Millett, but the years spent on research and documentation were well worth the wait. The authors put together a grand study of the largest military conflict of all time and they accomplished this in one volume. This is one of those rare books that belong on the shelves of every World War II reader or historian."},{"Title":"A war to be won: Fighting the Second World War","review":"This puts the obese and British-biased Penguin History on my shelf to gather dust.Succinct, fair and filled with more military analysis and less of the pet theories about politicians and world leaders you find in others.A very good one volume place to start."},{"Title":"A war to be won: Fighting the Second World War","review":"Carter Marshall's review below touched on some of the drawbacks of the book, but not all. My main complaint about the book is that it tries too hard to fit too much into a restricted one volume space, and sometimes leaves you wondering why the authors mention something in a paragraph and never lead to an explanation of its significance. Murray and Millett could probably come up with a wonderful history of the US involvement in WWII, but it seems like they foisted this one upon the reading public because the market was receptive--&quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; comes to mind.First, the good: the book gives a very concise and very well-written overview of WWII, including causes, deployments, and rationale. The book is quite readable, and even though you know the ending (or at least I assume you know the ending), it's quite compelling. If you're interested in history, particularly WWII, this book is an enjoyable and well-written start.Then there's the adequate: there are several finely rendered maps of troop deployment, commanders involved, etc., within the book, that generally aid in understanding what happened. However, the text surrounding those maps often discusses major battles and excursions that you can't find on the maps, particularly in the maps showing the Russian front engagements and the western Pacific battles. Further, many of the chapter sections mention but don't explain prior history and rationale for some of the included statements.Annoying, and missing: any description of Chechens, any description (other than cursory) of Stalin's Gulag, an overview or description of the French resistance, German populace acceptance of Nazi terms, etc.Finally, there is the simply annoying: the main complaint I had, determined early in the book, was the &quot;Conclusion&quot; to each chapter, in which the chapter was summarized. In almost every conclusion, sentences and suppositions were mentioned which weren't discussed at all in the previous section. In fact, after each chapter conclusion, I found myself re-reading sections of the chapter to see if I missed a paragraph. I didn't. The &quot;conclusion&quot; section in most every case contains a sentence that has no explication anywhere in the book.In summary, this is a fantastic book for the US history fan who became one after seeing &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot;, or who wants a concise summary of the history of WWII that can be included in your carry-on luggage. If you are an afficionado of history with a decent library of WWII volumes, you'll probably not find much of interest except the excellent writing."},{"Title":"A war to be won: Fighting the Second World War","review":"\\"A War To Be Won\\" - Fighting the Second World War\\" - Murray & MillettThe book \\"A War To Be Won\\" is a very useful one-volume introduction to the Second World War.

George Patton was one of the most bizarre characters produced by the United States Military Academy and the United States Army.\\"P336 \\"U.S. Admiral Ernest King raged at subordinates in public, ruled his bridge with fear, and railed at incompetents and offices he thought too charming. He made life miserable for anyone around him, including his wife and seven children, by chain-smoking, binge-drinking and flagrant philandering.\\"P530 \\"British men might grouse about the Yanks being overpaid, oversexed and over here, but the GIs were also overfed and they knew it...The Army demonstrated its confidence that it could provide GIs with food in abundance by calculating the allowance for toilet tissue per solider station in Britain at 22.5 sheets per day. The comparable British ration was 3 sheets.\\"I was drawn to this book from an interest in U.S. Presidential History. I am an admirer of Franklin Roosevelt and have read several biographies. One of the central issues of his Presidency was WW2. To say the least there have been quite a few books written about WW2 but I required a book that covered the whole war. I was very satisfied that this book provided me with sufficient information to partially understand the incredible nightmare that my parents and family lived through.It took me almost three months to complete reading this book. The fact of the matter was the substantial amount of detailed information on each page. I found this not a book I could absorb in large amounts. Don't misunderstand, this book, although very scholarly, is written in a manner an intelligent high school student could understand. The issue for me the sheer amount of information presented. I had to let things ruminate awhile before I continued reading."},{"Title":"A war to be won: Fighting the Second World War","review":"Murray and Millet come at this overview from an American viewpoint. While they seem to make efforts to maintain an unbiased telling of the story, it becomes obvious that they have definite opinions. This is not a bad thing, just worth keeping in mind while reading. The overview maintains a reasonable chronology of events while hopping back and forth between the Western, Russian and Pacific theaters.One thing that sets this discussion of the war somewhat above the others I have read is the authors' analysis of many of the major characters both military and political in all of the theaters. They do not limit themselves to a mere telling of the list of events; they delve into the motivations of the various players. Definitely an intersting read.

That book looked at the First World War and the Second World War (including the interwar period) from the standpoint of each participating nation. It set up the standard of &quot;military effectiveness&quot;, taken at the levels of grand strategy/national policy (to include industrial and economic preparation) strategy (operational war plans) and battlefield performance (operational or theater level of war and tactics of divisions to brigades). They have applied this thorough and enlightening analysis to the present volume. This focus makes for an excellent &quot;operational history&quot; of the war. The emphasis is on the work of armies, corps and divisions in theater-level operations, as opposed to the tales of derring-do at the company or platoon level. However, one gets a good sense of the plight of the men at the point of contact. The field commanders are thoroughly and fairly assessed. Montgomery, for example, is given his due as a great planner and a great leader of men, but a testy martinet when it came to inter-allied coordination. I would say that our British cousins would not find any Monty-bashing here. Rommel likewise is fairly handled. Guderian's halo is removed;his role as a &quot;good Nazi&quot; does not detract from his reputation as a hard-charger, but his brashness in dealing with his colleagues in other units is brought out.Throughout, there is a constant interplay between the pre-war plans and preparations with the results of each operation. National temperament and command styles are neatly summarized.There is no waste of words. The text is gripping, concise and lively. There are no anecdotal asides --- one gets the impression that these two are writing from accumulated expertise over a long period rather than from note cards with colorful &quot;filler&quot; spliced in-- a fault of too many World War II books of late.Appendices on military organization, weapons systems, the art of war and the documentary sources are mini-encyclopedia in themselves.This book is indeed the definitive book on how the &quot;war to be won&quot; was, in fact, won by the allies and lost by the Axis.Highly recommended for both the knowledgeable buff and the novice."},{"Title":"A war to be won: Fighting the Second World War","review":"This is an amazing product by two of this country's most prolific military historians. Millett and Murray have teamed together before as teachers, lecturers and authors, but this is their finest hour. More than 600 pages, a dozen well crafted maps and 64 photographs are employed to produce a stunning operational narrative of this century's bloodiest and most deadly conflict. From the early days of the war in Europe to the final blasts in Japan, this duo combines their 50 years of teaching experience and punchy prose into a highly readable, entertaining and educating package. Nowhere will the reader find a better combination of sweeping coverage and sharp conclusions about all the Second World War's major campaigns and operations. Furthermore, nowhere will the reader find the striking and damning conclusions the author's lay at the feet of Generals Bradley and Clark, as well as the pithy and well earned barbs directed at Field Marshal Montgomery. This tightly composed volume is now and will be the best single volume operational history ever written on WWII. It will quickly displace the work of John Keegan and Gerhard Weinberg, and rightfully so. It will be enjoyed by veterans of the war, students of history, and all military professionals. Recent books by great historians like Stephen Ambrose have highlighted the human dimension of what the Greatest Generation was like and how they faced daunting demands of martial combat. In A War To Be Won you will find exactly what they faced and how it was done. Very few historians have the experience, breadth and tenacity to take on such a monumental history. This pair has done it and done it admirably. Their scholarship and insights will not be easily surpassed."},{"Title":"A war to be won: Fighting the Second World War","review":"I enjoyed reading this book, which is a bit off-putting due to its size and breadth. As long as one has a bit of time on his or her hands, this is a useful and entertaining way to spend some quality time with yourself in the company of two excellent history writers. The book has an amazing scope, and like Gerhard Weinberg's &quot;A World At Arms&quot; has a mammoth and daunting job at hand to describe the total scope and kaleidoscope of activities contained under the rubric of the second world war.The authors here are much more forthcoming than was Weinhard in discussing specific battlefield details of particular engagements, and this adds to the book's considerable value and readability to history buffs like myself. I enjoy their liberal employment of relevant economic, technological, geographical and other factors in describing the whos, hows, whens, wheres and whys of specific struggles as well as in describing the nature of the overall socio-political aspects of the war. So, when they subsequently launch into discussing their uniquely constructed &quot;standards of military effectiveness&quot;, they add to its value by buttressing their findings with a wealth of different kinds of supporting data, information, and background that makes the total overview of the war much more understandable than it would be otherwise.The book does suffer from some minor drawbacks, such as the authors' obvious quarrel with the contributions and strategies of Douglas MacArthur, yet they are also suitably fastidious in pointing out his many contributions and effective tactics as well. This drawback is counterbalanced by an outstanding treatment covering the Nazi campaign against Russia, and the day to day details crammed into describing the ill-fated and terribly over-extended German occupation and troubles in Operation Barbarossa and in the subsequent crushing defeats at the hands of the Russian armies is worth the price of the book alone.In summary, I also believe their well-argued and documented take on the importance and lasting influence of the second world war is crucial in understanding all that followed in the balance of the 20th century to be well taken, and to be beyond reasonable dispute. In some respects (Such as level of detail regarding specific engagements) this is a better book than Weinberg's, and on other levels it falls short of his monumental work. Combined, the two books offer one an astounding and quite rich look at a war that we are just starting to appreciate in all of its amazing scope, ferocity, and consequence. This book should be required reading for anyone considering a career in 20th century history, or for all of us history nuts who just can't get enough of a great thing. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"A war to be won: Fighting the Second World War","review":"From the first, the reader is treated to a newness in WWII historical narrative and interpretation -- how combatants planned, prepared, and delivered their military campaigns across the globe. The authors have superbly managed the complexities of modern warfare on a global scale, and they manage to include theaters and personalities that often are ignored -- such as the Austrialian campaign in the Dutch East Indies, the Indian-British campaign in the China-Burma-India theater and the never talked about plight of the First Panzer Army from the South Caucasus to Romania. Guderian, Rommel, Zhukov, Montgomery, and Patton of course get thorough treatment, as do MacArthur, Clark, Nimitz, and King. The focus is on the men who implemented (and in some cases developed on their own) national stratgy to fight the war.There are however, some drawbacks that may thwart the lay reader. On a few occasions, the double-authorship assumes a &quot;Jeckle and Hyde&quot; character with seemingly contradictory statements in the same chapter. Unless familiar with modern military lexicon, the reader might not understand the distinction between &quot;best battlefield commander&quot; (Rommel) and &quot;best operational commander&quot; (Zhukov). Likewise, the Battles of the Atlantic and the Airspace over the Reich are said to have &quot;been won&quot; in mid 1942, yet in 1943 in both cases the authors state the issues were in doubt, and on occasion, the Germans getting the upperhand. Again, if the reader misses the distinction between victory in a campaign, and the remaining tactical engagements, he may be confused.Most annoying to me were editorial errors such as the &quot;four cruisers sunk at Midway (should be carriers), that Patton's Third Army was to the left of First Army (it was on the right, from the Allied perspective), and that General James Gain commanded the 82nd Airborne (ouch. James Gavin).Finally, on the minus side, there is an extreme dearth of citations for a 600 page work. Only direct quotes are annotated, and often the authors fail to back up controversial points with evidence in the narrative or by scholastic citation. This gives the work a &quot;journalistic&quot; flavor, which may appeal to those intent on reading, but for the researcher who wants to verify statements on atrocities or Nazi-Wehrmacht complicities, be prepared for disappointment.If nothing else, buy it for the pictures: over 100 famous and not so famous photos found in one volume (overlook the &quot;British sniper&quot; with a .45 Thompson). The appendices can stand alone. The trenchent analysis of the total cost of war can't be found anywhere else.In a single volume, no better value for the money."},{"Title":"A war to be won: Fighting the Second World War","review":"Williamson Murray and Allan R. Millett, two veteran American academic historians, are to be commended for producing this authoritative, one-volume military history of World War II. It is a wonderful achievement! Their book is nearly 600 pages long, and it would be impossible to address every issue in a brief, 1000-word review. I will, therefore, confine myself to the authors' treatment of the effectiveness of the United States' military operations, with the understanding that this is representative of the authors' approach to the broader issues and topics.According to the authors, &quot;World War II was a conflict of resources as well as ideologies.&quot; Virtually every reader is familiar with the ideological dimension, but Murray and Millett focus much attention on the war's political economy. One of the Americans' greatest contributions to the Allied effort was, when possible, to address military problems &quot;through their legendary productivity.&quot; The authors emphasize: &quot;So vast was American war production that the United States not only armed itself but shared its output with the other Allies.&quot; Murray and Millett write: &quot;Logistical superiority was crucial to the Allies' victory, and America's role as the \`Arsenal of Democracy' made a crucial difference. Not only did the United States carry the burden of most of the naval campaign in the Pacific and an increasing load of the combat in Europe as the war progressed, but its Lend-Lease program was essential to the military operations of its allies and to the functioning of their wartime economies.&quot; There are numerous examples of the wartime application of American productivity. For instance, in 1940, over a year before the U.S. entered the war, it &quot;recognized that the German assault on world shipping posed a significant threat to its own strategic position,&quot; and the Americans' development of the Liberty ship - which was constructed in sections and then welded together - proved to be a mass-production concept that revolutionized shipbuilding.&quot; Similarly, in April 1942, when, the &quot;Navy was unprepared to handle the U-boat onslaught...for many reasons, including the fact that it had too few escorts,&quot; the United States embarked on a program to produce 60 escort vessels in 60 days, and when it achieved that goal, it announced another such program.&quot; According to Murray and Millett: &quot;A major dimension of the industrialization of warfare was the commitment to develop and deploy new weapons that would give one's armed forces distinct operational and tactical advantages over the enemy,&quot; and, of course, the design and construction of the atomic bomb by an international team of scientists remains one of the most remarkable scientific and technological achievements of all time. Examining the war with Japan is the best way to assess American military performance during World War II because only in the Pacific did the United States fully deploy every element of its air, ground, and naval forces. The Navy had years to plan for the virtually-inevitable war with Japan. According to the authors, however, it was not until after Pearl Harbor that the U. S. finally began preparing in earnest. Murray and Millet write that &quot;FDR simply stated the obvious&quot; when he declared that &quot;only American air-naval power could eventually roll back the Japanese from their Pacific outposts and liberate the conquered states of Southeast Asia and China.&quot; Army Chief of Staff George C. Marshall &quot;worried about the diversion of army resources from Europe to the Pacific war,&quot; but even after the disaster at Pearl Harbor, according to the authors, the United States' &quot;Pacific Fleet retained much of its combat power, which would surge in 1943 with the arrival of battleships, carriers, and cruisers already being built, ships that would not be needed in the campaign against German submarines.&quot; Murray and Millett quote Admiral William F. Halsey's &quot;simple South Pacific guidance:&quot; &quot;Kill Japs! Then kill more Japs.&quot; The war against Japan was won with significant contributions from each of the services. The tide of the surface naval conflict began to turn in the late-spring 1942 with the Battle of Midway, which Murray and Millett characterize &quot;as not quite a Trafalgar but far from an indecisive Jutland.&quot; In addition, American submarines forced Japan's economic collapse by devastating its merchant marine. The army and marines dug out tenacious Japanese defenders from islands across the Pacific from late 1942 through the spring of 1945. And the air force's campaign against Japanese cities culminated in the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Notwithstanding the success of American arms, Murray and Millet are not reluctant to criticize, and their vignettes of some American commanders are brutal in their succinct candor: On General Douglas MacArthur: &quot;MacArthur's paranoia, lust for personal publicity, political ambition, structured and comfortable lifestyle, and hypochondria were well known in the army;&quot; General Mark Clark: &quot;Many of Clark's contemporaries believed he possessed one of the best minds in the U.S. Army. Others believed his character consisted of equal parts vanity and slipperiness;&quot; and General Omar Bradley: &quot;dour, unimaginative, and deeply jealous.&quot;The costs of World War II were staggering. Millions died in combat, and millions of civilians also perished. In financial terms, &quot;the United States spent almost $350 billion on its war effort.&quot; Nevertheless, according to Murray and Millett, World War II &quot;remains \`the good war' in American historical imagination.&quot; There are many reasons for this. One is that the United States and its Allies fought and defeated enemies whose despicable ideology threatened every freedom that Americans enjoy. Another is that &quot;the United States emerged from World War II stronger in both absolute and relative terms than it was when it entered the war.&quot; Murray and Millett's concise and perceptive treatment of American operations during World War II is indicative of the consistent excellence of this book. I am certain that it will rapidly prove to be simply indispensable to professional historians and students, but I also recommend it without qualification to general readers who want to know more about military operations in the global conflict which established the United States as the world's greatest power."},{"Title":"A war to be won: Fighting the Second World War","review":"Dr. Murray and I appreciate the favorable readers' commentary on our history of World War II, and we often benefit from readers' suggestions for correction and improvement as the book moves into additional printings. I am distressed, however, that Mr. Shahid Zaki has misrepresented to you, and in personal correspondence to me, my analysis of the national composition of General Slim's Fourteenth Army in Burma, 1944-45 (pp. 489-92). First of all, I characterize Slim's army as &quot;non-European&quot; and credit it with the defeat of &quot;the finest Asian army to take the field in modern times.&quot; I identify seven of Slim's twelve infantry divisions as part of the Indian Army, the force Mr. Zaki claims I slight. Mr. Zaki makes two errors in his commentary: (1) I do not say that the majority of Indian Army units were cavalry or armored regiments, but that among such mobile units in Slim's army, Indian Army units provided the majority. For the entire Indian Army, infantry predominated; (2) Mr. Zaki misses my other point, which was that Slim created a multi-national, multi-ethnic army that came to depend more and more on its Indian Army infantry battalions as the 1945 campaign developed. Initially, however, Slim created mixed infantry brigades that included one British battalion, one Gurkha battalion, and one Indian battalion. Unless one counts all the Gurkha battalions as Indian Army - which they were not - Indian Army infantry battalions were not in the majority when Slim's 1945 offensive began. Slim's two British divisions had sixteen European infantry battalions and three of other nationalities. His seven Indian Army divisions had nineteen British battalions, seventeen Gurkha Rifles battalions, and twenty-seven Indian Army battalions. One should add that Slim's most unappreciated force was two African divisions and an independent brigade, which provided twenty-one more non-European, but also non-Indian battalions. This calculation excludes General Orde Wingate's six-brigade (reinforced) Long Range Penetration Group, which included Gurkha but not Indian Army infantry battalions. Over the course of the 1945 campaign, General Slim placed increasing responsibility on his Indian Army infantry battalions as their combined arms, offensive capabilities improved. He could also draw Indian replacements or new battalions for his army, but not more British, Gurkhas, and Africans. Counting individual infantrymen (not battalions), I suspect Indians became the majority infantry nationality in Fourteenth Army by war's end. Nevertheless, Mr. Zaki is simply wrong when he claims &quot;that the Fourteenth Army in Burma was comprised mostly of combat units of the Indian Army.&quot; Mr. Zaki makes a common error of military history non-professionals, which is accepting commercial publications as infallible sources of statistical and order-of-battle data. You may be sure that Dr. Murray and I have learned this lesson the hard way, but we learned it -- or are still learning it. Even the official histories of World War II (every belligerent) should be read with care. In this case, my source of order-of-battle data was taken from Maj. Gen. S. Woodburn Kirby et al., _The War Against Japan_ (5 vols., Her Majesty's Stationery Office, 1957-1969), Vols. IV and V, which I highly recommend. Any general history of as complex a human event as World War II is bound to have controversial interpretations and factual errors. My characterization of the Fourteenth Army may be one of the former, but it is certainly not one of the latter."},{"Title":"A war to be won: Fighting the Second World War","review":"As a faculty member at the U.S. Army Command and Staff College, I got to tell you I love this book. It provides a tight, well-written global account of the fighting in this global war. Military professionals will find the book informed and useful, but Murray and Millett's smooth but brisk writing is also accessible to the general reader. Hitting this balance is no easy thing. The book is \\"joint\\" or \\"purple\\" in that it looks at air, land, and sea operations. The authors provide coverage of both axis and allies, but they are clearly more familiar with and better informed on operations in Europe than they are in Asia and the Pacific. The focus on the operational level, but they pay a good deal of attention to strategy and spend time looking at how decisions played out at the tactical level.They begin their account with a general history of military developments during the interwar period. Weapons rarely come with instruction books and the major powers pursued different types of weapon systems and had different ideas on how to use them, which reflected the political and cultural values of their societies. These peacetime decisions played a large role in wartime performance.A major shortcoming of all the axis powers was that their strategic planning was horrible. What made the Germans so successful early on was that they were good at combined arms operations (the coordinated use of infantry, artillery, engineers and air units that provided close air ground support) which allowed them to move faster than their opponents. Their early success came as much because of allied mistakes and contained and caused them to overlook serious problems like logistics, which became much more serious as the war went on.The Battle of the Atlantic was one of the most key campaigns of the war. If the Germans had won then it would have been impossible for the allies to invade Europe. The battle though was never that close, the German Navy was overly centralized, had a weak logistical structure, failed to concentrate their focus, and was not ready to challenge the global nature of Britain's naval power. In the east, support facilities and logistics came into play. They understand that little things could have enormous ramifications. For example, the German Air Force did not have enclosed hangers for their planes on the eastern front, so ground crews had to work out in the bitter cold of a Russian winter. They did their maintenance work as quickly as possible and sometimes it was not as thorough as it should have been. These shortcuts often resulted in poor performance in the skies. German shortcomings gave the Soviets enough time to reform their army and become a much more effective fighting force than the Germans.The authors pursue their account in a topically focused narrative fashion. In essence, they address the Battle of France, and then move to the Balkans in another chapter, and then look at the invasion of the Soviet Union, and then the Battle of the Atlantic, and then the war in the Pacific and so forth. Many times this results in chapters starting six months before the conclusion of the previous chapter. This approach, though, is best. It allows the reader to follow events to their logical conclusions. Of course, at the time, people had to deal with the air war at the same time they had to deal with the u-boats, and events in Europe had at the same time they happened in Asia. The alternative to this structure is the heavy chronological focus that Sir Martin Gilbert uses in \\"The Second World War\\" where one chapter can be on Europe and the next on the Pacific, and then the next on a vote in the British Parliament that affected the lend-lease. Only one chapter--an examination of the various home fronts--which comes for some odd reason at the end of the book breaks out of this mold.There are numerous strengths to this book. Murray and Millett cover all the major fronts and give lesser lights, like Australia, their moment. They focus on less than sexy topics like logistics Despite what many people think, the United States faced profound logistical shortcomings before and during this war that significantly shaped the decisions that U.S. leaders had to make. The U.S. Navy turned to carrier and submarines because they lacked the logistical support to go toe-to-toe with the Imperial Japanese Navy in a surface fleet engagement. Nor do they see the war as a simple conflict of mobilized economies. Intangibles like military leadership and motivation were also important in determining the outcome of battles.There are shortcomings with this book. While the coverage is broad, it is a bit shallow. Specialists will be disappointed in important battles getting only a paragraph of coverage. To some degree this type of problem is inherent in the format of the book--how do you cover all of World War II and get into every part in depth without writing a book that weighs 200 pounds? They are less familiar with naval operations than they are with air and land battles. They dismiss the Norway campaign as a strategic draw, but fail to note that the Germans drove the Danish and Norwegian merchant fleets into British hands, offsetting all the work u-boats had done during the previous two years. This omission is all the more surprising give the importance they attribute to the Battle of the Atlantic. They misidentify the Italian battleship \\"Giulo Cesare\\" as just \\"Cesare.\\" They attribute the sinking of HMS \\"Hood\\" to a 15 inch shell from \\"Bismarck.\\" This claim might be true, but most naval historians believe it was an eight inch shell from \\"Prinz Eugen\\" that hit the torpedo room or an anti-aircraft magazine. The authors attribute the Liberty ships to Henry J. Kaiser when it was actually the British that developed the ship. They blame the Tenth Fleet for failing to introduce convoys in 1942, which allowed the u-boats to score a lot of easy victories up and down the east coast. The Tenth Fleet was not established until 1943. When it comes to matters in the Pacific, they also make a number of errors. They put the \\"Enterprise\\" and \\"Lexington\\" in the wrong location on December 7, 1941. At Midway, the U.S. sank four Japanese carriers, not cruisers. At Leyte Gulf, they say the \\"Enterprise\\" and \\"Saratoga\\" were present when it was only the \\"Enterprise.\\" They also under report the fire power of the Brooklyn-class cruisers which could fire six inch shells not five inches as they report. A lot of these mistakes are minor and could easily come from hitting the wrong keys on their keyboards, but they all come in naval affairs, which is no accident."},{"Title":"A war to be won: Fighting the Second World War","review":"The problem with many books about WWII is that they tackle far more than could ever be effectively covered in one volume. WWII was more than just battles, it turned the global politcal/economic system on it's ear; it sparked drives for independence in dozens of countries while ripping empires apart; and it redefined the culture of practically every nation involved. As I have stated, when an author tries to tackle all these topics, they inevitably give many short shrift.The beauty of this work is that Murray and Millet focus solely on the military aspect of the war. In so doing they shed much needed light on some of the pivotal moments of the war, and the people involved. They have an obvious mastery of modern tactics, but the reader is never buried in an onslaught of military jargon. Furthermore, popular mythology surrounding the various personalities making the critical decisions of the war never colors their commentary. They go out of their way to judge each person on their merits, and their contribution to the war effort.They also do an excellent job of outlining the logistical battle waged by the allies. As a result of WWII, logistics is frequently referred to as an American military artform, and the authors do a superb job of explaining why that is the case.If you are looking for a broad history of WWII this isn't your book. But if you are a serious student of military history who wants to understand the strategy, tactics and personalities that determined the outcome of WWII, &quot;A War to Be Won&quot; is truly outstanding."},{"Title":"A war to be won: Fighting the Second World War","review":"A superb one volume operational history of the Second World War, this book carries you into the evolution of every major military. You learn what their assumptions were, why they designed the military they did, what their strengths and weaknesses were and how those interacted in the campaigns that decided whether Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan would dominate the world. This remarkable work reflects years of thought on the topic by Murray and Millett.They begin with this definitive description of the scale of the contest. &quot;World War II was the deadliest conflict in modern history. It continued World War I's slaughter of soldiers but then added direct attacks against civilians on a scale not seen in Europe since the 'Thirty Years' War three centuries earlier.&quot; (page vii)Murray and Millett render judgment on some very interesting topics. They are vehement about the culpability of the senior British officers in refusing to promote armored specialists to command armored divisions and blame Alan Brooke and his colleagues for refusing to learn the lessons of the first years of the war and refusing to open their senior ranks to people who were capable of the speed and complexity of modern warfare but not part of the inner clique. Murray and Millett admire Eisenhower and Patton but are the harshest critics of Bradley that I have encountered.The harshest condemnation comes for the German inability to believe their codes could be compromised or their intelligence service could be fooled. Murray and Millett note that the Soviet use of Maskirova (denial and deception) was consistently successful throughout the war once the fronts had been stabilized in December 1941. Again and again and yet again the Germans were surprised by Soviet offensives.This is an impressive overview that any serious student of warfare should carefully read. For the interested citizen this is as good a one-volume introduction to the military side of the Second World War as you will find."},{"Title":"A war to be won: Fighting the Second World War","review":"Fighting a war that lasts a decade or more, as World War II did, means work in every sense of the word. This book clearly outlines the managerial decisions of the 1930s, the weapons development snafus, the strategic waffling and incoherence, and the moments of brilliant and sustained innovation... the work of men and women in making and fighting a war.Told in an engaging manner, the book is opinionated. Bradley is a jealous and dour man; MacArthur is a hypochondriac who is disengaged from his troops and whose indecision cost America any chance to defend the Phiilipines at the beginning of the War; Patton is the only American general who prepared himself for World War II through study. Montgomery is a great general... the British were poor at promoting good men who had done well in lesser posts.The book breaks down the war into strategic decisions, and operational decisions. This book provides an amazingly clear story of what the nations thought they were up to.... the authors do not shy away from showing managerial incompetence. Along the way, it becomes clear that a war this big is in fact a work in progress, a sustained effort that involves as much human error as it does genius, as much simple management as it does courage and bravery.In this era of &quot;quick wars&quot;, it is fascinating to consider World War II as almost a way of life for the world, and as this book makes clear, as a way of work. On a pure military level, this book provides the clarity and overview that is lacking in a book such as Keegan's World War II.... The work is informative not only about history and the war, but about how men and women work over time to accomplish great goals.If you are only going to read one military history this decade, this is the one to read."},{"Title":"A war to be won: Fighting the Second World War","review":"I got this book hoping for something to update/replace Liddell Hart's operational analysis of the war. Sigh. Not hardly.The authors have written a book too short by half. They have many opinions, some interesting, but it's difficult to know why one should credit them on any given point, as their ridiculously scanty citations will show. Bombing the fuel facilities at Pearl Harbor wouldn't have done much good, as they could be rapidly replaced. Really? Says who? The authors just \\"know\\" this. The section on 1941 in Russia is especially odd; one would scarcely know that there were debated issues.The book is an okay introduction, but if you've read enough about the war to have some idea of the controversies, you'll be dissatisfied. Though lord knows, any book that tries to put MacArthur in his place can't be all bad.(And hey, if anyone knows of a book that does Liddell Hart's job better, please mention it in comments. As it is, he remains the best we've got, but SURELY 30 years of research have counted for something.)"},{"Title":"A war to be won: Fighting the Second World War","review":"This is a good start for those that are reading about WWII for the first time.

After reading this book, all I read now are books about World War 2, America, Britain, Germany, Russia, etc. during this time period.

For example,there are several paragraphs on the problems of the British Army resulting from their practice of using social class as criteria for officers. How this practice actually effected operations is never touched upon, and I think most readers would agree that over the course of the book, the British Army comes off no better and no worse than the Americans or the Russians or the Axis powers. Their analysis of military leaders often differs significantly from the conventional wisdom, eg Bradley was a poor general; Nimitz and Spruance were too cautious. Yet their criticism of all leaders is so comprehensive that you end up wondering how they determined who was good and who was bad as they all seemed to perform at the same low level. A similar book, Weinberg's World at Arms, is somewhat similar in approach and hangs together much better. Try Weinberg first."},{"Title":"A war to be won: Fighting the Second World War","review":"Some sections were well done; I learned a lot about Italy's involvement and the Balkan campaign for example. However, given the rave reviews I had read, I wanted much more than I got. There is much that is standard fare such as the coverage of the Battle of the Atlantic which completely ignores the questions Clay Blair raised in his recent books about German effectiveness and American mismanagement. Also the authors don't seem to think much of anyone's management of the war but give little evidence for their views. Bradley, Nimitz, Hodges, Fletcher, Wavell, Clark, King, and others are criticized professionally and personally (which may be deserved) but little is said to justify their views."},{"Title":"A war to be won: Fighting the Second World War","review":"I have not read the book fully but have gone through the section on the China Burma India theater. In this section authors have written that, quoting from the book &quot; Except in reconnaissance, mechanized cavalry, and armored units, Indian units did not provide majority of troops in combat arms.&quot; This statement is totally contradictory to the facts. The fact is that the majority of indian units were combat units, they were infantry battalions grouped into brigades and further grouped into variously numbered Indian Divisions. A brief look at the order of battle of the fourteenth army starting with its retreat from burma to its victory, will point to this fact. In fact, contrary to authors assertion, majority of the indian units were neither cavalry nor armoured. This owed to the slow mechanization of the British indian army and priority being given to other theater of operations. I wanted to point out this, in order that the gallantry of the thousands of Indian soldiers who fought and died in this critical theater of operations may not be forgotten. The fact remains that the fourteenth army in Burma was comprised mostly of the combat units of the Indian Army. Its contribution to the allied effort in winning the war against Japan cannot be underestimated and needs to be appreciated.

Great book for anyone interested in WWII."},{"Title":"A war to be won: Fighting the Second World War","review":"A book that adds nothing new of importance and merely recaps observations that have been made more convincingly by others. Frankly, it reads like a compilation of the authors' lecture notes for a college survey class in \\"World History Of The 20th Century.\\"Extremely superficial, with lots of personal asides like \\"Arnold, a sick, bitter man\\" that the authors never expand upon and that seem to have no relevance to the matter at hand. (For example, this reference was stuck in the middle of a very short discussion of Curtis LeMay's appointment as the replacement commanding officer responsible for strategic bombing of Japanese cities.)Similar titles by John Keegan, Max Hastings and/or Richard Overy would all be better choices."},{"Title":"A war to be won: Fighting the Second World War","review":"The authors yet again try to re-write history which clearly is their lifelong mission in life--to use industrial logistics to obscure the battlefield and attempt to vindicate navalist attrition warfare which killed thousands of Americans needlessly while U.S. Army General MacArthur used operational maneuver and achieved greater results at less casualties. Refer to William Manchester--a WWII marine combat vet----&quot;American Caesar&quot;---he WAS THERE. He was shot at. He saw his buddies killed by navalist frontal assaults conceived by amateurs in search for a future budgetary public relations position. That he concludes that MacArthur's campaigns in the Pacific were brilliant demand that his thinking be taken with more weight than these arm-chair wonks. The authors (one a former marine reservist) want to obscure the fact that the Germans were the main threat and most difficult foe--to overcome them the U.S. Army--and its Army Air Force not their favored navalist and marines---reformed themselves into the greatest Air/Ground fighting forces ever assembled to that point. A force that used both firepower and maneuver. That this force pulled off the greatest amphibious-airborne operation in history without need of any specialized marine ground troops must be something the authors cannot face. A key element was the 3-D operational maneuver of parachute and glider Paratroopers who sealed off the invasion beaches from counter-attack--operational art foreign to the WWII navalist mind. The Army/AF in the ETO fought and defeated the most capable 1st world country foe in the Germans---who fielded over 100 Divisions just for the invasion of Russia. The U.S. Army fielded over 50 Divisions in WWII to do the lion's share of the fighting and dying in BOTH the Pacific (more efficiently for more territory), North Africa and Europe while the navalists lied and re-wrote history to try to hog up the credit, which is why we still have obsolete surface-ship based land forces that are deployed in penny packets to act as evacuation services for the State department while the majority of the other 172,000 are in the U.S. land-locked but busy at the bars and www telling tall tales.Noone who has an objective view of history can endorse this travesty of history, done at a time when thousands of WWII veterans are dying each day and are thus unable to set this wannabe-historians straight as to the way it really was.May the ghosts of WWII dead stand to correct this revisionism!"},{"Title":"A war to be won: Fighting the Second World War","review":"This is an excellent overview of WWII, with only a few errors of fact. (Is there no one left who is capable of fact-checking a manuscript?) The authors cover naval strategy and battles in a cursory manner, while devoting most of their pages to an excellent analysis of land campaigns and strategy, including the often-ignored eastern front. Ultra intelligence is covered, but is probably not given enough credit for its effect on events. One strength of the work are the authors opinions (if you agree with them) of various major military and political figures, some of which have been given harsher treatment than heretofore. (The perspective of history is truer than the less critical adulation heaped on the victors in the flush of victory.) This work proves that WWII was such a vast occurrence that 576 pages cannot do it justice. But it was a pretty good try."},{"Title":"A war to be won: Fighting the Second World War","review":"This is one of the finest books of recent note that explores all facets of WW2. In particular, the authors ability to tie in the operational art of war with intelligence' impact with the making of operational decisions was OUTSTANDING. This book is easily one of the easiest to read, but, also one of the most informative works on WW2. The neophyte to the scholar and the military professional can learn from and enjoy this book. Hopefully, more works will soon be produced by these two fine collaborators."},{"Title":"A war to be won: Fighting the Second World War","review":"A War to be Won covers the entire theater of WWII. The writing is tight, incisive, and clear. The authors were born during the war, and later served in the military: \\"One of us contained Communism in the Caribbean and the other took on the same mission in Southeast Asia, and neither of us would have had these experiences (one suspects) if the German Army had actually taken Moscow.\\" (638)The authors give a clear summary of the book in their Preface:\\"In this book, we have concentrated on the conduct of operations by the military organizations that waged the war. We have not ignored the strategic and political decisions that drove the war, but what interests us most are issues of military effectiveness. We have attempted to explain the battlefield performance of armies, navies, and air forces; the decisions made by generals and admirals in the face of extraordinary difficulties; the underlying factors that shaped the outcomes of battles and campaigns; and the interrelationships among battles separated by hundreds or thousands of miles. Thus, we have written a history of World War II that examines the reciprocal influence of strategy and operations. We try to explain how military decisions were made, and how those decisions made a difference to the outcome of the fighting. We are aware that as historians, with access to documents and accounts from both sides, we can understand events as they unfolded in a way that participants could not. In every case, we have attempted to judge the decisions of military leaders and statesmen on the basis of what they could reasonably have known at the time that they had to act.\\" (x)Suggestions for additional reading are given in the book. In the seven-page Appendix 4, Exploring World War II, the authors talk about how to go about further reading and research on the war. They also have, following their endnotes, a sixteen-page bibliography for Suggested Reading, divided according to the chapters of their book. In Appendix 4, they praise and recommend two general histories of the war: Gordon Wright [1968], The Ordeal of Total War, 1939-1945, and Gerhard L. Weinberg [1994], A World at Arms: A Global History of World War II.Incidentally, Weinberg, in his book, has a twenty-three page Bibliographic Essay, where he, too, recommends Wright's book, judging it an \\"excellent general survey of the European aspect of the war\\". (922) Weinberg also recommends, for a single-volume history of the military side of the war, Martha Byrd [1970], A World in Flames: A History of World War II."},{"Title":"A war to be won: Fighting the Second World War","review":"This book is an analytical analysis of Military strategy operation for WWII at its best. You will really like to read this book for its broad coverage of all major battles fought in the WWII.

I have read dozens of WWII books over the years."},{"Title":"A war to be won: Fighting the Second World War","review":"Another book chosen by the professor for my Master Level Military History class. This book would be a good read and reference book for anyone intrested in MIlitary History."},{"Title":"A war to be won: Fighting the Second World War","review":"This is a narrative of the operational history of the Second World War. If one examines the bibliography and the references a limited number of secondary sources are quoted. For the Barbarossa Campaign two main books are quoted, &quot;When Titans&quot; clashed by Glantz and &quot;The Road to Stalingrad&quot; by Erickson. What this book does is to precis or to summarize these longer works. The book does not contain any substantial reference to archival material. In a similar way other chapters are based on existing histories of the pacific war.The book is easy to read and can be characterized as a reasonable narrative history of the war. It is a good starting point for people who want an overview of the main campaigns told in a lively and concise way. It also corrects some of the misconceptions that have existed in some earlier narrative histories. With regard to the Barbarossa Campaign earlier writers have suggested that the seizure of Moscow might have led to a successful outcome for the Germans. This book argues that the German Army suffered from massive logistic problems that things probably could not have gone much differently. The book also does not accept the nonsense peddled by the German military that they were all unwitting tools of the Nazi State. This book states what is now the accepted position that the army and the Nazi's were hand in hand.There are some annoying bits. The authors say that the Axis consisted of three countries Germany Italy and Japan. The reality is that the invasion of Russia was carried out by an alliance consisting of Germany, Italy, Hungary, Romania, Finland, and Slovenia. Spain also contributed a division of volunteers. SS units also had volunteers from Norway, Denmark, Holland and France. The invasion of Russia was carried out by a coalition of right wing anti-democratic states.Also in discussing the defeat of the British in Malaya and the Americans in the Philippines the authors trot out some old myths. They repeat the old mantra that the reason the Japanese won these campaigns was because of their air and naval superiority. The authors also say that in the Philippines McArthur had to rely on &quot;native troops&quot;.The German Army had to fight in situations in which they had no air support at all. During the Italian campaign they were able to mount successful defences on the Gustav Line at ANZIO and on the Gothic line.In both the Malayan and Philippines campaign the Japanese army was poorly equipped. They were basically World War One style armies, rifle divisions with supporting artillery. In addition Japanese armies had to live off the land. At the climax of the Malayan campaign the Japanese actually ran out of ammunition and were only saved by the British caving in and surrendering. The reason for their success was the abysmal standard of command in both campaigns. Percival the British Commander in Malaya only experience prior to his command was killing unarmed Irishmen. He strung his forces along the Malaya Peninsular and then watched as the Japanese attacked units individually and destroyed them. He outnumbered the Japanese and the quality of his weapons was the equal if not superior. MacAuthur was arguably even more incompetent. He had been the commander of the Philippines for some years. He was responsible for the development of their army. If it was no good then it was his fault.One of the problems that histories have had in the past is a tendency not to weight the importance of events. After the war it was common to couple together the defeat of the Germans at Stalingrad with that of El Alamien. The reality is of course that the defeat at Stalingrad was a staggering blow that tore open the eastern front left German forces in the Caucuses vulnerable and lost the Germans 250,000 front line troops. The battle of El Alamien involved some 80,000 axis troops with a minority being German and mattered not much at all. In fact due to the allied invasion of Tunis Montgomery need not have attacked at all. He could have waited a few days and Rommel would have had to retreat to avoid being cut off by the Americans.This book tends to make the same mistake. It does not weigh the various campaigns and look at their realistic strategic effect. One of the more interesting books published on the second world war is Second Front Now 1943 by Dunn. It shows how Germany was vulnerable to an assault across the channel in 1943 as they had transferred their reserves to participate in Manstien's &quot;Back Hand Blow&quot; attack. The allied strategy of invading Africa and Italy was a poor use of resources and allowed smaller German units to tie up allied forces until the end of the war. David Eisenhower makes this point in the biography of his father and shows that Germany was able to occupy Italy after the defection and then to fight one of the more successful delaying actions of the war. An Invasion of France would probably have ended the war in 1943 and perhaps led to a better outcome for Eastern Europe.It would now seem clear that the British strategic bombing campaign was a failure. This does not seem to have been picked up by the authors. They do however make the interesting suggestion that the German U Boat campaign was a failure and should never been attempted. During the war and immediately after most commentators thought that the U Boats had come close to cutting the Atlantic sea routes. One of Clay Blair's achievements was to show that this was not the case. This however was is different from a suggestion that the enterprise was a waste of time. It would have been interesting for the authors to back up their assertion with more material."},{"Title":"A war to be won: Fighting the Second World War","review":"My Fourth of July weekend was ruined socially because I couldn't pull myself away from this exceptional book. It covers the waterfront as well as the horizon with messy tales and sweeping accounts of how hard it was to win a glorious war. Personality disorders of many leading military figures were not the least of the problem. Bradley comes across as nearly demented with Patton-envy. Patton was virtually the only allied leader who prefered to kill Germans over seizing more territory. Mark Clark would paint bridges to impress his superiors, even with a war raging. One supposes the rocks were next, given enough whitewash and time. German forces collapsed the moment of surrender, not one hour sooner. This casts doubt on those who say the Nazi regime was demoralized in the face of defeat. Perhaps the greatest allied general of them all? Slim. Unsung heroes? The soviet leaders on the eastern front who became operational masters. One suspects if political correctness had been in place during WWII, we might all be speaking German."},{"Title":"A war to be won: Fighting the Second World War","review":"This is a very good military history of the Second World War.

There is much in here that even those who have seen previous Vuillard exhibitions will find new.My one complaint is the enormous size and weight of the book which certainly helps with the reproductions but makes it difficult to read the extremely useful text which carries (successfully) the argument for reconsideration. Be it noted that the reproductions are of such high quality that they recreate the feel of Vuillard's surfaces which are a great pleasure.One of the finest art books I have ever seen and a major contribution."},{"Title":"Edouard Vuillard (Library of Great Painters)","review":"The career of this French painter and photographer spanned the first four decades of the 20th century and produced a wealth of works.

It helps you avoid pitfalls and shows you numerous insightful ways to sell your house faster and for more money.One bit of advice that stood out to me was to fix, and not replace, problems in your house. Irwin provides a list of common house problems, and the cost of both fixing and replacing. His list consists of:leaky roof - $500 to $1,500 to fix, and $5,000 to $15,000 to replace.broken furnace - $200 to $1,200 to fix, and $2,000 to $3,500 to replace.broken air conditioner - $200 to $1,000 to fix, and $1,000 to $3,500 to replace.In the book, this useful list goes on.Irwin identifies two good reasons to not replace problems:1. Buyers won't be able to see the work you've done, and buyers won't pay for what they can't see. If you pay $5,000 to buy a new air conditioning system, the buyer's likely reaction will be, \\"Great, it's your house and you should maintain it. But don't expect me to pay 10 cents extra in price because you've done work that you were supposed to do.\\"2. Buyers may not like your replacement choice.I also really like his section on how to utilize the $250,000 tax exeption when selling your house. This is available to anyone who has lived in a house at least 2 of the last 5 years. Presently, I am fixing up a house that I live in, and I plan to use this exemption.

Unfortunately, the content of this book comes nowhere close to the promise of said title.The author uses English to in his Preface, in the titles of his charts, and then to identify the broadest of classifications of known schools of Buddhism and subsequent writers such as Asvaghosa, Nagarjuna, Asanga and Vasubandhu. Unfortunately, he leaves all of the particulars in their original Pali and Sanskrit, only rarely translating any of these terms into English. Most of the pages in this volume are only half-used, leaving plenty of space available for translations and expositions.While it is difficult not to pick up a few Pali and Sanskrit terms when studying the many books that have been written about Buddhism, this is a publication that can only be appreciated with a Pali-English and Sanskrit-English dictionary at hand.The author mentions in his Preface that he hopes to publish a volume entitled, \\"History of Buddhism and Buddhist Philosophy.\\" If he hopes for a wider English audience, let's hope that he puts a little more time and effort into that work.Unless you are a Pali/Sanskrit scholar, or have the time to sit with the aforementioned dictionaries, I do not recommend the purchase of this book. Let us hope someone else becomes intrigued with the title of this text and develops it in a way that will prove useful to us all."},{"Title":"A Dictionary of Science","review":"I've used this for over 40 years.It has served me well and still does.Although very far from current ,it has an historical perspective that is still very useful."},{"Title":"Electromagnetic fields and the life environment","review":"this small condensed book covers a lot of ground as to the effects of manmade electromagnetic emmissions.although based on the knowledge of the 70's it is right on the mark and one can only wish more attention was paid to this book by those creating the problems of today!"},{"Title":"Quick and Easy Home Sewing Projects","review":"I checked this book out of the library because I was looking for quick and easy sewing projects for curtains. Imagine my surprise when out of the 10 window treatment projects (I didn't count the tieback), 5 of them took between 6-8 hours. I don't know about you, but I don't consider 8 hours a quick and easy project! LOL.Several projects stated 3 hours or less, but I wonder if that time is accurate for the average or beginner sewer. There were several pillows, one of which was a round pillow with piping, zipper and a center button (pg 98). I don't know if 3 hours is a realistic time frame for this pillow on the round, especially if you've never done piping.The reason I chose this title is that almost the entire book seems to be populated with photos of projects that use some VERY outdated looking fabrics (huge florals, ugly calico prints and pom-pom trim). I initially thought this was possibly from the early 90's.The reason I did give it 3 stars was that the directions were pretty clear and there were a few cute projects where you would not have to envision a different fabric:-- pleated lampshade w/beaded trim (pg 124)-- silk panel pillow with braiding (pg 92)-- above-mentioned circular pillowI think you can find a book with beautiful projects and simple instructions and just skip this one."},{"Title":"Quick and Easy Home Sewing Projects","review":"I like Gloria Nicol a lot. Her taste is cottage/country/vintage style, similar to Lucinda Ganderton or Christina Strutt. Her choice of colors is pretty, simple, and cute (not gaudy). I find her ideas refreshing and inspiring. I love the calico, ticking and floral prints she uses for her pillows, seat cusions, etc. The instructions are easy enough to follow for a beginner sewer like myself. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Quick and Easy Home Sewing Projects","review":"I checked this book out of my local library and was delighted with the projects. It had unique and original ideas for things to beautify your home. The fabrics they used and the colors they picked were gorgeous (I, too, like country cottage styles) and inspired me to try new things. I tried to make the pillowcase with cover buttons and mine came out GREAT! I sleep on it every night and it makes me smile to know I made it myself! The instructions and photos were clear and well-written. This book would be good for intermediate to advanced sewers. I liked it so much I just bought it on Amazon so I will have it to refer to in the future.If you are looking to add personality and your own personal style to your home, this book is a good resource."},{"Title":"The Stormwatcher","review":"This novel, originally published in the U.K. in 1998, concerns a group of friends vacationing at a remote house in the French countryside. High-powered executive James, who suffers from an unknown chronic illness, his French wife Sabine, their two children Beth and Jessie, James' secretary Rachel, with whom he has had an affair sometime in the past, James' longtime friend Matt, who was employed by James until he was ostensibly made redundant, and Matt's wife Chrissie, whose open sexuality tends to make people uncomfortable. The story centers around Jessie, the precocious, disturbed eleven year-old who is being secretly tutored in forbidden knowledge by a mysterious instructor. Jessie becomes the catalyst for increased tensions and rapidly fraying relationships among the adults, all of whom have secrets from one another. The approaching storm in the title takes on more than one meaning...It's hard to put a label on this book. Though there are a couple very frightening sequences and a lot of suspense, it's not horror. Nor does dark fantasy seem appropriate. Magical realism? Perhaps. There are some events of questionable reality, but whether they are literal or psychological aberrations is open to debate. What it most certainly is is a fascinating relationship drama involving some extraordinarily well-realized characters, and a dark-edged mystery. The story itself is brilliantly constructed almost in a puzzle-like fashion. The background of Jessie's instructor is told in a parallel narrative to the main story, until it all comes full circle at the end, evoking a kind of symmetry. Novels rarely come as perfect as this. I can't say enough about Graham Joyce. This is the third consecutive novel I've read of his and they just get better.This Night Shade Books edition is signed and limited to 1000 copies."},{"Title":"If You're Afraid of the Dark, Remember the Night Rainbow","review":"We recieved this book as a gift after a major tragedy.

Today, as an adult, I still keep it by my bedside.

It's a question that's been the bane of philosophers and their science since Plato. Descartes said, \\"I drink therefore I am,\\" but his inquiry stopped there. To this day the philosophic community had concluded bleakly that it is a subject of such metaphysical complexity that the search will remain forever endless ... that is until now. Bert Witte, the author and illustrator of the new book of cartoons, You're a Real Wine Lover When... puts the issue to bed without its supper with Witte's astounding collection of aphorisms visa vi: \\"you're a real wine lover when.....you even store your automobile in French Oak\\"..Award winning Dutch cartoonist, Bert Witte, brings together his scathing wit, his brilliantly ridiculous caricatures and a deep love of wine in his newest collections of cartoons, perfectly timed to cure your holiday blues. And admit it, you got \`em bad. Be warned: Mr. Witte has permanently offended even the most smugly confident wine snobs. Be sure to check out the anatomically anomalous \\"Mr. Corkscrew\\" on page 16.Bert Witte tackles the tough subjects in wine (and gives them a snuggy); the glass, the bottle and the label, sampling and tasting wine, wine production, how to handle wine before, during and after dinner and common and unusual wine situations for the accident prone wine lover. Each area is given its proper drubbing. This new collection is wine's \\"Far Side\\"."},{"Title":"You're a Real Wine Lover When...","review":"If you love wine, then you will get a kick out of these cartoons!

However, upon reading it and having students to use it as their sole aid for learning solvent extraction, it may be a little difficult to penetrate. The different authors, each excellent chemists and masters of solvent extraction, have written different chapters and it is sometimes difficult to see the red line of the subject. If the book is used as a reference book for people already understanding the principles of solvent extraction and they only want to have some detailed question answered, this book is very good. For the case of teaching solvent extraction, my recommendation is to use this book and complement it with detailed lectures to give students the chain of events and explanations that are needed upon learning a new subject."},{"Title":"In freedom's cause;: A story of Wallace and Bruce","review":"This is a truly inspirational book. I believe this book describes one of the great events in all of human history. For any parent who wants to give their child a view of the world outside their strip-mall laden nieghborhood, they should dedicate themselves to reading this story to them. My youngest is only 7 years old and he loved this book! The only caveat I have is this book, like all Henty books, details many graphic battles. However, the main character demonstrates bravery, leadership, loyalty and ingenuity- traits we'd all love to see built into our kids. I can't recommend this book highly enough."},{"Title":"In freedom's cause;: A story of Wallace and Bruce","review":"Freedom's Cause has a brilliant plot and a fictional character as the protaganist. He starts off as a teen and then grows up through the time of William Wallace and Robert the Bruce. The fictional protagonist interacts with historical characters from that period of Scottish History. The story is full of adventure, friendship, loyalty, honor, heroics, and history. Good values are presented. This book is great for anyone looking for something on Scottish history and which also is an outstanding novel.This book is as excellent or better then any Nigel Tranter book I have read, like The Wallace and The Bruce Trilogy.The accuracy of the historical period is superb and I have read much on this area of Scottish history. The persons discussed, the geography talked about, and the timeline presented is very accurate.I highly recommend this and can't wait to read another Henty."},{"Title":"In freedom's cause;: A story of Wallace and Bruce","review":"This book is one of the greatest I have ever read.Taking place in medieval Scotland, it follows the many adventures of Sir Archie Forbes, a young scotsman who is determined to see his people free from the tyranny of England. Archie meets up with William Wallace and Robert the Bruce, Falls in love, and has many adventures. I loved this book, and i'm sure anyone who reads it will feel the same!"},{"Title":"In freedom's cause;: A story of Wallace and Bruce","review":"This book is one of the most fascinating and interesting to readers who care about the past. For people who do not like history or to learn about the exciting feats accomplished by our predeseccors, I do not reccomend this book.The story is about young Archie Forbes, a young man destined to be cheif of his clan. His father was killed when Archie was just a boy and his lands taken away by the Kerr family, nobles from nearby England. While Archie is determined to reclaim his family's lands he meets William Wallace and helps in the scottish revolution."},{"Title":"In freedom's cause;: A story of Wallace and Bruce","review":"This book has open my mind to Henty and the Renaissance. Not only does the writer incredibly and accurately describe the scene but also the characters like it is real life! Once picked up, it is impossible to put down. Archie, Wallace, Bruce and all the others take captive your thoughts. This book is highly reccomended because knowing about history accurately is vital. This book does all of that!"},{"Title":"In freedom's cause;: A story of Wallace and Bruce","review":"This is the best book I have read in a long time. G.A.

He loved it and highly recommends this book!"},{"Title":"In freedom's cause;: A story of Wallace and Bruce","review":"I highly reccommend G.A. Henty's In Freedom's cause to anyone age 10 and up who likes to read historical fiction. William Wallace, Robert the Bruce, and a ficticious charactor, Archibald Forbes, take the leading roles in fighting battles to stop the powerful English from taking over Scotland. This book is very closely based on factual hiistorical events. When England is very close to taking over scotland, William Wallace and Robert the Bruce fight overwhelming odds to get back their homeland."},{"Title":"In freedom's cause;: A story of Wallace and Bruce","review":"This is a very pleasureable book. Henty uses the medium of a fictional character to give us an intimate portrait of the life of William Wallace and Robert Bruce. Henty lays out the story with enough history to be accurate, but enough action to keep you awake. Although some may find it somewhat juvenille in approach, it is well written so as not to exclude all but his intended young audience. The language is somewhat archaic, but not overly difficult if one is familiar with the English language. All in all it is a fun book, and a must read for any fan of Wallace, Bruce, and the Scottish people."},{"Title":"In freedom's cause;: A story of Wallace and Bruce","review":"I highly recommend this book to any lovers of historical adventure stories. The story is fast paced and carries you along with Archie in his adventures. Have a good map of Scotland and England handy to look up places as you read. Great way to learn history and geography!Becky Maxwell"},{"Title":"In freedom's cause;: A story of Wallace and Bruce","review":"Old need NOT mean boring. Think of Henty's style as \\"Jane Austen meets Kipling.\\" This book chronicles not only the life and times of William \\"Braveheart\\" Wallace, but also Robert the Bruce, King of Scotland, as seen through the eyes of a fictional hero. Well researched, the history buff will also enjoy this novel of derring-do. Of course, Henty wrote in the convention of his day, but this only makes the book more quaint. His love interest is present, but gentlemanly written, much as Sir Walter Scott handled the lovers in \\"Ivanhoe.\\" It is slow going at first, but once the main character (Sir Archibald Forbes)is introduced, the book comes alive. I suggest one google a map of Scotland to see exactly WHERE all this takes place, as the book well and truly covers a lot of years and territory. ENJOY."},{"Title":"In freedom's cause;: A story of Wallace and Bruce","review":"Very good book. Having read this book after the one titled \\"brief history of Scotland\\", it gave me a good depth on the history of scotland.

This was the choice the people of Scotland in the 13th century faced if they rose up against their English ruler. Most would say it was no choice at all. Many of the Scottish nobles were English supporters. Few could be expected to rise up against the numerically overwhelming English army. The hero of the story, Archibald Forbes, joins the struggle for Scottish freedom led by the valiant Sir William Wallace and Robert the Bruce. The extraordinary valor and personal prowess of these men rival the deeds of the mythical heroes of chivalry."},{"Title":"In freedom's cause;: A story of Wallace and Bruce","review":"it was interesting nice to see it form another persons perspective. would read again and recommend for another to give it a go"},{"Title":"In freedom's cause;: A story of Wallace and Bruce","review":"I was hoping for more historical information.

If I find myself needing to know every detail, I can always find the historical info elsewhere. This was my first e-book, and most of it was read on my phone during a vacation. I found myself getting caught up in the action, and that is always a good thing. It was sometimes a bit hard to get through the language of the period in which this book was written, but not impossible. It was easily as enjoyable as \\"Braveheart,\\" if not more so.

While the background is not fiction, it has the benefit of reading with the ease of a novel as it follows the adventures of the fictitious Sir Archie Forbes as he teams with the real William Wallace.

Tomlin's 2 book series.It's easier to read & although it's been fleshed out with more fictional characters (to make the action a bit better) the history still rings true."},{"Title":"In freedom's cause;: A story of Wallace and Bruce","review":"I have read a half dozen of Henty's (seventy or more) books. They are formula works that cast an admirable youth into the caldron of historical conflicts. Henty's purpose is to tell morally uplifting tales of perseverance and honor while teaching otherwise accurate history for the audience of young adults.This book is the best I have read both of Henty's work and of Scotland under the Hammer. Think Kipling's book Kim, set in Scotland, where Kim winds up a mighty warrior and then a wealthy lord. Be sure to read Henty's work next to a computer where you can pop up maps of the various unfamiliar locals of the story.This book covers Scotland's resistance to the reign of Edward I of England. From the Scottish perspective Edward I, the greatest of the Plantagenets, the creator of the nation of England, the Hammer of Scotland was not a nice person.The greatness of this Edward is undeniable. He created the empire that came to rule the world. The cruelty of Edward is beyond the imagining of most modern minds. He really did hang Wallace for a while, then take the still living man down and have him disemboweled, then cut into four pieces and sent to the four largest cities in Scotland. Five pieces actually, he kept the head and put it on a pike outside the gate of some castle. A Scottish noble's wife who aided in the crowning of Bruce was then suspended alive in a cage over the gate of another castle...for years. And that was standard treatment for resistance to Edward's plans.Henty covers this history through the life of a young man who serves the fabulous Wallace and the unwilling nationalist hero Bruce. And through it all, as in all Henty's books, the young hero remains good of heart, powerful of arm, and loyal to all he loves. How is that for a refreshing twist in historical fiction?As historical fiction goes...this one is right up there."},{"Title":"In freedom's cause;: A story of Wallace and Bruce","review":"This KID saves the life of William Wallace TWICE! It just so happens that Henty fits his characters into history and manages to make them do a host of fabulous deeds without it changing the course of history at all. Well, anyway, this is just children's fiction. So, in that sense it is OK. For those, say, under age 13 it might even be interesting--fascinating, for many."},{"Title":"In freedom's cause;: A story of Wallace and Bruce","review":"hello,well i found this book boring, and very hard to read for someone has trouble reading...i love history but i just think this book was HORRIBLE....I had to read it for a book report..and i am still having trouble writing the book report...again HORRIBLE..dont' get it"},{"Title":"Deal with a Ghost","review":"this book presents the question: can history repeat itself? i suppose it was thought-provoking on some levels, but it wasn't exactly top-quality literature. a good book for teens, but readers looking for some more elite material should avoid this book."},{"Title":"Deal with a Ghost","review":"This story was very well written and, throughout it, a question was posed. The question was: Can history repeat itself? Continuously throughout the novel you wonder if Deal will make the same mistake in her present life that both her mother and grandmother made in their past lives. As a high school student, I felt that this novel was truthfully written and can easily be compared to the life of either someone who has stole a boy or girlfriend or to someone has lost a boy or girlfriend."},{"Title":"Human Society in Ethics and Politics","review":"Most Americans would see Lord Russell's work in ethics as viewed from the right. Russell is forthright in his consequentialism harkening all the way back to Bentham in his preferred treatment of criminals almost as irritating entities that merely need correction.From the left, I suppose he would look like a generic J.S. Mill echo chamber but with more data perhaps. He is clearly a British aristocrat which makes his view somewhat biased. Having seldomly seen what it is like among the lower classes who scramble for what they get, Russell tends to underemphasize &quot;the rules of the game,&quot; as a more Hobbesian perspective would indicate.The book is extremely concise, given its breadth and scope. Russell has demonstrated lexical efficiency that is almost shocking, given his other works.If you major in philosophy, or if you have liberal humanist politics, the book is worth the time it takes to read.

It is not a very deep or probing analysis of any particular problem, nor a carefully researched or detailed account; moreso it is the well-intentioned pontifications of an preternaturally rational and brilliant man with an abiding compassion for humankind. It's more \\"Uncle Bertie weighs in on the problems of humanity\\".Some say Russell's heavy lifting is really only done in his works on math and logic, and this is probably true. This book I think would support that claim. Still, there are some pleasant reflections in it for all it's glosses and generalizations."},{"Title":"Total Dragon Ball Z","review":"This book is so cool.It has BIOS for more than 300 characters! Many of whom I'd never heard of.There's also storylines for Dragon Ball and Dragon Ball GT, which we haven't seen yet in the U.S. There's a funny section on who'd play who if the U.S. made a movie on DBZ. Info on Super Saiyan evolution, and a ton more.The graphics are good too, and you get free 3D glasses."},{"Title":"Total Dragon Ball Z","review":"Hi DBZ fans! If you're looking for a magazine with tons of articles, lots of pictures,bios that last twenty pages, and an extra bonus section, you just hit the jackpot. To brief you on DBZ, it's about alien races, advanced technology and the good old fight scenes. I can't tell you all of it, but watch five episodes and learn away. It's got a 3D section, but be careful not to lose the glasses.It tells about the confusing stages of the Super Saiyan (or saya-jin) and gives summaries so that you don't have to wait until reruns. Do you get Goten and Gohan mixed up? Not after you're done reading this. Do you forget who can use the Kamehahmeha wave? Not after you read this. After I read this magazine, I knew so much about DragonballZ my friends were jealous. Seriously. If you want to be admired for being a DBZ genius, this is perfect. If you like the card game but it confuses you, buy this. And if you just like the pictures, this is also perfect. So it's perfect no matter what I review so just Buy it! Trust me, I'm a fan."},{"Title":"Total Dragon Ball Z","review":"Pojo (the people who made this book) really outdid themselves. This book has a two sentence title for every episode.

Oh, and it also has a description for every single character."},{"Title":"Total Dragon Ball Z","review":"As a previous viewer stated, this really is nothing more than a glorified magazine.I've gone throuh it, cover-to-cover, and I'm wondering if these people have actually SEEN dragonball z. There are numerous problems with it. Errors, mispellings, innaccurate information.Let's start with the errors. I'm convinced that the authors are little more than American DBZ viewers who have seen a Japanese episode once or twice. The information looks like it was copied directly from a website, complete with mispellings and all. The \\"biographies\\" are short, and rarely state anything meaningful or interesting (\\"Bra is the daughter of Vegeta and Bulma\\"). Yet another problem : Is it just me, or do poser magazines struggle to get real images? Numerous (100+) of the images in this book are terrible screenshots that are blurry, fuzzy, or grainy (Many so terrible you can hardly make out what it's a picture of).The synopsis of Dragonball/Dragonball Z/Dragonball GT is not very good either. The author's have a rather snobby view of American fans and a high view of themselves who have, quote, \\"Seen the REAL version [of DBZ]\\". Pojo, get off of it. Not even the card game guide is good, with poor strategies and being very outdated. I'm not even gonna start on the pathetic 3-D images thing.That said, I really do praise Pojo for trying. It's much better than anything Becket or some other magazine company has tried to put out. However, hopefully they will revise it, knowing that DBZ fans are one of the most difficult to please.Here's the bottom line, for the type of people who would spend $9 on a magazine, I think they will be very pleased. Kids/Teens who are fans of the English version of Dragon Ball Z and are not picky about tiny details will be satisfied. I'm just warning those would consider this a valid source for information. In short, information accurate enough to satisfy those who don't know better, but not on par with some of the stuff that can be found on the internet."},{"Title":"Total Dragon Ball Z","review":"This is one of Pojo's early Dragon Ball Z Books.Here's a quick summary of what you'll find inside:Dragon Ball Basic - Everything you wanted to know about Dragon BallsDragon Ball 101 - A summary of the manga (comic book), which differs slightly from the TV show.DBZ - Episode summaries of the first 137 TV shows.DBGT - History & SummaryVideo Game ReviewsCollectible Card Game informationand about 40 pages of Bios.

It is referred to as such in the&quot;book&quot; itself. Despite the fact that the authors complainabout grammatical errors on the DVD inserts, it is quickly obvious theNOBODY took the time to proof-read THIS book! The series Dragon Ballis summarized with so little detail that the reader is left none thewiser. The same is true of the summary of Dragon Ball GT.Themain focus of the book, DBZ, also suffers from confusing and errorridden capsule synopses of the episodes--though not ALL of theepisodes, only the first 137--why? I don't know. The series has beenout of production for years. Character names are mixed-up fromparagraph to paragraph, not to mention the spelling of same (as if thestory isn't confusing enough. Instead of wasting so much space on 3-Dimages, a little (A LOT) more detail would have been welcome.The&quot;book&quot; discusses the video and DVD releases, but doesn'teven give you a guide to the titles that have been released.

I bought this book without really looking at it first... what a mistake! Of the 370 total pages, the first 114 pages are about installing the Slackware CD included in the back cover (installing and configuring Linux was covered in the first of this series of books). Those 114 pages might have been better used to cover &quot;programming&quot; in Linux. The 2nd chapter [C Programming Tools and Linux] goes from page 115 to page 134 (less than 18 pages of content). The 3rd chapter [X Windows Programming] goes from page 135 to page 179 (less than 44 pages of content). Chapter 4 [Using Tcl] goes from page 181 to page 201 (less than 19 pages). And so on... The book tries to cover too much. Most of the information is not even useful for doing anything, not even introductory in nature.

Of course, contracts is not the lightest course to assimilate, but I frequently wondered why so many cases and few explanations, instead of the opposite? I'm sure it's possible to learn contract law from this, but if it weren't for the Law School Legends Contracts on tape I probably would not have remembered the dozens and dozens of cases about the same principle. Please, next time attempt READABILITY! If I were a contracts lawyer already I probably would not be buying the casebook, I'd try a treatise!"},{"Title":"Basic contract law, (American casebook series)","review":"First, you must consider that a) this is a law school casebook, it's not meant to be light reading, and b) my review might be somewhat tained by the fact that I've taken a Contracts course taught by Mel (an awesome lecturer), but: this is a more clearly organized and well edited casebook than most.The cases are well chosen and often paired in contrast to illustrate the few most common views courts have on a particular rule of Contract, usually with a full case first of the majority view and a few short &quot;squib&quot; cases after for emerging or fading perspectives. It's up to date with cases on electronic signatures and shrinkwrap licenses.The commentary after each section is readable and lucid. The organization is clear -- Eisenberg himself lectured straight through the book and it made for what seemed like a solid, complete course, focusing mostly on the full-length cases. If you're planning on teaching Contracts, I'd take a good look at Mel's book."},{"Title":"Basic contract law, (American casebook series)","review":"Of all the textbooks I've ever had in law school and undergraduate classes, this book is likely the most frustating and the worst.The entire book shows complete disregard for the fact that the book is meant to teach concepts unknown to the reader - not to provide review for those who already know. New legal terms are introduced not by telling a general meaning, but rather by including a case that uses the term repeatedly without defining it. Only after the case is there any attempt at giving a general and helpful attempt at a definition.Also, instead of discussing neatly in a paragraph that some courts treat a rule slightly differently, the authors put many short excerpts of cases. They add little to the reader's understanding of a concept or rule - at least not any more than a one sentence comment would along with a citation. It is also very repetitive.The authors seem to fear that writing on their own (in place of reprinting excerpts of cases) is somehow less valid or helpful to a law student. Nothing could be farther from the truth. Judges do not write opinions with the sole aim of teaching law students contract law. So to rely on them as if they did seems to be uncalled for.For those who say this book isn't that bad, have put the bar far too low and also miss the point. There is no requirement that legal textbooks be dry, unorganized, or unhelpful. They can convey the information without playing hard-to-get by hiding things in cases and a poor format. The authors must be more interested or passionate about contract law than their book shows. Overall, this book has lists and lists of cases, but no more - suggesting no understanding of the purpose of a text book."},{"Title":"Basic contract law, (American casebook series)","review":"Great, came in as expected. had aya edwenlwekdewpodkl \\\\e\\\\[2l;lqwkmd;l ldm,;kdm ;d;'d 'de ;de;d e;dm,e ;dme 'd';l ew; e;dl me;d e"},{"Title":"Basic contract law, (American casebook series)","review":"Just what I needed for class.

It's subtitle is Students with Disabilities and Standards-based Reform. In the midst of the outcry from politicians and parents for reform of the public school system, one group has been steadfastly ignored. That is those who have disabilities. For example, the American Association for the Advancement of Science put out a book in 1990 called Science for All Americans...Project 2061. This book stressed many of the much needed reforms concerning science literacy, but in their forward they mentioned every neglected group EXCEPT the disabled. Now since then, the AAAS has changed their lists of neglected groups to include the disabled, but a friend at the National Science Foundation who is blind, said that he went to a Congressional Meeting on school reform and especially science reform, and once again Congress neglected to mention including the disabled. As a Deaf person who struggled with bad attitudes of teachers and professors, interpreters with no training in science, outright illegal behavior on the part of two Universities, and being active in accessiblity and discrimination groups, I know how hard it is going to be to get the reforms and the eductional society together in such a way to make them work together. This book is a good first step towards that goal. The National Research Council has done its statistical work on just how many disabled drop out of school and are unemployed, due directly to educators who ignore them at best and have no intention of including those with disabilities in this march for better educational systems in the U.S. What neither Congress or educators seem to understand is that the impact of education which is below par and doesn't include the disabled in the reforms will ultimately be paid for by the American public. The disabled want to work, want to be part of society, and want to be accepted for who they are, not for what educators think they should become (ie., Deaf turning into English speakers). We also want the chance to choose for ourselves the right to make decisions as to what we want to spend our lifetime doing. For all educators, this book is a must-read since the inclusion movement is gaining momentum, and regular teachers are going to see us, the disabled, in their classes, and in regular universities. Neither we or the Americans with Disabilities Act is going away, and educators better be prepared for dealing with diverse students in their classes. This book will help them achieve that goal.

Fass is the only study yet available on the subject. The book is useful for the accurate information which it contains despite that the fact that it also contains an abundance of inaccurate \\"facts,\\" distortions, and willful omissions - all which support the author's ideological prejudices (which clearly lean heavily toward utopian/collectivist child-rearing by bureaucracies).The book's errors are legion; therefore only a small sample can be mentioned in a brief review. Fass claims the Philadelphia Charley Ross kidnapping of 1874 is America's first ransom kidnapping of a child (or the first \\"fully constructed\\" case, whatever is meant by that). In truth, the Pool case of 1819 qualifies as perhaps the first nationally known case (date of kidnapping: May 20, 1819, Baltimore, Md.). The Pool case does not, however, suit the author's ideological purposes. Nancy Gamble and Marie Thomas, the kidnappers of little 20-month-old Margaret Pool were females who physically abused their tiny victim.Throughout the book, Professor Fass makes broad claims that are not supported with a lick of evidence. One of these false claims is her generalization that women are seldom kidnappers for ransom, sadistic purposes, child labor purposes (prostitution, entertainment, servants). This is untrue.Deceptive rhetoric abounds in \\"Kidnapped: Child Abduction in America.\\" In the book's introductory chapter, the \\"myth\\" of Gypsy kidnapping is compared to the Medieval \\"blood libel\\" against the Jews, allowing the reader to get the impression that the myth of Jewish kidnappers for child sacrifice and the myth of Gypsy child kidnapping are similar in type and origin. In truth, \\"blood libel\\" is based on prejudice, while the \\"myth\\" of Gypsy kidnapping is based on fact. Gypsies have long practiced child kidnapping and a great many documented cases exist -- throughout the 19th century well into the late middle 20th century.A number of the author's claims regarding the sub-category of child abduction, parental kidnapping, are outright fabrications: such as the assertions that parental kidnapping was not taken seriously in the early 20th century(utterly false) and further that during the 20s and 30s only cases involving rich and famous were reported by the press (utterly false. cases involving people of all classes were in the news constantly). The fact is that already in the early 1900s, parental kidnapping was the subject of long newspaper articles which treated the phenomenon as a serious social problem (see: \\"Love Proves Superior to Courts Decrees,\\" nationally syndicated, including Marble Rock Press (Io.), Dec. 12, 1907; \\"Parental Love That Laughs at Court Decree,\\" nationally syndicated, including Jun. 11, 1910, Evening Press (Sheboygen, Wi.)).One of the more egregious distortions to be found in \\"Kidnapped: Child Abduction in America,\\" involves the 1874 Ross case. It deals with the fact that before a ransom demand had been made, police had begun searching for the missing Charlie in the Italian neighborhood. Fass tells her readers that the measure was taken based on \\"unsavory\\" stereotypes. The facts was that at the time Philadelphia was known to house a large population of \\"Padrones\\" who had left New York to escape prosecution there. Padrones were child slavers, who imported (kidnapped or purchased) children from Italy for the purpose of begging under the control of their masters. Many children were tortured and even mutilated (to make them more pitiful sights in order to attract alms). The scandal was so great that New York, in direct response to the Padrone racket, amended their kidnapping law to cover foreign-born victims.Fass, because of her predilection for applying present-day of moral preferences toward ethnic groups (ie: \\"politically correct\\" politics) ends up falsifying history and consequently cruelly diminishes the actual struggles of minority people. In the case of Italian-American child kidnapping of the later \\"Black Hand\\" period -- also ignored by Fass -- it was honest Italian immigrants who were preyed upon by Italian criminals. It was not unusual for poor parents to be victims of ransom demands of whatever sum was \\"appropriate\\" for the working class. The suffering of these innocent Italian victims was immense, involving a huge number of crimes over a period of decades.Professor Fass, by pretending that 1874 was the beginning of ransom kidnapping, the author manages to \\"historically cleanse\\" the rich and important history of child kidnapping of the 1830s-1860s, a period in which ransom child kidnapping gangs operated in Philadelphia, New York and elsewhere by erase inconvenient truths that violate her politically correct agenda. Likewise glossed over the issue of the kidnapping of the pre-Civil War children of free black parents -- despite the fact that the phenomenon was not absolutely separate from the other forms of child kidnapping that occurred concurrently.In the book's front material the author discloses that the book's writing was generously supported by a number of research grants, yet the final product proves that little research was actually done. The writing is quite good, but the scholarship is reprehensibly shoddy and its tendentiousness -- which fosters ignorance -- is dangerous.It is an alarming fact that of the several long academic reviews of the book that have been published none even so much at hints that the \\"facts\\" that Fass reports in her book might need more looking into (let alone that her endnotes routinely fail to support her claims with evidence). Apart from some disagreements concerning the interpretive approach (rather than questioning the factual data per se), her colleagues swallow the falsehoods -- hook, line and sinker -- without even a whimper of dissent.The author states that the problem of child kidnapping is an overrated one which should not be considered as important as many people think it is. Her book is designed to obfuscate the historical past in order to make her opinion seem to be based on historical fact, giving the overall impression that the book ought to be \\"the last word\\" on the history of the subject. As such, its dishonesty causes it to fail as even a \\"first word.\\"The book is a travesty and must, at some point, be replaced with a thorough, properly researched and honest work of scholarship. Until then, policy makers, academics and other readers will be subjected to a grossly propagandistic book whose publication can be best be described as an act of \\"kidnapping memory.\\""},{"Title":"Kidnapped: Child Abduction in America","review":"If you're really interested in missing children and child kidnappings, like I am, this is definately the book for you. It begins with the heartbreaking 1874 ransom abduction of Charley Ross from Pennsylvania. His father refused to pay the ransom, not because he didn't love his son, but because he thought kidnappers should not profit from their crime. Charley never returned home. The next chapter is about the Lindbergh baby, then Leopold and Loeb, and so on. It ends with modern kidnappings: Etan Patz, Kevin Collins and Polly Klaas. There's also a chapter on parental abduction. In other words, this book is very extensive.While it's a very \\"academic\\" book, it's not dull like a textbook. I found it very entertaining, with a nice centerfold of photographs. This book should definately have a place on anybody's true crime shelf."},{"Title":"Kidnapped: Child Abduction in America","review":"This is not easy reading, particularly for a left-behind parent who may have had to or continues to endure the terrorizing tragedy of child abduction or kidnapping (they are two very seperate but painful events, and are dealt with in the courts differently). In 'Kidnapped: Child Abduction in America' by Paula S. Fass, readers are brought into a historical perspective on how society deals with the abduction and wrongful removal of a child, and how this perception has moved the courts in different ways. Fass brings out a very important issue in this meaningful, yet painful book: what is the role of the media in abduction, and how has the role of the public voice directed the subjectivity of the various courts who are charged with overseeing such cases. Importantly, the author also points out that though the law is objective in theory, how the courts have handled abduction is subjective.What is missing, is an in-depth understanding of what a left-behind parent can do for themselves while seaching for a child. Emotionally, physically, spiritually, and financially most left-behind parents are left with scars no words could ever express. The turmoil brought onto a parent, yet alone a child, is unbearable. And for some, always with the safety of the child first and foremost, it may not be easy or suggested that a left-behind parent speaks directly to the press due to concern of their child's safety.Nevertheless, this is an invigorating book, and the stories presented, painful. When you see one of those fund raisers for an organization involved with missing children, do not think twice about helping. If you're a parent involved with a search, keep your faith. Sometimes its the only thing one can hold onto. Again, keep your faith.Well done, and thank you for bringing the issues of child abduction and child kidnapping out further into the public light."},{"Title":"Freemasonry in the American Revolution","review":"In the beginning this book seemed to have potential.

The music of Poe is undeniable - and his memorable lines remain rhythmically in mind. \\" The glory that was Greece,and the grandeur that was Rome \\" \\" Said the Raven, \\"Nevermore\\" And then too \\"In her home by the sea, Annnabel Lee\\".But the great innovator in literature, inventor of the modern mystery tale, the tale of ratiocination, the psychological thriller, is Poe the storyteller.But unlike many readers I am not a particular fan of fictional horror, feeling that life itself supplies enough of this particular quality. So I can remember even in grade - school not really taking to the \\"Fall of the House of Usher\\" or \\"The Tell- Tale Heart\\" because being at the time a very scared person who had a lot of fear in his world, I did not want fictional fear to augment what I already had.I also did not like the vague mystery, the sense of looming threat and non- understanding which seemed to me to come with these stories. But of course one particular reader's emotional predilections do not define what a writer truly is. For many these tales of mystery and horror are Literature at its most interesting and fulfilling.For me Poe's fiction had a weirdness about it which too could be connected with this strange step-son's biography. The expulsion and formal failure at school, the strange love for the child- bride, the haunting sense of loss in love. And then too the dissolution and drunkenness , the wasting away.To my mind Poe is not on the level of the greatest American writers but lingers a bit below threatening them. All that is warm, tender, humane and normal seems somehow outside the universe of Poe. To make an unfair comparison. Tolstoy too was driven by his demons and at times verged on a kind of madness. But he gives us a world in love and feeling and beauty that Poe does not come close to knowing.Nonetheless Poe is a genius of literary creation, and his works richly reward the reader in their magnetic and fascinating beauty -"},{"Title":"Complete Stories and Poems of Edgar Allan Poe","review":"Not being a literary expert, I take the publishers at theirword that this thick volume contains all Poe's stores and poems.Nobody with any fondness for literature should be unacquainted with Poe.

Purple prose was the popular style among many writers at the time, especially of gothic horror stories (look at Hawthorne, and Dunsany, and Washtington Irving): and the man certainly did have an impressive vocabulary: but sometimes it seems as though he were deliberately trying to mislead the reader. After all, there are only so many obscure words one can cram into a sentence (what, for example, is a \\"mulcet\\"? What on earth is a \\"simoom\\"?). Those interested in Poe would do best in turning to his poetry, which is beautiful, dark, and sombre, to discover the full extent of his inventive genius. But in short, don't bother with his stories unless you are an aspiring writer, appreciate tales which are somewhat grotesque and bizzare, or have the patience and comprehension to swallow a divers array of esoteric and obfuscating syllables."},{"Title":"Complete Stories and Poems of Edgar Allan Poe","review":"This book had everything you could possibly ever want from Edgar Allan Poe's works. It has all of his stories and all of his poems all fit together into one book at once, and it is delightful. I do know that Poe's story \\"Murders In The Rue Morgue\\" is the first ever written modern detective story. That's in here, and \\"The Tell Tale Heart\\", and so much more if you're wishing to read his stories/poems. Another thing I know about Edgar Allan Poe is that even though there is some mystery about his true death as a result of his alcoholism, Poe died as tragically as one of his tortured characters. There are many known theories about it. I personally think he was not overall completely understood, and these stories/poems can tell how interesting his dark imagination was. He was emotionally torn apart by his wife's death in 1847. One cool thing about this book is that all of his stories take place at night. I got this great book for a bargain deal, and I don't find it strange at all that Edgar Allan Poe was obviously just as \\"mad\\" as a character in one of his stories because they represent what he feels and what he is thinking about a particularly creepy situation. Highly recommended.

The illustrations by Dulac are placed throughout the book to visualize a thought expressed in the different poems, As well this makes the book come together well. Edgar's poetry was enjoyed to my fullest extent. Within the poetry I can see his abstract look at the world, especailly in the poem \\"Alone\\" were a sympathetic nature arises in me from understanding exacly what he poetically writes. With Poe's descriptions of being an odd child during his youth, I framilairize with him and understand his sadness.

It showcases the tales of terror that have enthralled readers of horror for generations. It's a pity that Poe doesn't get the credit he deserves. After all, he was the creater of the detective/mystery. Just read the Murders Of The Rue Morgue,etc.But what I love best about Poe's stories are the psychological tales of horror that he penned. He gave us insights into the dark places of the human psyche. One only has to contemplate the inner meanings of his tales to get at their hidden symbolism,e.g. The Black Cat or William Wilson.

He lived a difficult life, because he was raised in a dysfunctional household. But the final product of Edgar Allen Poe's mind is printed in his short stories and poems. Edgar Allen Poe's stories all have similar motifs and composition that would suggest suppressed emotions from life experiences are being discharged through his writings.In a great short story, &quot;The Tell Tale Heart&quot; the narrator doesn't hate the man that he's going to kill, he hates the fake eye. The eye represents evil, and Poe converts everything to black and white. If a part of the kind man is evil, then the whole man is evil, hence, he kills him.

To interpret his work, in function of this anomaly it may be abusive or legitimate. Arthur Shopenhauer affirmed that there is not any circumstance in our whole life that is not voluntary. In the neurosis as well as another misfortunes, we can see an artifice of the individual to get a purpose. Poe sacrificed the life to the work, the mortal destiny in relation to the posthumous destiny.Of course that the last Century was by far, much more unfortunate than the XIX ; that would explain simultaneously that the subsequently elaborated hells by Henry James or Franz Kafka are more intimate, flecked claustrophobic and intimate respect Poe stories. As a matter of fact you may find in Poe certain signals of the future Existentialism, since the simple fact to live for Poe was atrociousThe death and madness (Ligeia \`s tomb, The dwell and the pendulum) were the main symbols used by him to communicate his horror of the life. Accused of imitate the German literature, he could reply with absolute truth: the terror does not come from Germany, but the soul.Poe considered himself a poet, but the circumstances led him to write tales. In some of them the circumstantial invention endures, but in others (Rue Morgue murderers, The stolen letter) comes the copious police genre, that actually fatigues the press, and besides will never die.Poe belongs to non temporal and the eternal. He was a missed angel, his existence worked out as an immense link that joined from the hospitals of the hell, the delirious anguish and unfathomable horror through his tormented soul, could be preserved for the future generations of avid readers, who will contemplate the same cycle of the life, perhaps with other eyes, under different circumstances and protagonists but with the same result: the death without possible redemption."},{"Title":"Complete Stories and Poems of Edgar Allan Poe","review":"Alan Poe is one of my favorites terror authors, and he is very good at it.

His dark tales of horror graced my literature books in high school and college, and continue to resonate with me to this day. Poe was a very troubled man--deranged, if you will, but I think that that's almost a prerequisite when it comes to writing the stuff of genius. His life was never truly happy, and it showed in his work. Poe is best known for his poem, THE RAVEN, but there's so much more that is appealing to the lover of the horror genre. Poe was a master of the psychological aspect of horror. Sheer madness was a central theme to so much of his work. He left his writings to the imagination of the reader, instead of offering an abundance of tangibles. I particularly enjoy THE MASQUE OF THE RED DEATH, THE TELL-TALE HEART, MURDERS IN THE RUE MORGUE, THE BLACK CAT, and THE PIT AND THE PENDULUM. His tales of grief and horror have inspired movies, music, and perhaps redefined Halloween, to some extent. Edgar Allen Poe is a tragic character--he could've easily been one of his own characters. All of the great horror writers of today will admit that they owe a debt of gratitude to the greatest of them all- the great Edgar Allen Poe (1809-1849)."},{"Title":"Complete Stories and Poems of Edgar Allan Poe","review":"What can it be said about the literary talent of Edgar Allan Poe at this point of time? This American writer was an astounding man of letters, without whose contributions our world would probably be more boring and dull. He was able to elevate an underrated narrative format like the short story form to the category of real art, and also the first one to reasonably theorize about it.Even though Poe was something of a \\"mixed bag\\" (a critic once said of him that he was \\"three-fifths genius and two-fifths sheer fudge\\") his best tales are still intimidating narrative achievements. Some of the best are: \\"The Pit and the Pendulum\\", \\"The Masque of The Red Death\\", \\"The Black Cat\\", \\"The Tell-Tale Heart\\", \\"The Imp of the Perverse\\", or \\"Descent into the Maelstr&ouml;m\\" (to name just a few, of course). To pass away without having read some (if not all) of these masterpieces should be considered as something akin to a deadly sin or a capital offense. Poe was not A short story writer, he was THE short story writer, and many of his tales are still coveted triumphs that many aspirants to penpushers revere and envy. No matter if Poe is not sufficiently appreciated in America (is that really so?), here in Europe we'll be extremely pleased to give him a home. As a matter of fact I'd even contribute tax money to build him a public statue if I was asked to. The good moments that his best works have given me make him deserving of that. No other American writer has been so influential or has achieved so great a renown worldwide (especially in Europe and South America). Compared to his, the work of other writers like Mark Twain or William Faulkner strike me as \\"period pieces\\" and \\"local colour narratives\\".Among all the various editions readily available compiling the entire Works of Edgar Allan Poe, this omnibus by \\"Doubleday Publishing\\" is perhaps the best option for your money. It includes both his entire poetry and short fiction, as well as his only novel (\`The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym'); it is also reasonably priced and the book is quite compact, without being excessively large or bulky (you are not required to be a weight lifter to read it in bed). The only edition that probably surpasses this one in quality and contents is that published by \\"The Library of America\\" (but which is also more expensive). If, like me, you don't care much about Poe's poetry, then \\"The Complete Stories\\" by Everyman's Library (ISBN: 978-0679417408) should be a good choice as well. It doesn't really matter as long as people keep reading Poe from time to time and thus maintaining his brilliant legacy alive."},{"Title":"Complete Stories and Poems of Edgar Allan Poe","review":"The Amazon.com price on this superb book of Poe's complete published works is phenomenal. Only $18.00 for over 600 pages of one of the most widely read masters of horror in our times. Most people become familiar with Poe through mandatory reading assignments in middle school. How many of us were forced to memorize &quot;The Raven&quot;--and now are so glad we did?This heavy yet sturdy book allows one to spread their ravenal wings so to speak and enjoy Poe at will. Perhaps with a snifter of warmed brandy while seated in a leather buttoned wing chair, one can read through &quot;The Telltale Heart&quot;, &quot;Murders of the Rue Morgue&quot; or one of our favorites, &quot;A Cask Of Amontilliado&quot;. Listen! Sounds of the Carnival in Spain, bawdy drunken laughter, the echoing steps down into the dank wine cellar, the lure of tasting a rare wine, the viciousness taken upon the despised know-it-all, chaining him to the wall, entombing him in, brick by brick until the very last one is in place, the realized screams as the torch is thrown and his death ends his arrogance by a supposed mere simpleton.One can only imagine Poe's daily thoughts, dreams, and nightmares. Whether drug induced or not, Edgar Allen Poe's hand to paper still thrills us today and forever.

I have read much of Poe's works previously and was looking forward to revisiting his genius but have to say that this Kindle Edition is not even worth the $0.99 that I paid for it. Will probably just delete it."},{"Title":"Complete Stories and Poems of Edgar Allan Poe","review":"My Daughter had mentioned that she would like a book containing all of Edgar Allan Poes stories for Christmas. I went to Amazon. com found several E.A.P.(Edgar Allan Poe) books, I looked at this particular one and this book not only has every story written by Poe, it also has all of the Poems that he wrote, and a Biography about Poe. When it arrived, before I wrapped it I have to admit I had to read some of it. I was impressed. Well once my Daughter opened her gift and seen the contents of this book she was too was impressed with it. She informed me that she, herself has not found a more complete read at any bookstore thus far."},{"Title":"Complete Stories and Poems of Edgar Allan Poe","review":"I am forced here to eco the thoughts and feelings of several other reviewers here, \\"what can you say? It's Poe.\\" To do a critical analysis of this work, in particular by a non-Poe scholar such is myself, would be the height of arrogance on my part; pontificating on a subject of which so many, many others are more qualified would come across as, well...pompous and in many ways laughable. I seriously doubt if I could come up with bits of criticism or accolades others have not been hammering away at for the past one hundred years or so.Poe though is one of my favorite short story authors and indeed, one of my favorite poets. I have been reading him for well over fifty years now and his work is as bright and fresh to me now as when it was first read to me as a child. There are a few things to note though, and a couple of comments the reader needs to be aware of concerning this particular edition.First, this work has not been annotated nor has it been translated (French). I note that on this site and several others that this has thrown some into a hissy fit state. Good grief! This lack of translation does not distract from the story a bit. In addition, with the most simplest of computers it only takes a snap or two on the mouse to come up with the translation of not only French, but just about any other language you might come across...stop being so lazy! Having to research it yourself is the best way to learn! If you have problems understanding what he is writing of; again, there are literally thousands of sites that would love a visit from you...many of them are quite good! No computer? Not problem! They actually have books at your local library with the same information in them!Secondly, I have noted that on this site and several others that there seems to be a bit of whining about Poe's vocabulary, i.e. he uses \\"big words.\\" Folks, if you read 90 percent of the popular fiction books being cranked out today and pay very, very close attention, you will find that they have been dumbed down. They are ALL written at a 7th or 8th grade level! If you must use a dictionary a bit (which I fully and proudly admit to being forced to use each time I read Poe), then so much the better! Learning a new word and its usage is actually a good thing! I promise you that you will not suffer any permanent physical or mental damage.Thirdly, I note that on this site and several others it has been mentioned, and again whine about the fact that Poe tends to use a prose style that is no longer is use. Good grief. I suppose we should have his entire works purged of such and bring it all up to date...Hey Reader's Digest...you are falling down on the job! You are missing out on the chance to befoul yet another masterful bit of writing! This of all the complaints has to be the most asinine. I almost have to cry when I read such gibberish, yet at the same time feel a certain degree of pity for those that make such statements.Fourthly, it should be noted that Poe is actually the Great Grand Daddy of the detective novel or short story and was at least a generation ahead of Doyle. There are some great detective stories in his body of work and should not be missed my any lover of this genre.Fifthly, it may come as a shock to some, but Poe did write more than just \\"The Raven.\\"If you have not read Poe...you should. If it has been years since you visited him...get off your duff and set down with a cup of tea, and your pipe, if so inclined to participate in that nasty habit, and do some rediscovering. If you are in school, i.e. of the younger set, read him. I promise you will learn much of writing, story telling, emotions and actually yourself.Do yourself a big time favor and get a copy of this particular edition, or any other edition for that matter, and get reacquainted with this genius.Don BlankenshipThe Ozarks"},{"Title":"Complete Stories and Poems of Edgar Allan Poe","review":"Edgar Allan Poe is certainly one of America's greatest and most underrated writers; perhaps underrated because he's too easily pigeon-holed as a drug-addled horror writer. In fact, he virtually created the modern mystery tale, wrote excellent poetry &amp; many of the images from his horror stories have passed into the iconography of our culture--recall the Tell Tale Heart episode of Cheers, with Diane following Carla around going, boom--boom, boom-boom,....One of the beauties of Poe is that, since his work was all poetry &amp; short stories, you can get everything in a one volume addition like this one. I'll just look at a couple of examples:The Murders in the Rue Morgue:With this tale, Poe created the detective story. The narrator is a friend of C. Auguste Dupin in earl 1800's Paris. Dupin is gifted with a great intellect &amp; comes of an illustrious family, but has been reduced to poverty and has shrunken into indolence. However, reading about a particularly brutal murder in Rue Morgue, he is stirred into action &amp; he &amp; the narrator set out to solve the crime.All of the elements that have become so familiar to us are present here; a locked room, a bizarre killing, a brilliant but eccentric detective, an incredulous sidekick, bumbling police, etc.. Most important, the crime is solved by the rigorous application of reason. In Dupin we see the forerunner of everyone from Sherlock Holmes to Nero Wolfe.The Cask of Amantillado:The story is off &amp; running from the first paragraph:THE thousand injuries of Fortunato I had borne as I best could, but when he ventured upon insult I vowed revenge. You, who so well know the nature of my soul, will not suppose, however, that gave utterance to a threat. At length I would be avenged; this was a point definitely, settled --but the very definitiveness with which it was resolved precluded the idea of risk. I must not only punish but punish with impunity. A wrong is unredressed when retribution overtakes its redresser. It is equally unredressed when the avenger fails to make himself felt as such to him who has done the wrong. It must be understood that neither by word nor deed had I given Fortunato cause to doubt my good will. I continued, as was my in to smile in his face, and he did not perceive that my to smile now was at the thought of his immolation.He had a weak point --this Fortunato --although in other regards he was a man to be respected and even feared. He prided himself on his connoisseurship in wine.Taking off from this brisk setup, Poe treats us to one of the really diabolical tales of vengeance in all of literature. This one will trouble your sleep.And, of course, your teacher taught you poetry by reading your class The Bells, The Raven and Annabel Lee. I bet you still remember learning the word tintinnabulation. They're all here &amp; they're all just as morbid and scary as you remember them.GRADE: A+"},{"Title":"Complete Stories and Poems of Edgar Allan Poe","review":"When I was in 7th grade we read The Tell-Tale Heart.

Poe and his writing speak for themselves.As far as the content of this book, the title speaks for itself also. The stories are separated into three different sections titled \\"Tales of Mystery and Horror\\" (containing some of his more famous works such as \\"The Tell-Tale Heart,\\" \\"The Cask of Amontillado,\\" and \\"The Masque of the Red Death\\"), \\"Humor and Satire\\" (which include \\"The Man that Was Used Up\\" and \\"The Sphinx\\"), and \\"Flights and Fantasies\\" (\\"Eleonora\\" and \\"The Oval Portrait\\" are contained here). The first of the last two sections of the book contains his novel \\"The Narrative of A. Gordon Pym of Nantucket\\" and the last is the complete collection of ALL his poems.I purchased this book used from warehouse_deals and was glad of the product I received. Although there were wears and tears on the dust cover (which isn't important to me), the book binding retained its shape regardless of the age of the book. In fact, it only looks a couple of months old on the outside. The pages are yellowing, the dead giveaway that this is a used book (other than the dust cover).Overall, this is one of those books that every library should be without. The publisher did a great job of collecting and binding this compilation; it's complete and should last a lifetime."},{"Title":"Complete Stories and Poems of Edgar Allan Poe","review":"I bought the $50 leather bound Barnes& Noble edition but all the same, it is a very good book to get into the best story teller and (one of the best)poets ever's complete works."},{"Title":"Complete Stories and Poems of Edgar Allan Poe","review":"The Complete Stories and Poems of Edgar Allan Poe, is a good book to read on a rainy night. This book takes us back to the time of giant monsters, supernatural monsters, and dead people who come back to life seeking revenge against the people who murdered them. We can hear the monster's heart beat through Edgar Allan Poe's poetic form. The stories keep us in suspense until the bitter end. My favorite in the collection remains \\"The Fall of the House of Usher,\\" about a family and how they get ripped apart. The family tree grows without branches; Roderick and Madeleine live as direct descendents of the original Usher, which the narrator says constitutes a flaw in the strength of the family. A large crack runs through the house, itself, a symbol of the family breaking apart. Roderick suffers from hyper-sensitivity to light, sound, and touch, keeping himself enclosed in a dark padded room. Madeleine Usher suffers from catatonia, which leaves her often appearing dead. Roderick constantly worries about putting her in the family tomb while she still lives. The old house makes Roderick even more afraid to the point that he shakes uncontrollably. People who like to have their socks scared off will enjoy Poe's tales."},{"Title":"Complete Stories and Poems of Edgar Allan Poe","review":"it was a good book i read it in about a week and im 13 its has some dark wrighting it it but its ok."},{"Title":"Complete Stories and Poems of Edgar Allan Poe","review":"So maybe thats an exageration, BUT this book is the perfect compliment to any library. I have this, as well as a few other colections that I had purchased prier, but this one has it all. Everything from his beautifully eerie poems (my personal favorite is Annibell Lee which is my favorite poem ever written) down to his classic short storys like 'The Black Cat' and 'Tell-Tale Heart' which was the first story I ever read by Poe back when I was in Fifth grade...I had to read it for English and write an essay and I was so hooked after the first sentence that I swore to read any and everything this man ever wrote. Poe was a genious, although it's apparent he had many problems...His work still remains masterpiece and I feel will never be trumped...ever."},{"Title":"Complete Stories and Poems of Edgar Allan Poe","review":"As a high school student, I have learned about many great authors and poets:Ralph Waldo Emerson, Walt Whitman, Emily Dickinson, and Benjamin Franklin, to name a few. However, without a doubt and hands down, Edgar Allan Poe is by far thegreatest author. Poe has an amazing ability to catch his reader's attention, fulfill them during the story, and disappoint them at the ending. This disappointment is not because the story was unsatisfactory and dull, but because the reader craves more of Poe's phenomenal and entertaining writing. The first time I read Poe (The Tell-Tale Heart), I was fascinated with his ability to make me feel that I was caught up with Poe's insanity. His story was absolutely terrifying, yet there were no demons, devils, beasts, basilisks, or monsters involved. I was confused of where the disturbing terror was coming from. After reading many of his short stories and poems, I realized that the fear could not even be found in the story at all. It is found in the reader's soul, beliefs, and heart. This horror is not exposed every time you open a book by Poe. It is with you constantly, every day and second, as long as your heart is still beating...and perhaps even after."},{"Title":"Complete Stories and Poems of Edgar Allan Poe","review":"Edgar Allan Poe is arguably one of the greatest writers of fiction. His brilliant collection of short stories, including The Pit and the Pendulum, can be found inside this massive edition of his many works. No collection would be complete without the well-known poem, The Raven, which basically deals with the character's inability to deal with the death of Lenore. Mostly known for his horror stories, some may be surprised that he was also a mystery writer. The Purloined Letter is just one example of a detective short story. Poe's writing is phenomenal, especially since he is able to create a scary atmosphere, and the characters are trapped in danger, even if they are not fully aware of it at first. This is true with The Masque of the Red Death, in which a kingdom believes that they are immune from the plague due to the fact that they enclosed themselves in the castle. However, danger soon approaches. Read for yourself. You will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"Complete Stories and Poems of Edgar Allan Poe","review":"good stuff a I am is be to too true add dead for chance dog catt horse bull ox car tell"},{"Title":"Complete Stories and Poems of Edgar Allan Poe","review":"I was just reading a recent article on Poe by some Brit named Kevin Jackson. He doesn't like Poe. He lists other Brits who haven't liked Poe: Aldous Huxley, Kingsley Amis, George Orwell, Owen Dudley Edwards. Of course, this probably has something to do with the fact that Brits tend to despise Americans in general. But Jackson admits that the French just love Poe: Baudelaire, Mallarme, Valery, etc. Baudelaire in particular worshipped Poe quite literally: he prayed to him. Poe's association with the French preceeded his writings: he met the Marquis de Lafayette during his teens in Richmond, when he escorted the elderly Marquis (friend of George Washington) down the aisle of a church. I'll bet you didn't know that! I own two biographies of Poe: one by George Edward Woodberry and the other by Hervey Allen, both of which I recommend. As to the tales and the poems, of course Poe is beyond criticism (in spite of the Brits). He was a genius and his writings are immortal. The young tend to be his greatest fans, as they are the greatest fans of Lovecraft. His very popularity tells against him among the literary snobs. The young don't read literary criticism, so they read as they please, and they please to read Poe. Poe is cool. You just have to be cool when you end a story thus: \\"Rip up the boards! It is the beating of his hideous heart!\\""},{"Title":"Complete Stories and Poems of Edgar Allan Poe","review":"Although best noted for his short stories, Poe was a masterful poet.

Out of Poe's sorrow and sadness came a genius unmatched."},{"Title":"Complete Stories and Poems of Edgar Allan Poe","review":"Edgar Allan Poe is best remembered for his weird, creepy short stories, but he was also a great poet. Unfortunately, he lived much of his life in drunkenness and poverty, and died relatively young... or was murdered, we don't know for sure. All we know is he was found dead. But he left us with some very hauntingly atmospheric tales like &quot;House of Usher&quot; or &quot;Pit and the Pendulum&quot; and some memorable poems, including the gloomy pieces &quot;The Raven&quot; and &quot;Annabel Lee&quot;, a fantasy about being put in the coffin with his beloved dead wife.

Besides having a great binding, it allows you to read ANY of Poes's works in a single volume. It will surely keep you entertained for a long time.

I mean, this is Edgar Allan Poe we're talking about! It's an excellent collection of his stories and poems. Many people are of the opinion that Poe's works are all rather macabre. Although many of his works do fit into that category, he was also a brilliant satirist. For example, I recommend his short story, \\"The System of Doctor Tarr and Professor Fether\\". Quite hilarious, and very witty. Poe was a highly educated member of society, and was also the 'inventor' of the modern detective mystery with his short story, \\"The Murders in the Rue Morgue.\\" His incomparable literary style has gone unequaled to this day. For those already familiar with Poe, I suggest you read him again to have a fresh look at his works. For those who are NOT familiar with his works, you are missing out BIG time!

This is the work of the original genius of terror. And the most terrifying thing about Poe's stories and poems is that the threat doesn't come from a monster, or a devil, or a murderer: it comes from inside yourself, from your mind and your heart. There's no escaping them. Poe is not, of course a &quot;terror&quot; writer. He's just a writer, and one of the best there has been. His work can not be confined to a &quot;genre&quot;. His tales touch horror, but there are some analytical, metaphysical, futurists, and tales of love (strange love, but love).As correctly pointed out by other reviewers, Poe practically invented the mystery tale in which the detective is an amateur who solves the problem through reason and deduction alone (&quot;The crimes of the Rue Morgue&quot;). A wonderful cryptic and deductive tale is &quot;The golden bug&quot;. &quot;The cask of Amontillado&quot; is a masterpiece of cruel vengeance. &quot;The pit and the pendulum&quot; is pure terror, like &quot;The black cat&quot;.The poems have even more variety. You know what the famous ones are: The Raven, The bells, Annabel Lee. Here, the most remarkable characteristics are music and rhythm. &quot;Quoth the raven: nevermore!&quot;, and the ringing of the bells, the bells, bells, bells, etc. My personal favorite is Annabel Lee, but there are many other, less known, which are just excellent.Poe was a troubled man, addicted to drugs and alcohol, who died in a miserable way (some thugs made him drink to use him in an electoral fraud; he died from drunkness on the streets of Baltimore). But his intellect and sensibility (hypersensibility) made him a true genius, a profound connoiseur of the human soul, up and down. His writing is superb and he will remain as a master of literature for centuries to come. In case you have never approached his work, do so now. Choose your favorite couch; wait until everybody is asleep, get yourself a good drink, and travel to the bottom of your own soul."},{"Title":"Complete Stories and Poems of Edgar Allan Poe","review":"Macabre, enticing, and fantastic, Poe's stories reveal a first rate intellect and out of this world imagination. Poe was the first or one of the first authors of science fiction, when he wrote &quot;Ligeia,&quot; which is a must read, underrated story of his. &quot;The Devil in the Belfry&quot; reveals Poe's comic talents, as does the delightful &quot;X-ing a Paragrab.&quot; These two stories reveal the light, almost playful, side of Poe which is usually obscured by the dark side of his macabre horror stories and brooding poems. Speaking of which, his horror stories are some of the best ever written. I still feel the tension, reading them for the nth time in my life. Poe is also the originator of the detective story. Poe's intellect is evident in the story Mellonta Tauta, where he humorously explains the difference between the Aristotilean/deductive reasoning and Baconian (Hogian!)/ inductive reasoning. In his stories he also demonstrated some understanding of the theory of probability, foresaw the philosophical approach of perspectivalism, and raised the questions of sanity/normalcy that would become one of the major social questions of the 20th century, when power-hungry maniacal and clever madman came to power in some countries with the full intent of eventually ruling the world.I consider Poe one of the most imaginative people who ever lived and one of the most insightful people of the 19th century. By today's standards, his life was short. But the legacy he left influenced and inspired so many people that he should be regarded as one of the greatest writers of short stories who ever lived, and as someone who belongs in the pantheon of many 19th century geniuses."},{"Title":"Complete Stories and Poems of Edgar Allan Poe","review":"In the annals of short story writing there is perhaps no greater master than Edgar Allan Poe. His tales of horror have sent chills up and down the spines of their readers for several generations. His better known stories are all masterpieces of the genre of the macabre. As for his lesser known tales, they too are complex masterpieces of pyschological horror. And I use the word pyschological because Poe was aware of the inner workings of the human mind before Freud or Jung. He loves to explore the dark side of the human psyche, and no one has or ever will do it with as much power and mastery as did Poe.Also, Poe was a master of language and his ear was exquisitely tuned to the sounds of words. His poetry is perhaps the most tuneful in the English language. Listen to the music of the first sentence of The Fall Of The House Of Usher: \\"During the whole of a dull, dark, and soundless day in the autumn of the year, when the clouds hung oppressively low in the heavens, I had been passing alone, on horseback, through a singularly dreary tract of country, and at length found myself, as the shades of evening drew on, within view of the melancholy House of Usher.\\" You see, Poe understood both tone and atmosphere and how to weave these elements into his narrative; thereby creating a lasting effect in the minds of his readers.I remember when first I read The Tell-Tale Heart how the opening paragraph pulled me into the strange intensity of Poe's madness. It begins thus: \\"True!-nervous-very, very dreadfully nervous I had been and am! but why will you say that I am mad? The disease had sharpened my senses-not destroyed-not dulled them. Above all was the sense of hearing acute. I heard all things in the heaven and in the earth. I heard many things in hell. How, then, am I mad? Hearken! and observe how healthily-how calmly I can tell you the whole story.\\" But it is the story of a madman and in the end will not prove him sane. In point of fact, it will draw its reader ever deeper into the infernal regions of Poe's pysche, where he will hear the few things of heaven and the many demonic things of hell.I have always loved the intense way in which Poe uses language to attain his metaphysical revelations of the state of a brilliant mind that is on the verge of disintergration. For it is in the order that he brings to this nightmarish chaos that one begins to understand that Poe's dark genius is capable of the highest degree of intuition. And that he is an explorer of regions of the mind that others dare never to explore for fear of what they might find.So I recommend reading Poe's stories and poems for the sheer thrill of it, but also for the complexities of his craftmanship and the subtle way in which he weaves upon the magic loom of his incredible imagination."},{"Title":"Complete Stories and Poems of Edgar Allan Poe","review":"Having never written a full novel, Poe is sometimes forgotten when the great fiction writers of American history are listed. The power of Poe's dark vision, though, is virtually unprecedented in world literature. The manifestation of such deep, intuitive symbols and archetypes, ones of such clarity, prophesy and terror that even his incredible craftsmanship in language becomes transparant, is a gift given to only the most blessed and tormented of writers. To read a story like the Masque of the Red Death is to be flung into an allegorical morality play which fits perfectly into the modern context. Poe's stories and poems travel through time and rap ceaselessy on the window of your conscious thoughts. An ominous pall of expectation and retribution permeates all of his work. To pick up Poe is really never to put it down."},{"Title":"Complete Stories and Poems of Edgar Allan Poe","review":"Poe's tales of mystery and horror are, of course, legendary, but the reader will find so much more in this book as well. The classics, such as &quot;The Cask of Amontillado&quot;, etc. still shine and enthrall as much as they ever have, but his humor, which manages to combine simplicity with sophistication, is also exhibited in tales such as &quot;The Sphinx&quot;. Because this book is so all-inclusive, it can shed much light on the lives of those who are not fully aware of Poe's poetry. Does it follow strictly traditional and pedagogical systems of meter, etc.? Perhaps not. But Poe has taken the commonplace, even somewhat trite term &quot;rhythm&quot;, and turned it into something absolutely magical. Again, this is most evident and accessible in the classics such as &quot;Annabel Lee&quot; and &quot;The Raven&quot;, but here it can be found, and definitely should not be ignored, in lesser known gems such as &quot;The Haunted Palace&quot; and &quot;To -----&quot; (&quot;I heed not that my earthly lot...&quot;). When read quietly and at the right pace, his poetry is thought-provoking to say the least; when read aloud, it is almost mystical in its beauty. Committed to memory, it will surely earn one kudos and perhaps even a slight, contemplative awe when recited in the right company. (Giving full credit to the author, of course). Despite Poe's tragic life, he is truly an American treasure. This book exemplifies that through its simple content and short biography, without any constraining and often tiresome commentary. It presents itself to the reader as if to say, &quot;read with your heart. Be frightened, be amused, be enchanted; but hopefully, and most of all, just enjoy.&quot;"},{"Title":"Complete Stories and Poems of Edgar Allan Poe","review":"This refers to the Doubleday reissue.As titled, this tome contains all of the stories, not just the short stories or a meager selection thereof, but ALL of the stories, including the long Pym and manuscript found in a bottle.

I would have given five stars, six if possible, because Poe's work on the whole is amazing. Even though all of his short stories and poems (and novella) can be fit into one book which doesn't even break a thousand pages, Poe is very easily the best writer to ever come out of America surpassing even Melville, Whitman, and Faulkner. The writing is required reading for all who love words. However, according to the classical education of the nineteenth century, there are quite a few allusions to material written in foreign languages ranging from Latin and Greek to German and French. In some places translation is provided, but I believe that these translations were done by Poe himself and not by the editors at Doubleday. There were some places where translation was crucial to the story but was not provided such as at the end of &quot;The Purloined Letter&quot;. However Doubleday is not the only one guilty of this, I found quite a number of other editions of Poe's Complete works which lacked annotation as well. In fact I still have not found an edition which DOES CONTAIN annotation. However, it is only a thorn which does not take away from the beauty of this rose of literature. Most know Poe from his horror fiction but in the section of Humor and Satire one finds stories which are still able to make one laugh such as &quot;The Literary Life of Thingum Bob, Esq.,&quot; and &quot;The System of Doctor Tarr and Professor Fether.&quot; The section of Flights and Fantasies shows the man whom Jorge Luis Borges strove to imitate. And for the very sparseness of it's section, the poetry of Poe continues to amaze to this day, with poems which are more like music than writing. But be warned, no one will like everything in here, but everyone will like something in here. For me, I personally didn't care for &quot;The Gold Bug&quot; or for &quot;The Mystery of Marie Roget&quot; but those are both detective stories, so a detective story lover might swoon over them whereas a fantasy story lover might not care for them at all. A reader who prefers Satire will definitely see a side of Poe which few are familiar with, and which, oftentimes, is on par with even Twain and Bierce. For sheer imagination, few if any, can hope to ever equal Poe."},{"Title":"Complete Stories and Poems of Edgar Allan Poe","review":"Edgar Allan Poe, born in Boston, Massachusetts on January 19, 1809, died October 7, 1849.What is it that makes an author famous? I don't mean famous in the sense a news article reports that \\"Jack Greylea's novels sold 15 million copies last year,\\" but in the sense that he is thought of as being profound, and seminal. That he is quoted, and scholars analyse his works, and he is looked upon as being the original voice of his style, or the font from which many imitators have drawn inspiration.Edgar Allan Poe is one such. The very hint of his name calls up images of midnight graveyards, of crumbling mansions lit by wax candles, the home of strange and tormented aristocrats, till the description \\"Poe-like\\" can draw as vivid a picture in our minds as \\"elephant-like.\\"Yet his output was not great. Basically a short story writer and poet, he produced only one full-length novel, which received more censure than praise, and which very few people today can name. Without wishing to run him down as an author (what he did, he did well, but what he did well, was to be Poe) he was a limited writer, and all of his works over twenty-two years can be contained in one thickish book.So what is the secret of Poe, whereby a scanty writer becomes the cult-centre of a world of horror that carries his own stamp? It lies I think in two things.Not to place these two in any order of importance as regards his continuing fame - I leave this to you - but I would say....Firstly, that it was his choice of subject and execution of it. The mournful, weird and macabre, in which man becomes little more than an instrument of darkness, and that usually the worst darkness, that which wells up from within, whose black light shows us as being not the pawns of evil, but the source of evil itself. But to seize on this idea - or any other idea - as inspiration is nothing, merely the starting point from which the quill hits the paper. It is in the execution of his vision that Poe's genius emerges. Not with a great deal of subtlety, nor a much complexity, but with great and disciplined fixity on the horror of his intentions, Poe moves relentless to the nasty culmination of his stories, and they come to us with all the rawness of unconsoled misery. His art was that of the short story writer, and as such he wrote little, but when reading Poe a little is more than enough.Secondly, that Poe more than any other author is identified as a man with his works. An orphan and an outcast from his adopted family, overly sensitive and reckless, he lived wildly, lied readily, lived in poverty, married strangely to his thirteen-year old cousin, was widowed miserably, and finally died mysteriously at age forty, from uncertain causes that speculation has named as anything from drug addiction to murder. As if this were not enough, his works were controlled after his death by his executor, who attempted to blacken his name. More than any other author that I can readily think of, Poe was his own tormented, tragic hero, and his oppressed characters were him.In the nineteen-sixties, several of Poe's stories and poems - The Pit and the Pendulum, The Masque of the Red Death, The Raven, The Tomb of Legeia and others - were made into popular, low budget films, cementing Poe's reputation firmly into the mythology of modern horror movies. It's common of course for movies to be nothing like the original written work, but all of these are based on not on fully worked out novels, but ideas that Poe dealt with in comparatively few pages.Incidentally, the principal actor in many of these was Vincent Price, whose tall, mournful frame instantly springs to mind as well nigh inseparable from Poe's weird gems."},{"Title":"Complete Stories and Poems of Edgar Allan Poe","review":"This is a great classic book to have. If you love the poetry by Edgar Allan Poe I highly recommend adding this book to your collection."},{"Title":"Complete Stories and Poems of Edgar Allan Poe","review":"Reading Poe is always a great experience.

It has most all his poetry and short stories, great collection. Nicely bound, pages printed clearly."},{"Title":"Complete Stories and Poems of Edgar Allan Poe","review":"I've always had a liking for Edgar Allan Poe, with his tales of horror, mystery and suspense, done in the atmospheric prose of a master writer. Since I live close enough, I've even made some trips to his gravesite, a place that is always surrounded by a sense of sadness.Poe was a tormented genius who died young, under mysterious circumstances, and at the time of his death he wasn't deservingly popular. Certainly his work was not cute romances for the masses -- he explored the darkness of the human heart, love, satire, and the earliest whodunnit stories. And \\"Complete Stories and Poems of Edgar Allan Poe\\" brings together all of his poetry and writings in one book.Poe's fiction writings include short stories and novellas, which tend to be rather weird -- a treasure-hunt and a golden insect, a ship caught in a whirlpool, a hypnotized man talks about the universe, and stories of despair, madness, and occasionally beauty. There is also his trilogy of Monsieur C. Auguste Dupin stories, which were the first to feature a brilliant detective solving an impossible crime.Most people know about \\"The Raven\\" (which even has the Baltimore Ravens named after it) but Poe actually wrote a lot of poetry, most of which readers never heard of. Sometimes dark, or whimsical, or even both. \\"By a route obscure and lonely/Haunted by ill angels only/Where an Eidolon, named NIGHT/On a black throne reigns upright...\\"And, of course, the horror. This is what Poe is best known for, including such well-known stories as \\"The Fall Of The House Of Usher.\\" But there are also lesser-known gems -- tales of a plague invading a party, being buried alive, a portrait that siphoned the life out of its subject, and a nightly visit to an Italian crypt leading to madness.Don't read \\"Complete Stories and Poems\\" all at once. It's too intense. It's better to soak it in a little at a time, so that you can get a better feel for the different kinds of writing that Poe did, and how he excelled at pretty much everything he put down on paper. Most great writers can't boast of that much.Poe's writing is what makes even his least story or poem come alive -- he brought a gothic, misty vibrancy to his stories, and could make his quiet dialogue seem utterly chilling (\\" \\"I have no name in the regions which I inhabit. I was mortal, but am fiend...\\"). It's not hard to see why he was an influence on authors such as Fyodor Dostoevsky, Oscar Wilde, Arthur Conan Doyle and Franz Kafka.\\"Complete Stories and Poems of Edgar Allan Poe\\" is a must-have for anyone with an appreciation for great literature and beautiful, dark writing."},{"Title":"Complete Stories and Poems of Edgar Allan Poe","review":"Read troughout the world, admired by Dostojewski and translated by the famous French poet Baudelaire, Poe has become a legendary writer, representing the artist as a romantic failure. A lot of his stories seem a description of the frequent nightmares he had.But his popularity and his influence on literature - even today -depend less on nightmares than on his accomplishments as a writer of fiction and as a great lyric poet.'The fall of the House of Usher' and 'The Cask of Amontillado' show Poe's mastery of Gothic horror. His 'The Pit and the Pendulum' is a classic of horror and suspense. He invented the modern detective story with ' The Murders in the Rue Morgue '.But he was also a great poet famous for the lyrical 'To Helen' and for the incantatory rhytm of 'The Raven'."},{"Title":"Complete Stories and Poems of Edgar Allan Poe","review":"I am a great admirer of Edgar. I find him to be an exceptional talent in a time that did not appreciate his self torment and work. He was bi-polar, and must have had a terrible time relating to people who had no clue what was wrong with him. But in his darkness, he wrote. He is an excellent writer who can express the very essence of his poetry. He wrote down his pain in a venting bonanza. As a eulogy of his pain and life struggle, he should in the very least of the least get 5 stars. Thanks, Ed.His works are frighteningly excellent. His style is beautiful and captures the moment.

His writing style is still unequaled by other writers. His ability to say so much with just the right words was most astounding. Modern writers can only hope to aspire to his genius. Poe died as a pauper because his contemporaries were jealous of his talent. No other american writer except for maybe Ferlinghetti has grasped the idea of writing and used it so perfectly. Poe deserved better than he got."},{"Title":"Complete Stories and Poems of Edgar Allan Poe","review":"The Complete Stories and Poems of Edgar Allan Poe, is a good book to read on a rainy night. This book takes us back to the time of giant monsters, supernatural monsters, and dead people who come back to life seeking revenge against the people who murdered them. We can hear the monster's heart beat through Edgar Allan Poe's poetic form. The stories keep us in suspense until the bitter end. My favorite in the collection remains \\"The Fall of the House of Usher,\\" about a family and how they get ripped apart. The family tree grows without branches; Roderick and Madeleine live as direct descendents of the original Usher, which the narrator says constitutes a flaw in the strength of the family. A large crack runs through the house, itself, a symbol of the family breaking apart. Roderick suffers from hyper-sensitivity to light, sound, and touch, keeping himself enclosed in a dark padded room. Madeleine Usher suffers from catatonia, which leaves her often appearing dead. Roderick constantly worries about putting her in the family tomb while she still lives. The old house makes Roderick even more afraid to the point that he shakes uncontrollably. People who like to have their socks scared off will enjoy Poe's tales."},{"Title":"Complete Stories and Poems of Edgar Allan Poe","review":"Whether you were forced to read him as a high school student, numbly opening to one of his many short stories or poems, or as an avid fan of the macabre, you delved into his darkest works, it doesn't take long to understand why Edgar Allen Poe is considered to be one of the great writers of all time, blending styles ranging from horror to comedy into his volume of work to create stories that capture the imagination and thrill the soul.Many of his writings have been translated into film, or referenced in other literary works, television programs, even some of the great satires of the stage and screen. Here now, is a chance to share in the complete works of this masterful writer of the macabre.From &quot;The Raven&quot; to &quot;The Tell-Tale Heart&quot;, this collection of his stories and poems is beautifully laid out in a hard-cover edition that is far less expensive than comparible collections of his works in paperback. For anyone from the casual reader to the most dedicated fan of American literature, this collection is a must have for any home library.Scott Kolecki"},{"Title":"Complete Stories and Poems of Edgar Allan Poe","review":"In this book are all of Edgar Allan Poes stories and poems.It is one of the best books I have ever read.It has stories such as the Tell Tale Heart in which the person telling the story can not be trusted because he is mad and tries hard to convince you he is not.And also The Fall of The House of Usher,in which old frinds reunite and play out long days that end in an unexplainable twist.But other than the stories there are the poems such as Annabel Lee which was inspired by Poes favorite topic,The death of a beautiful woman.And of course the famous poem of lost love,The Raven.So if you are looking for a great book to read I suggest this one:)"},{"Title":"Complete Stories and Poems of Edgar Allan Poe","review":"Before reading this collection, I knew Edgar Allan Poe as a poet and as the author of the Gothic horror stories which after his death were collected as \\"Tales of Mystery and Imagination\\", although he himself never published a collection with this title. I was therefore surprised to discover that his range of subject-matter was considerably wider than this and that the majority of his short stories do not fall within this category; he was also a prolific author of satirical and humorous tales and of what are referred to as \\"fantasies\\".There is perhaps a reason why Poe is today best known for a few works making up only a small part of his output. Reading his dramatic fragment \\"Politian\\", a fusty cod-Shakespearean blank-verse tragedy set in Renaissance Italy, I quickly understood why, after a few scenes, Poe abandoned not only the play itself but any idea of making a career as a dramatist. (He never wrote for the stage again). About his leaden tales of humour and satire the kindest thing to say would be that most of them clearly reveal just why Poe is not principally remembered today as a humorist or satirist, although there are occasionally some flashes of interest. One that caught my attention was \\"The 1,002nd Tale of Scheherazade\\", which uses the language of the Arabian Nights fairy-tale to inform the reader of some of the wonders of nineteenth-century science and technology, the twist being that fact is indeed stranger than fiction and that when Scheherazade recounts scientific fact rather than fantasy nobody believes her.This volume also includes Poe's only novel \\"The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket\\". This starts out as a gripping seafaring yarn about a young man who stows away on a Nantucket whaling ship, and whose experiences include mutiny, shipwreck and cannibalism. The second half of the story, however, turns into something closer to science fiction, as Pym is rescued by a ship on a voyage to explore the Antarctic, a region of the globe still largely unknown when the book was published in 1838. According to Poe Antarctica is not an ice-covered continent but an open sea with a relatively mild climate, which gets steadily milder the closer one approaches to the South Pole, and containing a number of islands populated by dark-skinned savages.Poe can be seen as a pioneer of science fiction, although the advance of scientific knowledge since his day means that what was once speculative fiction is now either banal fact or else completely implausible. Readers in the 1840s might have been persuaded that it was possible to travel from the Earth to the Moon by balloon, as happens to the protagonist of \\"The Unparalleled Adventure of One Hans Pfaal\\", but modern readers are unlikely to be so gullible, and the ending, in which Poe pulls the rug out from under his readers' feet by revealing the whole thing to be a hoax, will not come as a surprise.Another genre in which Poe acted as a pioneer was that of the detective story. Although he only wrote three stories in this genre, his hero C. Auguste Dupin anticipates Sherlock Holmes in his ability to solve crimes by deductive reasoning. Like Holmes, and a number of other fictional sleuths such as Hercule Poirot, Dupin is not a police officer but a gentlemanly amateur. Of the three Dupin stories, \\"The Murders in the Rue Morgue\\" and \\"The Purloined Letter\\" both end with an elegant solution to the mystery, although I found the third, \\"The Murder of Marie Roget\\", dull and pedestrian. \\"The Gold-Bug\\" is a mystery story of another type, concentrating not on a crime but on a search for buried treasure and reflecting Poe's interest in the science of cryptography.During his lifetime, Poe was better known as a literary critic than as an author of fiction, and in the years after his death had the curious distinction, for an American writer, of becoming better known in Continental Europe than in the English-speaking world. He was particularly well-known in France, where his work was translated and popularised by Charles Baudelaire. This is perhaps not surprising, as I have often found there is something rather un- American about those works by which he is best remembered today. One might have expected the early literary works of the young Republic to be vigorous, optimistic and democratic in tone, but Poe's Gothic tales and poems are sombre and pessimistic, often aristocratic in their subject-matter and frequently set in Europe. \\"Metzengerstein\\", for example, is set in Hungary, \\"The Masque of the Red Death\\" in mediaeval Italy, \\"The Pit and the Pendulum\\" in Spain under the Inquisition and the Dupin stories in France. Several of his stories deal with a mad or cruel aristocrat or ruler who is overcome by some terrible fate (\\"Metzengerstein\\", \\"The Masque of the Red Death\\" or \\"Hop-Frog\\"), and a recurring theme in others is a ruined or ruinous palace or castle. In \\"The Fall of the House of Usher\\" the title has a double meaning; it can be interpreted as referring to the decline or a once-great family or to the collapse of an actual building.Unlike some earlier Gothic writers, Poe does not always make use of the supernatural in his stories. He can also create a sense of horror by evoking the terrible power of nature (\\"A Descent into the Maelstrom\\") or the cruelty of which humans are capable (\\"The Pit and the Pendulum\\"). Both those stories end happily, with the narrator saved almost miraculously from his terrifying predicament, although an escape from death is the exception rather than the rule in Poe's horror stories, where death is more often something inexorable. The death of a beloved young woman is a particularly recurrent theme, possibly reflecting the early deaths of his mother and his wife, and occurs in poems such as \\"Annabel Lee\\", \\"The Raven\\" and \\"Ulalume\\"), and stories such as \\"Ligeia\\" and \\"The Fall of the House of Usher\\". (Both these stories also deal with another of Poe's obsessions, premature burial).Both as a poet and as an author of short stories, Poe is a very uneven writer. At his best, however, he must rank as one of America's finest with a unique ability to conjure up an atmosphere is psychological horror in his stories and to convey emotion through the musical use of language in his poetry. (Perhaps his greatest achievement in this regard is \\"The Bells\\", in which he reproduces in words the sounds of four different types of bell- silver, golden, brazen and iron, corresponding to the emotions of merriment, joy, terror and grief).On a final note, I was very impressed by the handsome elegance of the hardback volume itself, confirming my view that American books, both hardback and paperback, are often superior in quality to British ones."},{"Title":"Complete Stories and Poems of Edgar Allan Poe","review":"BetterWorldBooks did a wonderful job of solving an book copy mix-up , they were outstanding in ther're efforts to please me.I will certainly think of them first in my next book search.

There's usually a novel that they're famous for and while Poe wrote a novel \\"The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym\\", it isn't particularly good and doesn't hold up to the short stories.But what stories they are! They're all filled with madmen, murder, jealousy, betrayal, revenge, magic, death, hatred, ghosts, haunted mansions, talking dead, hypnotists, and jesters - all the elements that went on to make up the horror genre that exists today. Poe is the grandfather of horror whose imagery still captures peoples' imaginations today.The creepy old man with the one large eye in \\"Tell-tale Heart\\" whose still-beating dead heart drives his murderer insane; crazy Roderick Usher who sits in his crumbling mansion haunted by his dead sister's ghost; the figure of death who intrudes upon a prince's party in a locked up castle while all among the countryside reigns the Red Death; the nightmarish swinging pendulum; the living death of \\"M. Valdemar\\"; the sweet revenge of \\"Cask of Amontillado\\"; the immolated bullies of \\"Hop-Frog\\"; the murderous doppelganger of \\"William Wilson\\"; and the early template for the detective stories of later years in \\"Murders in the Rue Morgue\\", \\"Mystery of Marie Roget\\" and \\"Purloined Letter\\" - these are all first class stories that hold up superbly today.The appeal of these captivating stories goes hand in hand with knowledge of Poe's own tortured life that contained numerous instances of heart-ache, loneliness, and loss, tinged with addiction to alcohol and drugs, and a mysterious death that remains unexplained to this day.While the majority of the stories aren't as brilliant as \\"Amontillado\\" or \\"Usher\\", those few stories that are more than vindicate Poe's status as a great writer. And while the lesser stories like \\"Gold Bug\\", \\"Black Cat\\", and \\"Descent into the Maelstrom\\" feel slower, overwritten, and less interesting than the best of Poe, there are moments in them that stand out and make reading them worthwhile.Then there is the poetry. \\"The Raven\\" stands head and shoulders above the others, and remains a startlingly arresting poem to read to yourself or aloud to others. It's sing-song quality is what keeps it so popular and its legendary images of a demented Raven saying \\"Nevermore\\", and entrancing lines \\"Once upon a midnight dreary...\\", make it a poem that people will willingly read, and keep returning to, until the end of time.As with the stories, few other poems manage to reach the heights of \\"Raven\\" but there are a few gems in the poems, some excellent lines and images such as in \\"Lenore\\", \\"The Conqueror Worm\\", \\"Spirits of the Dead\\" and my favourite \\"Annabel Lee\\".Poe's stories are a must-read for all fans of literature, whether horror, gothic or otherwise, as they're not only fascinating and well-written but are also, most importantly, great fun to read. So go on, turn off the lights, and by the glare of the silvery moon open up the pages to one of his stories, and scare yourself like it's 1842... nevermore."},{"Title":"Complete Stories and Poems of Edgar Allan Poe","review":"Edgar Allan Poe is regarded as the undisputed master of the gothic horror genre.

A book of this magnitude is hard to really review because there is so much to comment on it's almost better to comment on nothing but the emotional pull of the work in general. So, with that thought in mind I'll do that very thing. Edgar Allan Poe is one of the darkest writers known to man, but on the upswing he may very well be one of the most influential and overall the most insightful. Reading any of the selected work in this collection (ranging from masterful short stories to some of the most brilliantly crafted poems written) will open a door to another world, a world that lives in each and every one of us, a dark world that we shun for fear of understanding. Poe brilliantly connects us to that world.Poe is often referred to for his horror, stories like \`The Tell Tale Heart' or \`The Black Cat' set a precedent for what we've come to expect from his work, but it's not limited and that's where the pure joy in unexpected gems lies in waiting. Poems like the beautifully written \`Annabelle Lee', a tragic story of love and loss, showcase a side to Poe, that while still maintaining a dark edge comes off softer and more heartfelt. It's almost so beautiful its anti-Poe.Like I've mentioned, there is so much here it's hard to narrow down the must reads. There are just so many here. Every poem and story are classic in their own way and deserve our attention. As some have already commented on, this is not a collection to breeze through or take in all at once. It's too abrasive and may come across drastic and or blunt. It's better to take it piece by piece and really allow the brilliance that was this tortured soul shine through with each passage.Edgar Allan Poe still today proves to be an inspiration for many recent writers, and his influence can be seen in many of the most praised, hailed and cherished a manuscript, but the truth remains that there is only one Edgar Allan Poe, and while writers of today have their own unique twists and assets, an imitation of the predecessor at times is nothing more than an imitation. Poe was the real thing, a genius of the written word and it's tragic that he left before his time was through, but he stays with us through collections like this that capitalize on everything that was great and awe-inspiring about a man who lived darker than the rest of us, not because he was that much more removed from the rest of us but because he knew how to embrace the very darkness that lies in us all."},{"Title":"Complete Stories and Poems of Edgar Allan Poe","review":"It's a finding of modern psychology that depressed people are most in touch with reality.Perhaps this finding is what is meant when they say that great suffering produces great art.Or rather perhaps: Great suffering can produce great art in the hands of the right genuis.Treated with disdain by his adopted father, unable to properly care for his sick wife and dead by two score years in the bottle, Edgar Allen Poe experienced great suffering. He was also the right genuis.His short, pithy poems and stories cull the raw material of your deepest fears to give them life.It is interesting that outside of his work as a writer and putative editor, Poe was also an early skeptic and debunker. He correctly understood that the reason the night sky was not awash in light was because insufficient time had passed for the distant stars light to reach us. He also single handedly debunked a fake chess automaton by showing that it was in fact run by a person concealed in a hidden box.His writing aside, perhaps the ulitimate unsettling thing about Poe is that -- given his prescient understanding of humanity and the world in which it lived -- that he chose and ultimately died from substance abuse in a vain effort to shield himself from that understanding."},{"Title":"Complete Stories and Poems of Edgar Allan Poe","review":"Discovery is one of the greatest thrills of reading, and if you think you have a fairly sufficient understanding of Poe from only such works as &quot;The Raven&quot; or &quot;The Tell-Tale Heart&quot;, think again.After reading this volume I was impressed at the breadth of Poe's work. His most famous works,I have deciceded, are certainly NOT his best ones. Incidentally, this means that if you love Poe, you may grow to love him more. If you are even somewhat attracted to the uncanny aspect of his stories, behold his lesser known and far stranger works.Poe's Victorian attachment to exacting detail makes several of these stories quite gripping. His odd imagination comes to life most vividly in his humor. Yes, Poe wrote humor! Try &quot;the Angel of The Odd&quot;, &quot;The Scythe of Time, &quot;The Imp of the Perverse&quot;, &quot;The Devil in the Belfry&quot;, or &quot;Never Bet the Devil Your Head&quot;.After finishing some of these works, you'll wonder why your high school teachers assigned the blandest of his selections, leaving you with what you may soon consider to be a rather shallow appreciation of his writing.

I once spent a weekend at home memorizing \\"The Raven.\\" Don't believe me? Invite me to a party.I'm outwardly normal. Yet, I'm a huge fan of Edgar Allan Poe and his melancholy genius. Everyone should own a copy of his complete works. Read the poems aloud to a date by candlelight. Read his stories when your by yourself in the dark. Poe's obsession with death and the afterlife -- his outright denial of the finality of death -- is evident everywhere. This tortured soul lived and died miserably and now millions of us embrace his work and lionize the man. Nearly every piece of Poe's work is tragic and beautiful. A volume like this is something you will keep all your life and then you'll pass along the tattered remains to your kids. The tattered remains of the book, I mean. Not your mortal remains.

Its big, easy to read print and hardback."},{"Title":"Complete Stories and Poems of Edgar Allan Poe","review":"Poe has been called the creator of the modern detective story and yet many people have no idea that the character of Sherlock Holmes was inspired by Dupin, the protagonist in \\"The Purloined Letter\\" and \\"The Murders in the Rue Morgue\\". This is not meant to detract from Doyle since I do credit him with mastering the genre. But Poe wrote with meticulous detail and such subtle nuances of logical distinction that he stands among the few truly great American writers.Even Poe's shortest of stories, e.g. The Assignation, The Cask of Amontillado, pack far more visual imagery and intensity of emotion than contemporary pulp fiction authors can contrive in an entire novel stuffed full of crass language and sexual gimmicks. Poe needs no gimmicks to keep you turning the pages.Perhaps Poe does assume a certain level of cultural literacy on the part of the reader that is absent in our modern television society. People actually read books for pleasure in those days. But !I don't believe he was writing for the elite for he was hardly of the upper class. And it is true some stories might contain one or two phrases of \\"non-politically correct\\" language (The Gold Bug, for example). So did Shakespeare, Melville, Twain, and Doyle. But evaluated in the context of his time one can not help but admire his work.I don't want to address at too much length the experiences of many students who have had been force-fed Poe as part of an English literature class. The Merchant of Venice, Anna Karenina, Crime and Punishment, and Lord of the Flies are all books I will never read again due to my onerous experiences in school. However, if you are inclined to delve back into any of the classics in the English language, you can do far worse than to rediscover the tales of Edgar Allan Poe."},{"Title":"Complete Stories and Poems of Edgar Allan Poe","review":"I'm a big fan of Poe, so I always like to take a look at editions I've not seen before.

The Daybreakers actually is the sixth in the series chronicling this great fictional family. Sackett's Land became the first of the series of which there are nineteen episodes or stories. Louis L'Amour, the premier western writer, in my personal opinion, does such a magnificent job of intertwining his incredible research of what actual history there is available, with his personal knowledge of the locations for the settings of his tales. I have never been disappointed with any of his works. I always feel as though I am there in person living out the story among the characters.Each story is captivatingly exciting to be part of, and Louis L'Amour includes his very own life experiences as part of most his books, which in turn makes them seem so true to life. My mother first introduced me to Louis L'Amour's westerns when I was only ten years old and I have read many of them over and over again through the years. Currently I am enjoying them afresh in the AudioBook format. Mojave Crossing is only one of many in the AudioBook format that I have and am enjoying. Be careful, they are very addicting.

L'Amour is a a very consistant writer and I am sure that once you read one you can't stop."},{"Title":"Mojave Crossing","review":"This July, 1964, western novel transports the reader to the years 1875-1879 with a trip through the Mojave desert into Los Angeles, California. The route Tell Sackett takes out of Hardyville, Arizona Territory, leads him to Piute Wash and Rock Spring, then south to Black Canyon, then south to Granite Well, then southwest to Willow Spring and the Sheep Hole Mountains, with a side trip to Hidden Valley, then into Los Angeles (or \\"the Pueblo\\" as it was then known).Once there he stays at Pico House, an 1870 style, 3 story high, blue granite hotel on the corner of Main and Plaza. Along the way Tell meets up with Nolan Sackett and till book's end, though they are related cousins from Tennessee, seem to be on opposite sides. This book doesn't show Nolan at his best until he decides to side with his cousin.Louis L'Amour also gives us much collateral information along the way such as the place known as La Nopalera or as 'The Catus Patch' area being today's Hollywood, and Rancho Rodeo de las Aguas being modern day Beverly Hills. Rodeo drive did originally see many rodeos in its area. He also mentions the town of San Bernardino as originally being a Mormon town, and interestingly Big Horn Sheep are not sheep at all, but in the deer family.In Tell's journey we get this guided tour of a trail to Los Angeles, meet a woman who could be called a witch, seek to recapture stolen gold from Tell, and discover gold from a retired pirate, and meet several down right mean and ornery killers. In several scenes the past comes unexpectedly rushing back to haunt William Tell Sackett in both people and locale.This book once listed as number 6 in the Sackett series, is now listed in THE SACKETT COMPANION: A PERSONAL GUIDE TO THE SACKETT NOVELS by Louis as number 9. If a reader enjoys this novel it is an apt suggestion that he or she will also be interested in THE CALIFORNIOS, another book by Louis L'Amour, though that book is not in the Sackett series. But both books show California to have been equal to any western town of the time though we do not usually consider it such today. Both books help us to realign our thinking to seeing California as rough and ready as any town of the west.Semper Fi."},{"Title":"Mojave Crossing","review":"Havin read many Louis L'amour books it only came natural to read the Sackett stories this one bein a great part of the entire.Tell Sackett the one of three brothers that most of the stories are about, and of course not the ladie's man of the three is begged to take pretty lady across the Mojave desert.

Something that Kanigel explains very well with myriad examples ranging from business to everyday life.It has the great merit to be on the whole fairly balanced, leaving the reader ample space to make his/her own opinion on this important yet controversial figure. It also suggests several further reading avenues, including on education, Soviet economics, and management scholarship.It is, however, regrettable that Kanigel does not deal more explicitly with the very serious and convincingly documented accusations made by the Taylor scholar Wrege (with Copley, the other biographer of reference) regarding Taylor's outright falsifications and blatant lies and manipulations throughout his career - including use of personal connections and direct ownership of companies in order to secure the conduct of ethically and economically questionable human experiments for self-publicity purposes.Although Kanigel repeatedly touches on these disturbing aspects of Taylor's life, methods and ideas, this biography would have gained from some dialogue with Wrege's work, and higher academic research standards generally. Wrege's contribution is acknowledged in the bibliographical section, with mention of certain differences of views but without explaining their exact nature. If Taylor's ideas have defined our modern times, but if these ideas have, as it seems, absolutely no valid empirical foundations, don't we have then a serious problem?In combination with Wrege's 'Frederick W. Taylor, the Father of Scientific Management: Myth and Reality', Kanigel's work remains a good starting point for all those interested in and wish to revisit - or critically reassess - Taylor, scientific management, taylorism, and overall the efficiency principle. Is efficiency really efficient? In the light of Taylor's life, peculiar methods and unconvincing results, one might wonder if the efficiency principle should continue to be taken for granted. Rediscovering Copley's first biography might also be a good follow-up.An excellent biography."},{"Title":"The One Best Way: Frederick Winslow Taylor and the Enigma of Efficiency (Sloan Technology)","review":"200 pages into the book and I was still wondering when he was going to tell us aboutwhat Fred was really known for ( Efficiency theory).Most of the book seems to be taken with excusing Frederick Winslow Taylorfor not understanding why there was a union movementin an America of 12 hour days and child labor.The Japanese think the fellow is just fine and have resurrected him as an Icon.His downfall seems to have been cursing at a Congressmanin a Congressional hearing on labor practices.People were dying in factories everywhere in Americaduring this era of overwork and under pay.I don't think that \\"Sloan Technology\\" is going to be successful inthis hero resurrection. It is just sorry that a good biographer shouldhave taken this job. His Ramanujan book was really good."},{"Title":"The One Best Way: Frederick Winslow Taylor and the Enigma of Efficiency (Sloan Technology)","review":"Kanigel illuminates the life and times of both Fred Taylor and the revolution his ideas spawned. Without explicitly understanding how Taylor's ideas have shaped our lives we cannot understand the profound impact this 19th Centruy man continues having on our day-to-day lives. With the often misplaced notion of efficiency so deeply ingrained in the very fabric of our lives, we often ignore the profound impacts of blind quests for efficiency.Who do you know who can reliably recognize the tipping point where efficiency destroys effectiveness (and with it competitiveness)? Who do you know who would challenge changes in the name of efficiency because the changes would impair quality, effectiveness, morale, or labor relations? Without understanding Fred Taylor and efficiency, how can you avoid mistaken applications of the notion? What will keep a 19th Century man from being the most influential man of both the 20th Century and the 21st Century?"},{"Title":"The One Best Way: Frederick Winslow Taylor and the Enigma of Efficiency (Sloan Technology)","review":"Most people can dish it out a lot easier than they can take it. Frederick Winslow Taylor apparently typified this rule of thumb. Robert Kanigel gives due credit to Taylor, but portrays the father of scientific management as a thin-skinned hypocrite and a phony. Taylor's perfectly-logical theories--lowering production costs to increase the bottom line--paved the way (kinda) from small workshop manufacturing to low-cost mass production. Some potholes nonetheless remained. The changes that scientific management contained were bound to upset some apple carts. But Taylor was his own worst enemy. He was bereft of emotional intelligence, rarely if ever trying to win employee trust and cooperation. Browbeating and rebuking was his m.o. in a for-me-or-against-me ideology.Fred claimed his ideas were unassailable, principally by virtue of his having risen from the ranks of the &quot;working men.&quot; He apparently beat the working-stiff attitude into the ground at every turn in his life. It was was one of two tongues he spoke with. The fact was, Fred Taylor was never a &quot;working man&quot; per se. His very birth put him a class apart.Young Fred Taylor studied at expensive private schools. He never had to worry about his next meal. Au contraire, he and his family ate the finest foods while they checked in and out of chic European resorts. Even with today's egalitarian travel packages, the number of American lathe operators who visit the Old Continent are small by comparison. In Taylor's day, European vacations were exclusively the lifestyle of the rich and famous. Fred deluded himself into thinking he was a garden-variety raggged dick but, like the down-and-out George Orwell, Taylor was a wannabee. There was always a way out. For the real working men, reality was sink or swim.Fred Taylor failed when he finally confronted his intellectual equals in Congress (a dubious distinction). Like an uncoached trial witness, he fell prey to basic court-room set ups. He initially denied insignificant evils! (for example, that the main objective of a firm is to earn money) which he should have acknowledged, then found it impossible to backtrack while saving face. Taylor also claimed complete credit for developing scientific management. In fact, he grasped several different pre-existing ideas (no shame in that), then wove them into scientific management.All in all, Kanigel's analysis seems sound, despite a rather belabored effort. He frequently provides in his text almost full bibliographic references for contemporary secondary sources (what are end notes for?). Kanigel also likes to ignite gossipy tidbits which have little bearing on the subject. He then fans the sparks into nearly complete chapters. It all serves only to pad an already-lengthy text."},{"Title":"The One Best Way: Frederick Winslow Taylor and the Enigma of Efficiency (Sloan Technology)","review":"For anyone who has worked - on an assembly line, as a bureaucrat-in-a-box - the greatest workplace nemesis is a nonexistent ideal: the theoretical person against whom your &quot;efficiency&quot; is measured. Often, not even a boss or office rival is as irritating as this cold standard, the product of stopwatch-wielding efficiency experts and industrial psychologists who claim to have a scientific measure of &quot;average output.&quot; In The One Best Way, science writer Robert Kanigel examines the first so-called efficiency expert of them all: Frederick Taylor, the turn-of-the-century engineer and pioneering management consultant.Taylor's idea was simple: break down all jobs into their smallest component tasks, experiment to determine the best way to accomplish them and how fast they can be performed, and then find the right workers to do them. It was called scientific management, or &quot;Taylorism&quot; -- a formula to maximize the productivity of industrial workers. &quot;The coming of Taylorism,&quot; Kanigel writes, took &quot;currents of thought drifting through his own time -- standards, order, production, regularity, efficiency -- and codif[ied] them into a system that defines our age.&quot;Though he had an enormous impact on our everyday lives, today Taylor is little known outside management circles. This is curious: in his own time, Taylor was a world-class celebrity, advocating an organizational revolution that would link harder work to higher wages -- as well as instituting shorter working hours and regular &quot;cigarette breaks.&quot; His books and articles were translated into all the major languages and passionately studied, even in the Soviet Union, as guides to a future industrial utopia; he was, in many ways, Stalin's prophet. Yet Taylor was also reviled as a slave driver who devalued skilled labor and despised the common worker, and he was ridiculed as a failure in many of his business undertakings.Much of Kanigel's book is devoted to descriptions of the shops that Taylor worked in: a ball-bearing factory, a paper mill, and machine-tool plants, to name a few. It's dramatic how different the world he describes is from the work environment of today. Here were no highly educated managers attempting to exercise minute control over relatively unskilled employees. Instead, craftsmen dominated these oily pits -- spinning steel-cutting lathes, constructing elaborate sand molds for machine tools, and maintaining the gigantic leather belts that harnessed the energy of central steam engines. THis was in many ways the most fascinating part of the book for me: I learned what people did in the decaying mills that surrounded my New England home.To all but the most practiced eye, such a workplace was a chaotic scene. What the craftsmen did -- and what they were capable of -- was largely a mystery to management, which deprived the managers of control and power, leading to a number of stunningly counterproductive practices. If tool and die makers produced jigs beyond a certain threshold, for example, 19th-century foremen would dock (!) their pay per item -- an obvious incentive for them to slow down. And because ball-bearing inspectors in a Fitchburg mill worked slowly and talked too much, they were forced to put in 101/2 -hour days, without breaks.Taylor witnessed such practices and decided to change them. In one of his most famous experiments, on &quot;Schmidt&quot;, he got a common laborer to double the number of bars of pig iron he transported down a plank each day. All he did was pay the man more, linking higher output directly to higher wages -- hardly a revolutionary thought today. His solution for the gossipy ball-bearing inspectors was to separate them, shorten their working hours, increase their pay, and allow them to relax occasionally; in return, they were expected to work harder, and they did.Once Kanigel establishes that Taylor's method worked well (to a certain extent), the book becomes tough going. Despite his elegant prose, Kanigel's exhaustive treatment of his subject's life and experiments strained my interest. Do we really need to know, for example, that Taylor once spent months alternating the size of coal shovels in the name of furnace-stoking efficiency? Or the entire list of his vacation companions for one summer? Such biographical detail can add spice to a compelling narrative, but to include them only as an exercise in thoroughness, as Kanigel does, is simply tiring. Taylor simply is not interesting as a personality.Kanigel also glosses over many important issues. Taylorism really did devalue certian kind sof skilled labor, and the costs have been high. The &quot;Taylorized&quot; doctors of the HMO era, for example, must work with administrators peeking over their shoulders, dispensing pills at the expense of empathy and other unmeasurable healing skills. And once factory workers lost their control and even their comprehension of manufacturing processes, many ceased to take pride in their work and stopped making suggestions for improvement. This may be one reason why Japanese and European design is often superior to American. Taylorism also spawned the rise of management consulting, with its sham exercises and goals -- often a huge diversion of managerial talent in the name of efficiency. Kanigel, however, largely ignores this darker side of Taylorism; the true impact of his legacy gets lost in the details. The result is a 600-page profile of a narrow and compulsive man with a single, if influential, idea.Recommended, but only for scholars and specialists."},{"Title":"The One Best Way: Frederick Winslow Taylor and the Enigma of Efficiency (Sloan Technology)","review":"This is a wonderful book. You shouldn't reject this book based upon your opinion of its subject. The books is written very well and evokes enough of the times in which Taylor lived to give us a more nuanced portrait of the man within the context of his world.Nowadays, F.W. Taylor is often portrayed as either a villain who has all but enslaved us or he is defended as not really meaning what he said. Instead, this book shows us Taylor's nineteenth century upper middle-class background and spends a good amount of time on character development and work habits.Once all this is understood, Taylor's seemingly obsessive goals become more understandable. He did have many important insights in making work efficient. When he began manufacturing was done in thousands of very small shops. It was horribly inefficient. His work did help our economy and helped the average worker become more productive. However, I still can't understand how someone could think having a human body physically haul 47 tons of pig iron per day is a good thing. There is a definite quality of life aspect that still wasn't grasped by these early efficiency experts.Another extremely valuable topic the author clarifies is that Henry Ford's assembly line had more to do with meatpacking than Taylor's Scientific Management. Taylor's critics have unjustly used Henry Ford's manufacturing techniques as evidence against Taylor's methods when Ford himself made statements denying Taylor's influence. Also, like many original thinkers, Taylor was ill served by many who came after him and used his name but not his methods. This is all clearly laid out in this valuable book.This isn't a whitewash or a book of simple praise. It paints a complex portrait of Taylor, but gives us enough context to understand him within his time. We get to know something of his character and that helps a great deal. It is a big book but reads short and is surprisingly engaging for a book on manufacturing. This book gave me insights into the early twentieth century that I needed to make certain pieces fall into place. It has a prominent place in my library and I hope a lot of people read it."},{"Title":"The One Best Way: Frederick Winslow Taylor and the Enigma of Efficiency (Sloan Technology)","review":"I picked up this book because I wanted to have a better understanding of Frederick Taylor and Scientific Management. I got it. Although at times Kanigel's sentence structure got a bit convoluted, particularly at the beginning, I found the book fascinating and useful to the end.One of the major premises of the book is that we owe, or wish we did not owe, to Taylor the driving , amost relentless beat of our own age to be efficient, to use every spare moment. He revolutionized the world by combining elements that had existed for years into a coherent whole. We live with that legacy, for good or evil. As a manager and as someone concerned with organizations, I found the book not only good reading, but useful in thinking about my own work and how I view what I do.

Kanigel does a better job than most historians of making manufacturing history interesting. For me, there may have been a little more emphasis on Taylor's early life than I would normally be interested in, but Kanigel does an excellent job of defining Taylor. I had known that Taylor was famous for his time study techniques, what I didn't know was that he may have been partially or indirectly responsible for the advent and/or need for the human resources profession as well. He also had some involvement in cost accounting as it relates to calculating overhead rates for which I will be eternally disappointed in him for. He may have also been partially responsible for establishing the profession of manufacturing consultant as well.

Kanigel puts a tremendous amount of research and heart into these projects, and The One Best Way is no exception. I'd never actually heard of Frederick Winslow Taylor, and perhaps few people have outside of business school, but Kanigel shows that this man is a very important figure not only in the business world, but in affecting society in general. Taylor, through making the workplace more efficient, wanted to improve the lives of workers, but he may in fact have done the opposite. There is a tremendous amount of historical detail in this book; it is not a concise summary of Taylor's life but rather a thorough history of it.

For this reason, Robert Kanigel's biography necessarily reads at times like a meditation on efficiency, on manufacturing, or simply on being a pioneer. The author is clearly up to the task. He also explains manufacturing and Taylor's studies, and the implications thereof, with great clarity and often with wit. This is one of the major strenghts of the work, for it allows Kanigel to communicate the importance of Taylor and Taylorism effectively to a general audience. Sometimes, though, he seems to get carried away -- as in the &quot;Report from the End of the Century&quot; that takes up 65 pages in the paperback edition.The text shines, but one wishes for more coverage of his personal life. Kanigel seems content to begin with an extended view of Taylor's boyhood and nearer relatives. Then in adulthood he relegates any other issues to microscopic sketches, each spliced into one point in the narrative whether all their elements belong there or not. We are not given a sense of how these relationships developed over time. Such a treatment only contributes to the choppiness and lengthiness of the narrative. But these problems do not much harm the quality of the biography as a whole."},{"Title":"The One Best Way: Frederick Winslow Taylor and the Enigma of Efficiency (Sloan Technology)","review":"For anyone with an interest in the history of management theory, the early twentieth century, or what life was like without the extreme material abundance that marks our civilization (and how we came to be that way), this book is phenomenal. Kanigel deserves special praise for his even-handed treatment of the subject and of the many controversies that surround it. I got the sense that, through writing this book, he came to really appreciate Taylor and fully understand his critics.I especially appreciated that he refrained from drawing conclusions about how to reconcile Taylor's ideas with later movements or from reinterpreting him through modern eyes. Instead, he leaves this all-important work to the reader.Overall, the book is extremely well done. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The One Best Way: Frederick Winslow Taylor and the Enigma of Efficiency (Sloan Technology)","review":"Frederick Winslow Taylor virtually created some aspects of modern management. His influence was so powerful and so pervasive, that many things we now take for granted were concepts that he pioneered and if you hear about Taylor at all, it's usually with a strong negative judgpment.Taylor, who did some of the very first efficiency studies, is vilified as the person who tried to turn people into machines. He's seen as the progenitor of the efficiency studies. The first of those assumptions is partially true, and the second is certainly true that needs to be set in context..What author Robert Kanigal has done is clean up the facts and set Taylor in context.He does this with an excellent history/biography. We learn that Taylor, who came from a wealthy background, also spent time working in machine shops. We find him learning as much from that process as from formal education; and claiming at times that the practical experience of working in a shop is necessary to understand industry - or at least industry as it was developing when he did his studies.That time was the late 19th and early 20th Century. Even though the Industrial Revolution had been going on for awhile, factories were still developing into what we know them as today. Taylor showed how individual workers could be more efficient and effective. This was great for production, but not always popular with the workers he studied.Taylor's studies gave rise to what was called \\"scientific management\\" and laid the groundwork for later \\"efficiency experts\\" like the Gilbreaths of \\"Cheaper by the Dozen\\" fame. His legacy is both positive and negative.Part of his positive legacy is that Taylor demonstrated that you could actually study the way work was done and make improvements in the process. That's a powerful insight and like most powerful insights, it can be used for good or ill.One of Taylor's famous studies, for example, tried to determine the most efficient way to shovel coal into steel mill furnaces. Taylor found that the mill could make great improvements in efficiency by changing things like the location of the pile of coal, the design of the shovel, and by allowing the shovellers to take periodic rest breaks.Lots of folks who owned factories loved things like this. They got the shovels. The located the pile of coal where Taylor suggested. But they often left out things the didn't like, such as those periodic rest breaks.What Taylor gave the world were powerful methods of analysis that can make factories and shops and offices more effective. In that sense, he would be the grandparent of techniques like operations research, statistical quality control and kaizen.But, like the rest of us, Taylor was a product of his times, of his breeding, and of his experience. Like the rest of us, he had human flaws. The strength of this book is that it gives you a look at the whole picture.You get to see just how remarkable Taylor's insights were, and how his life and experience shaped those insights. You get to see how others took what he had to say and used it both for good and for ill. And you get that all in a well-written biography that will hold your attention."},{"Title":"The One Best Way: Frederick Winslow Taylor and the Enigma of Efficiency (Sloan Technology)","review":"This was so interesting, I couldn't stop reading it; Frederick WinslowTaylor's impact on our daily lives is amazing this was The One Best Way."},{"Title":"Four views of Christ","review":"For anyone interested in getting further than a Sunday Morning sermon into the bible and it's spiritual revelations, this book is for you.

This book is essentially a vehicle for promoting his revisionist agenda. Much of the content has already been shot down by a variety of military historians, including current Senior Lecturer of War Studies at Sandhurst, Christopher Pugsley.Belich reels off a series of ludicrous claims including:- The Maori 'invented' trench warfare in the mid-19th century (trenches had already been used in European conflicts, with the Lines of Torre Vedras being case in point)- Gate Pa took heavier shellfire per square inch than any point of the Somme in WW1 ( Gate Pa had an 8-hour bombardment with 16 field pieces and one large-calibre naval gun, as compared to 950 large-calibre modern artillery pieces deluging Bazentin Ridge with 650lb of shells per metre)- In the Anglo-Zulu War, Ulundi wasn't a 'great victory' (2,000+ Zulu dead, the capture of Cetshwayo and the burning of the Zulu capital apparently doesn't constitute a 'great victory')The book is a heavily distorted version of events coloured not only by the author's political bias, but by the fact he simply doesn't understand the mechanics of 19th century warfare and has no frame of reference to work from. He also deliberately omits key facts when they conflict with his views and cherrypicks quotes (often out of context) while ignoring contradictory material from the same source.A classic example is in Chapter 5, where Belich devotes 8 pages to the battle of Puketakuuere (which is fair enough), while the crushing Maori defeat at Redoubt No.3 (one of the heaviest by either side in the whole campaign) is covered in a single sentence with no mention of casualties. The later abortive Maori attack on Sentry Hill is also covered in a single sentence, with no reference to the 30+ Maori killed in the action. An interesting aside is that the Maori at Sentry Hill believed their 'Hau Hau' incantations and hand gestures would magically protect them from bullets as they casually sauntered towards the redoubt in open order. Predictably, Belich doesn't touch this with a bargepole.Then there's the more serious matter of Belich being caught making authoritive reference to fabricated quotes. When confronted about this, he attempted to claim that the 'quotes' he invented reflected the general views of the historical figure in question and it was something they 'would have said'. This kind of thing is generally referred to in academic circles as LYING.Basically, Belich has no credibility as a military historian whatsoever and this book was written expressly to rewrite history to match his ideals."},{"Title":"The New Zealand wars and the Victorian interpretation of racial conflict","review":"Twenty years after its publication, this remains one of the most controversial interpretations of an aspect of New Zealand history. The book opens with an inequivocal statement of intent: \\"This is a revisionist history of the New Zealand Wars.\\" Although it was initially hailed as a brilliant new interpretation, however, large sections have since been discredited in detail.As examples, Belich claims (incorrectly) that Maori invented modern trench warfare; that the Ngapuhi chiefs Hone Heke and Kawiti 'won' the Northern War of 1845-6; that the British never understood, and therefore could not counter, Maori strategy; that the British defeat at Gate Pa in 1864 was the result of a Maori 'ambush'....the list goes on. What is interesting is that no military historian - Maori or non-Maori - has ever endorsed his interpretation.Belich's reputation suffered a blow in 1998, when a television series based on this book was parodied by satirists and ridiculed by military historians. His reputation suffered what should have been a fatal blow in 2000, when it was revealed that some of the references in the book did not exist, but had been 'created' to support the argument. Belich's dwindling number of supporters are now reduced to making silly comments about his critics, rather than debating points on their merits.Notwithstanding, this book is worth reading. However, it must be read alongside the earlier works that Belich dimisses with such contempt (particularly Cowan's 'New Zealand Wars'). Readers should be aware that Belich has no standing as a military historian. This is most clearly demonstrated by his use of the terms 'strategy' and 'tactics' indiscriminately, and his complete lack of comprehension of operational art.Probably the book's greatest value is as a demonstration of revisionism 'gone too far', and what happens when a historian arranges the 'facts' to suit his or her thesis, rather than testing his or her thesis against the facts."},{"Title":"The New Zealand wars and the Victorian interpretation of racial conflict","review":"Prof. Belich has become 'the authority' on the New Zealand Wars and this book has become the standard text. This is hugely unfortunate. Not only is Belich's thesis that the native Maori were tactical and strategic wizards that were more than capable of facing the might of Imperial Britain (and in the process 'invented' a totally new form of trench warfare) profoundly flawed, the manner in which be supports his thesis is somewhat dubious. Belich frequently leaves out information that conflicts with his argument and often deliberately misquotes sources in support of what he wants to say.The disagreement and debate regarding any given interpretation of an event is a normal and even critical part of the academic or social environment. The fact that Belich presents a revisionist thesis on a subject that has not been comprehensively dealt with for 60 or so years is to be applauded, and certainly the fact that it has provoked a renewed interest in the subject here in New Zealand is wonderful.

Not only is it reprehensible and reveals much about Belich himself and the historic Academia in NZ but it has given birth to some complete factual falsehoods now being believed amongst some Maori that are dangerous.Belich is NOT a military historian and certainly has no first-hand military experience. The fact he could actually believe for a second that \\"trench warfare was invented by the Maori\\" despite the wealth of documentation of defensive trenches used in the Napoleonic wars alone is ignorant, hilarious and disgraceful.

As a reader, I have to confess that this is not one of my favorite books; just as D. H. Lawrence is on the whole a writer I respect more than enjoy. But any serious student of the English novel has to acknowledge the importance of his novels. Even more than in his great classic novel SONS AND LOVERS, Lawrence in his pair of novels THE RAINBOW and WOMEN IN LOVE (originally conceived as a single novel, but split apart upon rewrites) helped rewrite the rules of what was possible in the novel.There are four significant ways in which this novel (and its successor) represents something entirely new. First, Lawrence in THE RAINBOW largely dispenses with plot as the major structural device. Only in a very vague sense does the novel tell a story at all. It records the various attempts by members of three generations of the Brangwen family to achieve selfhood, but we don't get a plot so much as a succession of characters. Virtually none of the storytelling devices that were crucial to most previous novelists were of much use to Lawrence, simply because most of those devices were aids in creative exposition, whereas the narrative in this novel is minimal.Second, abandoning plot, Lawrence attempts to frame a novel around characterization, but having determined to focus on character development, he furthermore refuses to focus on a single character. There is no central protagonist to the novel (though Ursula, who will be the protagonist of WOMEN IN LOVE, comes close), but a collection of characters that as a group command our interest. Again, this is a departure from traditional novelistic practice, where virtually every English or for that matter non-English novel had a central character involved in much or most of the action in the novel. In cinematic or stage terms, Lawrence deploys an ensemble cast, spending perhaps more time on Ursula Brangwen than the others, but nonetheless diffusing the novel's concern to all of them.Third, Lawrence wanted to treat individual characters in a way that had not previously been seen in English fiction. Though many novelists had created marvelously complex characters, even the most complex appeared simplistic compared to Lawrence's. He wanted to develop psychologically complex characters that contained much of the complexity of real people, whose personalities can never been captured precisely in fiction. Lawrence's characters are richly illogical, filled with contrary motives, fluidly change their minds or feelings, and are subject to a host of influences. In other words, they are very much like normal human beings. Lawrence illustrates the ways that people are marvelous blends of contradictory impulses. His characters are not psychologically tidy because that simply isn't the way people are, so that while on one level Lawrence if noted for writing richly symbolic novels, they are also in this regard exercises in psychological realism. One can find fault with the way he depicts his characters. For instance, I think he underestimated the role that empathy and sympathy play in human relationships. Also, his characters are so consistently depicted in unflattering ways that one wonders whether Lawrence liked people at all. One reads Whitman, for instance, and is struck by his passionate love of humanity, seemingly motivated by his conviction that no man is an island to find something redeemable even in the dregs of humanity, loving both the escaped and the bounty hunter chasing down the slave in equal amounts. Whitman is unstinting in his love of human beings. Lawrence seemingly loves no one, and seems at times to believe that all men and women truly are islands. But one can disagree with Lawrence's views of humanity while still admiring his attempt to produce psychologically compelling portraits of real people.Finally, Lawrence helped transform the English novel by bringing a degree of sensuality that had otherwise been missing in fiction. I don't mean just sexuality, though there is that as well, but a complete opening of the imagination to sensual imagery. Lawrence, for instance, writes about the beauties of nature as convincingly as any novelist working in the English language. I find his nature imagery more convincing and honest than those, say, of Wordsworth. Some of his imagery touching the moon or men working in fields or the effects of sunlight are deeply effecting. The novel was banned for a number of words that were deemed too provocative and obscene, as well as for some profoundly sensual scenes. The words strike us as quaint today, especially one word that offended many: \\"belly.\\" The scene that provoked the most outrage was the one where Anna Brangwen nee Lensky would when pregnant undress and slowly dance ritualistically in her room before the fire.Despite these remarkable achievements, I find it hard to like Lawrence in general and this book in particular. I give the book five stars because it deserves them, but it is not a book that gives me much joy or delight. Part of this comes from the fact that Lawrence comes across as a bit of a misanthrope. He seems a person more fixated upon discovering what is wrong with someone than in praising what is good. To refer to the familiar distinction, he is a \\"glass half empty\\" kind of person. There are moments of bliss in his books, but I rarely experience joy or happiness. In other words, I do not like Lawrence's novels largely because of what I sense to be characteristics of Lawrence's personality that I do not like. His gifts as a writer are immense, and what he did to help transform the English novel should inspire the gratitude of everyone who loves literature. But as a whole he is an author I respect rather than admire, appreciate than love. This remains, however, a novel that any serious student of the English novel should read carefully. It and his successor WOMEN IN LOVE truly represent one of the turning points in the development of the English novel."},{"Title":"The Rainbow (Macmillan students' novels)","review":"I successively declare each Lawrence novel I encounter to be the best I've read, but in my opinion, &quot;The Rainbow&quot; is especially brilliant in its painstaking and accurate depiction of the universal experience of adolescence...and especially noteworthy in its spot-on description of the evolving feelings and thoughts of adolescent girls. Lawrence's feeling for and understanding of his female characters is astounding, particularly when compared with that of other writers of his time.This work is sometimes criticized because of &quot;repetitiveness&quot; in the writing, but I find the repeated phrases add to, not detract from, the power of the novel. As in Lady Chatterley, he also manages to work in many brilliant and cutting observations of the price of progress in an industrial society, and document in careful, keen-eyed accuracy the varying responses of his characters--and, through them, archetypal human responses--to that society."},{"Title":"The Rainbow (Macmillan students' novels)","review":"Much criticism has been leveled at D. H. Lawrence, from varying levels of sophistication and experience, but here is a novel to justify his continuing high place among English novelists, now as much as ever.The story line runs chronologically. The events detail three generations of the Brangwan family, and occur mostly around the turn of the twentieth century, in the same coal mining area where Lawrence came of age. The Industrial Revolution was in full sway and had changed the lives of most people, but the Brangwan family had managed to steer away from at least some of it's influences by owning a rich plot of farmland and also by being blessed with some artistic talent. Though the coal and iron mining that fed the Industrial Machine had a positive material advantage when considering the mean and menial conditions of previous centuries, the grime and ugliness, the pollution, and the conditions of hard labor were not always such an improvement and made some wonder what had gone wrong or whether there was a way out. Also at this time, England, in order to secure it's preeminence as a global power, had become exploitive in Africa and India, two places where the character Anton Skrebensky was stationed.Most of the book is about the youth and coming to age of Ursula Brangwan. The book follows the lives of her Grandfather and parents, but that's mostly background, setting the stage for Ursula. What is especially notable is the focus that the author has into the inner lives of his characters: their struggles and what they are faced with, their emotions, desires, yearnings. The actual events have a secondary importance. Hardly anything very dramatic as an action or confluence of events ever occurs. What is of primary importance is the character's (especially Ursula's) own view of themselves and their own emotions in dealing with all the negatives that life could throw at them at that particular time and place.There are long passages in the book about Ursula's relationship with Anton Skrebensky. Much of it is intertwined with descriptions of the forces of Nature or the beauties of Creation - descriptions for which Lawrence had a special affinity; devices that dramatize the character's inner lives. Ursula is usually not so desperate that she cannot afford to want freedom in her life, something that conflicts very much with Anton. Even so, though she is fortunate in some respects, as a young women she still has a limited range of possible choices other than marriage. The most obvious alternative is teaching school. One of the most powerful sections in the book, in my opinion, is her experience teaching in a working class school and the dilemma she faces there: having to sacrifice some of her principles not even to succeed, but just to get by.One of the criticisms of Lawrence concerns his use of exaggeration in language. I don't think that criticism holds up well here. The exaggeration is a kind of device. And, human emotions are strong for any thinking and feeling human being who struggles for freedom over bondage, or sanctuary from madness."},{"Title":"The Rainbow (Macmillan students' novels)","review":"Lawrence's fame (or notoriety) rests on his sexual frankness, but what a lot of readers overlook is how well he wrote about parent-child relationships and family dynamics. The beginning of this novel is absolutely brilliant: Tom Brangwen and the Polish widow marry in haste, then find that they still haven't worked out their relationship. Her young daughter is an uneasy third party, and the child's sensitivity to the unease in their household is beautifully described, as well as her stepfather's gentle efforts to befriend her. As Lawrence continues the family history, his usual obsessions surface. But in general, it's a good story: sex is an organic part of his characters' lives rather than the mainspring of the whole plot (as in some of his other novels). And the characters come across as multi-dimensional human beings rather than talking heads (or other organs) for Lawrence's comments on life. A good novel for people who &quot;don't like D.H. Lawrence.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Rainbow (Macmillan students' novels)","review":"Spanning the years 1840 to 1905, D.H. Lawrence's &quot;The Rainbow&quot; is the story of three generations of a rural English family, focusing on five main characters. More than just a simple family history, it is about gender conflict and the quest for identity and individualism.The novel begins with the early life of Tom Brangwen, a simple, poorly educated farmer. He marries a well-bred Polish widow named Lydia Lensky, who has a young daughter named Anna. Like any kid with a new parent, Anna is reluctant to adapt to her new environment, but eventually she learns to love Tom like her own father. When she grows up, she falls in love with Tom's nephew Will, and they get married and have very many children, an extraordinary number by today's standards but understandable back then when there was a higher infant mortality rate. Their oldest daughter, Ursula, emerges as the most prominent character, the one with whom the last half of the novel is most concerned.Ursula is nothing like her mother or her grandmother. She resents her parents' provinciality and her mother's complacency of being kept at home to be a baby-making machine and a domestic servant. Falling in love with a young man named Anton Skrebensky, she is unwilling to accept the dullness of being a wife. She rejects the sanctimoniousness and hollowness of religion. She becomes interested in the Women's Movement, such as it existed in the earliest years of the 1900's. She finds a new, exciting experience in a lesbian relationship with her teacher, Miss Inger. She decides to take up a profession, and teaching is one of the very few open to young women of the day. When given charge of a class, she soon learns that she must abandon her meekness and solicitude and become a stern disciplinarian if she wants to succeed as a teacher, and by doing so she manages to earn the respect of the unruly students and the other teachers. So ultimately, &quot;The Rainbow&quot; becomes the story of Ursula's (and woman's) self-liberation.The novel is structurally and thematically enigmatic. It presents conflicts but does not seek to resolve them. Its characters exist as dynamic life forms, interacting with and drawing vivacity from each other, and do not merely serve the purpose of advancing the plot, which has no beginning or end. It challenges conventional Victorian notions of feminine roles and sexual propriety, offering moments of daring sexual innuendo for its time, though necessarily muted by the censors of the day. While this book is not really a feminist tract, it offers unique insight into the issues of social, political, and economic equality of the sexes."},{"Title":"The Rainbow (Macmillan students' novels)","review":"This is a book that needs to be read relatively quickly to get the full effect. A masterful, overwhelming, huge, almost perfect book. He traces the history of the main character through multiple generations of parents to explain in incredible detail the creation of the protagonist. The use of a long running darkness and light metaphor, echoes Conrad, and gives an erieness to the book, the best example of this is early in chapter 15, and incorporates some of his pro-nature anti-business themes.His critique of industrialism and mindless consumerism at the expense of nature I found to be enormously topical. The concluding 10 pages, particularly the last 100 or so lines are truly epic and wonderful.Entrenched in the middle of this long book, I found I stopped noticing lawrence's style. Though I repeat the recomendation of reading the book in large chunks."},{"Title":"The Rainbow (Macmillan students' novels)","review":"The Rainbow by D.H. Lawrence is a fascinating saga of three generations of Brangwen family. I should have read this book before \\"Women in Love\\". Although there is no connection between the two. Numerous characters come and fade away making room for our protagonist, Ursula Brangwen. She is the quintessential Lawrence character, also appeared as Paul Morel in \\"Sons and Lovers\\" and Gudrin in \\"Women in Love\\". They attain everything they desire and yet reject and abandon what they seek to soar even higher. They surely triumph and that is the beauty of all his creations. I guess if all stories end up \\"lived happily ever after\\", then nobody would have heard of Shakespeare.It must have been a shock to the early 20th century readers of the beautiful lesbian liaison of Ursula and her teacher, not to mention numerous premarital sexual romps with Anton Skrebensky. Lawrence exquisite and poetic prose make it exhilrating and yet sensual. I guess he kept all the graphic detail for \\"Lady Chatterely's Lover\\".It is a great book with chock full of unforgetable charectors in the rich tradition of Dickens and Hardy. I"},{"Title":"The Rainbow (Macmillan students' novels)","review":"THE RAINBOW is the story of three generations of the Brangwen family. Beginning with the first, D. H. Lawrence shows the intricacies of human relations that frequently have no more going for them than just good looks or sexual passion. It seemed inexplicable to Lawrence that as many relations worked out as they did. His concern was in finding the rationale for the successes, and in THE RAINBOW he suggests that success in a relation is a function of the recognition that all relations begin in conflict, which in turn imply either a resolution which ends in success or a non-resolution which does not. The paradox that is inherent even in the first generation of Brangwens is that most people are by definition unique and therefore independent. It is only when they connect romantically that a fusion may occur--or perhaps not. It is this reaching out for connection, from man to woman, from man to society, that marks the underlying order of THE RAINBOW.Tom Brangwen is of the first generation. He is decent enough but alone and feels a void that only a woman can fill. He sees a Polish woman named Lydia Lensky to whom he feels an instant attraction. They meet, they talk, and conventionally fall in love. But they are supremely different in nearly all areas, including their ages. She is older by six years and has a daughter from a previous marriage. But they recognize and accept the paradox that individuality must merge with a collective identity. This they do and the relationship is secure. It is here that Lawrence introduces the near mystical \\"blood\\" affinity that two people have--or not--in any ongoing relation. Tom and Lydia have it. They have children but the one who comes into focus is Lydia's child from before, Anna. As Anna grows into womanhood, she clearly does not \\"have\\" it. Her blood speaks in a whisper and her husband Will does not hear it even after having nine children. The divisions between them are real enough, but they are no more or less real than those that Tom and Lydia were able to solve. Neither Anna nor Will connect. They are simply two spouses who maintain their uniqueness and never merge. They do manage to have children, one of whom is Ursula, who will return as a mature woman in Lawrence's sequel, WOMEN IN LOVE. Ursula is relentless in her wish to connect with someone or something. She tries teaching, but remains unfulfilled. She has an affair with a Polish officer named Anton Skrebensky, and discovers that raw sexual passion is not enough to bridge the gap from where she is to where she wants to be. She even tries a lesbian relation with a schoolmate, Winifred Inger, a factor which undoubtedly led to the public outcry to ban Lawrence's book. That too is unfruitful. Ursula is crushed when she learns that Winifred marries Ursula's uncle. When Skrebensky pops up out of nowhere, they recommence their affair but she is sure that they are never going to connect. By the end of the book, Ursula has an epiphany. She sees a rainbow. In the world of Lawrence, a rainbow is a potent symbol of rebirth. Ursula sees it the same way. To her, the rainbow is a mystical piece of architecture that promises that someday she will connect perhaps in a manner not unlike Judy Garland seeking her Oz. Thus, Lawrence indicates that the rainbow is the visual objective correlative of the magical blood that as he writes in his famous letter will allow Ursula, \\"To be alive, to be man alive, to be whole man alive: that is the point.\\" Putting aside the sexist pronoun, that is indeed his point."},{"Title":"The Rainbow (Macmillan students' novels)","review":"How unusual to find a male novelist so deeply understanding of the subtle differences in the way the sexes react to each other and society. Each generation of Brangwen came closer to the ultimate reality of freedom and self fulfillment. Of course it was finally Ursula who frees her soul totally and connects to the larger more infinite existence. This book was truly a deep and exultant experience."},{"Title":"The Rainbow (Macmillan students' novels)","review":"This is not D. H. Lawrence's best novel. It may have been ground-breaking and scandalous 100 years ago but it hasn't aged well and the prose are at times simply ridiculous. I almost gave up about 25% of the way through the novel, after having suffered through page after page of something like this: \\"He awoke reveling in his fecundity. He had slept deeply, immersed in thought about his wife's own fecundity. She was rarely as fecund as he but she was still quite fecund. Some townspeople believed his fecundity was greatest on Sundays, at church. Others thought him especially fecund on weekdays when he carved his wood. He hoped he'd always be fecund because life without fecundity was like a gaping, bottomless hole of Godless, endless sorrow\\". Enough already! Did I see the novel through to the end? I did. Did it enrich my life in any way? No. Should you read it? I'd start with Sons and Lovers. If you love it, you might like The Rainbow. If not, move directly to much better-written works, perhaps Madame Bovary or Portrait of a Lady. Because life is too short for fecundity."},{"Title":"The Rainbow (Macmillan students' novels)","review":"For the time it was written The Rainbow must have been quite controversial. Themes such as sexual promiscuity and homosexuality are dealt with.The story is of three generations of tempremental women coming to terms with their own sensuality and femminism.Like most of the books of that generation that were written by British authors, the prose is beautiful and poetic. But unlike its predecessors, the female characters are strong and femminism is a central theme.Personally, I prefer American writers such as Twain, London, or Steinbeck who create more beleivable and down to earth characters.I just do not seem to enjoy the stories of Wolfe, Hardy, and Lawrence, although I do appreciate their prose."},{"Title":"The Rainbow (Macmillan students' novels)","review":"The essential project of the Romantic Movement and the Left in the past 100 or more years, perhaps best expressed in the novels of Lawrence, is to replace Love with Passion. Love you see is a mutual thing. It requires interrelations and bonds which are anathema to the wholly nihilistic, individualistic and selfish intellectual elites of the Modern era. What in the end does Freudianism consist of, other than an attack on the foundations of the family?Passion on the other hand, requires nothing from anyone other than the individual. It does not require that the object of one's desires reciprocate. The individual, whole in himself, can experience passion.Lawrence, in these novels (Rainbow &amp; Women in Love) and others, tried to explore new alternatives to the traditional Western structures of marriage, family and Christianity. He hoped to recreate humans and human relations in new forms, unbound by tradition and reason.It is for this fundamental attack on the great accomplishments of Western Civilization that his books should have been banned, not because of some wildly melodramatic sex scenes in the haystacks.GRADE: F"},{"Title":"The Rainbow (Macmillan students' novels)","review":"Make no mistake: I would not have read this book unless I was compelled by, say, a teacher. And compelled I was. After finishing it, I think it's a great book and I'm glad that I read it, but paradoxically, I don't think I would do it again.The only way to describe \\"The Rainbow\\" is that it would be more of a masterpiece if you didn't have to read it. If there was somehow a method in which you could absorb this book without cutting through Lawrence's prose, this would be undoubtingly be one of the greatest books ever [not] written.Unfortunately this is impossible, because the style is inextricably connected with the thematics and direction of the book as a whole. So we as the reader must deal with the prose, because the text is as close as the reader will ever get to the novel, although I think that one of Lawrence's central themes is that the text cannot itself represent life. Hence you have text that attempts to depict life, text that knows implicitly that it will fail at this task, yet text that will try as hard as it can to draw out this picture of three generations of a family.In class we listed a few adjectives that would describe Lawrence's style for \\"The Rainbow\\":+Repetitive+Lyrical+Oppositional+Fecund+Slow-motion+Translated+Intense...and the list goes on. If you are very patient and can deal with the text beyond the text, so to speak, you will like this book. If you are like me, you will not like this book, but you will be glad that you read it."},{"Title":"The Rainbow (Macmillan students' novels)","review":"I have read others of Lawrence's books and thoroughly enjoyed them, but this one bored me to tears. It was not only repetitive, but unnecessarily florid, slow, and melodramatic. Here is a sample:&quot;Gradually she realised that her life, her freedom, was sinking under the silent grip of his physical will. He wanted her in his power. He wanted to devour her at leisure, to have her. At length she realised that her sleep was a long ache and a weariness and exhaustion, because of his will fastened upon her, as he lay there beside her, during the night. She realised it all, and there came a momentous pause, a pause in her swift running, a moment's suspension in her life, when she was lost.&quot;And it goes on and on and on like this, unto the third generation. No doubt all this purple prose was extremely erotic in its day, but none of these characters seem at all real to me, and there is no plot to make up for the lack. For me, this was one big waste of time."},{"Title":"The Rainbow (Macmillan students' novels)","review":"D.H.

Throughout this story, I was able to recognize my own feelings and reactions to life in his words. He puts in words what most people are afraid to see themselves. It is said that Lawrence is obsessed with things sexual, but there is so much more to this novel than sexuality. It is a work of art."},{"Title":"The Rainbow (Macmillan students' novels)","review":"Besides the history of a family over three generations, the key character is Ursula. In the early 1900s just before WW1, she is a \\"feminist\\" before her time. We find that she rejects marriage, engages in premarital sex, conducts a homosexual affair, and \\"objectifies\\" men. She is also non-religious and probably never has children. My point is not that she understands the human need to be a strong independent individual and does so, but that in the process of her female emancipation, she loses her ability to love a man and be loved in return. It is sad that in her search and rebellion against the traditional gender roles, she loses sight of the human need to bond."},{"Title":"The Rainbow (Macmillan students' novels)","review":"The copy of the book that I received was just how I expected it... clean, no damage, no markings, no signs of wear whatsoever.

But I did find interesting Ursula's parents and her family life -- I liked how she wanted to be different than her mother who kept popping out babies (not to put down Ursula's mother; I liked her, and thought if anybody should pop out lots of babies it should be her, she had good attitudes on child rearing and kids, especially in a time that was governed by the heinous idea of \\"spare the rod and spoil the child\\"), and was really keen to see where Lawrence was going to go with this character.But Ursula's infautation with a female teacher, and her relationship with Anton, and also her depressing teaching experience, well, to me, some of it just did not ring true.It was really interesting to see a female character in those times strive for a more independent life, but I guess I thought the book was most satisfactory when her struggle was with her parents. I mean, was there no other man than Anton? Was she conflicted about her sexuality? What did she want? This book did not answer the questions it should have.The book is more bogged down in religiosity than obscenity (nothing seemed obscene to me), but that is of course from the standpoint of this modern reader. Lawrence writes brief sentences and short paragraphs, so the book does read, even though some passages were unclear, and one chapter was deadeningly boring. ('The Bitterness of Ectasy.') But because of that readability factor, and because of my fondness for \\"Sons and Lovers,\\" I plan on reading Lawrence's \\"Women in Love\\" sometime soon.This Modern Library edition is excellent; I especially liked the biographical information on Lawrence. One should take note that it mentions Lawrence suffered from mental instability."},{"Title":"The Rainbow (Macmillan students' novels)","review":"Or call it missed opportunity. Now The Rainbow is, of course, a glorious masterpiece and blah blah blah, mostly as a result of its 'passion and intensity of vision'.(or quote any Lawrence critic particularly in love with what someone else said about him) If you are at all familiar with the author its likely you'll know what to expect: gorgeous, twisting passages of intense interior monologue where every question is asked and an uncomfortable number are answered. There is no space for lies or delusion as a nobel and frequently brutal honesty must underlie any such personal thoughts.The story is actually often rather interesting, particularly the earliest section, the beginnings of this family and the comparitive subdued nature of their once scandalous passion. I found myself most interested by the patriarch and matriarch and felt the children's defiance and mistakes were inevitable. The problem is that this theme is hammered home in such an ongoing blaze of fury that the very similarities of each subsequent generation becomes a superfluous point thereby rendering the whole construction numb.By all accounts a worthwhile reading experience, those of a mind for(or with tastes running to) passionate inquiry into the nature of life might quite possibly love this book."},{"Title":"The Rainbow (Macmillan students' novels)","review":"Not as moving as some of my favorite books, but this was an engaging look into three generations of the Brangwen family in small-town England.

The Rainbow is a book that is simply TOO stuffed with Freudian thought, and simply TOO concerned with implied incest and the kind of base themes a perverted teen could think of in under ten minutes. I completely and totally do NOT recommend this book. If you want something definitive of Lawrence's career, read Sons and Lovers. The same themes are repeated there, but not quite as stupidly."},{"Title":"The Rainbow (Macmillan students' novels)","review":"Daivd Herbert Lawrence was born on September 11, 1885 in the ugly mining area of Nottingham in the English Midlands. His father Arthur was a hardworking miner who opened the world of natural beauty to the lad. His mother was a woman who focused her attentions on \\"Bert\\" so the boy would develop his artistic inclinations. Together this ordinary couple produced a literary genius. Lawrence would change the novel and the way we read novels.In 1915 he wrote the Rainbow which tells the three generational tale of the Brangwen mining and farming family of Nottinghamshire. The generational stories revolve around:a. Tom and Lydia Brangwen-He is a strong man who marries the Polish widow Lydia. Together they have several children as they build a world of their own on their farm.The couple has difficult communicating well together except in the marital bed.b. Will and Anna Brangwen-Anna was the daughter of Lydia and her first husband a Polish physician who died young. While Will and Anna have a brood of children it is Anna who is in the spotlight. She weds her cousin Will. We see them making love; Anna dancing in the nude during a pregnancy and becoming an earth mother loving her man, home and land.c. Ursula is the oldest daughter of Will and Anna. She is a shy girl who blossoms in the novel. Ursuala becomes a schoolteacher in a grim urban school; falls in love and leaves Anton Skrebensky and returns home to her family and the friendship and love of her sister Ursula. These two girls will be the main characters in \\"Women in Love\\" the sequel to \\"The Rainbow.\\" Ursula develops a lesbian relationship in this novel but is clearly bisexual in orientation. The novel ends with her miscarriage as she is chased by a herd of horses in the rain.That is the outline of the story. Nothing much happens on the surface; plot is there but is minimal. What Lawrence aimed for in this fiction was the experience of sexual awakening; the female organism and the stormy but essential relationship between the sexes. His language is poetic in beauty and bristles with the life force. His descriptions of nature are detailed and evocative making him the heir to Thomas Hardy.\\"The Rainbow\\" was removed from the bookstore due to the strict and puritanical English censorship during World War I. Lawrence's wife Frieda who was German was under suspicion as a spy and the couple had a terrible time. Today in our sexually liberated culture \\"The Rainbow\\" is far from shocking. What we remember is the beauty of the language and the sense of time passing in the genealogical study he gives to one English family.Lawrence hated modernity, industrialism and the rape of the English countryside due to mining. He is romantic yearning for a simpler time.This classic novel published in the Cambridge Edition by Penguin paperbacks is well worth your time and money."},{"Title":"The Rainbow (Macmillan students' novels)","review":"When \\"The Rainbow\\" was originally published by Methuen in England, it was suppressed by the British police as obscene, and the edition was destroyed. The American edition came out in the same year with passages censored (this done without Lawrence's permission); he later referred to that edition as \\"mutilated.\\" (His comments appear in \\"Phoenix,\\" in a moving introduction he wrote for a bibliography of his own work).The problem for the reader today is to find an edition of \\"The Rainbow\\" that's based on the novel as Lawrence wrote it. This isn't too hard in the world of physical books--just get the Penguin Cambridge edition, based on the (absurdly overpriced) Cambridge University edition, which has been carefully edited and restored. Or read the Oxford edition, which is at least based on the suppressed Methuen original.But if you're trying to find this as an ebook, I think you're out of luck. As a 1915 publication, the \\"mutilated\\" American version is in the public domain, and it's most likely this that all Kindle and Nook editions represent. I assume this because there's in fact no way to tell what text is being used.Penguin, Cambridge University Press and Oxford University Press don't offer ebook versions of their own editions, for some damn reason. Hence there's no reliable way I know of to obtain this title in a legitimate unexpurgated version for electronic reading. Same holds true for audiobooks.Any suggestions?"},{"Title":"The Rainbow (Macmillan students' novels)","review":"I had actually never read any of Lawrence's works before, though I had heard much praise about him. Saga type stories tend to interest me in the way you can trace growth in characters and really get into them, so I thought I would give this a try. So glad I did! Lawrence writes with some of the most beautifully lyrical and lush wording. Even when speaking of the dirty coal mines of England, you can almost feel the grime on your own skin, or when Ursula travels to the shore and plays in the surf you feel as if you're right there feeling and hearing the ocean on yourself. It reminded me somewhat of the way Fitzgerald writes. Also, seeing the growth and change in the different generations of one family was very interesting to me, especially the way that Lawrence as a man so keenly captured the struggles of girls developing into womanhood and accepting those changes and dealing with first loves and heartbreaks.

I am currently reading this book's sequel Women in Love - let you know how it goes!"},{"Title":"The Rainbow (Macmillan students' novels)","review":"I loved this book when I first read it years ago, and, having just read it again, it has gotten better. Truly great books improve with age. What struck me this time is the juxtaposition of raw muscularity and florid poetry. Those who want to read a microcosm of Lawrence should try his novella &quot;The Fox,&quot; which encapsulizes Lawrence's recurrent theme of a thoughtful woman repeately struck by the waxing and waning of primordial passions. A good combination might be to read a Lawrence work with Yeats's &quot;Leda and the Swan.&quot; D.H. Lawence hurls body punches to the soul like a heavyweight boxer. This may be a sexist metaphor, but it conjures the power of his prose poetry."},{"Title":"The Rainbow (Macmillan students' novels)","review":"Sunshine is a substance of transparency, yet when it touches the soft mist and shines through the concrete droplets, the arc of color manifests and dazzles the human yes. In many ways, this is the journey of man as the essence of living is filtered through the mist of love. D.H. Lawrence's controversial Rainbow makes few reference to the natural phenomenon as rainbow, yet through out the lines, readers feel the \\"unbearable lightness of being\\" sipping through to cinch the yearning hearts. Countless twenty-century writers dedicated their finest works to capture this evanescence, and surviving through scandals and suppression is this ambitious piece.One of the unique faces of The Rainbow is its treatment of characters; instead of expanding from individuals, D.H. Lawrence reverses focus and lets the plot drift along. It's impossible to determine which character is the true protagonist because individuality is simply abashed in this banned work. In place of emphasis on characters, Lawrence traces a circuitous journey through three generations-alternating voices of three generations of Brangwen women. Despite the complexity of this novel however, each of these three women are given their space to dictate the path of their own rainbow. The word \\"journey\\" itself is repeated frequently enough, and the torch of change is constantly being passed along. The journey traces from the Polish widow to her Brangwen husband, her daughter to another Brangwen, and eventually the \\"heiress\\" of Brangwen memories-Ursula. The mother-daughter loop itself is a symbolic journey as the understanding of love is inherited.As a novel focusing on the very nature of relationships and their connection to love, to sex, and to God, The Rainbow captures the pain and anguish of each woman as they come to possess the fruit of union with a man. And as the daughter gains voice over the ailing mother, the readers come to see how much time leads the mind towards something new. All characters seek illumination of love, and different from conventional romance novels, The Rainbow traces not the journey of one person, but the journey of an understanding. Anna Brangwen, the daughter of Lydia Lensky, finds a lover with whom she develops \\"a sensuality violent and extreme as death\\" (280), a relationship that ends in great fecundity. As her fresh and wishful perspective fades, her eldest daughter, Ursula commands the pace as she comes to possession of passion. Through her youthful flirtation with Anton Skrebensky, Ursula grows to be an emotional teacher eager to share her passion, only finding herself shut down by reality into \\"a hard, insentient thing\\" (445). Her meager knowledge of love leads her to a physical and emotional affair with Skrebensky as both grope for the truth behind relationships. But this truth is too grand for both of them as they yield to the tempting nature of passion, and let love pass by. But does the journey stop there?\\"The primeval darkness falsified to a social mechanism\\" (499) is indeed the chimera that propels all characters towards the light of human affections. During a time of great changes, men and women cannot help but clang to one thing that seems unscathed-this primordial sense of protection in the bodies of opposite sex. But this need fades so fast as they probe deeper into the soul in search of the amorphous answer that leaves them sleepless. Just as the sun penetrates through the seductive veil of mist, the characters reach a point where physical relationships is a concrete something that does not satisfy. But while they reach in the darkness of lust for the light of emotional union, all falter just as the beautiful array of colors fade away. The sunshine never fails to reach earth, but it never fails to trick wild hearts into the trap of a surreal realm of love-the paradise beyond the rainbow."},{"Title":"The Rainbow (Macmillan students' novels)","review":"This book delves into the thoughts and feelings of the Brangwen family and their loves.

In reading the introduction, the history of revisions to the text by Lawrence, his wife, editors, and copyeditors lets the reader know that this was &quot;corrected&quot; many times. Unfortunately, the editors never really keep to one interpretation. From reading this introduction, it sounds like they tried to incorporate all the editings of everyone who worked with it.

Very Hardy-esque."},{"Title":"The Rainbow (Macmillan students' novels)","review":"Controversial in his time, D. H. Lawrence's \\"The Rainbow\\" is considered one of his masterpieces nowadays. The reasons in both cases are virtually the same. Completed in 1915, the book has a modern freshness that even now -- almost 100 years later -- is still fresh. This is a novel that aged well -- or better yet, hasn't aged and is always up to date.Banned and considered disturbed in its time, \\"The Rainbow\\" brings a formal experiment combined with sexual awakening and candidness and the praised of individualism. The events and characters are recurrent and they happen cyclically. The novel described three generation of the Brangwen family and as their world dissolves and their lives changes.What were most disturbing by the 1910s in this novel were the sexual passages. There weren't seen as a natural act of life, but rather were claimed as dirty. One of the most interesting moments in the narrative is a honeymoon. Beautifully --and sometimes funnily-- described the event is like an early sexual personal revolution of the couple. Needless to say that people in 1915 weren't ready for that.The most interesting generation of the Brangwen is the third one, focused on Ursula (she and her sister will be the protagonists of \\"Women in Love\\" published in 1917). Most of the book is devoted to her, but until we reach her there is an amazing cast of characters created by Lawrence populating \\"The Rainbow\\".Story moves in a special speed. It feels like the writer has create a world apart where one must surrender to its velocity in order to enjoy the story. It is worthwhile to let yourself be immersed in the place. Lawrence writing is like a travel in place and time with a destination that we may know --from books and movies-- but the way he presents it is so unique that this journey feels like new.Creating characters that are very human places Lawrence's literature as universal. Since his books deal with our aspirations, fears, love among other things, one --no matter where or when-- can identify his/herself with his writings. In age when one dimensional characters and disposable thrillers tend to rule, \\"The Rainbow\\" is like the sun shining in a cloudy day.

Neither left much of an impression on me, so I was surprised that THE RAINBOW would leave it's mark, especially since it is geared more towards the sensibilities of a much younger reader than myself. To me it is far from a perfectly designed and constructed novel, but I respect and admire what Lawrence has attempted here. While using certain Biblical references as well as allusions to a number of sacred themes, Lawrence attempts to break away from traditional religious thought, to embrace a new spirituality emphasizing the primacy of the individual, and seeking an alliance between the natural world and human nature.THE RAINBOW chronicles a history of 3 generations of the Brangwen family in an England where the idyllic, rural life of the farm, must give way to the railroads, mines (and the more cosmopolitan areas surrounding them), where life becomes more complicated, presents more choices and opportunities, as well as difficulties..where the roles of men, and especially of women, start to change. It is funny that Lawrence was castigated for being a misogynist, when in this novel, the women are much stronger characters than the men. Perhaps a character like Ursula was looked upon as a succubus, who entices men into sexual relations in order to possess their souls, rather than as a young woman who struggles with her identity, and the meaning of her life. The episodes of her sexual awakening as well as those of her mother Anna; the attempt to break away from a seemingly sterile predestined future by becoming a teacher, and the frustration of that experience, are particularly effective.Lawrence's prose has been a particular bone of contention among critics. Some call it overbearing and sloppy, untethered to standard rules of composition. Despite all the stylistic hyperbole, despite the ofttimes bombastic sensuality, the lurking eroticism, the naked symbolism, the pervasive use of exotic metaphor, the strange grammer..despite all the qualities that are looked upon with derision, D.H. Lawrence resides on a level very few other writers share..living there on the power of his ability to fashion a language that serves and very nearly describes those ineffable truths at the core of Nature, and the mysteries that dwell deep within the human personality."},{"Title":"The Rainbow (Macmillan students' novels)","review":"This is, like \`Women in Love' and \`Sons and Lovers', a masterpiece.It was originally intended to be all one story with \`Women in Love', but by the time Lawrence got to writing \`Women in Love' his powers and confidence as an artist had grown. The Ursula character was to have carried the Laurentian message forward into the second story with extra force, because we would have a full understanding of the development of her mind to the point where she meets Birkin. However we find in \`Women in Love' that the voice of Lawrence is with Birkin and Ursula is a slightly diminished character, who often finds herself challenging him.The result of this is to mean you can read to the two novels separately and be satisfied with both as single pieces of great fiction.Reading, studying and then having the joy of sharing the work of Lawrence with young people, when I taught him at \`A' Level has been one of the high points of my life.In my own novel \`A Song for Jo' Lawrence has an influence on the intellectual and emotional development of the two main characters, Jo and Chris, who are college students studying English. Other great literature from Keats, Emily Bronte and Shakespeare (and more) is worked into the narrative. It is a love story with a difference!People of all ages and sex have enjoyed it.It's available on Amazon - please follow the linkA SONG FOR JO"},{"Title":"The Rainbow (Macmillan students' novels)","review":"I ordered this book because it was required in one of my son's classes and the school bookstore prices were exorbitant. The prices here were much cheaper than the school book store prices. I ordered several books for the same reason in this same order and they all arrived quickly and in great condition."},{"Title":"The Rainbow (Macmillan students' novels)","review":"I didn't find this book enjoyable, too much repetition for one reason and being a bit too dramatic for my taste, but I have to say it is definitely worth reading because of the complexities of its characters. The multiple protagonists with the most interesting and significant developement of Ursula's character seem to present differences in gender and in social/cultural contexts. I am particularly impressed by the depictions of female psychology that seem very sharp, insightful and modern. The author's courage to take the risk of writing about sensuality, desire and pursuit of independent thoughts by female protagonists definitely deserves a special place in literature. It is also interesting to note that nobody is clearly defined, or, rather only defined by their inner struggles that constantly seem to change. There is no closure, or resolutions or convictions, and all characters are complex in their own ways, which can be unsettling for some readers, but I find it more realistic."},{"Title":"The Rainbow (Macmillan students' novels)","review":"Spanning three full generations, this book focuses primarily on the last generation's woman who was an esprit de vivre - emotionally, mentally and sexually.Following the bloodlines of the Brangwen family, we learn how a common British citizen married a Polish widow, has his step-daughter Anna marry his brother's son (okay even in today's world as there are no blood commonalities), and watch their daughter fall in and out of love and deliver us ultimately to the rainbow.The last Brangwen woman, Ursula, receives more than half of the novel's pages. She is a feisty cat who outgrows her puerility to become a reticent teenager and evolves eventually into an officious and deferential school teacher. \\"She was Woman, she was the whole of Woman in the human order.\\"Many of the independent characteristics of this woman of the 1930's are akin to the tour de force protagonist inLady Chatterly's Lover. These are cool women of their day, and would be deemed even hip by today's standards. And, amazingly, many of the educational and vocational tracks of Ursula parallel the writer's youth - teaching for a period of time and education at Nottingham.D.H. Lawrence's great gift may be his ability to envision things in a woman's perspective in such great detail. I often think I am reading something written by a woman. Having been brought up in separate sex educational facilities, and a \\"just past\\" 19th century mentality, one would believe this to be next to impossible. But, apparently it is not. In many respects, Lawrence can rival great novelists like the Bronte sisters whose personal feminine touches make their respective successful novels important even in today's literary world.Works like these may not market today. Like a black and white film replete with slow dialogue and devoid of car chases and violence, this literature would not be embraced by today's readers. But, it involves detailed encounters of lesbian affairs and premarital sex with soldiers and unmarried pregnancies. Not entirely stale topics.And, Ursula saw the world for what it is: \\"She knew that the sordid people who crept hard-scaled and separate on the face of the world's corruption were living still, that the rainbow was arched in their blood . . . would issue to a new germination, to a new growth, rising to the light and the wind and the clean rain of heaven.\\"If you have the opportunity, read this classic."},{"Title":"The Rainbow (Macmillan students' novels)","review":"The Rainbow is one of those great, startling books that exceeds its setting to provide universal lessons to the reader. These lessons are in the form of questions social, political, and of course philosophical, and while it does help to know some of the background Lawrence was working with to get the most out of the Rainbow, this isn't necessary, as my own readership can attest to. The Woman's Rights movement and post-colonial/industrial themes in the Rainbow are not necessarily as heavy when compared with Lady Chatterley's Lover or even Songs and Lovers, probably on one hand because the Rainbow is his first great experimental, or rather Modern, novel that focuses as much on thematic content as it does on style, which is a reason in itself you should pick up a copy. The Rainbow is like Thomas Hardy's Jude the Obscure on THC. On the other hand, it's not too wild and zany-it's more mild and subtle than something like Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man by Joyce, which furthers its accessibility.And on that note, this book reaches out to you-the three generations of family throughout the book means there will definitely be some aspect of psychology/rites of passage/family interaction that you will be able to relate with. For me it was the elder Tom throughout the first part of the book, who couldn't figure out how to get his grip on life and ended up drinking all the time to deal with the pain, the darkness, before ultimately seeing a goal in romance, and then outwardly reaching and grasping that goal. The misogynistic trends of England during the late 19th century are definitely present in Lawrence's treatment of women, but as you go forward to the final protagonist, Ursula, and even before that Anna (Ursula's rebellious, feline-in-character mother), you start to realize both the social movements to liberate women and how exactly that came about in family environments with the downfall of the male presence in the household, the downfall of that archetype that could previously control but now more often than not fails.So the universal lessons are present indeed, but keep in mind that this was a banned book because of its treatment of sexuality. This book, along with his other great works, ended up inspiring Henry Miller during his escapades throughout New York and France, being a key biographical influence that's revealed through Miller's letters to Anais Nin. But this book, which was \\"burned on the streets,\\" doesn't nearly extend its fiery passion the way his later books do-but still, it's easy to see sections in the book where someone who puts their selves in the shoes of Lawrence can understand what he's doing, with the scenes of passionate love-making, as well as the mere description of two individuals kissing, which honestly appear more sacrilegious than the sex itself.All in all, pick it up, stick with it, and you'll find yourself rewarded in many, poetic ways.For fans of Thomas Hardy, other Lawrence books, Virginia Woolf, Henry Miller, James Joyce."},{"Title":"The Rainbow (Macmillan students' novels)","review":"It is a rare book indeed that I can't make it through. There are some books that I start and put down, but mostly for reasons of disinterest or poor workmanship. _The Rainbow_ suffered from neither of these. Instead, I simply could not put up with the seemingly endless vacillations of the characters, the souped-up description of all that they thought, and the plodding storyline. All these things are Lawrence's style, and it is a style that I just couldn't stand.In some ways, this did not surprise me. I've never been that fond of description. I favor dialogue, then plot. A book in which action and character are made manifest through dialogue usually ends up as a favorite of mine; books with lengthy ruminations on the beauty of the landscape, in which the author tries to be both poet and storyteller, annoy me. I don't dislike characters that have trouble making up their minds--such is life. I do dislike novels in which that is the only point of the book.Maybe I missed something. Maybe I'm not mature enough for this book. Maybe in ten years, or twenty years, or more, time I will come upon Lawrence again and my viewpoint will have radically shifted. These comments here, then, stand as a benchmark for that future date, to remind me of how absolutely dreadful I thought this book was."},{"Title":"The Rainbow (Macmillan students' novels)","review":"The two part saga of the Brangwens comprised by &quot;The Rainbow&quot; and &quot;Women in Love&quot; is surely the most stirringly realistic piece of writing concerning matters of the soul that I have ever read. Mr. Lawrence stands with Tolstoy and Dostoyevsky as the masters of the art of realistic fiction. This novel doesn't succeed because it is considered Literature by some astute scholar. It succeeds because it tears at one's emotions until he is certain that these events befell some poor middle class family in earlier England. Engaging and highly readable!"},{"Title":"The Lasater philosophy of cattle raising,","review":"The Lasater Philosophy of Cattle Raising, by Laurence Lasater, is an outstanding basic guideline for economic selection of cattle that can used in either an extensive or management intensive grazing system based on sound environmental practices.The Lasater Philosophy was developed by Tom Lasater, one of the founders of the Beefmaster breed; and a succesful cattleman in Texas. His philosophy has several basic principals that can make any livestock breeder succesful in profitable production. He covers topice like selecting animals that will be hardy and performance oriented in your environment. Basically, select those animals that will be coming from a harsher environment than the one that you will be putting them in. If they come from an easier climate, one can expect performance to drop. Lasater also covers the importance of the bull and the cow in making genetic decisions and how fertility should be measured.Perhaps the hardest part of the philosophy to grasp is the rather strict cull policy. Any female animal is culled if they lose an offspring for any reason. That means predators, scours, or even lightning. Keeping the best of the best, should prove to produce consistency and quality over the long run.I found this book to be excellent and recomend it to any breeders of any livestock who are interested in environmentally and grass based production methods. We currently use these principles in correlation with Linear Measurement to manage one hundred head of Belted Galloway cattle. Remeber, if you replace the words cattle raising with sheep, hog, or goat raising, the principals are still quite useful. Excellent photos of the Lasater type Beefmaster are included in all chapters and easily illustrate how these animals should appear in actual management conditions."},{"Title":"The Lasater philosophy of cattle raising,","review":"As a beginning cattleman I found the book extremely helpful and one can use the philosophy in all aspects of ranching.

The burgers from grinding up the chuck roast is better than the \\"sirloin\\" ground beef from Whole Foods. One thing, the bags are not sealed well and defrosting the chuck in my brand new Whirlpool created a pool of blood all over my spring water bottles on the lower shelf. It was madness and now I have to clean it up. With Sal Suds from Dr. Bronner, of course. The burgers are from the chuck roast that was exposed to air and bled all over my fridge the last few days and it smelled fine, tasted very good.

I have previously read number 10, but the U.S. publisher has not been reprinting the books in the order they were written. To fully appreciate the book, you need to read the previous books in the series. Otherwise you will feel at points as if you have walked in on the middle of a story. In this particular episode, Drinkwater is off on a special mission to the Baltic, only to have his orders changed via a message sent through diplomatic channels in Sweden, and by the request of an agent picked up in Russia. Things are complicated by an unreliable lieutenant aboard the ship. Events lead to the diversion of a cargo of gold, and Drinkwater's participation in an intelligence gathering operation. One of Drinkwater's old enemies (from books 2 and 3) is reintroduced. Part of the plot seems a little contrived, but overall it is an interesting story."},{"Title":"Baltic Mission","review":"Richard Woodman is perhaps the most underrated writer of naval action novels. His Nathaniel Drinkwater series, of which Baltic Mission is the seventh, combines realism, action, excellent characterization, and a gothic thread running through it. Drinkwater, who is a very decent man although not simplistically so, has to face various levels of human evil and depravity. Drinkwater has had three nemeses woven in and out of the series; the vile Morris from his first ship, the evil but cunning Edouard Santhonax, and his own wayward brother Edward. In Baltic Mission Drinkwater deals with two out of the three.The time is 1807 and Napoleon has been checked but not defeated at Eylau. Only Csar Alexander of Russia is able to stand against Napoleon and Drinkwater is sent to the Baltic to provide encouragement/assistance to the Russians. However, Alexander may be tiring of his fight against Napoleon and Drinkwater must be sure that he doesn't enrich a potential enemy. A mission to find out the status of the combatants is in order. Along the way Drinkwater has to deal with his irascible First Lieutenant Sam Rogers who is descending into alcoholism.Drinkwater is now in his 40s and suffering from his wounds. Series regulars Mr. Q. and Tregembo are back. Tregembo is now described as an old man although his age before was never specifically mentioned. I had the impression that Tregembo was a few years older than Drinkwater but he seems to have reached old age in one novel.Much of Baltic Mission takes place on land so it doesn't have the same level of naval action that other novels in the series have although the rousing conclusion is in keeping with earlier series entries. This one is more cloak and dagger with continued gothic elements and suspense. While Baltic Mission doesn't have the same intensity as Eye of the Fleet or sense of grand tragedy as 1805 it's still an entertaining read and perhaps a bit of a change of pace. To this point there have been no bad entries in the series and given Woodman's writing ability I doubt there will be."},{"Title":"Baltic Mission","review":"Woodman's seventh novel involving the life and times of Captain Nathaniel Drinkwater, provides a change from the usual naval action that the prior Drinkwater books have dealt with. That, however, takes nothing away from the historical setting or the intrigue that awaits Drinkwater and his cohorts as they set about to discover Napolean's plans for an alliance with Russia. Woodman is a master at making history come alive."},{"Title":"Baltic Mission","review":"I have just finished this book, the seventh in the series, and enjoyed it thouroughly. More intrigue than sea battles, but an exciting climax to several story lines throughout the series. Any fan of O'Brien or Forester is encouraged to dive into Woodman."},{"Title":"Baltic Mission","review":"7th in the series, Capt. Drinkwater's action takes place in the Baltic as Napoleon rolls up the Russians in 1807. Ostensibly carrying gold to the British ally, the Tsar, Drinkwater's cruise is episodic and nearly aimless at first, but concludes with an exciting rush under the eye of an ancient nemesis and the guns of the French. I get less of a sense of adventure and curiosity than with O'Brian's Aubrey/Maturin series, whereas the larger political context of alliance building against Napoleon is clearer here. However, the shipboard world of H.M.S Antigone thereby becomes less central and important. Except for some pro forma sail handling, unfamiliar terms are rare, even the regular cursing. This Sheridan House book has lesser art, better paper, and double the price of Warner's series."},{"Title":"Literary Mama: Reading for the Maternally Inclined","review":"This book is a collection of essays edited by Andi Buchanan and Amy Hudock of LiteraryMama.com -- a website that has raised the bar for writing about motherhood both on and offline.What I love about this collection of writing is what I love about LiteraryMama.com: the fact that it reflects the reality of motherhood. The writing isn't saccharine and cutesy. Rather, the book is honest enough to admit that there are times when we are disappointed and frustrated and angry with our kids -- and times when we feel guilty for feeling that way -- as well as times when we feel so happy about having a chance at motherhood that we are almost giddy.Here's something else I love Buchanan and Hudock's collection. Rather than limiting themselves to \\"name brand writers\\", Buchanan and Hudock have sought to give voice to both well-known and lesser-known writers. The result is a highly personal collection of memoir, reflections, and poetry from a highly diverse and talented group of everymoms. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Literary Mama: Reading for the Maternally Inclined","review":"Amazon.com recommended this book to me and since it was so reasonably priced and close to the lack of control on spending that is the holidays I decided to take a chance, and I am so very glad that I did. This anthology is so good in fact, that I can't keep it all to myself. I am going to give it away once I'm done. I'll buy another one later - when I want to read something again, and do the same with it.I knew I would love it halfway through the introduction because they started referencing all these writers/editors whose work I loved - Ariel Gore, Mothers who Think, etc. Also, they list many names that I haven't heard, giving me new books to explore after I am finished with this one.I've only finished the first section, but every single one of those prose pieces has spoken some universal truth that struck me very hard and deeply. Longing for solitude, anxiety on how the world will treat a unique child and the despair that it might be \\"beaten\\" out of her, children as unknowing masters of allusion and metaphor... not ten minutes after reading that line my daughter compared a dead leaf still clinging to the tree, blowing gently in the wind to a worm on a see saw, other lines mention how children have helped the writer slow down and pay attention to the \\"now,\\" when other mothers warned her that life was about to get much faster.Great, great stuff.I was immediately brought back to an advanced writing course I took in college. My daughter was an infant and I tried to use that course to sublimate the anxieties from having my life completely transformed. However - it was a course full of college kids and was even TAUGHT by a college kid (a graduate student)! They didn't trash my work by any means, but NONE of them, not even the teacher, could relate.There is a piece in this book, which the Web site dubbs a \\"literary reflection,\\" that references Henry David Thoreau and Walden Pond.This peice is special to me in particular because we had covered Thoreau - a walking piece - in the writing class. Mine was rather Seinfeldian, about nothing, but I wanted it to flip between a woman \\"living in the moment\\" and her fight with all the stupid minutiae that gets in the way of that, what to cook for dinner, etc. I wasn't successful - but I didn't have the words to explain what I was trying to do. The piece in that book helped me find those words. Man, when my teacher said that the best way to learn good writing is to read good writing - she wasn't kidding. The story in this book triggered my mind to be able to work on a peice that I hadn't touched in FIVE YEARS!This book is not just for writers, however. I spent those five years READING in order to preserve my sanity, not writing.The final evidence that you should get this book - you're just going to have to trust me on this one - I was actually underlining passages that felt like they were directly for me. I assure you that I don't do that, and I used to scoff at those who did. I thought it was incredibly pretentious and just plain dorky.But now I get it.

From huge houses and boats, to jaw-droppingly extravagant parties, massive jewelry collections, and -- best of all -- tremendous gestures that are sadly out of fashion, these pages chronicle an era that will never be seen again. The lushness of the era is matched by the lushness of Beebe's prose. He is an author who knew how to turn a phrase, tell a story, and have a personal voice as stylish and well turned-out as the man himself.There are probably many people today who would see this book as a 400-page criminal indictment against the \\"robber barons\\" of an earlier era.

It was a gift of immeasurable worth and value. I will no doubt still be reading through these wonderful books for years to come.Having just finished the first volume, \\"Run to the Mountain,\\" I stand in awe of the sheer depth and scope of the life we've each been given. The life presented here, that of Thomas Merton, is remarkable in many ways. \\"Run to the Mountain\\" is the chronicle of the years when he started instructing English in college up to his entry at the Trappist monastery in Gethsemani Kentucky.Beyond the external events of his times (the late thirties and forties) lies the bigger story of Merton's eternal destiny. Not since my own salvation have I encountered a story which so clearly illustrates God's pursuing love and grace. The reader can palpably feel Merton being called by God in these pages.It is quite tempting to imagine what might have become of Merton had he not heeded his call. These pages (and most of his later works) make clear his incredible power as a writer. It is not hard to imagine that he would have become at least as, if not more famous than Jack Kerouac, his fellow student at Columbia. It is one of the great \\"what ifs\\" (and there are several) of Merton's life.It is a great thing to be able to read about Thomas Merton's journey--to see him be changed and opened.

I appreciated his review of a wide range of articles across the ten or twelve scientific areas that comprise the focus of climate change. I found his general contention compelling - that some people - and the ICPP in particular - are overstating the degree of change likely due to human-induced greenhouse emissions. When you start looking at the details of the debate, such as the specifics of the GCMs (general circulation models), what their limitations actually are, and what the datasets show for the various temperature, precipitation, soil moisture, storm frequencies and strengths (hurricane and tornado), and the trends that are claimed to appear, you find a great deal of noise. That is probably the single thing that would cool people's attitudes if they bothered to actually find out what the research indicates. There just aren't the striking, clear-cut changes that lead to certainty in decision making with human activity as the primary cause of all the problems, both predicted and speculated. It does indicate that there are some changes, but in other areas there is no discernable change - and in general, there is nothing like for example, Al Gore indicates. The conclusion one will likely come to after a close reading of the literature is that the strong proponents of human-induced climate change are taking some substantial leaps of faith. In fact, I strongly recommend interested people first read Gore's book \\"Inconvenient Truth\\" and then read Michaels' book(s). That makes the situation quite clear. Gore comes off as somebody completely certain of his view, never mentioning alternative interpretations or any of the limitations that exist in the methods, measures, analyses, or literature. Michaels comes off as an interested scientist who is a bit frustrated at Gore's blinders and adamant assertions, and is deeply interested in the details of the science. For understanding the actual data and our situation on the world, the latter is better.In Gore's case, he asserts it is a fact that massive changes will take place, but Michaels shows quite convincingly, that these assertions are not supported by the data. In my own following of the literature for the last 25 years (coming out of my own research in solar physics, ionospheric physics, and solar-terrestrial paleoclimatology, and also psychology), I think it is safe to say that most of the particular things Gore says have been suggested in some form in some place in the literature, but the problem comes because he pulls them altogether into an oveall assertion of one gigantic and horrific \\"fact\\". In doing this, he ignores all limitations in measurement, and all problems of interpretation. To me, he illustrates why a politician should never think he is a scientist - because his political views structure the data, his entire logic is political and so the integrity of the science isn't important, what is important is his use of it for his political purposes. As a personal opinion, it seems to me Gore's entire approach is messianic, which is the opposite of what science should be. Reading this book and Michaels' other books will be greatly informative for anybody who wants to take the time to understand the basis for climate change, and whether or to what degree it is related to human activity. It isn't a simple thing, even though Gore asserts it is. It has become profoundly politically biased, which is a really awful result for the science, because it makes doing and interpreting science into a mindfield of other people's agendas. To me, this is the worst legacy of Gore's posturing. He certainly can say whatever he wants, but he has melded an ostensibly scientific veneer to his own highly biased political beliefs, and then asserted they are received facts about the world and that everybody else should shut up. However, in contrast Michaels does a good job of showing how scientists actually come to their conclusions.I should add that Michaels takes the reasonable position that we are affecting the climate, that increasing the CO2, methane and other greenhouse gas concentrations does have an effect, but he systematically evaluates the degree of that effect so readers will have a better chance to understand the difficulty of making huge generalizations. Again, reading Gore's book and then Michaels' books will underscore the difference.In sum: Michaels suggests the changes are not likely catastrophic; that is an extreme interpretation, but there are some effects and it is likely that we can and will live by minimal adaptation. Michaels seems exceptionally even-handed, and I fail to see anywhere in his book the kind of stridency that global-warming proponents claim. I think they do the so-called \\"skeptics\\" and the science a huge disservice by their blanket assertions that if somebody somewhere sometime ever was a paid consultant of industry or associated with some convervative cause, then he is impossibly biased and everything he says is discredited. That simply isn't true. It is a political statement, a rhetorical position that allows you to dismiss everybody who disagrees with one side. That isn't a good idea for understanding something complex because the answers do not ever all come from one side. This probably is an infiltration of the scientific debate by a politica agenda, which is extremely unfortunate for everybody. I prefer to take ideas on their merits regardless of their source. Even a conniving consultant can be correct, and also, even a politician who wants to be modern eco-Messiah can be correct. So a blanket dismissal means you'll never know whether they are, or whether they both are wrong for entirely different reasons. This is what disturbs me most of all in this entire situation. Science lives in the questions we ask, and if one side shuts down the question-asking, then the science and our understanding suffers. Gore asserts that proponents are motivated in a \\"pure\\" way by helping mankind, which I don't doubt. But helping mankind also involves getting government funding, here to the tune of $29 billion dollars over the past 20 years. So there is indeed economic incentive on both sides. However, in neither case does it flatly negate the science that results. Sometimes people who are the most motivated are the best at finding good answers, good questions or factual limitations, so it makes no sense to me to shut them down no matter what \\"side\\" they are on.I find it terrible that people can read Ross Gelbspan's book (e.g., the heat is on) and suddenly feel completely righteous in pronouncing Richard Lindzen of MIT as \\"discredited\\". Since when does reading a book by a political activist allow you to render judgment on a professional, Ph.D. scientist from one of the best universities in the world, and who has devoted his entire life to understanding climate change? I have found that the people who do this know almost nothing of the actual science. It appears they are looking for a basis on which to turn their own beliefs into cudgels. That doesn't help understand what is or may be, going on. I mention it because several friends of mine did just that.Michaels also adds other issues that seem immediately important to the debate but are ignored in almost all other treatments, for example, that humans are rather drastically changing the landscape by farming, by logging, by regrowing forests, creating reservoirs, and that these affect the amount of incident energy absorbed or reflected, and likely alter the overall energy balance. If you wish to understand the overall debate, this is an excellent source of information and questions.Doug Ammons"},{"Title":"The Satanic Gases: Clearing the Air about Global Warming","review":"I was curious about global warming. This book answered many of my questions and I'll re-read it and buy a couple of copies for my friends.Other than my small complaints that I wish it had expanded more and discussed in greater detail on historical evidence of climate change (such as archaeological evidence of ice ages and warm periods like when dinosaurs populated the planet) and focused more on the Sun's impact on the temperature of the Earth, it was an excellent book. I am now searching for more data about the effects on weather from natural disasters such as volcanic eruptions and forest fires, which were only discussed briefly in this book but increased my curiosity.I found the explanation of how global climate models are designed to be the most educational part of the book. I appreciated the point that the weatherman on the local news has a very hard time predicting the temperature twenty-four hours or a week from now. That puts a prediction on what it will be like 100 years from now into a better perspective. The discussion on El Nino effects was interesting as was the exposure of some scientists tendencies to select data that best fit into the theory du jour to make their conclusions more dramatic. Although the authors didn't say it, an intentional omission of data or evidence seems the same as a lie to me. I wasn't upset about global warming, I live near Phoenix, what difference does it make if its goes from an average high of 110 to 113 one hundred years from now? But now I am upset about global warming because it seems like a big scam and some very good intentioned people are being seriously fooled.The book is not a light read. I found I could only take a couple of chapters at a time and it wasn't something to read with the TV on or other potential distractions. I read most of it on a stratosphere warming, transcontinental jetliner when South Carolina was being frozen like never before in December 2002.This is an important book to read, if you don't know many facts about the topic, you'll get 'em."},{"Title":"The Satanic Gases: Clearing the Air about Global Warming","review":"This past winter (2006) was the coldest ever measured in Antarctica (and, generally, throughout the Southern Hemisphere). I have always thought that Pat Michaels was too hasty is conceding that the globe has warmed half a degree or so in the past century. It may not have warmed at all. In any event, the review I wrote in 2000 understates the problems with the warmers,.Just hours after I finished \\"The Satanic Gases\\" in 2000, the Associated Press reported on an alarming assessment of climate change done for Congress, which predicts the bad things that will happen if the world heats up by 5 to 10 degrees over the next century.But not to worry. It's another hoax.How so? Well, the agency in charge of panicking the world about climate change, the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, is predicting a global temperature rise between 1990 and 2100 of just 3 degrees.And besides, it rates the uncertainty of its own estimate as between 1 and 3.5 degrees.Put another way, the lowest estimate used for the report to Congress is 50 percent worse than the highest estimate made by the body that claims to represent the consensus view of the world's scientists.What's a body to do? Climatologist Pat Michaels has been a reliable guide on this issue. Now, in \\"The Satanic Gases,\\" he and Robert Balling bring up to date the questions Michaels published in \\"Sound and Fury\\" in 1992.In \\"Satanic Gases,\\" they maintain Michaels' earlier position, which is that 1) the general circulation models used to predict climate change are unreliable; 2) that warming will be less than the IPCC predicts; and 3) what warming does happen will be mostly at night and during the winter, and the effects will be good for everybody.They now are able to defend those views in greater detail than eight years ago. The $10 billion spent on climate research since then has at least bought a deeper understanding of how Earth's climate behaves.But, they argue, following the philosopher of science Thomas Kuhn, we are in a \\"paradigm shift,\\" in which evidence is piling up against the orthodox view, causing orthodox scientists to create ever more baroque explanations to defend the old order.Eventually, according to Kuhn, the walls are breached and the new, simpler, more persuasive explanation is accepted. (But, Kuhn says, it usually requires that the orthodox die off; few change their minds.)Kuhn's theory relies heavily on the history of cosmographic and physical science in a bygone age, when the heterodox risked burning at the stake by the Holy Inquisition.In that respect, we are better off. The lifestyles of the young and heterodox may blight their academic careers, but at least they are not murdered.In fact, say Michaels and Balling, in the modern system of peer-reviewed research publications, even heterodox reports get published.To get past the orthodox reviewers, these studies must be exceptionally compelling.Michaels and Balling claim that hundreds of such studies have now been done, though they are swamped by the tens of thousands of orthodox ones.No layman could possibly sort out the mess. So the question is, who has a good record as a guide?Michaels does. In the kind of backhanded compliments that are so common in the global warming debate, the panicmongers have repeatedly made \\"corrections\\" to their models in the direction where Michaels (and a few others) pointed. They just don't give him credit.Instead, he has been internationally vilified by a number of governments' environment ministers.Nevertheless, in the late '80s, Michaels asserted that the predictions of the climate models were too high. By 1995, enough time had passed and enough real temperatures were available that it was embarrassingly clear than Michaels was right.The models looked ridiculous. To save the appearances, the IPCC decided that the cooling effects of sulfate aerosols (which are abundantly created by the same processes that enhance global warming) must be cranked into the models.In \\"Satanic Gases,\\" Michaels and Balling demolish the validity of the sulfate adjustment, but whether they are correct about that or not, the underlying fact is beyond dispute: The panicmongers were wrong, and their wrong conclusions were the underpinning of the Kyoto Treaty on climate control.Michaels and Balling do not dispute that human activity is having an effect on climate, nor that the world is getting warmer. But, they say, we do not have to rely on models to tell us what will happen. \\"Since we have been enhancing the greenhouse effect for more than 100 years, nature has already given us the answer,\\" they write.That answer, they contend, is not just a greenhouse world but a greener world, with better weather (fewer storms, and not more as the panicmongers have predicted), bigger crops and fewer weather-related deaths."},{"Title":"The Satanic Gases: Clearing the Air about Global Warming","review":"This book upsets most of what we read in the papers about the disastrous effects of climate change. What Michaels and Balling have to say somehow doesn't make headlines or political hay. They just put forth sound, scientific arguments that are straightforward and common-sense. But never fear: the science is presented in a way that is easy to understand and very entertaining. The authors poke some fun at the pseudo-science antics of those whose livelihoods are dependent on climate change hysteria.

My specialty is human health.I can say without reservation that in my field, the overwhelming majority of my colleagues are apalled by the nonesense that has been written about the impact of global warming on human health--asthma, mosquito-borne diseases, and all the rest.Problem is, we all have priorities. Few of us can justify the time to counter this Orwellian gobbledgook. So the field is left uncontested.On the other hand, there are people out there who have garnered large funding from government and private interests in order to foster this phoney paradigm. It is in their interests to maintain its momentum, with or without the truth.The result is that the public are being fed with colossal quantities of pseudo-science, much of it expertly packaged and convincing to honest pepole.Michaels, of course, has his own angle on all of this. Frankly, I would have wished that he had steered clear of the politics. The substance of his book is erudite and well presented. In my opinion, his account would have been much more persuasive if he had he stuck to his highly readable style and avoided all mention of the politicoes.Ah well! Whatever the packaging, the substance of this book is solid science. I will value it for its bibliographic references and its logic, not for the other stuff.[Sadly, perhaps, in this age of mis-information, we may have to adapt this sort of style to compete with the propagandists].So, I give it 4 stars, and recommend Satanic Gases to anyone who wants to know a bit more about this hot topic."},{"Title":"The Satanic Gases: Clearing the Air about Global Warming","review":"This should be required reading for people on all sides of the climate change issue. Professors Michaels and Balling make it easy to understand the science behind the environmental rhetoric, and the news is all good! The media neglected to tell us that what climate change really means is warming in winter over Siberia, a longer growing season worldwide, and higher crop yields than ever. But Michaels and Balling explain how the climate models work--which is to say, they don't. And they show what the actual, factual, observed data tell us. I was surprised to learn the comforting truth about our climate and what we have/haven't done to it. Turns out past millennia were warmer all on their own! We all need to know such things--especially when our lifestyle and livelihoods hang in the balance. In this election year, we must train a careful eye on threats to both.

They present facts and rely on logic instead of attempting to prey upon our natural fear of the uncertain future which has always been with mankind (i.e. a couple of centuries back European screamed \\"Doom\\" to the heavens when they realized they were running out of wood to burn...then they discovered coal). The people that trash this book don't seem to get past what has become the white-hot screaming mantra of the human-hating eco-freaks, which is &quot;The messenger is an evil liar bought by evil Big Business&quot;. (To these descendants of the 1960's hippies, all business is &quot;Big&quot; and therefore evil. I've never heard them refer to \\"small business\\".) Fine, the authors are lying bastards not fit to touch the sap-stained unshod foot of a tree-sitter, but you still need to refute the facts with equal an opposite facts. (i.e. why is it a lot cooler than was predicted those many years ago? If that was wrong, what else is wrong?) So stop attacking the messenger, argue with facts and you may win followers. I was an original supporter of Green Peace years ago. The climate models of doom put forth back then have never materialized. Instead of logically reassessing their positions, many &quot;scientists&quot; (who are riding the Global Warming Gravy Train) appear to hang onto their dogma of eco-doom - despite all facts to the contrary - with the unwavering belief that would make a 11th century monk proud. For those searching to give meaning to their life in this fast-paced world, otherwise intelligent people have chosen to worship at the modern-day alter of Mother Earth. The problem with treating science like religion is that anyone that disagrees is a heretic that must be burned at the stake. Science is about adding data and changing theories to match the new data. For centuries humankind believed an 10 oz ball would fall 10 times faster than a 1 oz ball; But new data proved otherwise so we revised the theory and eventually came up something we use daily - modern physics. Religion is about accepting on faith that which cannot be proven. The eco-fear data being used to terrify our children is 35 year out of date and new data is selectively chosen and massaged to try to cram it into the context of those old models. This book presents new data with an open context.

Is mankind the cause of global warming or are we just part of the process? What \\"are\\" greenhouse gases? Exactly how much of them do we actually contribute? What is Earth's history and tolerance to them?

I haven't found the argument that global warming is real, yet maybe unimportant elsewhere. I haven't found the argument that Kyoto is irrelevant to global warming--with real numbers--elsewhere. Everyone else either seems to say &quot;global warming isn't real&quot; (losing the argument) or &quot;global warming is terrible (losing the argument as to why no nation of consequence--including Germany, England or Japan--has ratified that treaty). I noticed this in a recent news story.But where oh where does Bush's argument come from? I think it's this book, which has become a classic on global warming. Both my conservative and enviro friends seem pretty aware of it and the authors and accord its arguments a lot of respect. In &quot;The Nation&quot; last month there was an exchange between the authors and a critic which most of my friends agree was surprisingly favorable to the writers.I don't know if I agree. But I found Satanic Gases very readable (though I tend to suspect anything from the publisher--Cato Institute) and, if, as I guess, this is the book that Bush and Cheney are looking at, I've got to give it five stars."},{"Title":"The Satanic Gases: Clearing the Air about Global Warming","review":"In the last few months it was announced on the news that there was a consensus of scientists about the reality of human effected climate change and because of this consensus there was a growing imperative for the need to act. Not too long after president Bush announced in his state of the union address some measures which he argued would help in the fight against global warming. More recently there has been much publicity to the breakup of the Arctic Ice cap and speculation about the ability to sail once again through a North West Passage while at the other pole scientists have discovered lakes beneath the artic ice which have a significant effect on that ecosystem. This morning on the weather channel it was noted that yesterday the temperature high in West Caldwell, New Jersey, was the highest since 1947.For me this last remark is significant as I have yet to hear of any claims that the earth has been steadily warming since 1947 yet the temperature in that year was over 70 degrees F.What is the relevance of all this to this book you may ask? A good question. Being of English origin it is often said that the talking point is always the weather. Whilst this may not be true, I for one have long found the subject interesting. However, my degrees are in economics, social science and education so I cannot claim any expertise in this area. However, I am somewhat sceptical of many of the claims made about global warming and environmental change mainly due to the reliability of evidence relating to centuries past. I recall the predictions made in the 1990's of the disastrous winds which would cause havoc at the turn of the century yet never happened as well as the claims made for population growth in the 1960's which were proved false. I also believe that there is a lot of money to be made from the scaremongering about global warming by those who argue the most passionately for it. It is also true that even if countries like the US go for smaller more fuel efficient cars, then the wealthy and the powerful in our society will still be able to drive their relative gas guzzlers with impunity.This book is an asset to the layman trying to make sense about the true nature of climatic change. It shows that the consensus is more of a fabrication than reality because of the vested interests of those who formed the consensus to begin with. The Satanic Gases addresses many areas of concern and shows that the evidence upon which many conclusions are based is flawed or the reasoning is somewhat suspect.The major deficiency in the book lies in the ability or otherwise of the average reader to assess the quality of the information contained therein. I also consider that a second edition is long overdue which could incorporate more current information.The book is recommended by a number of eminent persons but that should not be a reason for merely accepting it's premises and arguements. For my own part I feel that it is required of us as active citizens to be sceptical of expensive and huge government programmes and to ask questions of our elected officials to help us truly understand the nature of them.It is my belief that the jury is still out on this issue and while that does not excuse inaction for the future, it is certainly our duty to ask that these programmes are really based on sound science and unassailable evidence."},{"Title":"The Satanic Gases: Clearing the Air about Global Warming","review":"Many times there is the warning through the book: do not criticize global warming advocates simply because some climate models have flaws. Such is petty and nonproductive behavior, and productive thought and research are badly needed. Right now we need to keep improving climate and Earth models for better accuracy and predictablility. Also, the most important idea from this book is to keep asking the questions \\"how\\" and \\"how much,\\" especially the second (p60). These approaches are not conservative, but rather what real scientists strive to do every day. The book title sounds combative, and likely turns off many on the Left, who often seem to prefer hearing bad news only.The authors claim that hurricane wind speeds actually decreased as ocean temperature rose over the last century. This seems surprising, and bears checking out with other published numbers-based results. The CO2 portion of the book is quite well done, but the small part about toxicity levels can be safely ignored. On the other hand, the chapter \\"Greening the Planet\\" is well worth reading a second time. CO2, they remind us, is not a pollutant, but rather a gaseous fertilizer for plant life. It is possible, though, to argue that ANY chemical is a pollutant if present in great enough quantity, if one wishes to split hairs.The last chapter, as with just about all climate change books, is not particularly strong. Most last-chapters are hand wringers, but Satanic Gases is at least not one of them. The authors advocate swapping the existing biased federal funding of research and development for private funding, and this is a forward thought. A minor observation: for some reason, critics keep badmouthing the authors' statement about ozone breaking down to the hydroxyl radical. Clearly, this criticism is mean-spirited, as technical people must know very well that the hydroxyl radical is tangled in the intermediate steps of the chemical change, although the authors did make a bad choice of prepositions.

Because the climate models are wrong, this means that rising greenhouse gas levels will only warm the earth slightly, and the benefits will outweigh the harm done. Interesting theory, however, most of the climatologists in the world no longer hold to this theory. The authors do describe the mechanisms behind global warming adequately, and confirm that the earth is warming. They part ways with other scientists by using an interesting approach to predicting how much warming will occurr - essentially, they say that the slow warming of the last 100 years accurately predicts slow warming in the next 100 years.The authors did not even mention climate tipping points presumably caused by rising greenhouse gases or other factors, which have occurred in the last 10,000 years, and could happen in the near future. The authors did go out of their way to criticize Al Gore no less than a dozen times. What is about Al Gore that gets climate change skeptics so fired up? It's not like he was the first person to say global warming is a problem.I would recommend this book to skeptics and non-skeptics alike as a thoughtful, well-intentioned study on global warming and its lack of impact on the world.

The emphasis on consensus comes from the political left and may have been invented by Stalin. How do leftist organizations reach a consensus? A leftist organization only invites those who it knows will agree with its position and excludes those who disagree. As far as scientific evidence goes, only ideas supportive of the paradigm ever mentioned, particularly in higher level documents such as executive summaries. The IPCC says this exclusion is made so policy makers won't be confused, but what is really happening is that all dissent is being suppressed.

The simplistic logic applied to that data and the grossly incomplete and myopic conclusions it produces are breathtaking. They appear to be over simplified blandishments designed to do nothing more than soothe the layman's concerns and win votes. Yes, the authors admit, the earth is warming and probably directly because of man's influence but this they portray as a benefit for all mankind. They glibly point out that because no scientist at the turn of the last century could have predicted what life would be like in the year 2000 they are compelled to limit their climate projections to the span of 50 years when natural C02 levels will have only doubled and the global temperature may have only modestly increased. Heck, they point out, we can all live with that. They conveniently neglect to consider the effects of a trippling or quadruppling of CO2 levels in the following 50 years because as we all know there is no point in thinking past 2050. They also conveniently fail to mention the possibility of the magnifying effects of a positive atmospheric feedback system. This book presents data selectively, without the circumspect objectively that characterizes valid scientific discourse. It has been bought and paid for by powerful interests that have a transparent economic and political agenda. The authors advice on Global Warming? &quot;Get over it&quot;. They should be ashamed to call themselves scientists."},{"Title":"The Satanic Gases: Clearing the Air about Global Warming","review":"Micheals and Patrick are among the leading skepitics of global warming in the international scientific community. And they are being paid well by the fossil fuel industry for their skepticism. Michaels has recieved substantial funding from the German Coal Mining Association and Western Fuels. Balling has recieved funding from the British Coal Corporation, German Coal Mining Association, and the Kuwait Foundation among others. The vast majority of their research is not peer-reviewed and the conflict of interest should be obvious. It's amazing how a hand-full of industry sponsored skeptics can marginalize the expertise of the 2,500 international climate experts that comprise the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)."},{"Title":"The Satanic Gases: Clearing the Air about Global Warming","review":"Frankly this book is entertaining and worth reading but it severly underestimates the problem. As we can easily see from websites like globalboiling dot com there is a clear link between ocean water temperatures and the power of hurrincaes and the hurricanes impact is HARDLY inconsequential.

So as not to engage in an ad hominen attack, I will only refer the potential readers to &quot;The Heat is On,&quot; an expose of global warming skeptics, including the authors.As for point-by-point critique of the book, there's not enough room on the Internet. Read &quot;The Heat is On&quot; (which also has a web site) or &quot;The Change in the Weather.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Satanic Gases: Clearing the Air about Global Warming","review":"At the outset, I have been a global-warming-as-disaster agnostic. But I have followed the arguments for years and try to read everything that comes out, and I try (but maybe fail) to not &quot;prejudge&quot; if I know something about the authors etc...I also look at reviews with I hope an open mind.That brings me to The Satanic Gases. The argument is really very simple: The planet warms, partially from human beings, but humans themselves cannot stop what they are doing and in fact have been adapting to this all along. But extreme scenarios get play from a political process that only funds our most lurid problems and a media that exists to sell media (surprise!). In fact, though, future warming is likely to be near the low end of the range, unless almost all scientific models are wrong to the core. This argument is made in very convincing fashion in this book.What amazes me is that it seems you either agree with these guys, citing the obvious plethora of facts and figures in the book, or you disagree and attack personally. This itself bumps my review of this book up one star.But, more important--and I hope I am not wrong here--it's beginning to look more and more like Michaels and Balling were in fact the correct prophets about the ultimate (non)-resolution of this issue. They have been screaming this from every available mountaintop (some supplied by industry, others from their University positions--major institutions like ASU and Virginia don't hand out Full Professor from cracker jack boxes) for years now.I give this book 4.5 stars (rounded to 5)as a result. More evidence: A few months ago Nova/Frontline had a global warming show in which the entire second hour was devoted (without credit) to precisely Michaels' and Balling's proposition: you can't stop it, and you can't even slow it much, so why try? The July Atlantic Monthly is even more telling. A huge piece by Daniel Sarewitz and Roger Pielke concludes 1)The science will never adequately support policy, and 2) We can't do much about it anyway, and 3) We have adapted if we have enough money, so maybe we ought to help poor countries with infrastructure. Pielke was a Democratic staffer for the late (of Southern California) congressman Brown's Science committee.Hey, those are the same arguments Michaels and Balling make in Satanic Gases, only based upon mountains of data.It's rare to see (what I used to think) were caterwauling naysayers turn out right, but I am very close to moving off the agnostic fence as a result of The Satanic Gases. It probably doesn't hurt that the book is very well written--I have seen in local papers several Op-Eds by Michaels and he is a very hot, entertaining writer for a scientist, almost like the &quot;Anti-Sagan&quot;."},{"Title":"The Satanic Gases: Clearing the Air about Global Warming","review":"The cleverly titled &quot;Satanic Gases&quot; is a remarkably interesting book. Those of us who follow the greenhouse issue have been peppered with hot rhetoric and ad hominem attacks on the motives and the credibility of the authors. For example, see Ross Gelbspan's book, which makes the preposterous argument that these two authors have somehow convinced the entire nation that global warming isn't a threat, while the 2,500 scientists can't counter them.But what comes out of The Satanic Gases is far different than boilerplate rhetoric--from either side. It is very highly referenced (so much for the argument that the critics don't publish), comes with the endorsment of the past presdients of the National Academy of Science, the American Physical Society, the past director of the U.S. Geological Survey, and the past director of the Board of Agriculture of the National Research Council.The argument made has considerable internal consistency--read it for yourself and compare it to others and you may come to the same conclusion. But, moreover, Michaels and Balling provide a neat explanation as to WHY the issue has been overemphasized that breaks new intellectual ground and seems difficult to refute. In addition, the book is surprisingly evenhanded (considering the opposing rhetoric) taking on misconsceptions about this issue whether they are from the right or the left.That's what makes this book different, and is why you should read it. I've read Stevens and Gelbspan and Gore's new edition (Satanic Gases is currently outselling all of them) and they just aren't as interesting, amusing, factual, or intellectually challenging. This book is a sleeper that is going to have a lot of staying power."},{"Title":"The Satanic Gases: Clearing the Air about Global Warming","review":"Firstly, let me say I did enjoy this book. I am a huge skeptic of the Kyoto Protocol but not only because of the reasons outlined in this book! Geologic history indicates that the world has been warming up more or less since the glaciers retreated 10,000 years ago. The geologic record over the last 500 million years would also suggest that we are in a 'cold period' and there is no time where the earth has a static temperature - it gets hotter and colder over the centuries and eons and in the past, it has generally been hotter. Stating that the temperature in 1900 was 'average' and then getting angry with ourselves when the world rises above or below this 'average' is very short-sighted...This book dissects a lot of the myths and contadictions that have sprung up over the last decade concerning global warming and its impact - higher deaths, more extreme weather conditions, decreased crop yields, excessively rising sea levels etc. It also briefly discusses the impact of government intervention to try and slow down global warming (e.g. the disintegrating Kyoto Protocol).However, I was a bit disappointed that the authors didn't step back from the microscopic analysis of papers to paint in the 'big picture' and allow the reader to gain a more coherant overview of why there are many skeptical scientists out there! In fact, from the evidence presented in this book, I am greatly reassured that global warming, despite its name, is clearly not a global phenomenon which is going to have much impact on any country except the US...The authors focus on small and large descrepencies in papers that have been released over the last 2-3 decades - largely by the US - and comments made by ignorant but influential people - also from the US. Well, thats fine - thats what has created the hysteria over global warming in the first place. But, surely the name 'global warming' implies it should have a global impact?! By the final chapters of the book, this over-emphasis on dissecting the smaller details make one feel too much emphasis has been placed on discreding models and little on the reasons why any scientists felt they ought to question the models to begin with. But, there is a lot of evidence beyond the dissection of small scale climate modelling which could be reassuring - and more interesting - to explain why anyone would want to put global warming in perspective in the first place!I also felt the book could have been better fleshed out by touching on why we are in this predicament of depending on fossil fuel in the first place. However, as the authors correctly note, where we will be in terms of technology and use of power in 100 years time is at this time, completly unknown. We could all be tapping into quantum energy for all I know! In the end, one can only be reassured (and not by the authors) we are burning through 440 million years of the Earth generating fossil fuels for us in a few short centuries - we will be forced to examine alternative and comparative sources of energy sometime in the next 100 years if not sooner.In the end, this book is a dry but interesting critique of all the climate modelling and posturing made by the US government in an attempt to rally the world behind a cause. It is very scientific, but arguments are developed logically and explained in a clear fashion that anyone wanting to gain a more balanced point of view about the hysteria surrounding global warming, will be satisfied with this book."},{"Title":"The Satanic Gases: Clearing the Air about Global Warming","review":"The Satanic Gases is a book that should be read by every none believer in global warming and by every global warming Kool-Aid drinker. The book shows that yes the earth has gotten warmer over the last hundred years. It also shows how people use every abnormal weather occurrence is blamed by global warming including El Ni&ntilde;o which has happened for the past 5,000 years. Also how we blame blizzards, floods, draughts, warm temperatures cold temperatures, and anything that's not average.This book is not an easy read and should be given time to read and digest. The book is well thought out and shows how only one side is ever presented, Especailly the coverage it gets during a hurricane or other natural disaster. It also shows how over the last 50 years hurricanes have decreased and tornados also. It also documents that CO2 levels were higher when the dinosaurs were alive and during the ice age. It also documents how temperatures have changed since the beginning of the world.Finally he shows the exaggerations of politicians such as Al Gore who make ridicules statements that aren't always backed by science. Also the effects of treaties and protocols would have to prevent global warming and the economic effects they would have. Over all this is a great book on this topic."},{"Title":"The Satanic Gases: Clearing the Air about Global Warming","review":"Michaels and Balling offer a refreshing alternative to the alarmist screaming that comes from some over the issue of global warming. Through comprehensive analysis of the data and theory behind the issue, the authors find that climate change from industrial activity won't be the dramatic planet threat many think.They acknowledge that carbon dioxide levels in the atmophere are increasing. However, they think global temperature will only increase 1.3 decrees Celsius by 2100. They do not think ocean levels will rise enough or fast enough to endanger people. Their findings also allow them to believe that storms may actually decrease in intensity and increased carbon dioxide may encourage plant life.The Satanic Gases is a fine bit of science presented in a persuasive manner."},{"Title":"The Satanic Gases: Clearing the Air about Global Warming","review":"Throughout history the vision of apocalyptic crisis continues to attract the multitude.As good as this book is about the science of &quot;global warming&quot;, the part I liked the best talks about the social mechanisms and political incentives that continually imagine and inflate crisis far beyond their true import.The subject has been well treated before in the classic: &quot;Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds&quot; by Charles MacKay and in Julian Simon's: &quot;The Ultimate Resource&quot;Remember the Luddites, Malthus, or the club of Rome (which predicted mass starvation for the 1980's), &quot;global cooling&quot;, and innumerable other crises. Unsophisticated crackpots schedule the end of the world within their lifetimes, so their folly is revealed on that day.It takes real &quot;sophistication&quot; and political motivation (what better example than the UN) to select a menace so difficult to disprove and so far in the future, that we can finally punish those evil greedy capitalists.Meanwhile, Popocatapetl just erupted in Mexico and spewed forth probably more pollutants in one day than all of humanity can manage in 6 months."},{"Title":"The Satanic Gases: Clearing the Air about Global Warming","review":"I have eagerly awaited Patrick Michaels' book.I am very actively involved in the debate on climate change. My specialty is human health.I can say without reservation that in my field, the overwhelming majority of my colleagues are apalled by the nonesense that has been written about the impact of global warming on human health--asthma, mosquito-borne diseases, and all the rest.Problem is, we all have priorities. Few of us can justify the time to counter this Orwellian gobbledgook. So the field is left uncontested.On the other hand, there are people out there who have garnered large funding from government and private interests in order to foster this phoney paradigm. It is in their interests to maintain its momentum, with or without the truth.The result is that the public are being fed with colossal quantities of pseudo-science, much of it expertly packaged and convincing to honest pepole.Michaels, of course, has his own angle on all of this. Frankly, I would have wished that he had steered clear of the politics. The substance of his book is erudite and well presented. In my opinion, his account would have been much more persuasive if he had he stuck to his highly readable style and avoided all mention of the politicoes.Ah well! Whatever the packaging, the substance of this book is solid science. I will value it for its bibliographic references and its logic, not for the other stuff.[Sadly, perhaps, in this age of mis-information, we may have to adapt this sort of style to compete with the propagandists].So, I give it 4 stars, and recommend Satanic Gases to anyone who wants to know a bit more about this hot topic."},{"Title":"The Satanic Gases: Clearing the Air about Global Warming","review":"This book deserves to be read by EVERYONE who professes a true interest in the Global Warming Hypothesis. Yes, that's right, that currently popular THEORY which has been so generally and uncritically accepted that most any contradiction of its dogmas is automatically branded environmental apostasy and corporate sell-out! These two gentlemen have provided us with a welcome antidote to the low-level hysteria usually associated with the currently fashionable model of global climate change, its unctuous hand-wringing and DISASTER-batory self-righteousness. I only wish they had spent more time with detailing a perspective of the interglacial period we now occupy, particularly of modern science's inadequate understanding of glacial periodicity and the shorter variations of climate that have interspersed those warming and cooling cycles. Contemporary thought is ALWAYS far too blind to anything but the narrow parameters of, at most, two or three generations worth of change. Real scientific progress requires such rigor: empirical objectivity, free of bias and prejudgement. The Satanic Gases contributes in its own small way towards that better progress. No, it does not have all the answers, nor is it simply intended as a debunk of &quot;mainstream&quot; consensus. What you will find here are some alternative explanations to many of the half-truths being fobbed off by the mass media as geophysical and atmospheric fact.

Normally I don't listen to Rush (find him boring) but I also read things like The Nation and I find that some big people on the left--like Christopher Hitchens--are converging on the notion that there is a a big rat lurking in the global warming story, namely that the issue is overblown and both the extreme left and right (i.e. Hitchens and Rush) seem to agree that the policies will cause economic harm for little accomplishment.So I decided too take a looksee at this book. BTW Amazon did have a great price! I was pleasantly surprised. It was actually fun to read and taught me a lot about the ancillary mysteries, such as tornadoes, jet streams etc that I have been curious about, but all backgrounded against the global warming issue and &quot;how&quot; science gets done.The bottom line really does seem well-argued. The issue is way overblown by both scientists and the press and--something I did not know--VERY little can be done anyway, even if we tried, and it was Clinton and Gore'scientists, not some right-wing nuts, that showed this.Just for they hey of it, I checked sales figures seen as this book isn't exactly advertised (despite the funny title). It looks like it's amazons best seller ( I searched under &quot;global warming&quot;), despite being nearly two years old. After I read it I think I know why. I learned a lot and it was fun and it was nice to understand why the political extremes seem to be getting together on this one. I also picked up a lot of fun trivia like how many people get killed by cold air and that winds in hurricanes are going down, not up, according to the UN. I intend to use these for upcoming Christmas party bets. Maybe that cute little enviro-femme will go out with me.A cool book."},{"Title":"The Satanic Gases: Clearing the Air about Global Warming","review":"I had the opportunity to hear Michaels speak in person the day after Hurricane Wilma hit Florida. In a year in which the Altantic Ocean has seen most named storms ever recorded in a year (22 by the current count) AND the most storms ever to become hurricanes AND the most powerful storm ever recorded, Mr. Michaels would have us deny the obvious - that hurricanes are formed over warm water, and as the water warms up, the hurricanes will become more intense.His book is made up of lies, half-lies and almost-truths. This is what American Scientist magazine had to say about him:>>The Satanic Gases is an altogether different beast. Patrick Michaels and Robert Balling are professional atmospheric scientists, and the dust jacket of their book states that their scientific studies support their claim that global warming predictions are \\"simply wrong.\\" The book does not fulfill this claim. Errors in scientific statements are numerous, misleading logic is used, and much of the \\"evidence\\" presented is from earlier, now superseded, studies. Minor scientific errors are common: The authors claim the earth radiates in visible wavelengths; they refer to gamma rays as \\"thermonuclear signals\\"; a thunderstorm is said to collapse when it \\"literally runs out of air\\"; ozone is said to break down to OH-; and so on.They make even more errors when describing policy matters and attempting to disparage various mainstream scientists. A scientist with whom the authors disagree is likely to be labeled \\"federal scientist\\" or \\"federal employee,\\" even when he or she is a university professor, apparently in the belief that the term \\"federal\\" is pejorative. The 1997 Kyoto Protocol, the agreement to make a small start on greenhouse gas reductions, is repeatedly criticized, even though the authors' description of the agreement suggests they have not read the text. They claim that this treaty allows the United Nations \\"to invoke whatever penalty it might choose upon those who do not meet their commitments.\\" No such provision occurs in this treaty, nor is it likely that a group of sovereign countries would delegate such powers to the UN.A sad aspect of this book is the effort throughout to prove that other scientists are scientifically dishonest. Climate modelers are accused of hiding the deficiencies of their models, when in fact modelers fairly meticulously list the ways in which their models fail to perform and the approximations made in creating a model. Those who choose to describe a variety of scenarios rather than using one uncertain guess are said to be employing \\"politicized fairy tales.\\"The most egregious example of a personal attack is a quote taken out of context and altered to distort its meaning. The quotation is taken from a published interview with a well-known scientist in which he discusses problems faced by climate scientists when talking to congressional committees and the press. In the interview he points out that one is obligated to give the whole truth, with the caveats-the ifs, ands, and buts. As human beings, though, he observes, we want to see the world become a better place, to draw attention to a potentially serious problem, so we feel a pull to use colorful metaphors and dramatic examples. This leads to an ethical bind. He concludes that \\"Each of us has to decide what the right balance is between being effective and being honest. I hope that means being both.\\" Michaels and Balling omit the phrase \\"I hope that means being both,\\" saying only that the scientist has said that \\"he has to choose 'the right balance between being effective and being honest' about global warming.\\"This book cannot be recommended, either as a contribution to public understanding of the current status of climate change science or as a helpful description of the current international negotiations searching for a consensus on how and on what time scale the world should begin the process of reducing emissions of climate-changing gases.&lt;&lt;Now, this is me talking. As I said earlier, Mr. Michaels would have us ignore the obvious, and would prefer many more disasters in which people are killed before anything is done. I would have given this book zero stars out of five. Unfortunately, Amazon does not give me this option."},{"Title":"The Satanic Gases: Clearing the Air about Global Warming","review":"The main point of the book is that Global Warming is not something to be concerned about. Both authors have impressive credentials, but you should know that they are on the payroll of anti-environmentalist groups, including Kuwaiti government sources (The Carbon Wars, p. 262).The authors admit that the world climate is warming, just not at the rate that many of the environmentalist and computer models predict. They claim that computer models are inadequate and at the same time claim that the temperature will continue to increase at a linear rate for the next century. On what basis is this assumption made if computer models are inadequate? Well, they actually use the computer models to support this linearity assumption. They predict that the average Earth temperature will warm by roughly 1 degree Celsius by the year 2100. This, it must be assumed from their book, will continue into the following century. No doubt they are banking on the fact that most people do not care what happens to Earth after 100 years.The two authors agree that we are changing the world climate and that it is getting warmer. They just don't think we should be concerned about it. In fact, they list a number of benefits. The authors make the argument that we cannot possibly predict accurately more than 50 years, and since in 50 years the world, in their opinion, will still be safe for mankind, why bother changing anything now? They do not address the danger of runaway Global Warming, which many scientists believe is a possibility. Given that our computer models are still inadequate, are we willing to risk it?If you care about the future of the Earth then do not let this book be your sole source of information on Global Warming because I do not think the authors of The Satanic Gases care."},{"Title":"The Satanic Gases: Clearing the Air about Global Warming","review":"What a great way to sell books!

The answer is probably that you are looking for a rationalization of what you already believe.This is science like prostitution is love. It may be a feel-good facsimile, but it isn't the real thing. And turning to politically motivated science cheapens the politics as well as the science.I think the most breathtaking aspect of this work is the colossal hypocrisy employed here. Micheals and Balling decry the distortions of the left-wing environmentalist nutballs and play up the limitations of environmental science while using the same tactics. If the premise of this book is accurate, that science is used by idealogues to distort the truth and promote their political philosophy, well, what can we make of this book? Does the politics lead or the science?I would suggest that you look into the history of the authors to determine whether they are capable of non-political dispassionate scientific inquiry.

Archeologists agree that around 10,000 years ago sea levels rose 400 to 600 feet and probably very suddenly. Noah is just the oral history of that event. Most scientists are unfamiliar with catastrophe theory (a very simple theory which describes that in nature events happen very precipitously). Nature is much like the stock market with sudden unpredictable spurts.Ice is a good conductor of heat and has a high latent heat capacity and thus a whole ice sheet (eg Antarctica) must heat up before it melts (very suddenly).

Our leaders seem strangely alike, bland corporation men in suits, who blindly lead us into wars against popular will, at the same time as they slash away at social provisions that have stood and served us well for decades.Ordinary people too have come to understand that the mainstream media only provides a slick but highly slanted view of world events. We hear much talk of Palestinian terrorists, but never of Palestinian poets. Alternative viewpoints are desperately required in times like these. Such a new outlook is provided by Flowers of Galilee.Its author, Israel Shamir, is a true Palestinian poet, though an adoptive son of Palestine, rather than a native. Gently Shamir leads us from the local and the particular, to the global and universal. The olive trees and blossoms of Palestine lead in an entirely natural and unforced fashion to the great questions.Why do we stand - apparently - on the very brink of World War III? Why is the Left fading away into 'business friendly' neo-liberalism? What about the increasing brutalisation of society, and growing gulf between rich and poor?Reading Shamir's analysis of Palestine and the world is like seeing a metaphorical onion being peeled away, till you finally come upon the kernel of truth. This stripping away of the layers of illusion is bound to be an almost painful and traumatic process for many readers, so it's good that Shamir's friendly tone is there to guide you through. The example of the British Prime Minister is always there to warn of the dangers of believing your own falsehoods and illusions.It's unfair, perhaps, to categorize any author in terms of his peers, but those who are unfamiliar with Israel Shamir's writings might imagine something of a combination of Lawrence Durrell and John Pilger. It would be out of place for this brief review to attempt a detailed description of the collected essays that comprise Flowers of Galilee : all however make fascinating reading and re-reading. Individually, the essays vary in overall tone from the largely amusing such as 'Up to a Point', to at least one - 'Cornerstone of Violence' - that will scare the hell out of its reader.But amid all the moving or philosophical passages, there remains a gentle vein of serious humour :'The instant recovery of a hijacker's passport, intact on the scene of jet crash, should be counted among the most spectacular miracles of all times, well ahead of Daniel's trip into the fiery furnace. The old Babylonian furnace surely had not built up to the temperature of burning jet-fuel. Arab-language flying manuals in the trunk of a car,inaudible videotapes and other conveniently recovered exhibits make of the Moscow trials of 1937 a shining example of justice uncorrupted. The Afghani prisoners of war have been kept away from prying eyes, in the limbo of Guantanamo Bay, lest they disclose the greatest secret of all: their innocence.'Despite the fact that the collection was written during 2001-2002, Flowers of Galilee retains an absolute contemporary immediacy.For example, he leaves us in little doubt what a victory for the 'Mammonites' of the USA would mean for the world :'Their programme of globalisation would eliminate all beauty and specific quality of the world, kill the spirit, undermine art, wipe out spirit, destroy nature, undo social achievements, divide mankind into Masters and Slaves. Wherever they go, old caf&egrave;s and restaurants disappear and Starbucks and McDonalds take over. Workers lose their working places, museums are filled with trash, art is replaced by TV. Still, they should be contained, not destroyed.'Shamir seems to imply that an alliance of the outsiders of far left, far right and Muslims could defeat the forces of Mammon and the globalisers. But above all, he is convinced that the future of the world will be settled, one way or another, by the struggle for Palestine : 'The fall of the Holy Land would create a point of no return for mankind and signify Man's total enslavement by the forces of domination. Our victory will set the world free.'"},{"Title":"Flowers of Galilee: The Collected Essays of Israel Shamir","review":"With every word, every phrase, Israel Shamir displays his loveof the holy land. I've read lots of books on the Middle East,but this is - by far - the most compelling. I really cannotexpress how important this book is to me, so I'll include aquote from Nick Pretzlick, which I agree with wholeheartedly:&quot;Israel Shamir is in love with the Holy Land. He has apassion for the land and its people; he believes thetwo are umbilically linked. For him there is only oneviable solution to the conflict that has ravaged theregion for so long and that is the one state solution.Shamir is a humanist and although he is scathing aboutPalestine's enemies - the Jewish elite - he takespride in and writes lovingly about the courageousJews, who resist Israeli crimes.Flowers of Galilee is a collection of essays, so fullof affection - such an elegy of love - that, readingit for the first time, I felt impelled to delay theturning of pages, preferring instead to linger overimages - to savour the sentiments.Shamir does not pull any punches. He challengesconventional thinking, but he does so with honesty,affection and such thorough understanding andknowledge that his outspokenness is reasonable andrational. Flowers of Galilee is an eye opener - alearning experience. It is also enchanting.&quot;"},{"Title":"Pier Angeli: A Fragile Life","review":"Here at long last is a first rate biography of Anna Maria Pierangeli.Jane Allen has managed to capture here the whole of the Pier Angeli era perfectly, from a wealth of personal family interviews and worldwide media reports.For the first time,the writer has delved into Pier's mind and given us all an illuminating scene of what made her so irresistable with her unique beauty.Many previously unpublished photographs are included and there are chapters devoted to her relationships with James Dean and Kirk Douglas.Her sad and declining years are written in a sympathetic and moving style with great depth and sincerity that any Pier fan would appreciate.A comprehensive Filmography of all her films from 1949 to 1971 are covered, and a very detailed Notes section covers some 16 pages.This is a very fine definitive volume, and Jane Allen should be congratulated for this labor of love."},{"Title":"Pier Angeli: A Fragile Life","review":"I was in my early teens when Pier Angeli was on top. I remember Vic Damone's television show (my mother always watched it). Plus I barely remember the custody battles between the couple in the late fifties. Since I am an ardent James Dean fan, I didn't care a lot for Pier because I thought she was a flighty thing with little substance. This book changed my mind. It is beautifully written and well-researched. The writer pulls you into the setting, leaving you with the sense that you are really there. The author is both a writer and a psychologist; her analysis is quite perceptive. She views the situations from all aspects and doesn't throttle the reader with her own opinion. Some biographies are manipulated to the writer's benefit. Such is not the case here. For anyone who has ever been an admirer of any of the people in Pier Angeli's short life, this book is a must!"},{"Title":"Pier Angeli: A Fragile Life","review":"Information on Pier Angeli is hard to find; I'm so glad I found this book! Pier's story is wonderfully told - I simply could not put this book down. I highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"Pier Angeli: A Fragile Life","review":"I was fortunate to find this book on this site at a decent price, and I'm so glad that I did. Not only is it informative and readable, but it really gives you insight into the life of one of the most underrated and neglected young actresses of the 50s, Anna Maria Pierangeli, known as Pier Angeli during her MGM contract. The Italian actress lost her father in her early teens and was controlled and chaperoned by her domineering mother, Enrica, who essentially kept Pier away from her true love, actor James Dean, and convinced her daughter to enter into a marriage with singer/actor Vic Damone, a union that would be short-lived and a disasterous mistake. Her career faltered during her marriage to Damone and it never regained the same momentum. Pier found herself in increasingly more unworthy and exploitative films in Europe before her return to Hollywood in 1971. Her second marriage to musician Armando Trovajoli was as disasterous as her first, and she lost custody of her children. However, her return to California was a time of high hopes that her career could be rejuvenated. I personally never believed that Pier committed suicide, and it's good to see that the author argues against this theory and proves that there was no suicide note, as has often been claimed. She loved her children and her sisters far too much to do that, even if pills and alcohol did bring a temporary escape at times.There are some wonderful sources and people who were close to Pier who make this biography all the more interesting, such as her fraternal twin sister Marisa Pavan, her younger sister Patrizia, her son Perry Damone, as well as many who worked with Pier and befriended her. You have to wonder how reliable of a source Enrica Pierangeli was, however. The term \\"stage mother\\" is never used but the way their mother and daughter relationship was described (love/hate, Enrica's constant presence and living through her daughter's career, how she tried to control who Pier dated, the fact that they were dependant on each other despite that they had a \\"terrible relationship\\" and would check with each other many times a day), seems remarkably similar to the lives of Natalie Wood and Sandra Dee, both of whom had stage mothers. And the fact that Marisa and Patrizia were pushed into the background and the focus was on Pier in the family - speaks volumes. Enrica tried to downplay Pier's relationship and feelings for James Dean, and I get the strong impression that Enrica's dislike of Dean and the fact that she lost control over Pier through much of her time with Jimmy and later her marriage to Damone played a large part in how Enrica relayed things after Pier's death.Pier was a gentle, childlike and somewhat naive young girl at the beginning of her screen career, and I think because of that and her mother's pushing to have Pier support the family, that made her vulnerable to both the studio and to people around her who did not have her best interests at heart. She was never really given the kind of roles that showed her acting talent, with a few exceptions, and to me that's a shame because I truly think that the world was deprived of Pier's talent and presence. She longed for love, and perhaps a bit of a father replacement, since she adored him and kept his photo (along with that of James Dean) for the rest of her life. She managed to avoid marrying Kirk Douglas, but sadly Damone was her mother's choice and she went along with it, although there may have been affection on her part for Vic, her heart always belong to Jimmy, as she stated later in life.She suffered so much, but she did not take her own life.I would like to thank Jane Allen for her effort and for bringing this great biography of Pier and for opening a window into her world and the times she lived in. I wish Pier's family and friends all the best and hope they are doing well, and I hope Jimmy and his Annarella are together in heaven."},{"Title":"Pier Angeli: A Fragile Life","review":"Very interesting and wonderful written book. The book gives a good focus on the whole life of Pier from her childhood to her very sad older age. I wanted to read it to find out more about her relationship with James Dean, which is mentioned and referenced in the book.I recommend this book to all people who like biographies"},{"Title":"Pier Angeli: A Fragile Life","review":"It's hard to find information on Pier Angeli so this book written by Jane Allen is a perfect source. I originally bought this book because I am a huge fan of James Dean and she is mentioned in so many of his biographies. After reading the chapter on him, I felt compelled to find out about what happened to her later on after his death. And it was not happy. I see Anna Maria Pierangeli as a young woman looking for love in all the wrong places and in the wrong people, hoping to recreate the security and comfort she had with her father who had died just as she reached stardom.She was a misunderstood young woman who wasn't prepared for how big she was getting in the movie industry and who was too trusting, though this was not her fault but mainly part of her nature. She was a kind person who had a good heart and had the best intentions for those she cared about, especially her sons. But too many heartbreaks (the end of her relationship with James Dean, his death), failed marriages to Vic Damone and Armando Travajoli, the physical and mental abuse she endured from lovers she hoped to find companionship with, hoping that it would lead to some sort of happiness in the end.All of this took over her life, thereby making her believe that she could not find the happiness she longed to have. This biography is very intimate and shows the readers a side of her that she desperately tried to hide away for fear of rejection, rejection that she frequently experienced. A lot is provided about her personal life, the betrayals, the never-ending events of unhappiness, disappointment, etc. It seems that life never really treated her fairly and during the times when it seemed that all was well, they were simply too good to be true and always came to a miserable end. I felt sympathy for her because of what she had to go through, an independent life which she desperately wanted when she was dating James Dean and when she got it, she found that she couldn't harness it herself, especially after James had died. All that she went through led to her untimely death, which was NOT suicide, apart from what fans and/or other biographers claim.It hurts me to think of all her pain and misery, thinking that Jimmy Dean would have been heartbroken if he was watching over her after his death. It's true, she was a loving person even though at times she turned to alcohol and pills to relieve her of her pain, even if it was only temporary. She believed she could depend only on love to get her through, part of her idealistic life. But in the end, she could not have this. As true to the title of her biography, she did have a fragile life. I could not put the book down and page by page, I felt that I could relate to her, her emotions, her views, and her reasons for her actions which weren't in her best interest, though through no fault of her own but simply her misguidance by those who controlled her and her weakness to stand up for what she wanted, to be a non-conformist (an influence that Jimmy Dean had tried to help her to demonstrate).After reading that Pier considered Jimmy to be her one true love, you start to think about what could have been between them had fate not intervened, leading up to his unexpected and sudden death. Pier went through many hardships, many that she should not have had to endure. Whether you are a James Dean fan or not, this book is a must-read, you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Pier Angeli: A Fragile Life","review":"this was a wonderful read, and beautiful written story of the life of the equally beautiful yet flawed pier angeli, i think the title was a bit misleading because i don't think pier was as fragile as the world thought she was, in the book i saw a woman who just didn't really have her piorites right and made bad decisions.the only thing i critize about the book is the book format, it's written as though you are reading a newspaper with very small print."},{"Title":"Pier Angeli: A Fragile Life","review":"And I don't say that lightly. This is an incredible book for several reasons.Information, especially good detailed information on Pier Angeli is quite hard to find and here is a whole book in English, just about Pier.The book is well researched and is written in a warm , respectful tone towards its subject.You don't always see that in a biography.I also enjoyed the format and layout of the book. I thought it was done beautifully.It also had some photos of Pier I'd never seen before.Most of all I was just grateful for an opportunity to find out more about Pier . And I was happy to see her story sympathetically told.Her story should be much more well known and she is sadly underrated as an actress.I first heard of Pier because I am a huge fan of James Dean.But I have became a fan of Pier in her own right.The book touched me deeply. I did not know that Pier had experienced so much unfairness and agony in her life, especially in her final years. I knew she had experienced some rough times throughout her life, but I did not half the things she had been through.I think Jimmy would be saddened to know all the pain that his \\"Annarella\\" has suffered.Pier was a sensitive , fragile, unique woman and I relate to certain aspects of her character such as her oversensitivity and the part of her that never wanted to fully grow up and let go of the innocence and free spirit of childhood very much.What happened to Pier was a tragedy.I still don't understand why the studios turned their backs on this beautiful , talented actress. That was a huge mistake because it cheated both Pier and her fans out of all the terrific work she was capable of doing.If the major studios hadn't unfairly turned their backs on her , she would have had the lasting quality career she deserved.Her life would have probably have been different and she might even be alive today.Who knows?I don't mean to make this book seem all negative because its not.Pier's story is a heartbreaking one thats for sure, but the book also celebrates the good things in her life-her beauty, her love and loyalty to family, her love for her children, her talent, her once luminous career.And the book also presents proof that Pier DID NOT commit suicide as is so wildly reported and believed.I would recommend this book to any fans of Piers, any fan of classic Hollywood , its personalities and its darkside,and also to fans of James Dean. There is a chapter about her relationship with him and several mentions about him in the book.My only possible complaint about the book is sometimes I feel the Author tried to insert her own speculations as to what Pier was thinking and feeling at certain moments, when nobody not even her family or friends could know that unless Pier came out and explicity told them, but I suppose thats common practice in a biography.But it don't feel it takes away any from the high quality of the book."},{"Title":"Pier Angeli: A Fragile Life","review":"Jane Allen, lets us all know the truth about how much Pier Angeli and James Dean really loved each other. The questionable paternity of one of her children. The shocking papers that were found in James Dean's Porche after his death. The eyewitnesses who saw the lengths each one had gone to to see each other. There has to be a movie made about this relationship that gets deeper into their rocky romance not just their intimate moments in Malibu at the beach house but their long talks. They had so many interests in common not just a loss of a parent which is what everyone who has seen the other television movies about James Dean have found out. Their love for each other was emphatic in every way. I know that they were reunited when she left this world, accidentally, as Jane Allen points out, on September 9th, 1971. This is a great book.The only thing I have to negatively comment about is Jane Allen's belief that Pier wanted to be envied. Pier wanted to be adored by her fans. She always wanted praise but not envy."},{"Title":"One of the Boys","review":"In this story a.young woman works with a group of cameramen and is very good at her job.

It's a book that's difficult to describe, and something sets it off from Hilda Lawrence's other fine novels of suspense; perhaps because her dapper hero, Mark East, makes no appearance and the whole story has that \\"stand alone\\" feel that indicates the author wants to attempt something genuinely new without relying on the charms of a continuing character.It is a Southern Gothic book, in which a young woman, Regan Carr, returns to the house where she lived as a child under the invitation of an elderly, adorable cousin Hurst Herald. She packs everything she has in a single sack (the story seems to be taking place during the US depression) and boards the train in Chicago. When she gets to the mansion, there's a big black wreath on the door. Hurst has died. And nobody believes that he invited her in the first place. She's relegated to a little room by the attic where she meets a couple of allies, the pitiful, yet comic sisters, Katy and Jenny, who slave all day to keep the neurotic upperclass Herald family humming.There are dark mysteries in the book, and soon it becomes apparent that one of the family members is a dangerous lunatic whose crimes and mind are more twisted than even a modern villain like Hannibal Lecter or any of his dreary imitators. The scenes were Regan has to expose herself to pure evil are marvelously done. THE PAVILION is like what would happen if Flannery O'Connor had written THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, and I wouldn't be surprised actually to find out that O'Connor read and learned from Hilda Lawrence, who had a short, tumultuous career of writing a handful of crime classics (say, from 1945-55), then she disappeared. One of her stories (from DUET OF DEATH) showed up as the basis for a memorable episode of Alfred Hitchcock's TV show, \\"The Long Silence\\" in 1963.

The thing that I don't like about it is that the Kindle version does not have everything that the hard copy does. The Kindle version also doesn't have page numbers. When the professor references a certain page in an assignment, it makes it very difficult to know if I am referencing the right material. For the most part I like using a Kindle version but they need to do a better job to make sure that everything is included from the original version.As far as the actual content of the book is concerned, it is fairly informative.

Ettlie knows TONS but can't seem to organize his thoughts or stay on topic! Clue: he does repeat the same thoughts throughout the book so occasionally you can use later passages to decipher others. He even has two sections by the same name in one chapter - I am not kidding! I don't even think his editor could make it through this one. Lots of great ideas in there but plan many hours reading every single reference to try to figure out his points. That is IF you can find the references, some are quite old and many are flat WRONG, or not completely identified, especially in Chapter 9. Sadly, his reviews as a prof sound about the same. Smart guy but proceed with caution!"},{"Title":"Managing Innovation, Second Edition: New Technology, New Products, and New Services in a Global Economy","review":"Why a second edition? Author John Ettlie explains. \\"First, it is greatly simplified but broadened in one important way: it adds more material and cases on service innovation...It is also worth noting that there are many videos and additional case recommendations available to assist in this process, which can be accessed through the Web site that supports this text (www.managinginnovation.org). Second, it has new original cases written since the last edition [1998], and a few classic cases that carry over that students have all voted to keep. Third and finally, fewer subjects are included but those that have survived have been significantly updated and treated in greater depth.\\"Ettlie carefully organizes his revised, updated, and (in some instances) expanded material within three Parts. In the first (\\"Getting Started with Innovation,\\" Chapters 1-3), Ettlie focuses on technological innovation, various theories of innovation, convergence of strategy and innovation. In the second (\\"The Innovation Process Unfolds,\\" Chapters 4-7), his focus is on managing R&D;, economic justification of innovation initiatives, the New Product Development (NPD) Process, and interrelations between and among new processes and IT. Then in the third (\\"The Context of innovation and Futures,\\" Chapters 8-10), he shifts his attention to various dimensions of public policy, the \\"Coproduction Imperative\\" in response to globalizing change, and managing future technologies.With regard to the mini-case studies, there are 17 inserted throughout the narrative, each followed by a \\"Discussion Questions\\" section. Exemplar companies include Gillette, AskMen.com, Hewlett-Packard, IBM, Outboard Marine Company, 3M, Microsoft, and Honda. Also, there is a \\"Summary\\" near the conclusion of Chapters 1-9. Throughout most of the chapters, Ettlie also inserts \\"boxes\\" that provide brief examples of managing or mismanaging innovation. For example, Bruce Weber's article, \\"IBM's Deep Blue Wins Chess Match,\\" a \\"Self-Assessment\\" exercise that evaluates the reader's behavior at work, an explanation of how \\"Technology Drives Bank Mergers,\\" and a summary of \\"The Advantages of Set-Based Design.\\" Given the scope and depth of the material that Ettlie covers, various reader-friendly devices that also include dozens of Figures and checklists of key points are most welcome.This by no means an \\"easy read.\\" However, it will generously reward those who are directly or at least indirectly involved in the management of innovation in a world that Thomas Friedman has characterized as \\"flat,\\" one in which new technologies, new products, and new services are essential for a company to succeed in a rapidly expanding global economy.Those who share my regard for this book are urged to check out Tom Kelley's The Art of Innovation and his more recently published The Ten Faces of Innovation, Tony Davila's Making Innovation Work, and Innovation to the Core co-authored by Peter Skarzynski and Rowan Gibson as well as Competing in a Flat World co-authored by Victor Fung, William Fung, and Yoram (Jerry) Wind. Also Bernd Schmitt's Big Think Strategy, John Cao's Innovation Nation, and Big Ideas to Big Results co-authored by Michael Kanazawa and Robert Miles."},{"Title":"Bold Galilean: The Power of Rome Encounters Christ (Christian Epics)","review":"This is the third book I have read in the Christian Epics series issued by Moody Press in the mid-1990s. They are all older books, not-so-well known (with the exception of Quo Vadis? and Ben Hur), telling stories that are set in and around the time of Christ, edited and abridged to make them more attractive to modern readers. The two I read previously were Quo Vadis? and Ben Hur, which are popular classics that I found to be fairly mediocre. So I was expecting pretty much the same with Bold Galilean, especially since it has not enjoyed the enduring popularity of the previous two.I was, however, pleasantly surprised. Perhaps it is due to the fact that the book was written in the 1940s, while Quo Vadis? and Ben Hur were written in the 1800s, but I found the book far more readable, the narrative more engaging and the characters better drawn. LeGette Blythe definitely had talent as a writer; his way of describing places and his creation of characters and their interactions is skillful.Bold Galilean focuses on three Romans, whose lives will intersect with that of Jesus in markedly different ways. There is Gaius, a centurion stationed in Judea, whose interest and sympathy is piqued by the words and deeds of the bold, young Galilean rabbi. There is Marcus, son of a Roman senator, who has come to Judea to make a fortune in his family's business and who believes money is the answer to everything. And there is the Tribune Lucius, recently come to Judea with Pontius Pilate, who believes that Roman military power is the ultimate solution. He figures far less in the story than the prior two, but his life is impacted by Jesus, as well. And then there is Naamah, a beautiful Jewish woman who grew up in a country north of Greece, who is captured by the Roman army, sold into slavery, and eventually ends up as a concubine in Herod's palace.The author creates a engaging story of these four, with Gaius, Marcus and Naamah even interpreted as actual characters in the Bible (but I won't say which ones as that would give too much away). Each of them encounters loss and tragedy before their lives are touched and forever changed by Jesus. Their stories were totally plausible, and their conversions were depicted skillfully and realistically; I found Gaius' and Marcus' struggles with doubt, even after the miracles Jesus did for them, to be far more convincing than if they had immediately been won over to Jesus, excitedly telling everyone they knew about him (which is how modern authors tend to depict first-century Christians).Occupying just as much space as the story of these four is the story of Jesus himself. Here again the author does an excellent job. For the most part he manages to flesh out the story of Jesus and his disciples without departing too much from the Biblical account (there were a couple of exceptions, but they didn't detract too much overall). I particularly liked the way he depicted Jesus physically. While so many authors describe him as blond, blue-eyed and with an almost ethereal glow, Blythe describes him as a tall, muscular, tanned, rugged man with reddish-brown hair and dark eyes. Given the fact that Jesus was a poor man who did manual labor (carpentry) before he began his ministry, I think this is far closer to how he probably actually looked.If you like Christian-themed stories set in first-century Judea, I highly recommend this one."},{"Title":"Bold Galilean: The Power of Rome Encounters Christ (Christian Epics)","review":"Who is this strange man, this carpenter from Nazareth? He has strength, power, and an amazing capacity for drawing people to him. Everywhere he goes he attracts a crowd. He heals diseases, raises the dead, and calms the storm-swept waters. People yearn to be near him, to hear his teachings, and to experience his power. But few can decide what sort of man Jesus is.A Roman manufacturer, Marcus believes this rabbi is but an opportunist looking for money and power. Marcus's god is money - silver, gold, and merchandise. With money comes power, and with power comes happiness - he can buy anything he desires. Then his life is turned upside down. Can Jesus change such a man as Marcus?A fisherman by trade, Simon struggles with trying to understand his intelligent yet powerful young master. Jesus knows the Scriptures and can dispute with the spiritual leaders in the synagogue, yet he prefers to be with ordinary people - fishermen and tax collectors. Simon follows the rabbi, and, as he listens to his teachings, Simon begins to believe that this is indeed the promised Messiah, the Son of God.A Roman by birth, but interested in Jewish affairs, Centurion Gaius Sempronius does not know what to believe. He hears stories of the rabbi's healing powers and sees them at work in his own servant. He feels the carpenter's drawing power as he listens to Jesus tell of his Father. Is this the Messiah the Jews have long awaited? Has he come to overthrow the Roman Empore and set up his kingdom?High priest Joseph Caiaphas wants to rid Isread of this rabbi from Galilee. The temple leaders try desperately to trap Jesus - to trick him into saying things that would go against the sacred writings. Caiaphas believes Jesus to challenge to his authority, an evil influence, and a perverter of the law. He will stop at nothing until the Nazarene's influence has ended.--- from book's back cover"},{"Title":"Language of Space","review":"I must admit I haven't read this book, but I recently attended a presentation by Bryan Lawson where he presented these ideas in some detail. He is a good, entertaining speaker and has shown very good writing skills in previous books.The topic, however, is mostly well-known stuff by designers and architects, who have been interested in how the built environment shapes our behaviour for millenia, literally. The classic studies by Jacobs (\\"Death and Life of Great American Cities\\") is a more recent (1960s) example of this concern.In all (topic + author), I'd recommend this book to readers who are interested in design and architecture topics and are not fully familiar with Jacobs and all the subsequent work in envirmomental behaviour. This is a good place to do some catching-up.It is also very much recommended to non-design people trying to understand that design is much more than 'styling' or superficial appearance."},{"Title":"The Crimson Tapestry (Twilight of the Gods, No. 1)","review":"Joens has created a beautiful work of fiction that was refreshing to read. After growing weary of 'prarie' Christian novels, I was blessed to stumble onto this book.The Crimson Tapestry is about a boy called Worm with no past and an uncertain future. His world is turned upside down when he finds himself staying with a family that may have keys to unlock his past. Encountering an enormous bear, packs of wolves, and men who want his death, Worm's life is suddenly full of adventure, mystery, and romance as he makes the journey to discover who he really is.Fast-paced, with intense moments that made me hold my breath, this book is a must-read for anyone who likes the action/adventure genre. Although The Crimson Tapestry is set in 5th century Europe, it feels like fantasy. I strongly reccomend this book- but make sure you have plenty of time for it- it's difficult to put down!!"},{"Title":"The Crimson Tapestry (Twilight of the Gods, No. 1)","review":"Wonderful book for all ages.

I was not disappointed. Michael Joens' does not match Frank E. Peretti, at least in Peretti's twists and turns in his later works, but Joens' keeps you riveted to the pages. As a bonus, there is also the pleasant experience of learning and of being reminded of history learned long ago, regarding the Romans, Britons, Angles, Saxons, Picts, Scots, and Druids. It appears that Michael Joens did quite a bit of research into the 5th century period in the British Isles. Some have called this Fantasy, but it did not seem so to me. The verisimilitude Joens has created was beyond that of any good action-movie. And then, there are the real truths that touch the heart, making this book a valuable read."},{"Title":"The Crimson Tapestry (Twilight of the Gods, No. 1)","review":"mr. joens' work is a fun read, however i wish that more of the nordic pantheon was explained in his story--for example, what does the title have to do with the characters' way of life? what exactly is the twilight of the gods? i found myself doing some side research on the nordic pantheon and the history of the british isles--as i did with his second work. the storyline was at times predictable, but still a fun read--someone asked me to compare the work to the narnia chronicles--i'd say the twilight was less meaty on all sublevels, but a good introduction into the time period."},{"Title":"The Crimson Tapestry (Twilight of the Gods, No. 1)","review":"I'd reccomend this book to anyone who is into Christian Fantasy.

That said, if it had been released a few years later, we would all associate it with the worst excesses of Rambo-ear Reagamerica.

The author discusses how the film came to be made and the political context that surrounded the film, but the heart of the book is his discussion of the film itself.Charity's writing here is marvelous, pointing out where the scenes were shot, what was real and what was faked, how the film points back to Westerns and \\"Only Angels Have Wings,\\" and how it differs from Wolfe's book. While reading \\"The Right Stuff,\\" time will fly by.This is one of the best of the excellent BFI series.

The Jhanas include eight levels of conscious awareness, and they appear to be the mystical \\"mystical experiences\\" that so many pilgrims from so many religious traditions have sought for so many centuries. This book gives a Buddhist perspective on them.--Ayya Khema, a well-respected Buddhist nun, centers her book around a little-known part of Buddhist scripture called the Potthapada Sutta, in which a well-meaning but unsophisticated student asks the Buddha how to achieve the highest level of conscious awareness. The Buddha often answered such complicated questions very simply and with some humor, but he now takes the reader into a journey full of wisdom and depth. Instead of answering the student directly, he defers the answer until he has addressed the preparation needed to comprehend the question. The Buddha clearly indicates that the higher mental states should be approached indirectly, carefully, and with great ethical and mental preparation. Such preparation usually takes tremendous effort and personal change, but without them, chasing after something like the \\"highest conscious states\\" may not only be useless but a dangerous source of attachment and delusion. Far from being an esoteric spiritual cookbook, Buddhism demands adequate awareness, a practiced discernment of existence, and an ethical \\"guarding of the sense doors.\\" Only then can the various Jhanas be productively accessed, although they are not simply \\"obtained\\" by our own efforts. Liberation depends on understanding existence, not in manipulating existence.--Ayya Khema then gives a superb commentary on the Buddha's description of the Jhanas, and discusses what they mean for us. The author suggests the Buddha viewed these supreme mystical experiences far differently from many other religious leaders. Although the Jhanas are a supremely wonderful and useful place for the mind to be, they too are subject to arising and passing away, and are not the End of the Road. Instead, their value is to allow the mind to become so clear and so focused that Insight Meditation becomes more, well, insightful. As the author puts it, the Jhanas can have indispensible value in \\"understanding experience,\\" and in managing the questions of old age, suffering, and death. When all becomes still and one becomes kind, all becomes obvious.--Ayya Khema has artfully described a wonderful teaching. She has introduced us to steps on the spiritual journey that many of us had not expected to take -- those of discipline, renunciation, heightened awareness, and decency. Life isn't easy, but it can be positive for one who pays attention and changes accordingly.--This book deserves the attention of anyone interested in this dimension of Buddhist meditation. You may also want to consider a directed Jhana retreat, such as one of those found on her student Leigh Brasington's website."},{"Title":"Who Is My Self?: A Guide to Buddhist Meditation","review":"books on meditation abound . the hard part is sifting through the morass of confusing and often contradictory methods that all but scream for your attention . ayya khema's book doesn't scream .... it whispers . and its still whispering to me , long after i have finished it .meditation books can be dry , they can be humorous , technical etc , but they all need to appeal to the experience of the everyday person , the one we're all so familiar with . we have to see our everyday selves in a book on meditation for it to appeal to us . ayya khema's book appeals .buddhism can be so esoteric . but this book keeps it simple , the way buddha intended it before our vainglorious egos started putting words into his mouth .now if i sound like i'm about to fall at ayya's khema's feet in servile obeisance , i'm not . there are plenty of other good books out there on meditation , but few wrenched my gut the way this one did . the best part of this book is that ayya khema writes like she has herself been through the pains of the path . buy it and begin practising !"},{"Title":"Who Is My Self?: A Guide to Buddhist Meditation","review":"I own over a dozen books on Buddhism, but this is the *only* one that actually describes stream-entry. The descriptions of the jhanas are just wonderful, and certainly have helped me in my meditation practice. My deepest gratitude goes out to the late Ayya Khema.Don't be fooled by the title (which I really find misleading). This book is a treasure of simple, yet detailed explanations on a complex subject. This book is a must for the serious buddhist meditation practitioner."},{"Title":"Who Is My Self?: A Guide to Buddhist Meditation","review":"I disagree that this book's title is misleading. True, the focus is on meditation and the jhanas, but the point is that if you practice in this manner you WILL discover who the self is, or rather that it is not.Ayya has a very readable writing style. And Just as a question arises in my mind, she answers it. She starts out with the difficulties we all have when starting meditation by focusing on the need for an ethical lifestyle, then detailing the hindrances we all face from time to time, and then going into details of the stages of the Jhanas.I get much out of all of Ayya's books, and am currently in the process of rereading them. Each time I learn more. I think this is my favorite Ayya book. Her books are well organized, superbly written, and the ideas well articulated, easy to understand, with many wonderful examples. And she sticks to the Buddha's teachings and interjects quotes from various texts of the Cannon. I can't recommend this book enough."},{"Title":"Who Is My Self?: A Guide to Buddhist Meditation","review":"There are many wonderful reviews of this book. So, I'll limit my 'review' to just a few comments. This book is like a meditator's manual and it is superb. It is very clearly written and, most importantly, it works! You'll probably not read this book straight through; it'll probably be dipped into as your practice progresses. This is not a beginner's book: purchase it only if you are very serious about your practice and are looking at establishing a daily practice or at least a very regular practice. And it would also be helpful if you have some background on Buddhism e.g. fromThe Heart of the Buddha's TeachingandEight Mindful Steps to Happiness: Walking the Buddha's Path, both of which are excellent resources. Also, please note that this book is written from a Theravada perspective. So, if you are learning Tibetan Buddhism (tonglen, lojong) or Zen Buddhism then this is perhaps not the first book to get, because you may find it confusing."},{"Title":"Who Is My Self?: A Guide to Buddhist Meditation","review":"I stumbled upon this gem and decided to give it a chance, despite not being familiar with the author. I had another book that went through the jhanas in my hand and comparatively, this one seemed to be more organic and contextual. Additionally, the author's voice is conversational, an amazing feat in and of itself. She has to know her stuff inside out to present something so profound and unpack it the way she does. The book is comparatively short given the breadth of the topic. The sutta contains the whole of the practice.Other reviewers basically said what I feel, so I won't repeat it. If I could take but one meditation book to a deserted island, this would be it. It engages ALL one needs to consider to become liberated, not only meditation. The book is very true to the original teachings and without any egotistical need to put her stamp on it. The title is really not a good representation of all the book contains but by the end, you will hopefully understand why she picked it. Losing our belief in an existent \\"self\\" is the sinequanon of the why of buddhist practice and what liberation is dependent upon. That idea is impossible to comprehend and will only make sense after meditative experience.The author provides a map from the beginning of our path (the confused person who does not understand what practice is all about) and the end (becoming a Buddha- awakening to the ultimate reality vs. what we thought was \\"true\\" all along). I love it and I can't say enough. It is packed with the wisdom and experience of someone who has tasted the fruit of practice. Her engagement of path and fruition (fruit) is clear and compelling. I've read this short chapter multiple times and will continue to do so. It also inspires me to continue to engage in my practice, and what can be better than that? This book stands heads and shoulders over any other meditation book I've read, especially contemporary ones. In fact, I am selling alot of my books to live more simply and this one is definitely not going anywhere."},{"Title":"Who Is My Self?: A Guide to Buddhist Meditation","review":"This was my first Ayya Khema book and I have to say I was pleasantly surprised. She packs a lot into this text - her knowledge of Theravadan thought is formidable. And yet she delivers it all with the warm and comforting voice of a close friend.

Great stuff."},{"Title":"Who Is My Self?: A Guide to Buddhist Meditation","review":"I found this to be a more difficult read than \`Being Nobody, Going Nowhere\`. It's more Buddhist oriented with her telling a story of one of the original Buddhist text. Still, it was interesting in seeing how the people who knew Buddha asked questions and how he answers. Ayya Khema has an ability to explain the old texts, their context and apply them to our modern lives."},{"Title":"Who Is My Self?: A Guide to Buddhist Meditation","review":"Down to earth commentary on the Potthapada sutta with realistic description of the jhanas, along with what the path is and isn't.

Each chapter is a separate mystery to be solved, sometimes lasting many years, and sometime ending in revelations that radically altered the way in which the authors (e.g. Paul Val&egrave;ry) and artists (e.g. Henri Toulouse-Lautrec) are viewed.The setting is almost always in France, usually in Paris, since that is where Carlton Lake lived for many years, during which he wrote as the Paris art critic for the Christian Science Monitor. He amassed a collection so vast that it was eventually transferred to the Harry Ransom Humanities Research Center at the University of Texas at Austin, where he served as curator of the collections that researchers now flock to see.The book reads almost as a who's who of major French authors and some artists, giving intimate glimpses of their lives.

This coffee table size book, co-written by his widow, is Jerome's life story and a wonderful color compilation of his art. In 1967, he died at age 27 from a tragic accident and while he had only been in the art field for 5 years, his influence has been tremendous and ongoing. Jerome's widow Peggy tells his story in a sentimental way, and the book is profusely illustrated with color reproductions of his art. It is a visual feast, with his signature blue backgrounds, delicate lines and colors portraying powerful and spiritual themes. He shows what the Trail of Tears felt like, the sadness and hardship endured when the Southeastern tribes were forced to go to Oklahoma, Indian Territory then. Jerome also liked to portray children, playing stickball and dancing, and some of these are touched with whimsey. This book is highly recommended for those interested in Native American art."},{"Title":"The Life and Art of Jerome Tiger: From War to Peace, Death to Life","review":"I can't claim to be an expert on art, but I know what I like and I like Jerome Tiger (1941-1967). This young American Indian had a fabulous sense of color and movement and his paintings are just plain beautiful. Most of them have American Indian and Western themes. You've seen many imitators if you've perused the galleries in Santa Fe.Tiger seems an overdue candidate for iconhood. He was a full-blooded Indian from Oklahoma. He was uneducated, never finishing high school, and untrained, although he studied for a while at the Cooper Art School in Cleveland. He was a boxer and street fighter, a drinker, and, most importantly, he died young. He was only 26 when he killed himself with a bullet -- apparently accidental -- to the head. He was enormously, instinctively talented at his trade and blissfully ignorant. He once asked, \\"Who was Michelangelo?\\"His wife and cousin compiled this illustrated biography. It's well written, favorable to Tiger but not hagiographic. The story of his life is interesting; the reproductions of his paintings and drawings are wonderful. There is a drawing of James Dean done when Tiger was about 14 years old that is as good a representation of the \\"rebel without a cause\\" as I have seen. There are photographs of Tiger in the boxing ring, and riding a horse, and with his daughter. He was a handsome young man whose pompadour resembles James Dean's.Most of all there are reproductions of his paintings, more than 100 of them, most dominated by the beautiful blue he favored and featuring American Indians in all their activities. The impact of his large paintings cannot be appreciated on the printed page but they are stunning. Tiger's output was enormous; he had a photographic memory and rarely erased. He once drew a locomotive in all its details from memory. He was a budding genius who, in my humble opinion, deserves to be in the first rank of American painters -- not in the first rank of American Indian painters, but in the first rank of American painters. And the movie of his life will undoubtedly win an Oscar.Smallchief"},{"Title":"The Life and Art of Jerome Tiger: From War to Peace, Death to Life","review":"There are gorgeous reproductions of Jerome Tiger's work, who died at a tragically young age. this was during a time of extreme prejudice that still exists in Oklahoma to this day (as well as other places).

While it is both seriously outdated and out of print, many details of the method of X-ray structure determination that everyone takes for granted nowadays are presented as new ideas and thoroughly explained in a thrilling way.

The friend who gave it to me warned me that I would want to stop reading it. I did have to stop reading a few times and talk it out with her. It gave me an insight into myself and my attitude and definition of forgiveness I had never even imagined before. It has given me very useful tools that work. I will highly recommend this book to anyone who is struggling with forgiveness."},{"Title":"The Twelve Steps of Forgiveness: A Practical Manual for Moving from Fear to Love","review":"This is another one of the books of Paul Ferrini, I recently completed reading. After finding his work, I seem to want to read everything he has ever written. He is an important modern-day poet. His writing is beautiful prose to me. There is wisdom and truth in his work that is easy to assimilate, for me personally. I believe I was searching not to understand forgiveness for others, but to find forgiveness for myself, when I chose this book. I was looking for forgiveness for my own transgressions against myself and I believe I found it here. I was changed after reading this book. What is really unusual, is that I feel that way, after each book I complete, that he has written. We must be on eachother's spiritual path, our paths crossing at this time. Paul Ferrini, how did you learn all of these things? Each book I have read, I've had to pass along to a friend afterword because of the value I've gained from his work. He may become a most important author in the world. I feel honored to have found his work and heard his message.

Go in, and meet the true self.Paul Ferrini's books are very inspirational.His weekendworkshop I followed in 2006 was rather bleak and didn't meet up to his written work unfortunately.I've got quite a pile of his books, and each one of them I reccommend highly!"},{"Title":"The Twelve Steps of Forgiveness: A Practical Manual for Moving from Fear to Love","review":"For years I have dealt with personal issues caused by something someone has done to me. Plus people wanting to disregard that what has happened happened. I felt highly overlooked. On top of nobody allowing me to heal properly every other day there was a reminder of what has happened. It's the hardest when you are related to the person who hurt you or this person is in a place you have to go (school, work, gym etc.) for a long period of time. Me being who I am I do not take someone hurting me lightly because there are certain things that are highly unacceptable for you to do to a person as well as ill.Yet with this book, I was able to ease some of the pain I felt as well as open up and realize what is what. How I am not owed an apology from those whom have decided to commit treason against me. Oddly enough some of those people have apologized to me after I told myself to forgive them for their wrong doings.Honestly I see no point in sitting in fire if you catch my drift.I am much happier after applying the thoughtful suggestions in this book to my life. I smile more as well. This book is the perfect balance between spiritual and doctoral help.I advise all to not buy the other books on forgiveness that are listed without looking at the preview or reading comments. A few of the other books I thought about buying had some harmful chapters such as Blaming God and Forgiving God. I didn't understand why such a thing would be in there, what does he have to do with why we were harmed? he doesn't tell people to hurt us."},{"Title":"The Twelve Steps of Forgiveness: A Practical Manual for Moving from Fear to Love","review":"This book was too wordy and needed editing, but I appreciated the message that forgiveness starts and ends with yourself.

Yes easier said than done but I know it is neccessary. To achieve this we have to truly forgive ourselves at a heart level. We need to explore every aspect of our own personality and come to terms with it. We don't have to be perfect, we just have to accept ourselves! It can sound so easy yet we seem to make it so hard. We have entrenched belief systems and they are hard to let go of.

Some of the recipes were child friendly but all of those I have tried are great to serve on the day we check one of the author's books from the library. Great way to help us connect our children with good reading. I have also cheated and on the day we ordered pizza we shared the broccoli recipe from Judy Casely -- knowing that the children would LOVE the pizza and not like the broccoli. They were glad to find out that Casely likes pizza too although the broccoli is heathier. Of course we also tried the English muffin pizzas too -- great for lunch. One day we had a 'literary luncheon' with Paul Brett Johnson's fried chicken Keiko Kasza's potato salad and Mary Casanova's crazy chocolate cake. All were teacher friends. Introduced them to some great authors and great books. This is a fun way to start a book conversation and would make great items for our book group. wish there was an adult version as we like the little bits of information about the books, and the authors, along with the themes shared. Lots of good food and lots of good anecdotes.Also recommended: I think I read that a new title will be out next year -- Authors in the Pantry. I'll look forward to i"},{"Title":"La Maison de Rendez-vous","review":"The settings of both stories are oriental. In \`Djinn' the protagonist works undercover for an androgenous American spy. There are some curious adventures met in the hands of two children. After a while the book begins to fold back on itself and we find ourselves right where we started but we go off in a slightly different direction. It is as if the protagonist is trapped in some never ending mystery that doesn't explain itself. \`La Maison De Rendez-Vous' is about an evening get together, again we find some mysterious elements and the story folds back on itself various times, everytime we get a further glimpse into the affairs. It is the most curios style of narration that ends up adding a nightmarish aspect to the mystery. I wouldn't suggest this book to a die hard mystery reader but this will make an interesting reading otherwise"},{"Title":"Don Juan Tenorio/ Mr. Juan Tenorio (Spanish Edition)","review":"This is the most famous depiction of the ancient legend of Don Juan, the unrepentant and bold sinner from Spain. A masterwork of Romanticism, &quot;Don Juan&quot; tells the story of Juan Tenorio, a worldly man whose only interest in life is to seduce as many women as he can. He makes a bet with his friend Luis Mej&iacute;a, to see who is more fortunate with women. Don Juan wins, but his father writes him off from his testament. After that, Don Juan rapes Luis' fianc&eacute;e. All this gives him, of course, a bad reputation, so the father of his beloved Ines forbids him to marry her. Events unfold then at a rapid pace, amidst duels, murders, illegitimate seductions and tragedy, including the apparition of ghosts. But more than just a cloak-and-dagger play, this work is a fascinating elaboration on the central myths of sin and repentance; of trespassing and divine forgiving; of the redeeming possibilities of true love, as distinguished from the sins of the flesh which lead to hell. In the Spanish world, it is the play that is staged every year, by the beginning of November when Day of the Dead is celebrated. It is a sum-up of the Romantic myth and, as all classical works, it admits different interpretations, from the literal to the philosophical. And it's a lot of fun too."},{"Title":"Don Juan Tenorio/ Mr. Juan Tenorio (Spanish Edition)","review":"Don Juan Tenorio is the ultimate player. He is to players what William Shakespear is to poets.

He also suggests how the international community can help when developing nations adopt sound food and nutrition policy.Policy-makers in the developing countries are confronted with a primary dilemma. On the one hand, they want high prices for food to stimulate agricultural production. On the other hand, they want low prices to protect (at least in the short run) the poor buyers of food. However, adequate supply of food is not enough to eliminate malnutrition. Poor people must also have appropriate incomes, access to complementary goods and services, and the distribution of food within the household must meet the nutritional requirements of all its members.It is often said that a secondary dilemma is that between the role of the agricultural sector as a producer of food and its role as a provider of resources for the rest of the economy. The resources may be savings for industrialization, foreign exchange or tax revenue.The first dilemma has three origins, each presenting an obstacle to reform.The ultimate objective of policy-makers can be described as growth with equity. But there are at least five proximate objectives and three constraints of food-price policies which are listed below: 1) Allocational efficiency, i.e., the objective is to raise food production and productivity at the lowest cost. 2) Acceleration of aggregate economic growth through the balanced expansion of agriculture, manufacture and services. 3) National food security in the face of international uncertainties. Price stabilization for both consumers and producers. 4) Social objectives (some of which may be in conflict with one another) including undernutrition elimination, poverty alleviation and income redistribution, reduction in rural- urban income differentials and migration. 5) Political objectives such as the desire for political stability, which is important for investment and economic growth, or the desire of a particular government to stay in power through the support from urban consumer groups.The constraints are the budget, the balance of payments and the administrative capacity. The budgetary constraint consists in minimizing the burden on the budget and on scarce administrative skills. The balance of payments constraint consists in keeping within foreign exchange resources.The second origin of the dilemma is historical. Policy-makers find themselves with the heritage of a complex structure of interventions relating not only to explicit and implicit measures for output prices, but also with input subsidies attempting to offset the deterrent effects of low output prices, and the high costs of some inputs due to protection, explicit and implicit taxes on the consumption goods bought by farmers, various direct controls and ''ad hoc'' measures to meet specific pressures.The political constraints call for analysis of the problem of how to built a political base for the desirable reforms. What is needed is an analysis of the reformist coalitions that would provide the constituency for reform.So as to resolve the dilemma three things are necessary: first, an awareness of the set of objectives and their conflict or consistency; second, an economic analysis and an empirical estimate of the impact of existing measures and of any proposed reforms; and, third, a political analysis of how interests and support can be mobilized for these reforms.An integrated nutrition policy must embrace much more than ensuring supply of, demand for, and access to food. It must aim at appropriate health standards, particularly the elimination and prevention of intestinal and parasitic diseases, so that the food is properly absorbed by the body; at adequate education, particularly of women, so that people know what food to eat, how to prepare it and how to keep themselves healthy through hygienic practices; and at equitable household food distribution, so that vulnerable groups, such as pre-school age children or pregnant and lactating mothers, get enough to eat.The benchmark for producer prices is world prices, for they represent the opportunity costs of domestic resources. In countries where producer prices have been pushed below this benchmark, discrimination against agricultural producers should be removed. However, not current world prices but the trend of future prices should be used as the guideline. Using the trend also eliminates the need to pay attention to temporary price fluctuations, which are a disincentive to agricultural investment and hurt consumers. Around 15-20 per cent should be added to the estimated future price trend as an insurance against world prices rising steeply, developed countries reversing their protectionist policies or food becoming unavailable in the world market.It is important to ensure that higher prices are not absorbed in marketing margins, either by monopolistic private middlemen or by inefficient or corrupt state marketing boards.The announcement of these prices has to be timely, i.e., before the planting season, so that farmers can incorporate them in their decisions.Policy must also ensure that agricultural inputs such as fertilizers, seeds, machinery and transport are available.For each of these purposes, namely, 1) ensuring demand and access to markets, 2) not discriminating against agricultural production, and 3) ensuring inputs, macroeconomic policies relating to exchange rates are at least as important as microeconomic policies for specific crops. An overvalued exchange rate can harm food production for domestic consumption and foreign exchange earnings for imported agricultural inputs, though adjustments in the exchange rate are frequently insufficient.I tend to agree with the author's thesis of the need of a multipronged attack in regards to the problem of hunger. He seems to have an historical basis to substantiate his argument that getting the prices right by itself, without complementary action by the public sector (on technology, roads, health, extension services, etc.), can be ineffective or counterproductive.This book makes an interesting read. I just hope that, in the ten years since its publication, some progress could have been made in the 17 issues that the author identifies as in need of further research (e.g., innovation)."},{"Title":"What Price Food: Agricultural Price Policies in Developing Countries","review":"In this book the author discusses the impact of prices on the efficient allocation of resources and on various segments of the population who are especially vulnerable to changing prices.

The essays are reader-friendly, but demand reflection and action to come into consciousness. I had never read personal essays, especially prose that addressed issues of cultural conservation, the U.S.-Mexico border, and the naming of middle spaces and realities.The essays merit reading and careful reflection. I admit that I return to the essays often, because they read with immediacy and offer encouragement, hope. A few essays are meditative and stretch from the United States to countries such as Cuba, the Dominican Republic, Mexico, and Pakistan among others. Pat Mora, as a U.S. writer of Mexican origin, crosses spaces and borders to commune through language, culture, and critical consciousness."},{"Title":"Chiropractor: The Quest for Professional Respect","review":"Having read this book I have gained a huge amount of respect for this specialty which the public deserves to have covered under their respective medical plans, but alas this is not the case.It was a great book and a good read.

He takes an honest, no nonsense approach to the subject of Chiropractic care and its evolution from the days of Palmer's discovery to a modern, researched health care practice. He also examines the how Chiropractic is practiced today and the need to educate the established medical community in modern Chiropractic research. I applaud Boyer for not slamming the established medical community, but instead, calling for a spirit of cooperation between different health care professionals.All people in all health care professions would do well to read Chapter 3 \\"How do Chiropractors View Health?\\". It should have been titled, \\"How do Chiropractors View Chiropractic?\\" This one chapter, written in Question & Answer form, cuts through all the inane rumor, lies, and malicious propaganda written by some in the medical community. This chapter explains how the modern Chiropractor views their profession. Call it a FAQ's about Chiropractic. This chapter alone makes this book a valuable tool for those in the health care field who wish to expand their knowledge of health care professions other than their own.Boyer also includes mini case studies from his many years of practice that are both eye opening and thought provoking.

After Ackerley returned from India, he spent several years touching up his diary for publication; he changed the names, toned down the sexual content, and removed passages that might be considered libelous. This recently published version is the first unexpurgated American edition, with all the cuts restored.Ackerley's intent was to be mischievous and outrageous and comic; and his book became both a critical hit and, to everyone's surprise, his most commercially successful work. The book is at its best in its humorous depictions of the Maharajah, his private secretary Babaji Rao, and the contingent of valets, including the endearingly sweet Sharma and Narayan. For the most part, Ackerley's portraits are nonjudgmental and fond; he reserves his venom for the British guests and, to a lesser extent, for his sycophantic tutor, Abdul, and clumsy servant-child, Habib.Throughout \\"Hindoo Holiday\\" there is a disconcerting, even creepy, undercurrent that revolves around the sexual despotism of the Maharajah, whose predatory advances are directed towards the \\"Gods\\"--his name for the boys in his employ. \\"Boys\\" is Ackerley's term; at least one is identified as being twenty and several are married, so it's possibly more accurate to call most of them young men. But, whatever their age, these youngsters are compelled to have sexual relations with the Maharajah--and with his wife while he's watching. Complicating this issue is the subtly hinted possibility that the ruler is suffering from the advanced stages of syphilis. (The paternity of the palace's heirs is a great mystery, as well.) Only a few of the youths seem able to withstand his advances, and Ackerley often must come to the defense of Narayan, one of the \\"Gods\\" who refuses to comply.Ackerley reports these incidents with disquieting aplomb. His own role in these matters is rather innocent; according to biographer Peter Parker, he limited his affections to kissing and holding hands: \\"If he had sexual relations whilst in India, he left no record of the fact.\\" (And Ackerley was not known for being shy about such matters in either his journals or correspondence.) Nevertheless, intentionally or not, the goings-on in the palace are emblematic of the corruption, indolence, and decadence of the British Raj.Most modern readers, then, will find much of the tone and material and humor in \\"Hindoo Holiday\\" a bit dated. Yet Ackerley's memoir is still an accurate portrait of the time--and there are moments of brilliant hilarity."},{"Title":"Hindoo Holiday: An Indian Journal","review":"The cliche &quot;He leads a charmed existence&quot; ran constantly through my mind when I first read *Hindoo Holiday*. How else would a talented but eccentric young Englishman more or less tumble into a privileged position as secretary to an Indian maharajah and have the most glorious and exciting things happen to him?But it's real--*Hindoo Holiday* may sound like the title of a Hollywood musical but the writer is J.R. Ackerley and the telling is his own. His scenic prose style is better than any Technicolor in sharing his joy at his newfound environment. This book deserves a treasured spot in any armchair traveler's bookshelf."},{"Title":"Hindoo Holiday: An Indian Journal","review":"The first thing I should carp about (and that will be the last time I do about this book)is that it has never been recommended to me by friends or at the university by my teachers. The reason could be the the rather candid and matter-of-fact approach of Ackerly to homosexuality (belonged to the circle of friends including Forster and Auden):I should have guessed immediately because the locale is 'Chokrapur' whose American counterpart would be 'Ladsville'! One is left wondering if there was no persecution of people with different sexual orientation, after all, as its widely believed and is true, the British Victorian attitude were responsible(the British enforced out-lawing of homosexuality still persists in the Indian penal code) for casting a pall of repression over an otherwise liberated and taboo-proof(especially in matters relating to sex)Indian social order? Apparently not, for Ackerly carries on and there is nothing furtive about the advances:its all grown up and consent based.The other point that should be brought up and very few readings have thrown up, is that India's cliched image about being a land of diversity(thats true here, for the Indians Ackerly comes across are of all types), colour, and paegent is totally ignored.No monuments are praised here, nor is the culture sung about:For a change here is a book about the Indian people and the Indian attitudes and psyche. Ackerly seems totally unaware of the cultural difference.He just faithfully logs the absurdities of a group of people without any prejudice and judgement. If one has read 'A Passage To India'(EM Forster), which incidentally is as empathatic towards the Indian people, tends to cast the characters into an heroic mould and makes them very rounded in the attempt to compensate(rather over-) for the contemporary British view of their subject people, one would find it refreshing and indeed intriguing that some one could empathize so deeply with another people and be so impervious to notions of difference and all the baggage British took along as luggage when they visited their colonial cousins. Ackerly carries no 'White Man's Burden' thus giving the book such a contemporary feel to it. like his pen and ink drawings, his portraits are laconic but truly convey the character of their subjects.This is truly a book about real India, that is often missed out in glossy publications about the glorious monuments, or the patronising tomes about the Indian-way of life.This should be a must-read for anyone trying to understand India or pretends to be an Indophile.The patriots in India and the ultra-patriots in saffron policing the indian culture today should be ashamed for not having read the book and equally ashamed if they have, for then they have not understood much about their past."},{"Title":"Hindoo Holiday: An Indian Journal","review":"Both of Amazon's reviewers to date seem to have missed the point of Ackerley's Hindoo Holiday. Anyone coming to this book for a historic, sensitive portrait of life in India under the Raj is in for a profound disappointment. Ackerley's stay in the state he called &quot;Chhokrapur&quot; was short--only five months--and although he was interested in the cultural differences he found between himself and his friends, this account (in diary form) doesn't probe deeply into the questions of religion, gender, sexuality, and cross-cultural discourse that Ackerley inevitably encounters.Instead, the diary is meant to do one thing--make the reader laugh. Ackerley's sketches (literal and figurative--this edition comes with some pleasant pen-and-ink line drawings) of his Indian friends are memorable indeed: the shy Sharma, the affectionate Narayan, the wise Babaji Rao, the pompous but friendly Prime Minister, the irritating English Tutor Abdul, and most of all, the silly, simpering, loveable, intelligent, complicated, contradictory Maharajah himself. Ackerley is a brilliant writer whose eye for personal detail is unfailing; he's also a frequent misanthropist. The brilliance of Ackerley's writing, here and elsewhere, is that he doesn't ask you to like him, but leaves you unable to dislike the people (and canines--his My Dog Tulip is a must-read for any dog-lover) he encounters. Funny, entertaining and ultimately moving."},{"Title":"Hindoo Holiday: An Indian Journal","review":"E. M. Forster, whom Ackerley emulated in going to India in the 20s to work as private secretary for a maharajah, has a character in A PASSAGE TO INDIA named Miss Derek, who is private secretary to a rani and who &quot;regarded the entire peninsula as if it were a comic opera.&quot; That basically describes the attitude Ackerley adopts in HINDOO HOLIDAY, which treats an indian princely styate as if it were wildly wacky. No doubt that might have been true to Ackerley when he visited in the 20s, but this book's humor has worn somewhat over the years and seems at times a bit condescending. What has remained interesting and vital are Ackerley's observations about Indian (particularly Hindu) customs and manners, and his deft sensitivity and understatement in his portrayal of the maharajah's (and his own) homoerotic desires: Ackerley's keen observational intelligence, fortunately, outweighs the dated cross-cultural comic aspects of the narrative. While this isn;t nearly at the level of one of his later works like MY FATHER AND MYSELF, it's an intriguing read for anyone interested in India during the raj or early 20th-century homosexuality."},{"Title":"Hindoo Holiday: An Indian Journal","review":"This is one of those books that I will always keep by my bed as a reminder not to take myself too seriously in any capacity. I found this a terribly funny book, mostly becuase it rang so true. Ackerley is fabulous company, shockingly observant and brutally honest, even when it plunges him into bad light. We tip-toe so carefully around so many of the subjects he faces head on - racism, homosexuality, class and privilege. He doesn't flinch."},{"Title":"Hindoo Holiday: An Indian Journal","review":"Ackerly is a naughty naughty man. I agree with another reviewer who said that he was honest in his depicitions of the people he encountered as well as himself. Ackerly understood the hearts of the people he knew. Often he made fun of what he saw in people, but he knew them and knew when to put away his naughtiness. This was a great book. It was funny and charming. It gave me a glance into what India was like and may still be. I highly recommend this book to anyone with an open mind."},{"Title":"Hindoo Holiday: An Indian Journal","review":"What an absolute charmer this journal is. This is one of those books that I've been meaning to read for a number of years, but for one reason or another had never got around to. I'm so happy I finally did. Not at all what I expected. I've enjoyed a number of books covering the theme of East meets West culture clashes such as Orwell's brilliant \\"Burmese Days,\\" Ruth Jhabvala's \\"Heat and Dust\\" and Forster's \\"A Passage to India\\" and \\"The Hill of Devi.\\" Still, I think it is Ackerley's whimsical reminiscence I like best.Published in 1932, I know that some will find this book dated and politically incorrect. I prefer to accept it as a product of its time. The journal covers the six months that Ackerley served as a private secretary to a Maharajah. The author pokes fun at the many arcane traditions and myths of the Hindu culture, without ever becoming malicious. The Indian King is somewhat of an incorrigible lech and maker of mischief as depicted by Ackerley. The stuffy British aren't spared the barb either. I particulary loved this exchange: \\"...'Do you like India?' Mrs. Bristow asked me. 'Oh, yes. I think it's marvelous.' 'And what do you think of the people?' 'I like them very much, and think them most interesting.' 'Oo, aren't you a fibber! What was it you said the other day about \\"awful Anglo-Indian chatter\\"?' 'But I thought you were speaking of the Indians just now, not the Ango-Indians.' 'The Indians! I never think of them.' 'Well, you said \\"the people,\\" you know.' 'I meant us people, stupid.' 'I see. Well now, let's start again.'\\"Openly homosexual, Ackerley has great fun documenting his flirtatious encounters with a number of the Maharajah's servants - \\"....And in the dark roadway, overshadowed by trees, he put up his face and kissed me on the cheek. I returned his kiss: but he at once drew back, crying out: 'Not the mouth! You eat meat! You eat meat!' 'Yes, and I will eat you in a minute,' I said, and kissed him on the lips again, and this time he did not draw away.\\" Altogether disarming and delightful (and not at all exploitive). Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Hindoo Holiday: An Indian Journal","review":"Ackerley's (very artfully constructed) journal does many things. It offers an informative, basic guide to an Indian culture - its religious rites, observances, symbols etc; etiquette; social system - holding surprisingly strong under the Raj.It mixes tacit admiration for the expressive beauty of that culture with equally tacit horror for its repressive absurdities.It compares this society, favourably, with the sterile and racist Raj.It offers a sublimely funny comedy of social manners, full of characters from all castes and social positions, who are generally eccentric and/or sympathetic, all related in an elliptical comic style reminiscent of contemporaries Waugh and Powell, with the occasional unWaugh-like burst of rapture.For me, however, the book is most fascinating as a mystery story-cum-psychological study of the author himself - co-existing with the 'objective' observations is an exultant gay desire and lingering, mostly repressed trauma from the Great War that speak volumes about his motives for leaving decadent England for India, and explain the author's abiding interest in the country's taboos and restrictions."},{"Title":"Hindoo Holiday: An Indian Journal","review":"HINDOO HOLIDAY, while it does contain Ackerley's familiar low-key self-deprecating brand of humor, does not measure up to his other three books. It is essentially an edited journal of the several months he spent as a so-called secretary to the Maharajah of a small kingdom in India in the 1920s. It is an interesting look at the customs and foibles of the native people during the Raj. And yes, Ackerley's sexual afinities also play a constant and subtle part as he comments continually on certain beautiful young boys he longs for. In fact, it seems his 'employer,' the Maharajah, is also gay, and invites Ackerley to private parties featuring enticing scantily clad dancing boys.The truth is, however, there is little point to this book. Its journalistic content and style became simply tiresome eventually, so much so that I finally abandoned the book altogether about 2/3 of the way through. I still think that Ackerley was a fine writer. HisMy Dog Tulip: Movie tie-in edition (New York Review Books Classics)is a classic memoir, as isMy Father and Myself (New York Review Books Classics), about his relationship with his father, a work that is both comical and heartbreaking. HINDOO HOLIDAY might be classified as a light entertainment, an anomaly in a small but fine literary legacy from a talented and tortured soul.- Tim Bazzett, author of the memoir, BOOKLOVER"},{"Title":"Hindoo Holiday: An Indian Journal","review":"The more sexually explicit material was deleted from the text when the book was first published. In this edition the material has been added back in, but apparently no one thought it necessary to then do any further editing, which results in some startling juxtapositions and unintended sloppiness."},{"Title":"Hindoo Holiday: An Indian Journal","review":"I personally enjoy memoirs so I jumped at the chance to read this book when my study abroad program had it listed as required reading. Although it seems a bit dated, since it's from the early 20s, Ackerley presents an awesomely sympathetic view of the Indian people mere decades before the Partition during a time when the British weren't so keen on the Idian culture (as Ackerley makes the reader aware of with his portraits of resident British). I thought Ackerley wrote a stunningly entertaining book, giving candid portraits of various Indians and British alike. As long as you don't mind reading about the everday goings-on then you'll love this book. Apparently it also gives a very accurate description of India at this time, or my program wouldn't have had it on its list of required reading."},{"Title":"Hindoo Holiday: An Indian Journal","review":"I'm a great admirer of Ackerley's writing, and this book is beautifully written, but I failed to get the point. That could be my fault, but since in his other writing he made his points forcefully I suspect that maybe there isn't one to Hindoo Holiday."},{"Title":"Hindoo Holiday: An Indian Journal","review":"This is one of the worst books I have ever read.

I read Lew Hunter's book on screenwriting and found myself thinking up all kinds of great new ideas for my novel, and then, as I went through the book further, actually started taking the first steps to writing a screenplay.This is a basic book. I'm not enough of an expert on scripts to judge the script that Hunter wrote which is included in the book. But I found the advice helpful and, perhaps more important, inspiring. I've taken McKee's workshop. He's brilliant, and he disagrees with Hunter on issues of story structure, and things like page count for when different aspects of story occur. There is plenty of lively debate in the field of screenwriting on how stories are put together. And sometimes name-calling to go along with it. Lew Hunter takes a more conservative approach, toeing the Aristotelian three act play line, and he explains why he feels that the first act should end around page 17 of a 100-110 page script. You better believe this will garner disagreement, especially in light of groundbreaking films like Memento, or Pulp Fiction. But he does give his rationale for his approach, and this helps the reader to make up his own mind. My own screenplay, will definitely not be a straight linear story, but it just may end up that the 2nd act does spiral somewhere near page 17.But the bottom line for me was that this book moved me. As far as being a writer is concerned, I've done reasonably well, with published non-fiction articles in OMNI, SUCCESS, FAMILY HEALTH, and even a cover article in WRITER's DIGEST.I had actually bought the Hunter book, started it, then, having also purchased a number of other books, put it aside. But Hunter's name does come up a lot in the world of screenwriters, so I revisited the book. Sure enough, it took me to the next level. The people who have criticized Hunter's book are primarily comparing Hunter's book to books that are mostly about story, not about creating a screenplay. There's a difference...."},{"Title":"Lew Hunter's Screenwriting 434","review":"As a writing teacher I had access to as many free books on screenplays and writing in general as I'd ever want. I went over the samples carefully,because I'd be married to the book(s) I'd selected for courses for a long time. Screenwriting 434 rose above them all. I taught with it course after course. Why? Lew's book is an inspiration to writers. It includes everything you need to know, along with a sample screenplay that makes many students believe you they can do better. If you've ever read ON BECOMING A NOVELIST you know what it's like to read a writing book that makes you feel you'd never be able to please the author. Lew just makes you want to get out there and do it, and he takes you by the hand and shows what needs to be done. There is no other book like it. I've noticed many negative reviews on this book by \\"a reader\\". Lew is a teacher and I suspect from the simliar sound of the negative reviews that he may have annoyed some \\"one.\\" Don't let that stop you from at least looking at this wonderful guide. An argument that someone does not like a sample \\"story\\" has nothing at all to do with a writing book's teaching ability. And picking on a screenplay that actually got made is stupidity! Everyone can learn from a screenplay that sold and that students can actually watch. My students used this book for both fiction writing and screenplays, and they've had success in both areas."},{"Title":"Lew Hunter's Screenwriting 434","review":"I've now written three screenplays my most recent work appears to be approaching professional caliber. Looking back, I have to say that I'm very glad I started the process of learning how to write a screenplay by reading \\"Screenplay 434.\\"I found a certain magic in the book. It provides just enough information to keep you learning yet not overwhelmed. And the author is encouraging and positive, which I believe is important. Of course, the reality is that only one of thousands of people who read their first screenplay book will ever earn back even the cost of the book from their screenplay writing. So it is critical that the PROCESS be as pleasurable as possible. I believe that \\"Screenwriting 434\\" is an excellent way to ensure that your process is pleasurable, while ensuring that you do begin your growth as a screenwriter.Of course, Screenwriting 434 is only a primer. From there, you might go to Alex Epstein's Crafty Screenwriting."},{"Title":"Lew Hunter's Screenwriting 434","review":"In the process of getting my MFA in Creative Writing, I picked up many books to learn more about becoming a professional writer. Lew Hunter's Screenwritiing 434 was one of most interest, due to my evergrowing desire to break into the screenwriting business once I finish my degree. I finished it immediately and wasn't able to put it down.Many might sratch their head and think, \\"what does a small-town Nebraskan know about screenwriting?\\" The answer is, \\"A HECK of a lot.\\" Hunter has been a screenwriting professor at UCLA since 1979 and before that worked as a writer for television shows such as \\"Batman\\" and \\"Bewitched.\\" He knows the business and has been a creative consultant for many writers working in the business today. Many of his alumni are prominent screenwriters today, such as David Koepp, Joel Schmacher and Alexander Payne. Steven Spielberg has claimed that Hunter is the best screenwriting teacher going. Pretty good evidence of his skill and knowledge, don't you think?Hunter writes in a way that encourages, but at the same time is realistic. He wants people reading the book to open their mind and follow what they want. He also wants to make sure they know the do's and don'ts of the business. He gives excellent examples and explanations of what to do. Basically, he tells people that besides following a few certain groundrules, there is no one right or wrong way to write. A little bit of creativity, imagination and dedication will get the writer further than they ever thought possible.I also went to one of Lew Hunters screenwriting colonies in Superior, Nebraska and must say that I have never had as great of an experience as that.

Both were very average. I had the stories but did not have the way to make them flow, collate or garner pace at the right times. I attended Lew's Summer Colony in September 2006 and the experience sent me home with a completely changed outlook. It was as if someone had turned on a light. My first screenplay was produced in 2005 and made telemovie status. I have two screenplays to be produced now in 2012 and one with top end Hollywood talent.Starting from Lew's methodologies was wonderful, following tried and proven format I have since read similar books (at Lew's advices) and have honed my mediocre talent further. I paced thru a couple of other publications at libraries and they were in no way structured, helpful or logical. Lew has the knack of simplification without the tedious pages trying to explain 'what and why'. Combined with Aristotle's 'Poetics', written 350 BC it is amazing how Lew combines the essence of writing when back then - stage plays were without having a POV 'eye' amongst the action.

The first one I read was the Complete Idiot's Guide to Screenwriting, which was not all too impressive although I found it to be more helpful. Lew Hunter's Screenwriting emphasizes the importance of your story, but doesn't do all that much to help you write it. It's more about the three act structure and general rules about writing. Also, he lumps his own little-known script \\"Fallen Angel\\" in with undeniable classics like \\"Casablanca\\" and \\"Citizen Kane\\" but then refuses to share it with us, instead giving us the full script of his not-so-special script \\"Glass Hammer\\" which was never truly made into a movie.In summary, if you're looking for your first book, I would recommend Complete Idiot's over this one.

Waugh clearly was the genius of the dynasty. His relationship with his father is heart-breaking and wonderfully drawn by the grand-son, a brilliant stylist and clever wit. His close reading of his grand-father's famous novels provides useful insights into the creation of these novels, which remain in print after making best-seller lists more than 50 years ago. One Waugh, one would think, would be more than enough, but here we learn the English language world has been graced with at least four: Arthur, Evelyn, Auberon, and Alexander. How delicious."},{"Title":"Fathers & Sons","review":"This collective biography spans about six generations responsible for, one from the fifth generation tells us, about 180 books-- quite an average. Alexander's narrative depicts The Brute, muttonchopped patriarch from the 1860s; Arthur, Pickwickian declaimer; Evelyn & Alec, one funny, one feckless, both novelists, bon vivants, and diligent scribblers; Auberon (\\"Bron\\"), satirist whose entries for the Daily Telegraph & Private Eye I'd always heard of but never before (given their London provenance) had the chance to sample-- in his son's excerpts here; Alexander, who never seems to have been called as such ever by Bron. \\"For the first eight or ten years of my life I was addressed simply as 'Fat Fool'.\\" (422) It's that kind of relationship; the book concludes gracefully if ruefully with the newest father's glance at his next generation. Alexander, as I must call him for clarity's sake in a book with three Brons and a He-Evelyn & She-Evelyn, delves into the correspondence, rumors, anecdotes, novels, journalism, and gossip that makes up about a century and a half of alternately engrossing and trivial material.Rather than the Delphic oracular injunction to \\"know thyself,\\" Alexander avers this on the lowered level of the teenaged \\"I need to discover the real me.\\" He counters: \\"Perhaps 'O Man, know thine ancestors' would be a more useful motto for the modern egotist to pin on his puffed lapel. For the key to his identity, if such a thing even exists, will be found to lie not where he instinctively looks for it in the mirror-glass in front, but furtively concealed all about the hedgerows and borders of the long, twisting, dusty road behind.\\" (19)Why focus on the fathers and sons? That's where the bulk of the literary material lies, and the reason for \\"Wavian\\" renown, envy, backlash, and retribution. Michael Dirnda's review posted on Amazon recounts the episode of Bron's Cypriot machine gun gone awry, and this could have been lifted from a novel by Evelyn, his father. Alexander's best when he shows precisely how real life overlapped with Evelyn, Alec, Arthur, and Bron's own writing, and how they all used extraordinary wit (at their best at least; all wrote so much that inevitably standards slipped) to illuminate in fiction and essays their own foibles and those of their fathers. This pattern, as the son reflects late on in this family history, presents fascination and difficulty.\\"A father may have many children to add to his many concerns but a son has only one father, the 'august creator of his being', who chooses where he lives, where he goes to school, what he might find funny and, to a certain extent, what he thinks. Fathers are more important than sons, and therein lies the problem.\\" (418) The gist of this lengthy book, filled with letters back and forth between the generations as they snipe, nudge, and snicker with each other, is that in such a chain of progenitors and offspring may not lie conventionally false notions of affection for children-- in all their boredom, annoying habits, and demands to Be Taken Seriously. Instead, refreshingly, each father W. appears to-- as documented closely here-- have detested and escaped from his snivelling progeny whenever possible, and for this, in time if decades later, the son loved the father. Such honesty, as Alexander and his father show, eviscerates sentiment. It attacks maudlin convention of how parenthood should be celebrated, and this remains the lasting message I take from this book.But I'd be remiss to say, without giving away the best parts of this narrative, that for all the longueurs, for all the endless moaning about headmasters and contracts and affairs and alcohol that occupy so much of the content of the letters and the recollections-- that considerable learning, outrageous incidents, and genuine humor at the foibles of our fallen human condition provide the essence of this study. Evelyn and Bron sigh eloquently, in frustration at the pablum that the nanny state thinks we need for nourishment in ever more philistine times.Not all is either stultifying correspondence, insider family lore, or dutiful corroboration or refutation of allegations whispered or thundered for decades against the Waughs. The contents are stuffed full of epistolary invective, and it's probably difficult for Alexander, having to set the record straight and add his many askew angles to what's been printed and promulgated about his family, to edit the wealth of primary sources he presents, sifts, and challenges. The book may suffer in readability for those of us not as enamored of or as intimately related to Waviana. Still, this is a forgivable fault and a welcome one, given the access Alexander offers for those who immerse themselves in his in-depth presentation of Alec, Arthur, and his own father.By contrast, the more familiar Evelyn recedes, and we see him more as one integrating his father, Arthur, into such works as \\"A Handful of Dust\\" so memorably. Evelyn's more personally presented to us, and less of his works or public life, such as it was, gains scrutiny here. The book, for me, gains poignancy in the later years of Evelyn and the maturity of Bron; this allows Alexander more space to consider his own entry then onto this crowded dais of literary predecessors. His emphasis is on the personal side of Evelyn, his grandfather, as he signed to Bron \\"yours affec. E.W.\\"Bron comments on Evelyn after his death that \\"politics bored him. His interest was confined to resentment at seeing his earnings redistributed among people who were judged more worthy to spend them than he.\\" (qtd. 424) This typifies an ethical, yet bitter, sense of withheld fairness amidst what Evelyn lamented as the \\"abominable difficulty of human relations.\\" Bron credited Evelyn's removal of all his teeth without anesthetic as improving his disposition in old age; Evelyn in turn had followed Arthur's venerable example. Such relationships, then obliquely reflected by Bron with Alexander, as had Evelyn & Alec's with Arthur, sets up a hall of mirrors. The later father and son characterize themselves as \\"liberal anarchists,\\" fed up with a notion of prosperity that insists only on materialism and gadgets. (Although I did marvel at Bron's ability \\"without gainful employment\\" at 24 when fathering Alexander \\"near Treviso in Italy at the house of a one-eared Arabist called Dame Freya Stark\\" to \\"employ a daily help, a French maid and a maternity nurse.\\" (422-23) Money did seem to afford handsome estates, lengthy trips abroad, boarding schools and Oxford, and lots of fine wine on what appeared to me vanishingly little visible means of income. This may be my American sensibility, unaccustomed to how the other half lives.Alexander on Bron: \\"He, too, used his writing to free himself from the irritations of life and the problems of human existence.\\" (430) The whole refusal to kow-tow to the demands of children, while delighting in the pursuit of one's own selfish pursuits, certainly runs against the prevailing philosophy of our age. Somehow, the Waughs managed to produce the children they deserved, I suppose. This all reminds me of an observation by Borges: both mirrors and procreation are abominable, for they reproduce the human figure without reason.Bron emerges as a match for Evelyn when it comes to insight beyond the family's eccentricities and social shenanigans. As Evelyn became discouraged by the post-Vatican II Church, so did his son. After attending services that Bron realized \\"would be completely unrecognisable to him, that the new religion had nothing whatever to do with the church to which he had pledged his loyalty,\\" Bron \\"felt I could distance myself.\\" Wisdom follows: \\"Whatever central trut survives lies outside the modern church, buried in the historical awareness of individual members. Or so it seems to me. But whenever I have doubts, it is my father's fury rather than divine retribution which I dread.\\" (435)Bron's son follows suit. He titles a recent book \\"God,\\" yet asserts that the loss of a True Faith (as Evelyn famously displayed) may be simply proof that the zeal of the convert's rarely hereditary. Decline & Fall repeats each generation on the Waugh's domestic stage. \\"The English show their hatred for children by dressing them in anoraks and romper suits, stuffing them with sweets, refusing to talk to them and sending them out of doors whenever possible in the pathetic hope that someone will murder them.\\" (qtd. 437) The clumsy love of father for son, and the half-shameful, half-affectionate fumble of emotions, moves through many letters quoted here, if to often unintentionally comic rather than the usually desired risible or denunciatory effects.A couple of examples must suffice. Arthur wrote to teenaged Alec off at school, in May, 1914 about the sin of self-abuse. \\"It is an awful thought that someday you might take to a poor girl's arms a body that will avenge its own indulgences upon children yet unborn.\\" The letter goes on, by the way, for probably over fifteen hundred words, and is printed in its entirety. I do doubt the assertions in one footnote Alexander adds, however, so I must append it too for the sake of transparency: \\"Masturbation was not considered unhealthy until 1710 when John Martens, a quack doctor and pornographer, proclaimed it as such in a book called &lt;em>Onania&lt;/em>. Marten's fortune derived from the medicine sold in conjunction with his book. The Church did not consider masturbation a sin, or indeed link it to Onan's behaviour in Genesis, until after the publication of &lt;em>Onania&lt;/em>.\\" (63) Certainly a topic needing hands-on research?There's much of this sort of skewed erudition here from all Wavian contributors. I leave to you to burrow out the derivation of Crutwellism, to hearsay regarding Oxonian \\"dog sodomy,\\" Evelyn's providing rabbits with a deadly glass of Christmas cheer, and his wife Laura's fate when she fails to get rid of rotten fruit. You'll find which Waugh died with a turd near his corpse, which one provided inspiration for both Island Records and the cocktail party, which one became Colonel Gaddafi's favorite author, and which one was depicted in a moralizing portrait, \\"Dr Waugh and the Perverse Pupil.\\" Not to forget such sentences as this, concerning \\"an ethnic guitar\\" which Alexander's brother Nat brings back from South America \\"as a present for his mother-in-law\\" that \\"contained chagas larvae, which hatched unto beetles, crawled out of the instrument, killed the dog and rendered his mother-in-law insane.\\" (443)"},{"Title":"Fathers & Sons","review":"Boy, what a tangled bunch of father/son relationships! Alexander Waugh slices and dices the family tree with great wit and insight. It sure is an indictment of British \\"public\\" schools. Nasty, brutish, (and short?) indeed! This book is a pleasure to read, too, just for the wonderful use of the language."},{"Title":"American Adventures: True Stories from America's Past, 1770-1870","review":"I am enjoying reading these stories aloud to my children. They each contain very interesting and sometimes not well known facts, which contribute to the enjoyment of the story.At the conclusion of each adventure, there are activities one can engage in: writing/journal, independent activities, and group discussions/activities. There is aslo a mini time line included with each story, as well as a paragraph describing what else was happening at the time.I believe the kids get more out of the stories when we read and discuss them together, as opposed to giving them a chapter to read individually."},{"Title":"American Adventures: True Stories from America's Past, 1770-1870","review":"This was a great book of 15 different and exciting stories about America's past, prior to 1870.

As with all of Leon's Uppity books, this one is another winner! I loved it. History teachers ought to use this book, as the writing is sassy and never dull or dry."},{"Title":"Outrageous Women of the Renaissance","review":"Leon's books make terrific gifts...I've sent them to friends for birthdays, just for fun and get well gifts. The author's research and way with words never ceases to amaze me! And what a sense of history.... she makes you love the past and spirit of those indominable and sometimes wicked women!"},{"Title":"Outrageous Women of the Renaissance","review":"This book is, along with the rest in the series, very funny and informative. Tells about many women considered outrageous by Rennaissance terms. Complete with hilarious black and white illustrations for younger readers."},{"Title":"Outrageous Women of the Renaissance","review":"I had a whole mess of Vicki Leon's books in my library. Then, in September 2004 Hurricane Ivan washed away my house, and my beloved library. (I don't miss the old house but I still miss my library and my shoes.) I loved Vicki's books so much, the Uppity Women series especially, that I finally got around to buying them all AGAIN. As a professional motivational speaker and trainer I've pulled stories from Vicki's books into presentations for women's conferences. Though her books are about women of the past the lessons learned relate to today. If you need inspiration and a laugh grab any one of Vicki Leon's books. \\"Outrageous Women of the Renaissance\\" by Vicki Le&oacute;n happens to be one of my favorites."},{"Title":"Religions, values, and peak-experiences (Vilking compass book)","review":"Written near the end of his life, Dr. Maslow sought to leave threads for others to pick up and develop. He disturbed those who prefer the logic-tight barriers between science and religion, and boldly suggests that his \\"most important finding\\" was his discovery of what he termed \\"being values,\\" or metavalues. This, his lost discovery, has been virtually ignored by psychologists and religionists. Yet, this insight is pivotal to understanding Dr. Maslow's belief that human nature has been sold short. He discovered metavalues to be active agents that configure the personalities of self-actualizing individuals. He pointed out that Truth, Beauty and Goodness are expressed in the lives of all self-actualizing personalities. Without these metavalues, the qualities of devotion and passion toward a cause or mission can become lethal to humankind. Science without higher values often creates better weapons of distruction and even more efficient gas chambers. Those who observe that much of what Maslow says in this book is colored by religion and philosophy are correct. His intention was to break down the arbitrary barriers between disciplines. Along with \\"The Psychology of Science\\" ad his posthumous: \\"The Farther Reaches of Human Nature\\" this book is of landmark importance to the 21st century."},{"Title":"Religions, values, and peak-experiences (Vilking compass book)","review":"Abraham Maslow (1908-1970) was an American psychologist best known for his conceptualization of a \\"hierarchy of human needs\\" and \\"self-actualization.\\" He (along with Carl Rogers) is considered the founder of humanistic or \\"Third Force\\" psychology.He states in the Preface to the 1970 edition, \\"Since this book was first written, there has been much turmoil in the world and, therefore, much to learn. Several of the lessons I have learned are relevant here, certainly in the sense that they are helpful supplements to the main thesis of the book... Organized Religion, the churches, finally may become the major enemies of the religious experience and the religious experiencer. This is a main thesis of this book.\\" He adds, \\"I now consider that the book was too imbalanced toward the individualistic and too hard on groups, organizations, and communities. Even within these last six or seven years we have learned not to think of organizations as necessarily bureaucratic... If I were to summarize both the book and my remarks in this Preface in a few words, I would say it this way: Man has a higher and transcendent nature, and this is part of his essence, i.e., his biological nature as a member of a species which has evolved.\\"Here are a few quotations from the book:\\"The high religions... tends to rest ... its right to exist on the codification and the communication of this original mystic experience or revelation from the lonely prophet to the mass of human beings in general. But it has recently begun to appear that these 'revelations' or mystical illuminations can be subsumed under the head of the 'peak experiences' or 'ecstasies' or 'transcendent' experiences which are now being eagerly investigated by many psychologists.\\" (Ch. III)\\"(A)ny doctrine of the innate depravity of man or any maligning of his animal nature very easily leads to some extra-human interpretation of goodness, saintliness, virtue, self-sacrifice, altruism, etc. If they can't be explained from within human nature---and explained they must be---they they must be explained from outside of human nature.\\" (Ch. V)\\"We must remember, after all, that all these happenings are in truth mysteries. Even though they happen a million times, they are still mysteries. If we lose our sense of the mysterious, or the numinous, if we lose our sense of awe, of humility, of being struck dumb, if we lose our sense of good fortune, then we have lost a very real and basic human capacity and are diminished thereby.\\" (Appendix I)"},{"Title":"Religions, values, and peak-experiences (Vilking compass book)","review":"Maslow makes a good distinction between the peakers and the non-peakers and makes an excellent connection between this and organized religion. His use of the term \\"non-peakers\\" is not to refer to people who do not have peak experiences, for he believes that every one has peak experiences but he uses this terminology to refer to a person who is afraid of peak experiences The purpose of organized religion for him is to communicate peak experiences to non-peakers. His position tend to advance personal revelation over dogmatic revelations. The question he leaves unanswered is how personal revelations can be verified or validated? I believe organized religion will help in confirming peak experiences. If not, what most people might call peak experiences might just be neurosis.He also advances a religious pluralism that will accommodate every person, both the atheist and the believer. Maslow gives us good insights into peak experiences and helps us to appreciate more these experiences. His book is interesting to read and easy to follow. I enjoyed reading the book."},{"Title":"Religions, values, and peak-experiences (Vilking compass book)","review":"This book of Maslow's is way underrated! Though a child of the 60's I just discovered this book a week ago.The book touches on many important life themes. It explains why so many people can not swallow organized religions, which in turn explains why so many people describe themselves as atheists. At the same time, it explains the commonality of values shared by most people and makes an important case as to why such universal values should be taught in schools. There are also implications about child-rearing practices and how it is done best. The book also shows why the mystics in any religion struggle with the administrators and clerics (and visa versus). The struggles and causes of struggles between men and women are also examined.

IT was life transforming, much like an after death experience... The energy, comprehending everything about the universe, and most of all telepathic communication with a higher power. I thought I went completely mad, but finding this book a month after it happened was a miracle in itself. I found a lot of assurance in Maslows book. It happens and more frequently than you would think (and I am not mad!!!). Maslow mentioned 'peak experiences' happen during child birth and listening to classical music which I have a hard time with, but who am I to disagree? The odd thing about my peak experience is that my life improved greatly after it occurred. The sad thing is that 8 months after it happened my fiancee was killed in a traffic accident. In everyway that peak experience kept me alive. A simple knowledge that 'things happen for a reason -even though we may never comprehend it'. There is a downside to peak experiences which Maslow didn't discuss. That is the obligation one feels after it happens. I really identify with the character John Travolta played in the movie &quot;Phenomenon&quot;. Why did it happen to me? What am I to do with this knowledge? I hate it.

Another source reported that his Security Officer advised him: \\"You have seen nothing, heard nothing, and you sure as s*** can sign nothing!\\" when Stringfield asked him to sign an affidavit about a 1953 incident. Another case involves an Air Force gunner who took UFO photos, then was interrogated from 2am until 10am by military personnel who swore him to silence. Another source claims that UFOs seemed to have helped influence Israeli forces during the 1967 Arab-Israeli war. Stringfield says he was advised not to mention the retrieval by the USA of a UFO that had crashed in Mexico during his 1978 MUFON speech. There's more on Roswell. With regard to reports that it had been a Skyhook balloon, in an Oct 1979 telephone conversation with Stringfield, Marcel states, \\"The material I gathered did not resemble anything off a balloon. A balloon of any kind could not have exploded and spread its debris over such a broad area.\\" There is a brief mention of an unspecified alien autopsy; \\"pliable, stretchable skin, over smooth muscles; no perspiration or loss of liquid through the skin and no body odor.\\" Stringfield includes his correspondence with Barry Goldwater (\\"It is still classified above Top Secret\\", \\"We both know about the rumors\\") and mentions that a source claimed that Goldwater's visit to Wright-Patterson \\"caused quite a fiasco among ranking personnel\\". He also includes some letters from Frank Scully from 1954 regarding the identity of \\"Dr. Gee\\" and of how he was gathering material for a follow-up book to be titled This Side of Saucers, which promised to be more sensational than Behind the Flying Saucers. Scully also said that he had been very ill for some months. Other news: a human-alien western-style shoot out in 1977 near Lumberton, Ohio. Stringfield reports that following an initial contact, his sources most often become silent, \\"a silence rooted in fears of reprisal or ridicule or a desire for privacy, or all three combined\\". This fascinating report concludes with some sketches of the aliens, based on eyewitness reports."},{"Title":"It's Not Easy Being a Bunny (Beginner Books(R))","review":"Poor P.J.

It takes some careful reading for the lay person because it explains in some detail how and why certain tests are performed and included in the diagnositic process. This book is very helpful for the person who has a probable or definite diagnosis of MS and has an inquiring mind. ~MP"},{"Title":"Multiple Sclerosis-Questions and Answers (Questions & Answers S.)","review":"+++++This is a concise but comprehensive book by consultant Neurologist Dr. David Barnes that gives crucial information about the disease Multiple Sclerosis (MS). Barnes states the aim of his book:\\"To provide a brief outline of the nature of MS and how it is likely to affect individuals both short- and long-term, a rational approach to its diagnosis, and an overview of symptomatic and other management strategies.\\"Who is this book meant for? Again, Barnes answers:\\"Family and General Practitioners, residents, junior neurologists, interns, medical students, and carers with a specific interest, as well as informed patients.\\"In my case, I'm just a person who wanted to know more about MS and this book definitely delivered.Each of these book's chapters is headed with what constitutes the chapter. Then a series of questions that relate to the heading act as sub-headings. (Note that some chapter headings are posed as questions.) It is the answering of these questions that make up the main narrative of each chapter. For example, one chapter is laid out as follows:The diagnosis of Multiple Sclerosis (chapter heading or title)1. What are the principles involved in making a diagnosis of MS? (sub-heading or sub-title)2. What investigations might be helpful? (sub-heading)3. What other tests might be needed? (sub-heading)Having this book structured in this way makes it very easy to read since you are given a concise but adequate answer to each question. As well, you can pick and choose which questions you want to have answered.The other chapter heading are as follows: (1) Definition and historical aspects (2) Epidemiology and etiology (3) The pathological evolution of the lesion (4) The role of MRI in MS (5) The clinical patterns of MS (6) The clinical manifestations of MS (7) The prognosis of clinically isolated syndromes and MS (8) What can be done about the symptoms of MS? (9) What is the value of steroids in MS? (10) Can anything make a difference to the natural history of MS?More than fifty questions are answered with respect to MS.There are photographs or diagrams or tables or graphs that accompany some answers. I found all of these interesting.Finally, the only problem some readers may have is that there is some technical terminology. Barnes does not stop and define and explain each term. Actually, this is a good thing because if he did, this book would easily be five or more times greater in length. Thus, I would recommend having access to a basic medical dictionary when reading this book.In conclusion, this is the book to get if you want your questions about Multiple Sclerosis adequately answered!!(first published 2000; forward; introduction; 11 chapters; main narrative 115 pages; references)+++++"},{"Title":"Foamy Sky: The Major Poems of Miklos Radnoti (Lockert Library of Poetry in Translation)","review":"Radnoti was one of the great twentieth century poets. This would be true even if his story was not one of great poignancy and sadness. He wrote his last poems on a forced march during the Shoah (Holocaust) and ended his life shot into a mass grave with those final, brilliant poems in his pocket. They were discovered when he was exhumed and reburied after the war. These translations capture his music in English. I have found them to be indispensable to me. Besides their great beauty, they say something important about the human spirit. This man defined himself as a poet and refused to let others define him, in the worst possible circumstances. This is an inspiration to us all."},{"Title":"Changing the Bully Who Rules the World: Reading and Thinking aAbout Ethics","review":"Rarely do we find books which change our lives. This one didn't hit me like a ton of bricks nor did it give me the false charge received from supposed motivational material. However, as I read and thought about Ms. Bly's essays, I found that a slow fire was catching in my mind. Reading this book was the best educational experience I've had in ages. Its been about 2 weeks since I finished reading it, but I find so much of it coming back as food for thought. And it has become one of those books which I like to keep close at hand in order to pick up, browse, re-read. I consider myself well-educated but the issues which Ms. Bly discusses here were rarely raised in my school work (which includes the attainment of a post-graduate degree). There is a need for books like this which call attention to the the large hole in our social fiber and go the extra step toward helping us make ourselves more complete. Ms. Bly does wonderful work. She makes me want to improve my ability to consider where I am, what life can be, and how I can attend to the information around me and integrate it into a proper outlook -- one which is more widely focused, concerned with getting behind the surface of things. I recommend this book highly to anyone interested in living more awarely and in need of the guidance to start in that direction."},{"Title":"Changing the Bully Who Rules the World: Reading and Thinking aAbout Ethics","review":"Changing the Bully Who Rules the World uses modern literature to help explain bully behavior. It is a very readable and thought provoking book. It explains in layman terms what moral stage development is and how each of us can use partializing in our conversations with others to promote improved ethics. The most heartening disclosure is that we can all improve ethical behavior. Even at adulthood, we are not locked into a lower level of stage development. With encouragement and using proven techniques everyone can improve.It is an encouraging and very accessible book that will give you hope and understanding of how we can improve the world."},{"Title":"Changing the Bully Who Rules the World: Reading and Thinking aAbout Ethics","review":"Carol Bly takes an engaging, &quot;great books&quot; approach to exploring the ethical quagmires that dot our modern landscape. Her chapter on the moral blunders well-meaning people make in groups is as relevant to my work with a nonprofit board as it is to my husband's army career. Cheers for Bly's clear writing style and combination of literature and social thought (particularly the well-chosen appendices!)"},{"Title":"God of the Golden Fleece (Book of the Gods)","review":"Following a deadly battle between the Gods and the Giants, a shipwrecked Proteus barely manages to reach a nearby beach but has lost his memory. Already on the shore are Jason and the Argonauts preparing to continue sailing in order to take the Golden Fleece from King Aeetes. Proteus decides to join the quest and performs feats beyond that of the heroes of the Argo.As Proteus begins to regains pieces of his memory, he concludes that King Pelias hired him to kill Jason. However, his time amidst the Argonauts, especially the brave leader makes him realize he cannot do this task and instead becomes an intrepid and loyal member of the crew. After fleecing Aeetes and other adventures, the Argonauts land on the enchantress Circe's island where Proteus not only learns more about himself and the truth, but plans to do something about it, that is if he lives long enough to do so.This retelling of the Greek epic Jason and the Argonauts is a well-written fantasy tale that keeps reader attention throughout the book. The story line is fast-paced and filled with action though much is seen through the eyes of the mysterious and bewildered Proteus as opposed to Jason, Hercules, and some of the other mythical heroes. Highly regarded Fred Saberhagen, in his fourth &#65533;BOOK OF THE GODS&#65533; novel, is not quite on the level of the mythological classic or the Ray Harryhausen animated enhanced movie, but will provide the author&#65533;s myriad of fans with an entertaining story.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"God of the Golden Fleece (Book of the Gods)","review":"One of 5 books which have taken the classical Greek myths and updated them with a sci-fi hook. When are the stories in the books taking place? Before the classical Earth-centric Greek period? Or, sometime way, way, way after our civilization has passed? Saberhagen drops a hint or two (use of word &quot;bio-computer) which may or may not lead one astray. But the good storytelling and stories stand by themselves. If anyone has a copy of Robert Graves 1955 (or later re-issue) The Greek Myths, it's a wonderful co-read. Unfortunately, word from the Saberhagen web-site indicates the publisher, Tor Books, is not interested in continuing the series. Maybe we, the readers, should let Tor know that WE ARE interested in the series being continued. I, for one, want to know more about the background and future of this new mythological world."},{"Title":"God of the Golden Fleece (Book of the Gods)","review":"This is a good book with a non-typical ending.

There she meets indigenous shamans, keepers of the secrets of the medicinal plants of the rainforest, and discovers that the key to healing is more than the pharmacological properties of the plants. Profoundly stirred by the spiritual energies awakened in her by the shamans she encounters, her science background fails to explain her emotional, physical and spiritual crises, nor does it offer her total healing.Readers will relate to the author's life situations; who among us hasn't had a health challenge (in the author's case, cancer), a marriage gone awry, a job that doesn't fit, or a life that feels parched and devoid of inspiration? Not everyone will seek healing in the same way as the author, but her pursuit of clarity, purpose, and health is a universal human story, told with honesty, insight, and humor.Jungle Medicine isn't an academic treatise on indigenous tribes, ethnobotany, shamanism, or ayahuasca, (the spiritual plant medicine used by South American shamans), although all of those topics flow throughout the story. Instead, the author's lush, sensual descriptions of the daily life-and-death dramas of the jungle, her ability to write of plant medicine pharmacology in a way a layperson can understand, and the information she provides about the natural medicinal riches of the rainforest, (increasingly endangered due to slash-and-burn agriculture and petroleum exploration), takes the reader on an exciting, tactile journey to the heart and lungs of the planet, the Amazonian jungle. More than a memoir of spiritual emergence and physical healing, Jungle Medicine is a call to action to all of us, to walk in tempo with the song of our life's purpose, to respect Nature's bounty, to make spiritual healing equally as important as our Western medical technology, and to act now to save the irreplaceable pharmacy that is the Amazonian rainforest."},{"Title":"Jungle Medicine","review":"Connie Grauds is an unusual person. She has apprenticed herself to a Peruvian shaman, Don Antonio and learned shamanic herbal treatments - in addition to being a conventionally trained western pharmacist.Grauds points out that herbal remedies contribute significantly to our western pharmacopoeia.\\"120 clinically useful prescription drugs worldwide are derived from plants, around 39% of which are used in the U.S. And 47 of these 120 drugs are derived from plants native to the tropical rainforests.\\" (p. 17).Grauds describes one of the remedies that Don Antonio uses.\\" \\"Sangre de grado... Dragon's blood...\\" Don Antonio wiped some of the red sap from the tree and rubbed it vigorously on the back of his hand till it formed a white paste. He told us that he used sangre de grado orally to treat diarrhea, and topically to heal wounds, that it both stops bleeding and disinfects the wound. \\"It's the rainforest's mercurochrome,\\" said Charles, adding that scientific research on sangre de grado had shown it to be effective in treating a variety of ailments.\\" (p. 48).While Grauds spontaneously developed strong intuitive awarenesses of plants prior to studying with Don Antonio, she had no idea what to make of these. It was only as she observed her teacher communicating with the plants in order to identify which of them would be appropriate for treating various problems that she came to understand her gift.Even more important, she came to understand the spiritual component of healing that markedly augments the effects of herbal remedies.As she advanced in her knowledge of plant lore and treatments, she learned to work with the remedies more deeply.This is a delightful, insightful, healing book, warmly recommended to anyone interested in shamanism and particularly in shamanic herbal remedies."},{"Title":"Jungle Medicine","review":"Jungle Medicine is a marvelous story of radical personal transformation and luminous jungle magic. If you've ever wondered what learning from a genuine shaman is like, or what it's like to give up everything you thought was real and then finally understand true healing, then you will love this book. It touched my soul."},{"Title":"Jungle Medicine","review":"Follow a western trained pharmacist through her personal discovery that nature really is alive. Connie has a wonderful writing style that waxes poetic at times. She is able to beautifully illustrate her experiences. Her time and mystical events with the shaman Don Antonio are brilliant. A must read for anyone interested in mystical natural healing."},{"Title":"Jungle Medicine","review":"Very rarely does a book come along that successfully interweaves multiple dimensions. Connie Grauds as a professional pharmacist reveals to us many of the jungle's medical secrets. As a shamana of the Amazon tradtion she challenges the reader to view the jungle's gifts in a spirited fashion. \\"Jungle Medicine\\" is a book that you will want to read time and time again as you continue life's journey. - Peter Christian, Clincal Social Worker"},{"Title":"Jungle Medicine","review":"A great read. A quick one also! If you are interested in shamanism, healing, western meets traditional medicine, the jungle, adventures, or all of the above, this book is for you. Grauds writes this book from a perspective that many of us can relate to, and takes us to a relm that few of us have ever imagined!"},{"Title":"Jungle Medicine","review":"Jungle Medicine does the trick for those readers looking to discover more about the shamanic journey and the use of medicinal plants by a shaman. The book is easy to read, but you won't want to skip a word. Enticing, evocative, spiritual. It will stay on the top shelf of my bookshelf."},{"Title":"Jungle Medicine","review":"This is a great book! Grauds recounts her personal transformation from a being a purely western-medicine-oriented pharmacist to becoming a shaman's apprentice deep in the Amazon jungle. The story is a page-turner and the truths Grauds realizes about healing, spirit, and medicine are profound. If you're thirsting to connect or reconnect with that mysterious life force that's so much larger than ourselves, this book is an inspiration. It's utterly believable and extremely thought-provoking. And a totally engrossing story! Tops."},{"Title":"Jungle Medicine","review":"This is a great book to give to any left-brained person who might be interested in healing -- like your doctor! Often dry, occasionally repetitive, the mystery and spiritual medicine slips in nonetheless.Connie Grauds strikes me as being a very fine person and the perfect one to write a book about shamans in the Amazon -- that is, if the book is directed to the conditioned \\"scientific\\" thinker. However, for someone like me, who is comfortable in her right brain openness, the book held far too little information about actual healing and far too few healing stories.There were absolutely no personalities depicted, not even about don Antonio, her teacher. We get very little sense of the man, as we do also of her two friends, Marcie and Kay. Emotion appears hardly at all. Discretion is all very well, but it makes for a very cold read when you are striving for connection and understanding.Okay, so the book wasn't a big fat reality fairytale, and the mysticism was kept to a minimum. I still enjoyed reading it. If you have gone down that path of shamanic discovery, this book will hold little of interest to you. But if it's all new and you are fighting with your doctor about your medication, or if you have doubts about it or your physical condition, then this is the book to start with. You will trust it -- and if you give it to your healthcare professional, they will, too."},{"Title":"Jungle Medicine","review":"This was a fantastic story of a woman who learned about the spiritual side of medicine and managed to incorporate it into modern western medical practice. I expected to learn more about spiritual medicine, but instead I entered an incredible journey into the Amazon."},{"Title":"Jungle Medicine","review":"I was very excited to read this book, but I found it less about the subject of healing and more about the transformative experience of the author. I had wished, especially, for some resolution around the healings of the author's two friends who endured a week of treatment in the Amazon. After their healings, they were never mentioned again. I was disappointed."},{"Title":"Dont Forget to Come Back","review":"In this story a little girl is upset because her parents are going out for the night and are leaving her home with a babysitter. She tries all different types of ways to convince her parents to stay home with her. Since they are not going to stay home with her she gives them three rules to follow and one of them is to not to forget to come back!I think this is a story a lot of children will be able to relate to. A lot of kids dread staying home with a babysitter while their parents go out for the night. The fear of missing out on something, or just being without their parents is hard on them. This book does a real nice portrayal of these feelings. When the parents leave the girl in the story ends up having so much fun with the babysitter that time flies. Even if the reader was never left at home, even if they were just dropped off at daycare or a relative's house, they would be able to understand that unwanted separation from their parents.The pictures and the text bubbles will apple to children. It is a chance for them to see another child's emotions about a situation they can understand. Seeing that they aren't the only ones that feel this way is a good thing for young people to understand. The young reader could also be encouraged that even when their parents go out for the night that their parents do love them and won't forget to come back."},{"Title":"Dont Forget to Come Back","review":"Having trouble getting your kids to stay with a babysitter? This book is for you. I got this book as a gift when I was a kid and 20 years later, I still own it. It's just one of those books I can't part with.The book is about a young girl and her parents. The parents are planning a night out and are going to leave the girl with Bob, the babysitter. The book leads up to the girl's fears of being with a sitter, however in the end, she ends up having a great time with Bob.I wish more parents knew about this book. It's creative, imaginative and a favorite book you're kids will have for many, many, years."},{"Title":"Beginner's Arabic Script: An Introduction to Reading and Writing Arabic","review":"I am in the process of learning a bit of Arabic so I picked this up. I read through once tracing characters with my fingers and got through it in a few hours. I decided to go back with a pen and actually follow the directions (e.g. \\"read and write\\" followed by 12 or so vocabulary words), actually do the exercises, and actually do the tests at the end of each unit. I'm finding it takes about an hour per unit and I'm learning a lot more by actually doing this.Once I'm done with that, I intend to do it all over again with the handwritten versions of the letters.However, I wish the writing were a bit larger and there were more hints for how to write the characters and get them right. For example, I still don't the proper way to make a mim that is connected to the letters on either side and there is no information on the order to write letters in. Do I make all the toothed character lines and fill in the dots later? Or make the dots on each tooth? Since my goal is just to read (probably the real goal of the book anyway), it's not too important to me, but I still feel it's a bit of a deficiency.Still, I am very happy with my choice to pick this book up. I'm spending hours upon hours with it, and my hand is getting sore. I can see my progress, and actually completing each exercise with a pen (not just tracing with my finger) is proving to really drive the writing system home."},{"Title":"Beginner's Arabic Script: An Introduction to Reading and Writing Arabic","review":"Arabic script is not that easy, and is a fully cursive script which means there is no easy way.This is not my first study of the script, as I've studied the Persian script in the Nastaliq style (which is more complex), so this was relatively easy to use, given my prior knowledge and the simplicity of the sript used by Arabic.

Teach Yourself remembered this when they printed &quot;Teach Yourself: Hindi script&quot;. Their is little need to remember words, commiting the letters to memory is enough. This book is different though, it gives one alot to absorb, like 30 words per unit and grammer. If a person plans on making inroads to the language though, they must know the letters by heart before doing anything else.Arabic as an alphabet isn't to hard to remember, but it is quite confusing in spelling, and for a beginner this does not help any when you have words piled on. It should be noted though the Author does make it so one does understand the language better, I am no expert on Arabic, but I do know alot more then I had thought about knowing. Although it tries to teach you signs, it ends up building your vocabulary up to inclue quite a few nouns and very few other words. On the whole though, this book isn't bad though."},{"Title":"Beginner's Arabic Script: An Introduction to Reading and Writing Arabic","review":"Learning Arabic presents several diffculties for the non-native, the first of which is the alphabet, or more accurately, script. This is because, unlike English and other European languages, there is no true printed form for the language, being a true script. The main problem with it is that the letters change their form depending on the context.At 155 pages, this is almost a mini-course on Arabic, not just on the script, but the overall focus is on teaching you the script, and for that it serves very well. But for someone who doesn't want to have a lot of extra vocabulary or grammar piled on initially, I would recommend the Nicholas Awde and Putros Samano book, The Arabic Alphabet, instead.I have a slight personal preference for that book over this one, as it focuses more on the script and doesn't worry about the more advanced grammatical topics, which really require a separate volume. As a result, it's shorter and to the point and is only 100 pages long. But both books are excellent and do their job very well. I just think this one would better suited someone who enjoys learning languages and already has skills or training in that area.If that sounds like you, then this book will give you a little more basic Arabic vocabulary and grammar in the process of teaching you the script than the Awde book, and the author does a fine job of explaining all the concepts clearly and concisely. There are sections on verbs, nouns, adjectives, pronouns, and how they are formed, as well as other aspects of the grammar.The author also discusses basic phonetics and phonology, and how the vowels and consonants of Arabic differ from English. One odd aspect of the phonetic notation is the number \\"9\\" is used for the Arabic glottal stop. I've seen this in one other Arabic beginner's book. It's not standard notation but it's okay for a beginner's book, as long as you know what it means. The author defines it, but I missed that somehow and kept seeing these 9's all over the place, and I finally figured out what it was.As both books point out, the main problem in learning the Arabic script is the letters change their form depending on their position in the word, in other words, on whether they're at the beginning, middle, or end of the word. Then there is the infamous \\"Hamzah,\\" or diacritical mark, which can appear over various letters in the word, and can float around a lot. The rules for this get very complicated, and most Arabic speakers don't even know all of them, but the basic principles aren't hard to learn. This makes it very similar in English to the apostrophe, which causes problems for English speakers also. Just these two things can make the alphabet a trying experience to learn initially for the foreign-language speaker.Both the Awde and Samanos or this book are excellent and will help you clear that initial hurdle of learning the alphabet that must be overcome before you can really embark on a serious study of Arabic grammar and language. If you're flush I'd say buy both books, since they complement and reinforce each other, and they're not that expensive to begin with.Despite the difficulty with the alphabet/script, Arabic has very regular verb constructions, and dictionaries in fact can refer to them by numbers I-X. The three cases Arabic posseses, the nominative, accusative, and jussive, are really no longer used in actual conservation, and you're only likely to find them in scholarly discourse or in the Koran. This makes the case system no more complex than Spanish or English or French, which is a big help there. In contrast, Russian still has six cases and German technically has four.Overall, a fine beginner's book that is almost an essential supplement to any course in Arabic, especially if you're going the self-study route (as I am)."},{"Title":"Beginner's Arabic Script: An Introduction to Reading and Writing Arabic","review":"This is one of the excellent &quot;Teach Yourself&quot; series. I have tried to learn Arabic on my own using various sources and this is by far the best I have come across. Divided into 15 units, John Mace introduces the student to the alphabet in easy stages rather than the whole alphabet at once (which can be a little daunting)and adds a little grammar in each unit. This is very encouraging to the complete beginner and there are lots of exercises and tests at the end of each unit to re-inforce what you have learnt. Each unit stretches the student a little more but if you concentrate and do all the exercises it is more than manageable. However, the best thing about this book is that Mr Mace teaches you how to hand write Arabic. I spent a whole year once writing beatiful Arabic script as I saw it printed, not realising that it wasn't hand written that way. All the vocabulary used in the book is included in a useful Arabic-English and English-Arabic dictionary. I cannot recommend this book too highly."},{"Title":"Beginner's Arabic Script: An Introduction to Reading and Writing Arabic","review":"My Arabic studies have been placed on hold while I go back to college (prepping [hopefully] for a MA in linguistics). I was using this along with \\"The Arabic Alphabet\\" (by Awde and Samano). Personally, I'm finding it easier to go through the other book first, as Awde and Samano's book is very concise, and gives stroke direction. This book is useful, but the script (printed and handwritten) is very small, and the handwriting is a bit \\"simplified\\" and \\"spartan\\". The handwriting in the book is true to form for \\"real\\" Arabic handwriting. However, being an introductory book, I think the author should have made the print larger, and given large, clear examples for the student.Another critique is that the author rarely uses vowels. The author does this because someone going to an Arabic-speaking nation or picking up an Arabic newspaper will never see these (except on foreign names). He does not want to make the student dependant on these. However, from my experience, learning the pronunciation of the vocabulary was much easier if I could add in the vowels, and so I was able to learn words much faster.The information seemed very good, but was quite basic. This is NOT a guide to speaking Arabic. It's goal is to familiarize the student enough to read common signs and warnings, tickets and schedules, bills and checks, and as the author puts it, \\"read a headline and get enough from the article to know what's going on.\\" It's an introductory book, and as that, it serves its function well. It is also a good resource for understanding handwriting, which, as stated earlier, is a very \\"simplified and spartan\\" version of the formal script."},{"Title":"Beginner's Arabic Script: An Introduction to Reading and Writing Arabic","review":"Packed with examples, this book doesn't just present the Arabic alphabet, but it treats basic declarative sentences as well. Mace shows you how to write the script and provides examples of handwritten Arabic, presumably his own, with every word. One problem is he doesn't vowelize the words, which can make them somewhat hard to learn. True, unvowelized Arabic is the norm in newspapers and street signs, if not in the Koran, but beginners might want a more phonics-based approach to writing. Furthermore, Mace tends to use a kind of shorthand script when writing: the teeth of \\"s\\" and \\"sh\\" are smoothed out, the three dots over printed \\"sh\\" are represented as a circumflex, and the two dots over \\"t\\" and under \\"y\\" are represented as a short horizontal bar. Apparently, this way of writing is done by many, but such an overly cursive style would indicate that it's the way to write if you're already bored with Arabic, not if you're just starting out! Unless you're very confident, I would recommend Awde's \\"The Arabic Alphabet\\" instead. As for the Mace book, I got jammed at about page 30 and never went back."},{"Title":"Beginner's Arabic Script: An Introduction to Reading and Writing Arabic","review":"First off, let me say that my opinion of this book as a beginner's tool is slightly tainted. I am fluent in Hebrew, which has a very similar alphabet and a lot of cognates, plus similar rules of grammar. Thus, I think I'm at an advantage when it comes to learning Arabic.That said, I think this is a very solid, if not ambitious, beginner's book. Instead of learning the whole alphabet and then piecing it together, MacE wastes no time getting you to read and write real-world words. And throughout the rest of the book, as you learn plurals, prepositions, possesives, and many other useful rules of grammar and nuances of the Arabic language, MacE teaches you new and useful words and phrases. For example, he puts a lot of emphasis on learning to identify and read common street signs in Arabic (such as &quot;ibil&quot; - camels).As in many languages, Arabic has a printed and handwritten form, and, if you use the book correctly, you'll be able to read and write both (the handwritten form looks impossibly daunting at first - don't worry!). Also very useful is the small Arabic-English and English-Arabic dictionary included in the back. It is by no means comprehensive, but there are many useful everyday-words that might make reading an Arabic newspaper a little easier.Overall, I'd recommend this as a good start. If you plan to spend some time in the Middle East or just need to be able to speak and/or read Arabic, you'll need another more advanced book after this to teach you more about putting together whole sentences and other more advanced topics."},{"Title":"Beginner's Arabic Script: An Introduction to Reading and Writing Arabic","review":"This book offers important features not found in The Arabic Alphabet (by Awde and Samano). It presents the alphabet both as it is printed, and as it is ordinarily written. It provides a reasonable beginning grammar. And it offers an introduction to the grammar. But if you want your handwriting to be calligraphic, then you will be frustrated by the lack of guidance on the formation of such letters. My recommendation is that the reader get both books. But, if the budget provides for only one book on Arabic, then this book is probably to be preferred."},{"Title":"Beginner's Arabic Script: An Introduction to Reading and Writing Arabic","review":"Like most of the other reviewers, I have to say that I am enjoying this little book. It stays true to its title, and focuses on the script, both printed and written. I also have the Awde book, which gives more complete stroke direction, but it's short on actual handwriting. Mace's book is full of examples of real handwriting, which I think is great, especially for those trying to learn without a teacher.I think it's a great idea to introduce rudiments of grammar, so that you're not just stuck on the alphabet all the time. The grammar also helps shed light on the script and pronunciation (e.g., the one-letter prepositions that are tacked onto the start of the words they govern).My only disappointment with the book is that it's full of words like engineer, ministry, passport, permit, representative - not the kind of words typically associated with a learner's book. What about 'table', 'door', 'hand'? Still, I understand that his target audience is people who find themselves in an Arab country, and need to read road signs, newspaper headlines, maybe fill out paperwork. They're likely to be engineers, I guess, so it makes sense. But for those of us who are just curious, it makes it a little more boring.Overall, I've found it useful and engaging."},{"Title":"Beginner's Arabic Script: An Introduction to Reading and Writing Arabic","review":"As was pointed out by another reviewer, Frank Gibbons, the vocabulary is very much geared to a bureaucrat who may travel to an Arabic-speaking country, and need to read road signs, talk to officials, etc. If one needs only to be able to read script this is a good book; it has exercises and self-tests and the units are not too much to absorb in a half-hour, so one can absorb the material in one section without too much trouble and make quick progress.The book also introduces some English/American words spelled phonetically in Arabic, that a traveller or foreign worker might come across.What I would have liked that that I know more would be an index by word roots, with all the derived words under the root. While I know that some older dictionaries are organized like this, and I wouldn't want that exclusively, it seems like it would be a good mnemonic aid while building vocabulary.What I appreciate about this book is that it is clear, well-written and explains about word forms, showing patterns that you can extrapolate from in writing/reading plurals, definite articles, etc."},{"Title":"Beginner's Arabic Script: An Introduction to Reading and Writing Arabic","review":"i've studied a lot of chinese character books and recently picked this one up because i've decided to learn arabic script as well. this is the best beginner's arabic book i've ever seen. in the introduction mace gives you clear tips on memorization that you can apply to anything else you might ever want to learn. the book is only 168 pgs long- but the wealth of information inside is astounding. the book is easy to follow, teaches you pronounciation, and grammer in a very clear manner. i've looked through many of the beginner's arabic books- but this is the only one i decided to purchase."},{"Title":"Beginner's Arabic Script: An Introduction to Reading and Writing Arabic","review":"I am teaching myself arabic.

The book covers the nature of Knowledge, Knowledge based strategies, Knowledge Management (KM) and organizational learning, and tools techniques and processes. They are of a uniformly high standard.This is a very valuable reference resource in what has become a rather incoherent field - with a welter of definitions and perspectives. The Yearbook is a well balanced and well organised guide to navigation to available resources that also contains a very well chosen selection of articles to cover the various aspects of knowledge management.Most of the articles are directed either to clarifying important concepts - for example Karl-Eric Sveiby's article on Tacit Knowledge - or to improving some aspect of practice - for example Charlotte Roberts on 'Can We Talk?', which is concerned with conversational skills. There is a wealth of useful frameworks and tools and some very useful summaries of key concepts such as the transformation that occurs between explicit and tacit knowledge. The emphasis is on human aspects of knowledge management rather than the technological end, but both receive good consideration.In order to test the coverage, I worked through as many relevant themes as I could think of and checked whether I could find something useful on each theme. The only ones I did not find were the relatively new concern with physical design of space to enhance knowledge creation and transfer (an important part of knowledge infrastructure), and discussion of group meeting techniques for building shared understanding. That's a pretty good coverage score.Part 5 Knowledge Management References contains:* reviews of significant articles, * a listing of useful internet resources, with brief commentary on the content of each, * a directory of KM organisations * a directory of periodicals dealing with KM * a glossary of terms associated with KM and * a set of quotations (this last no doubt included for the benefit of speakers at the innumerable seminars and workshops on KM!)"},{"Title":"Literacy Instruction in Half- And Whole-Day Kindergarten: Research to Practice (Literacy Studies Series)","review":"Well done and easy to use.

Certainly, the noble Ms. Bird had made this remarkable journey (and many others) in a time (the late 1800s) when 'women didn't do such things'. For that I applaud her spirit and determination.While interesting, in my opinion, most of the book comes across as fairly uninspired. She seems unable to share the sense of wonder one must feel when in the presence of such dramatic physical geography. Her description of the local citizenry is, to my mind, also fairly unimaginative. While her narrative is certainly straight forward and no doubt accurate, it seems she never really 'gets into it'.There are several moments in the story when we are given an insight into Ms. Bird's character and we see her as an enormously resilient and self-reliant person. There are also interesting glimpses of her Victorian roots as portrayed in her comments regarding local Tibetan customs and habits.All in all, I would recommend this book but I would caution the reader not to expect 'Lost Horizons'."},{"Title":"Among the Tibetans (Equestrian Travel Classics)","review":"Isabella Bird was an amazing woman who travelled all over the world for her &#34;health,&#34; establishing hospitals where she could and always writing letters to her sister back in England. The letter were published and, like other women travelers of the late 19th century, she gained an international reputation. Her trip into western Tibet, published in 1894, is not as well known as A lady's Life in the Rocky Mountains, but it is at least the equal of that adventure. Bird traveled with quite a large support group but often she was the only&#34;traveler.&#34; A look at a modern map makes the reader realize that the regions of Kashmir and Tibet she traveled through are still remote. On steep mountain paths they lost some pack animals but Isabella carried on, visiting wandering herdsmen and their families, marveling at the stark landscape, the monasteries and rendering it all in vivid detail. For the contemporary couch potato, her account is so amazing that the reader would be insane to try a similar feat--riding side saddle in a dress. There is a fairly good biography of Bird available, but for the real thing, I recommend her own accounts of her travels in Persia, Japan, Tibet and the Rocky Mountains and points in between."},{"Title":"Among the Tibetans (Equestrian Travel Classics)","review":"This book is good, but only if you approach it with the proper frame of mind. To begin with, there are two things that the reader must remember. The first is that she is writing about a land which no longer exists, and the second is that it is the mindset of the writer which is as interesting as the land she is describing.The fact that there have been many changes since the 19th century need not be elaborated upon. This book is an interesting historical description.But it is the mindset of the writer which I found most interesting. Throughout the entire book she talks about her horse better than she talks about most of the people she encounters. The level of ethnocentricity and cultural insensitivity in the way that she describes all the people she meets is appalling. Curiously she is completely oblivious to this. It is easy to pass this off as being typical of Victorian world views. But I lived for many years in India, and I am afraid to say that even today, this is an all to common mindset among Christian Missionaries."},{"Title":"Among the Tibetans (Equestrian Travel Classics)","review":"First, a minor quibble - the journey does not actually take place in Tibet, but rather in Ladakh (or Little Tibet, as the author refers to it). That matter aside - what an incredible journey - it is just a terrible pity that the author carried so much unwarranted baggage with her - elitism, racism, distaste for anything Moslem-related and a contempt for Buddhism and the Lamas, who treated her with such kindness and high regard during her journey. She could have learned and enjoyed so much more if she had truly opened her eyes. It really does reflect all our worst perceptions of the British-Raj - Ms Bird 'luxuriating' in her massive tent while her servants and 'coolies' were at times required to sleep without cover in the snow.There are wonderful descriptions of this, for us, remote territory - incredible scenery, villages, towns, people and customs. Unfortunately the book is written in a peculiar 'distant' style, as if the author was an observer from afar - Ms Bird never draws us into the adventure or journey, giving a feeling of actually being there. Perhaps the original edition, which presumably carried the many illustrations of which the author speaks, was better able to convey the grandeur and the trials of the very difficult terrain.Still, it is a great period piece and a true eye-opener on the character of Ms Bird, the adventurer, as well as conveying a picture (albeit not fully engaging) of a time and place past."},{"Title":"Among the Tibetans (Equestrian Travel Classics)","review":"Isabella Bird's travel writing is a wonderful look at the world at the turn of the last century.

Judith Duncan's stories are never about sophisticated urban boys and girls but rather about rural people living lives of quiet domesticity. I particularly liked this old title from the late 1980s.Briefly, Susan Lynton works for a government minister in Ottawa as his assistant. Nearly 30, she has had a fairly uneventful life but enjoys her job and has a good working and personal relationship with her boss - a man of her own father's generation. One summer he suggests that she take an extended summer break and travel to rural Alberta to fill in as cook on his nephew's ranch. She is taken with the idea and travels out to take up the job.45 year old Jason Chisholm's wife left him some years ago, leaving him with a huge ranch and four children to bring up. Although all concerned have been marked by their experiences, none are dramatically traumatised and life has been moving on.Much of the story takes place, literally, in the ranch kitchen and Susan learns to cope with feeding a family of hungry kids and the adults who do the hard and unending ranch work. There is much description of the housework, doing the laundry for a large family, gardening, cooking, dressmaking, etc that takes place on an isolated ranch. Although this might sound boring, the author's intimate descriptions of these domestic activities (which most of us, her readers fulfil ourselves) nevertheless make for satisfying reading.Gradually, of course, Jason and Susan fall in love. Susan develops a close relationship with his eldest daughter but, one day the daughter catches them embracing and the girl is unable to handle it. Despite having agreed to marry Jason, Susan feels compelled to leave the ranch.Of course, eventually everyone is reconciled, love wins out and everyone is happy. Indeed, nothing much dramatic happens in this story - its charm lies in the intimacy, domesticity and sheer likeability of all of the main characters.I highly recommend this old title; it's well written, the descriptive narrative is first class and, overall, it's one of Judith Duncan's best."},{"Title":"Legends, Lies, and Cherished Myths of American History","review":"Television news reporter (now there's a credential) Shenkman attempts to debunk some widely-held but erroneous beliefs about American history from Columbus to the present day, covering topics such as sex, family, the so-called good old days, arts and quotations. It's a fine and admirable idea for a book. Unfortunately, this book does not deliver the idea's promise. Shenkman uses nearly no primary sources, relying on modern historians' research. This gives the result that in many instances, his \\"proof\\" of the falsity of one claim is simply another author's claim. Shenkman also has an odd idea of what constitutes American history, often resorting to 17th-century history to refute claims of what \\"American\\" life really is. He also quotes extensively but cites sources sproadically, often lumping a few paragraph's worth of sources together in one footnote. There are one or two nuggets of good stuff in here, like the origin of Paul Bunyan, or some of Harvard's history, but the lack of primary sources and generally non-scholarly approach make this book somewhat interesting at best."},{"Title":"Legends, Lies, and Cherished Myths of American History","review":"This looked like a fascinating premise - debunk all the things we think we know.

Just a lot of random factoids strung together.I'm normally a fan of the factoid books, but I guess I just had mismatched expectations. I expected more from this book.I was also vaguely troubled at a number of points during the book. The author used a lot of weasel words (might, could, may, etc.) when trying to convince us that the conventional understanding of a particular point is wrong. If you know better, say so. If it's a matter still in dispute, that's a little too academic for me to care about.At other points, I found myself challenging his assumptions and sources. The one good thing I can say about this book is that for popular entertainment it was exceptionally well footnoted.

Shenkman acts like an annoying twelve-year old who's memorized 50 state capitals and wants you to listen as he recites them -- and thereby proves how smart he is.Many of the facts he \\"reveals\\" here were things most people would learn from a comptent high-school or college American History class, or else are too irrelevant to be included even there. e.g. pointing out that Paul Revere had two companions, or that Molly Pitcher was not the only woman to fight in the Revolution.Yes, it's true that most people aren't aware that John Paul Jones later served as a mercenary to Catherine the Great ... but what's the point? Are they supposed to know? Does not knowing reflect some sort of failing in their education? Shenkman certainly implies as much.But even more annoying is his habit of attacking myths that nobody really believes. He refers to the \\"firmly held belief that premarital sex is a twentieth-century phenomenon.\\" Firmly held by whom? Shenkman wants to pretend that there are people out there who think that there was no fornication pre-1900, so that he can show how wrong they are (and by contast, how smart and urbane he is). But of course nobody actually thinks this; what they actually think is that it was >less common&lt; in the past than it is now ... which his statistics confirm. Now it probably is true that many people misunderstand or exagerrate how much less common ... but that's a comparatively subtle distinction, and Shenkman doesn't do those.To pick another, he alludes to the (putatively common) \\"belief that Presidents were freqently born poor.\\" Excuse me? I highly doubt anyone out there actually under the misapprehension that the majority of Presidents were raised from poverty. People believe that it is >possible for a poor person to become Head of State, and that that possibility is more real in the US than in other countries.It might be interesting to do a comparative study with, say British PMs or Soviet Politburo members, to see what percentage of them came from comparatively wealthy backgrounds. Alas, that sort of thing is beyond Shenkman. His brilliant idea is to list all the presidents and spin their life stories to make them sound bourgeois: the orphaned Hoover was \\"brought up by his maternal uncle, the head of a local academy;\\" Nixon's father owned a gas station; Eisenhower's mother went to college. Best of all is his pointing out that while Lincoln was poor, he was \\"not as dirt poor as his neighbors.\\"My guess is that Shnekman fancies himself another Howard Zinn, fearlessly deconstructing the bourgeois myths of America. He isn't. Zinn uses facts to make points; he constructs arguments. Some of those facts are slanted, some points are debatable and some of arguments weak, but it is at least the discourse of an educated adult. Shenkman's is not."},{"Title":"Legends, Lies, and Cherished Myths of American History","review":"...but Richard Shenkman tries to give us the critical eye to spot it.

The lists in this book are incomplete, they often contain unproven assertions, and sometimes are a little slipshod. However, no claim is made that these are the final facts, but rather that these are alternate, iconoclastic views that allow you to approach history, not as a sponge to absorb the broad assertions of which teachers are so fond, but as a critically thinking human being ready to separate the wheat from the chaff.

It makes a great politcal story, but is rarely accurate. As the author points out Lincoln was not wealthy as a child, but also not poor by the standards of the day.The sections on sex, family, and education really offer a facsinating view into American past.

No facts are cited, so page 11 serves as an ironic introduction. Seventeen chapters group historical topics. They make entertaining reading, and are informative. But are they all 100% correct? Note how many of his notes reference a sole source. Page 22 questions Eli Whitney's use of interchangeable parts from inspecting surviving examples. But after decades of wear wouldn't the original parts have been replaced? The Ford assembly line (p.25) came from Chicago slaughterhouses.The \\"Founding Fathers\\" chapter teaches you what is censored from the schoolbooks. Page 31 tells of the Yazoo land swindle in Georgia, and the part played by the US Supreme Court after the fact. Neither Washington, Jefferson, Franklin, or Hamilton went to church regularly (p.35). \\"Presidents\\" says that Warren Harding was selected after many ballots. His Cabinet included some of the best minds in the country (p.50). If not the brightest, he made it up by often working from 8am to midnight until he died of a heart attack. Eisenhower's \\"fuzzy locutions\\" were just a way to give evasive answers (p.54). Reagan was a liberal Democrat from the 1930s to the early 1950s (pp.56-57). Most Presidents had a middle-class to rich background, except Andrew Johnson [and Bill Clinton?] (pp.58-59). Shenkman contradicts de Tocqueville on the \\"equality of conditions\\" in America. But de Tocqueville was right; lavish living was politically incorrect, and considered immoral. De Tocqueville also commented on America's fascination with money.\\"Sex\\" suggest the only diference from 200 years ago is more publicity. The sermons against vice in the late 19th century may have been against the industrialized version (p.71). Big cities had guidebooks so \\"the reader may know how to avoid them\\" (p.72)! \\"The Family\\" notes the high rate of divorce in America started in the 1880s (p.80). Divorce seems to follow the economy (p.81). In past centuries early death was so common that single parent families were prevalent (p.82). \\"War\\" suggestss a censored reign of terror during the Revolution; a higher proportion of Loyalists fled than Royalists from Revolutionary France (p.84), where more died. Shenkman says the Mexican War was for territory, as if this was unusual (p.91)! Like most historical arguments, one man's truth is another man's myth. Page 103 says the Japanese emperor and the Supreme Council decided to end the war on June 20, 1945 weeks before the A-bombs were dropped. No one expected deaths from the radiation!The popular image of \\"The Frontier\\" as a place of violence is due to Hollywood movies and dime novels, rather than historical fact (p.112). The Kansan cow towns which saw more violence were those with a large transient male population looking for fun. Davy Crocket's legend came from his political biographies (p.114). \\"Education\\" notes the failures in schooling goes way back; it is not a current phenomenon (p.13). College rebellions were common in the early 19th century (pp.135-6). \\"The Good Old Days\\" refer to the times where problems were forgotten and good memories retained (pp.159-160). Drug abuse was widespread in the late 19th century, not counting alcohol (p.164). \\"Folklore\\" says many famous figures believed to be mythical were based on real people, like Johnny Appleseed (p.166). The \\"Famous Quotes\\" chapter explains why some are \\"famous misquotes:.

Have you ever visited Abraham Lincoln's Log Cabin, and wonder if it is authentic? Well, look no further. In this book, Richard Shenkman sheds some light on some of the &quot;stories&quot; behind U.S. History as we know it.This book was, if anything, a really fascinating read. Shenkman did a lot of research in objecting to the time-held beliefs and traditions of some of the greatest pieces in American history. He mentions several historical things, and then counters them with his own detailed views and findings.The writing is very easy to follow, and the short, yet detailed chapters make the book a fairly quick read. I can't say that the book was a total &quot;eye-opening&quot; experience, but it was rather interesting.Is the tourist attraction of Betsy Ross' house really hers? Was Colombus' reason for the journey to the New World really made up by Washington Irving?

After recently reading several U.S. histories and several founding-father biographies I pulled this out for some lite reading. While an interesting read, my copy is going in the trash.Most of my thoughts have been expressed by other reviewers. True to the title the book is mostly a fast-paced debunking of one \\"myth\\" after another, many of which are generally accepted as myth or are inconsequential to american history. The work is footnoted (loosely at best), but many references end up being someone else's opinion rather than a primary source. Since Mr. Shenkman is going out of his way to debunk American history it's hard not to take a lot of his debunking with a grain of salt."},{"Title":"Legends, Lies, and Cherished Myths of American History","review":"Legends, Lies, and Cherished Myths of American History is an interesting and informative read that attempts its best to debunk the mythologies that have overshadowed true historical accounts. This latter part is pretty surprising to me as Richard Shenkman makes a good point that the winners always write history based on their perspective, however biased it is. There were some surprising facts in the book that I didn't know. For example, the Declaration of Independence didn't happen on July 4th but rather on the second. For a while, I thought that the German economy were largely shackled by the Versailles Treaty, but it turned out that World War I cost the Germans three times as much as the reparations in the treaty. Even though the Germans were dismayed by its depression, Shenkman makes a point that they could have gotten out of it if the population tried to lower their standards of living. The author took the myth out of every president that took the office in United States history, and after reading each, my respect, however little it was, for the presidents have been greatly reduced. I wasn't surprised about Christopher Columbus, but one thing I can't ever understand why do we have to declare a holiday after him? For a long time, I actually thought that Amerigo Vespucci discovered America, but this country was only named after him (I hope I read that right) through fraudulent claims. Another thing I enjoyed was the history of education in America, and I enjoyed the disrobing of the mystique that Harvard carried with itself. Meanwhile, it may be interesting that a lot of truths are rediscovered in the book, but to me, it feels dismaying that historians have the power to falsify information without us having the resources or means to verify it. Ultimately, we'll just have to take their word unless somebody else can refute it although we won't have any idea of the correction. All in all, Legends, Lies, and Cherished Myths of American History is worth reading for anyone who is interested what America was truly like back then or rather how history can be shaped; however, I admit the information contained in the book is kind of hollow at times, and I am not sure why. Maybe it is that what it's past is past, and it doesn't really matter anymore."},{"Title":"Legends, Lies, and Cherished Myths of American History","review":"An eye opener about the myths in America.

But then English and German scholars began digs around 1900 and found writings by the Hittites.First, the good. I enjoy Shenkman's writing style. Yes, he inserts himself into virtually every sentence, but that's the way he writes and I had no problem with that; some of it is amusing.What I do have a problem with are statements like these: The story of the Jews' special covenant with God is pure moonshine. It was dropped into the biblical history of Moses long after the rest of the material about him was written. It's been dismissively referred to by experts as \\"paddng.\\"What is his evidence this was \\"dropped in\\" or that this happened long after all other materials about Moses had been codified? Why was this added? And who are these dismissive experts? Shenkman doesn't say.Ever hear of Christ referred to as a \\"Hellenistic gadfly\\"? Me either; it's pure Shenkman. How about, \\"Much of what we think we know about him is as imaginary as his innumerable portraits.\\" I first read Shenkman's Legends... many years before having read the Bible. Since then, I've read through it more than once. I know some details don't jibe, but they are very minor details. They don't change the big picture of God's relationship with His creation and they change little of the actual history. It appears that Shenkman, instead of reading scripture, relies on sources and scholars who say what he wants to hear or he, as he is fond of saying, just makes things up.Does the New Testament fulfill the Old? Not for Shenkman. Instead, any NT event that jibes with the OT is simply an author like Matthew bolstering his case by cribbing OT text. Why would Matthew do this? Fame? Fortune? His own talk show? Of course not. In this case, Shenkman shows an ignorance both of the NT and the Old.This is not to say that some of what he writes about Biblical events isn't correct. It is true we don't know when Christ was born, but this isn't earth shattering or revealing. Does it change John 3:16? No.If you're expecting Shenkman to tackle the Myths of Islam, he is too timid to attempt this."},{"Title":"Legends, Lies, and Cherished Myths of American History","review":"Good, succinct destruction of historical myths, as we know them.

In fact, the so-called haldimand negotiations were by no means conducted in secret. furthermore, since vermont was, at the time, an independent republic, the negotiations were not treasonous. the british thought they were seducing allen, but the vermonter was only trying to guarantee his state's safety from british and indian raids while at the same time putting pressure on congress to admit vermont into the union. to support his allegations against ethan allen, shenkman cites only one source, a book published over sixty years ago. shenkman would do well to do better research before he goes about besmirching any more national heroes."},{"Title":"Legends, Lies, and Cherished Myths of American History","review":"Fascinating, if somewhat controversial, look at our past.

Some of the assertions I already knew about:1. General Pershing did not say \\"Lafeyette, we are here!\\" - someone said that instead.2. Many people in the South did not support slavery during the Civil War.3. Only about 1/3 of the colonists supported the American Revolutionary War.4. Not all of the Alamo defenders were all killed actively fighting in the battle. Some were captured, disarmed, and later executed.Shenkman challenges several assumptions about American history that I thought were true. However, I wonder how accurate Shenkman's assertions are. For example:1. Many of our nation's founding fathers were not Christians and that religion was not an important part in their lives. While some probably were not (Jefferson, Franklin, etc.), many certainly were. Many, many other sources reinforce that Christianity was a very important part in our nation's early history.2. The American Revolutionary War was fought mainly by established armies and on battlefields where European-style tactics were used by both the American and British armies. Shenkman needs to bone up on the American Revolutionary War in the South. While European-style battles may have been fought in the North (New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, etc.), guerilla warfare was the main form of fighting in the South (particularly in North and South Carolina). Partisans such as Thomas Sumter, Francis Marion, William Davie, and a host of others led troops that were more of a hit-and-run tactic instead of standing in straight lines blazing away at each other. Yes, there were some formal battles in the South (Guilford Courthouse, Camden, Cowpens, Kings Mountain, etc.). However, most engagements were of the guerilla war tactics.The book is an interesting read and will challenge your assumptions about American history.

I have shared my copy with my railroad colleagues, including several women, who all said they enjoyed it immensely, and want their own copies.The two women have a gift for capturing the true essence of our industry. Ms. Niemann writes in the language of the trainmen's locker rooms, switch shanties and locomotive cabs, a mixture of railroad slang and profanity, but, that is the way it really is.Lina Bertucci's photos truly convey the sense of never-ending fatigue, boredom, grime, that was (is) part of railroading, then and now. (I also had the pleasure of knowing Ms. Bertucci and some of her female co-workers when they became the first women hired by the Milw RR for train service in the '70s. Those women fought some real barriers to be accepted in what had been a all-male environment.)"},{"Title":"Railroad Voices: Narratives by Linda Niemann, Photographs by Lina Bertucci","review":"Niemann's quick patter, penetrating heartfelt look at the people around her, and brevity take us on an adventure that caters to my Tom Boy and captures my short attention span. I read it cover to cover in one day, thought about it for days later."},{"Title":"Railroad Voices: Narratives by Linda Niemann, Photographs by Lina Bertucci","review":"Gritty, dusty, muddy, ballast-strewn dirt under foot. A coppery feeling in the mouth. Eyes strained and burning, almost too tired to open. Perpetual noise---the incessant squeaking, grinding, thumping and crashing of heavy, lumbering machinery. Break time, and the codgers slumping in straight-back chairs leaned against the wall are all snoring, smoking, or describing their latest sexual conquests. Oily, smoky air stinking of hot grease. The feel, smell, look and sound of heavy industry, all the same day after day, night after night. These are the sensations that Niemann and Bertucci's book leaves in the reader's mind.The title and even the subject matter notwithstanding, I hesitate to categorize this book as a volume on railroading. The impressions of the people and their work-lives that are featured in the prose and the photographs are descriptive of all those who labor in the blue-collar jobs of heavy industry. These railroaders have much in common with miners, steel mill workers, grain elevator operators, truck builders, and all the rest on whom our nation's economy depends.If we must, because of its focus, speak of it as a railroad book, let us be clear about what it is not: There are no ballads or wreck songs here, no folklore about John Henry or Casey Jones, no heroic histories of rail disasters, no financial analyses or statistics of ton-miles hauled or ruminations on the nostalgic era of steam locomotives. What we really have is a book of contemporary photographs, some taken with film and some painted with the brush of words. Both kinds of photos reveal the grass-roots operating railroader and the real, unembellished, and usually uninspiring environment in which he or she labors.What is the lasting value of this book? It is truly American sociology and history. Not the history of the corporate board room. Not the history of company economics. Not even the technological history behind roller bearings and the huge diesel-electrics that haul unit trains from Powder River coal fields to the ravenous furnaces of east coast electrical generating plants. The history in this book is both more basic and more essential, for it shows us the working conditions of the people who make the machine run, whose work enables the rail corporations to prosper, and whose personalities are shaped by the unsympathetic and unending tasks set for them.If, Gentle Reader, you react badly to harsh language, to untempered sexual remarks, or to photos including \\"explicit\\" centerfolds taped to a yardman's locker door, then perhaps this book is not destined for your reading list. On the other hand, if you find fascination (or perhaps reminiscence) in unexpurgated portrayals of blue-collar working Americans or if you merely wish to understand the demands of such work and how it shapes the people who perform it, then I believe that you will treasure this book as a most worthy addition to your library. Whether you shelve it with your books on sociology, heavy industry, American history, or transportation will be your call. It integrates them all.By the way, if you find fulfillment with \\"Railroad Voices,\\" explore \\"Set Up Running,\\" a similar exploration into the life of a real, unremarkable railroader, an engineman on the Pennsylvania Railroad. Both books show us the real world of the railroad employee with grease on his (or her) clothes, gloves on his (or her) hand, and a union dues deduction in his (or her) paycheck."},{"Title":"Railroad Voices: Narratives by Linda Niemann, Photographs by Lina Bertucci","review":"Railroad Voices tells the story of two women encountering railroad life in the final decades of the 20th Century. It's an outlier relative to most railroad literature, which caters to train modelers and enthusiasts, or to historical and academic experts. This book speaks to an artistic and intellectually engaged audience without assuming any railroad interest. The railbuff or historian can come along for the ride, but shouldn't expect that their curiosities and sensibilities will be catered to. Railroad Voices focuses largely on the flesh-and-blood people who ran the trains and worked in the marshaling yards, where the trains started and ended their journeys.Thus, from a railfan perspective, I was initially disappointed with Railroad Voices (but not to say that its stories and photographs are entirely devoid of technical interest). Also, as a former switch tower operator, I would have liked some pictures and stories from inside the switch towers (like the ones seen in Ms. Bertucci's photos from Milwaukee). Ditto for the dispatchers who directed train movements, plus the signal maintainers who kept the switches and signals working.But no, this is a train crew's story told in words and photos. And it's a story well told.Ms. Niemann's writings are pungent and compelling, and she directly confronts the distasteful and unpleasant aspects of railroad life in post-industrial America. Once upon a time, passenger trains served the elite of our nation, while tracks and freight trains were a necessary fixture to most every city neighborhood, along with the rural heartland. But times have changed, and today's remaining lines traverse the forgotten corners of our land, places populated by illegal immigrants, the mentally ill, homeless outcasts and criminal transients (far from the benign drunken hobos of 1960's suburban memory, recall the cute miniature hobo on the Lionel train under the Christmas tree).Ms. Niemann's negative and tragic description of railroad life is thus more sad than surprising. The hours on the freight runs are long and unpredictable, managers often push beyond reason in the face of relentless competition from 57 foot tractor-trailers and inland barge lines, and the dangers of killing or being killed by a string of 70 ton freight cars never ceases. But what is especially tragic is Ms. Niemann's lack of any pride or consolation in being part of something as tangibly big and important as railroads still are to the American economy.Workers once felt good about hiring on with the railroad; you were no longer just another \\"townie\\", another grocery store clerk or elementary school janitor. You were part of something stretching from coast to coast, the veins and arteries of American commerce. The work of a train crew was always hard and dangerous, but there was a sense of purpose that many if not most railroaders once shared. This spirit still seemed to exist when I worked on the Erie Lackawanna in 1970s.It appears that over time, the believers were largely replaced by a younger, more cynical generation weaned on distrust, encouraged by the events of the Vietnam War and Watergate to conclude that \\"the whole system is corrupt\\". We railfans sensed the change. Through the early 70s, many railroaders accommodated railfan interest. Admittedly, there were always \\"rails\\" who wanted you off the property (often so they could pursue their \\"Rule G\\" violations, on-duty use of intoxicating substances). Others wondered aloud why intelligent people with cameras would waste their time studying and recording a world that was crumbling. I recall an old Lehigh Valley railroader saying that the railfan hobby was \\"like watching a man die of cancer\\".But most of the old heads and many of the younger ones seemed complemented by our interest. Rail buffs affirmed that what they did was indeed important. How many garbage collection crews or taxi drivers have people following them, filming and admiring the details of their work?Ms. Niemann by contrast is a railroader of the 1980's and 90's, when her attitude about railfans became common: \\"the brakeman stares out the window, wishing he were going to be home tonight, and angry at the rail buff because he constructs a fantasy, while the brakeman must live it\\". Her anger is partly with an enterprise that no longer believes in its own necessity and worth. Even into the 1970s, railroads painted their freight cars in catchy colors and adopted logos to impress the public with their \\"can-do\\" spirit. The Chessie System had a sleeping kitten, while the Southern \\"serves the south\\" and \\"gives a green light to innovation\\". The Union Pacific was \\"the automated railway\\" that \\"can handle it\\". And until the disastrous Penn Central merger of 1968, one predecessor line painted its boxcars a snappy jade green and called itself \\"The Road to the Future\\".We're now in the post-Penn Central future, and the few railroads that survive are mostly profitable. Warren Buffet owns BNSF, one of the big-4 American systems. And yet, railroad management mostly turns away from public observation, painting their engines black or dark blue, pulling gray or dark brown freight cars ornamented with numbers and little else. It's thus not surprising that employees also disfavor attention. The attitude of railroad owners, managers and workers appears to be that \\"we still make money and are needed, but that could change.\\" This attitude is not unfounded; for example, Post-Panamax ships and the decline of coal usage due to global warming, cheap natural gas and improving green-energy could cause further railroad contraction.Railroad Voices is a good reality fix, a reflection on the cruel edges of modern society at large. Ms. Bertucci and Niemann provide an increasingly rare look beyond the entertainment front that digital technology has created for the \\"successful\\" class, a world view dominated by Facebook, Xbox, Netflix, NFL, etc. Their book peers into the un-pretty and uncertain part of America where necessary work is done -- but with such cynicism and spiritual degradation."},{"Title":"Railroad Voices: Narratives by Linda Niemann, Photographs by Lina Bertucci","review":"My grandfather was a conductor on the railroad and retired about 10 years ago.

When they grew up the waffle business was handed over to them. Each of them built a house; Percy built a straw house, Pete built a log cabin, and Prudence made his cottage out of bricks. One day they met a wolf named Tempesto who didn&#65533;t want waffles but wanted to eat them! The wolf knocked down Percy, and Pete&#65533;s houses and moved on to Prudence&#65533;s. The three pigs bombarded him with watermelons, pumpkins, cantaloupes, grapes, and pastries. This caught Tempesto by surprise and he was knocked down. The wolf entered down the chimney but was soon turned into a waffle. In the end Percy, Pete, and Prudence married and had kids.

And the wolf being steam-pressed in a huge hot waffle iron and then smothered in butter-- ouch!I feel it's important to teach children to have empathy for others. Even though the people in the book are cartoonized animal characters, children identify with them. I do not think that the violent situations in this book will teach children fellow- feeling.

The pigs, not only have names, but they also attend school and run the family business. Neither the pigs or the big, bad, thug-like wolf get eaten. Instead, there's a humorous and positive ending to this tale. The illustrations are fun and intricate and exemplify the great Steven Kellogg style. As a reading teacher, I have used this book as part of a study of classic tales. My students particularly enjoy the humor, illustrations, and details that they can compare to other versions of the same tale. This is a great book to share with students and readers of all ages!"},{"Title":"The Three Little Pigs","review":"I've read and reviewed most of the basic tellings of \\"The Three Little Pigs\\", as well as most of the variants. Here's my take on it.This is quite possibly the best telling of \\"The Three Little Pigs\\" out there. Although it more or less follows the traditional storyline, it expands it greatly, having the mama pig start a waffle business, making the house of sticks a more believable log cabin, and giving all the characters names and personalities. Humor abounds, particularly in the artwork, such as \\"Pablo Pigcasso\\" and a \\"peopley\\" bank. It's subtle and may take you a frew readings to notice. Very good, nice twist at the end."},{"Title":"The Three Little Pigs","review":"In Steven Kellogg's inventive take on the storybook classic The Three Little Pigs (HarperCollins, 1997), brothers Percy, Prudence, and Pete find themselves in deep water, or perhaps syrup, when a sinister customer shows up at their town waffle cart hungry for something other than waffles. Having taken over the prospering waffle business from their mother, Sarafina Sow, the pigs are lucky enough to own individual homes in which they attempt to hide from the big, bad wolf, aptly name Tempesto. Tempesto's voracious appetite, however, moves him to violent action as he blows down not just one, but two, of their homes. Kellogg's action-packed illustrations capture the reader's eye with their attention to detail. Although younger ones may not totally take notice of the clever scenery, such as the Pablo Pigasso painting in one of the pigs' homes, they will surely smile at the book's humorous depiction of an animal village, while adults will take pleasure in the fact that the illustrations are more than just expressive colors on a page. Children will rejoice with the triumph of the miniature hog heroes of this tale and laugh out loud at the animals' comical battle involving flying watermelons and ending with a creative addition to the waffle cart's menu: the \\"wolffle.\\""},{"Title":"The Three Little Pigs","review":"Steven Kellogg did a wonderful job.

Now, as a first year Kindergarten teacher, I am sharing his books with my class, and they have really come alive for me, again. His traditional tale interpretations are creative, intricate and hilarious--not to mention beautiful. My favorite part of his Three Little Pigs tale is the illustration on the back jacket, which shows the wolf retired to a beach in Florida. He wears a tank top that pleads, 'thugs need hugs, too'.

The most \\"violent\\" detail in the book is how the three little pigs \\"steam the meanness\\" out of the wolf using their gigantic waffle maker. Steven Kellogg spins this story with great creativity, and adds tons of hilarious details in his pictures. It is not only fun for adults to read, but the 4-year-old I read it to also loves it more than any other book I own. We enjoy looking for things we've never caught before each time we read it.

However you might not know it from reading this dense and forbidding tract. Even a short excerpt can be tough going. However, utilitarianism has been, and remains, one of the most influential ethical philosophies of all time, and this was among its modern founding documents.If one can come away from it with a general sense of what utilitarianism is, what act utilitarianism is, and how it gets from egoism in psychology to neutralism in ethics, one has done pretty well. This should help the reader start thinking about what some of the problems with this theory are, how it measures up to its competitors, and how it can be applied to specific problems.The best news for those who have braved this text is that Mill and other later thinkers will seem like poetry in motion by comparison."},{"Title":"An introduction to the principles of morals and legislation,","review":"Jeremy Bentham's Bentham Utilitarianism is essentially based on his desire to move away from the moral philosophy of Judeo-Christian ethics ,or the deism of Adam Smith, and move toward a philosophy that could under pin an atheistic perspective.Bentham wants to come up with a decision making calculus which is simultaneously applicable to issues in economics(politics)and ethics(morals).Bentham claims that for all actions there are two distinctly measurable outcomes,pain and pleasure. Bentham comes up with a Principle of Utility(p.1).This essentially boils down to the observation that positive utility(pleasure) is generated by activities that generate sensations of pleasure while negative utility(pain) is generated by activities which generate sensations of pain.One can approve or disapprove of any action to the extent that it increases happiness(pleasure)or decreases pain.Approve ,in Bentham's system,translates as good or right.Disapprove,in Benthams system, translates as bad or wrong.How is this system implemented ? Bentham claims that there are lots(units) of pleasure and pain that all decisionmakers can calculate precisely and exactly.The value of the lots will be more or less depending on the duration,intensity,and certainty of the pleasure.All actions are equally good if the sum of the amounts of pleasure resulting from each action is equal.This is where economists come up with their indifference curve analysis and hedonic calculus.Unfortunately,Bentham fails miseribly in his attempt to demonstrate that human decision makers have the capacity to calculate exactly in quantitative terms.He never answers the question ,\\" How do humans actually make the quantitative calculations ? \\", upon which Bentham's entire edifice of decision amking is so precariously balanced .He merely asserts it:\\" ...who is their who does not calculate ? Men calculate,some with less exactness,indeed,and some with more:but all men calculate.I would not say,that even a madman does not calculate \\".(p.188) .This is very similar to the modern neoclassical economist who simply asserts that the normal distribution is applicable even if goodness of fit tests demonstrate that the data from the time series observations does not come close to fitting the normal probability distribution.Bentham is the founder of both Classical and Neoclassical economics.Smith explicitly rejected Bentham's arguments in The Theory of Moral Sentiments (1759;sixth edition,1790)some 28 years before Bentham decided to eliminate conscience(Smith's impartial spectator) and substitute utility.It is easy to see that the modern Benthamite approach is to combine the Bayesian ,subjectivist approach to probability of F Ramsey,B De Finetti,and L Savage with the game theoretic,expected utility approach to utility of von Neumann and Morgenstern to obtain the Subjective Expected Utility (SEU)approach, which is the fundamental foundation of all neoclassical economics and economists.Any economist ,who claims that he is not a neoclassical economist ,but who fervently supports SEU,is a neoclassical economist.Only risk,usually represented by the standard deviation of a normal probability distribution,exists in SEU.Keynes demonstrated that SEU is a very special theory that only is sound when the weight of the evidence,w, supporting the estimate of the probabilty relation, is complete.w must have a value of 1.Only in this case can a decision maker define a single probability distribution to represent his preferences.Only in this case can the standard deviation represent the risk involved . A value of w &lt; 1 means that decisions are being made in conditions of partial ignorance.A value of w=0 means decisions are being made in total ignorance.One can just as easily work with D Ellsberg's rho index.A rho = 1 allow a decision maker to specify a single unique distribution.A rho value less than one requires a set of different possible distributions.A rho =0 means that no distribution can be used.Note that this only deals with the nature of the probabilities.The outcomes themselves may also have to be represented as intervals.This is the case with the very strange Kahneman-Tversky battlefield and rare Asian disease problems which were put forth by them as cases of decision making with either w or rho &lt; 1.Yet Kahneman and Tversky claimed that the decision maker had exact,precise point probabilities and exact,precise outcomes attached to the point probabilities.This made no sense either in theory or to the experimental subjects subjected to this kind of bizarre decision problem.It is extremely important to read Bentham's book in order to understand modern day approaches to decision making.The modern approach merely rewrites Bentham's book using more up to date mathematical techniques and formal exposition.The ideas are the same."},{"Title":"An introduction to the principles of morals and legislation,","review":"Jeremy Bentham (IPA: ['ben??m]) (February 15, 1748 - June 6, 1832) was an English gentleman, jurist, philosopher, and legal and social reformer. He is best known as an early advocate of utilitarianism and animal rights.Bentham was one of the most influential (classical) liberals, partially through his writings but particularly through his students all around the world, including John Stuart Mill and several political leaders.He argued in favor of individual and economic freedom, including the separation of church and state, freedom of expression, equal rights for women, animal rights, the end of slavery, the abolition of physical punishment (also of children), the right to divorce, free trade, and no restrictions on interest. But, he was not a libertarian, and supported inheritance tax, restrictions on monopoly power, pensions, and health insurance.In 1776, Bentham published his Fragment on Government anonymously, a criticism of Blackstone's Commentaries, and in 1780 his Introduction to Principles of Morals and Legislation was published.A truly influential author!"},{"Title":"An introduction to the principles of morals and legislation,","review":"The works speak for them selves over time, but it was great to be able to have a complete set of his works"},{"Title":"An introduction to the principles of morals and legislation,","review":"Bentham's ideas are brilliant.

At best, it's smooth jazz, at worst, it's the \\"demo\\" key on a Casio keyboard. His other recordings had classical or new age music, or nature sounds in the background.I should probably also mention that the format is a little different. It's Bob and his wife Deirdre, and there are talking segments mixed in-between affirmations. Nothing bad about that, but if you know his other recordings, this isn't the same thing.While-U-Drive series: the content is good, but the music is so bad that I won't be listening again.

The cognitive aspect of it gets you to understand fear and anxiety and ways to counteract these feelings in a positive way. A combination of discussing fears and anxiety while playing positive affirmations after each track eventually finds its way into your subconscious because you find yourself during the day repeating these affirmations in your head. The upbeat music and tunes can be a bit dated, like from the 80's but it sticks in your head and helps you to remember things from the CD more easily. I'm just happy it works as well as it does and I try to play it at least once a week to keep these affirmations and understandings of anxiety fresh in my head."},{"Title":"Overcome Fears and Anxiety Auto-matically (While-U Drive)","review":"Wow.

Glesne's writing style helps the reader enter the mind of her examples and encounter unexpected situations that arise. She could only do that because Glesne demonstrates years of sophisticated and comprehensive experience in the field and captures the fine nuances of Interviewer behaviors and possible issues that arise with participants. Glesne actually prepares the reader for the unexpected so that when you run into it, you can pick up the book and say, \\"Now what did Glesne say to do about this problem and read it for problem-solution?\\" Glesne actually anticipates what I am thinking as a qualitative researcher-novice reader.

I wouldn't even let adult cousins in the house if my parents weren't home. I'd never been abused, but I had a certain sense about things and heard stories from other kids. I had no idea that people could be so trusting and naive. Then I read this book. I guess things were different in circa 1970s Idaho. Places like this are a paradise, a Utopia. Leave it to \\"snakes\\" to ruin an Eden of sorts.I will be the first to tell you, this is not the best written book to ever hit shelves. That aside, it is a true account from real people who suffered at the hands of a predatory abuser; a man who saw the prey and went in for the capture. The parents went through Hell and the little girl suffered psychological turmoil as the abductor toyed with her innocence and willingness to bow down to adult authority. I could not put this book down for long and read, sometimes in disbelief as time and again, this predator was allowed back into the lives of the family. They wanted to believe so strongly in forgiveness and redemption. I myself would have tortured and gutted the violator and abandoned him in the desert and left forgiveness up to our Heavenly Father's disgression. (Don't anyone out there, doubt for a minute that I could do it or not.)As far as the book, I would highly recommend it for readers. I'd like to add, please, do not be judgemental. This family obviously lived in a sheltered world which made it easier for this terrible crime to take place. Ignorance is not stupidity. We can all learn from this story."},{"Title":"Stolen Innocence: The Jan Broberg Story","review":"I finally got around to reading this book in my mom's bookshelf, and I'm glad I did.

However, why did the author feel it was so necessary to repeatedly state the name of the friend that took their daughter? THE ENTIRE STORY COULD HAVE BEEN TOLD USING AN ANNOMYNOUS NAME INSTEAD OF DELIBERATLY SMEARING A PERSON'S NAME ON ALMOST EVERY PAGE OF THE BOOK!! The reason I say this is that it has been 30 long years since this event happened and people do change. Why dig up all this dirt and destroy a man and his present family over something that happened so long ago?The answer?.....Some people(the ones who wrote this book)can ONLY JUDGE and are unable to forgive.I did alot of things 30 years ago that I am ashamed of but with wisdom and age have learned the wrong of my mistakes and become a better person. Don't most of us become wiser and better as we age. Would you want to be judged today by things you did 30 years ago?My father's associate was charged with molesting a 12 yr old girl. It was in all the papers and very, very biased. The papers never asked for his side of the story. His career(a Pediatrician) was ruined! He over-dosed on pills due to the trauma. Two weeks after his death the girl admitted she had made it all up BECAUSE SHE WANTED SOME ATTENTION!! Not only did she kill a wonderful man, she ruined the lives of his wife, 8 children, and 900 pediatric patients.To the author I would like to ask these questions.......why did you wait 30 long years to write this story? Did Elizabeth Smart's book motivate you to take advantage of the moment and cash in on the profits while the market was &quot;HOT&quot;? Why have you not found forgiveness in your heart?To the reader I would give this advice: Do not judge a book by it's cover. Be assured there is more to this story than meets the eye!"},{"Title":"Stolen Innocence: The Jan Broberg Story","review":"To the person who wrote the review entitled &quot;Revenge? Hate?&quot; I am curious to know how you know that this book, as you put it, is &quot;destroying a man and his present family&quot;? Do you personally know the kidnaper? From the things you said in your review, I am guessing that you do. To me it sounds like you are the one with a lot of hate. The author didn't &quot;smear&quot; anyone's name, the kidnaper did that to himself when he committed the crimes. You act like we should have sympathy for the kidnaper. But let me tell you, I know how it is to spend a lifetime to recover from abuse and I don't have sympathy for someone who would kidnap and molest an innocent child. You also asked why the author waited so long to write the book. As a victim, I know that sometimes it takes a very long time before a person is ready to talk about such horrible crimes. It is frightening and shameful to have gone through such things. When I read this book (and I happened to also go to a conference where the victim spoke) I didn't feel that the author was judging the kidnaper. I think it could have been much worse against the perpetrator if that had been the goal. She wasn't writing about everything that has happened over the past 30 years, she didn't write whether the person had or hadn't changed since the events of the book, she just wrote about the experiences of the time of the kidnaping. And she wrote it in a way that truly hit home to me. I know what it feels like to be terrified every day because of abuse. I wish I would have had the courage to tell someone many years ago. This book gives victims some strength and courage. I applaud it. I think everyone should read this book!"},{"Title":"Stolen Innocence: The Jan Broberg Story","review":"The day I received this book and started reading it I did not stop until I had finished all 300+ pages in one sitting. From the first pages, I was completely drawn into the mystery, deception, and heartbreak of this shockingly true story. I was amazed at the insanity of the situation and then touched by the victim's and her family's ability to overcome years of pain and suffering at the hands of someone whom they considered a close friend at one time.This book is a great read for people of all ages and life situations and may be especially helpful for parents who want to learn how to keep their children safe from predators. It would be an excellent read for teenage girls because it gives such an excellent illustration that not all people who show loving actions are good people acting in their best interest- a message hard to get across to young girls at that age.Lastly this book is a messenger of hope for victims of abuse and families of abuse victim's who may see themselves in these pages and know they are not alone and that all is not lost.I know many people who have read this book and every one has found themselves absolutely engrossed from the first chapter and glad they'd read it. It's a great selection for book clubs because you really have to talk about this book with people after you've read it. I very much recommend this book to other readers!"},{"Title":"Stolen Innocence: The Jan Broberg Story","review":"I saw this cover over a year ago, but forgot the title before I could find the book. I was thrilled when I found the book again, as the story had intrigued me. I was so impressed with the honesty of this story, of the humility of Mary Ann to be so honest, even when I'm sure it was hard for her to do. I'm also so proud of Jan--I've seen her movies and I was stunned when I realized she was the girl in this book. Evil definatley has a face and a name--as does faith and family unity.And to the 'Revenge' reviewer--from the tone of the post I can't help but think it's Robert himself--this is the only review that reviewer has ever written. It sounds to me that he's still seeking his power any way he can. Anyone that read that book and has any decency in them would realize that it's not about revenge, it's about triumph. The book isn't about Robert--it's about a family who survives the worst life has to offer at the hands of a twisted man. They are now willing to tell their story so as to spare someone else from having to live through the same torment.My only complain (the reason for 4 stars) is that I'd have liked to have Jan's portions written in first person like Mary Ann's was and I'd have liked to have the information presented with more detail to the chronology, there were places where it skipped to future, then back again. All it all it was very well told and well written--especially since it's been 30 years."},{"Title":"Stolen Innocence: The Jan Broberg Story","review":"You absolutely can't put this book down once you start reading!

Writing from both the perspective of the victim of a kidnapping and her mother was unique and truly insightful. It is a heartbreaking and inspirational story all wrapped into one. I was extremely moved by this family's story."},{"Title":"Stolen Innocence: The Jan Broberg Story","review":"Jan Broberg Felt is my cousin and Mary Ann Broberg is my aunt.

It has caused quite an uproar in our valley as his wife now is a teacher in our elementary school. It makes you wonder, WHY!!? Every one who has children should read this book and learn how to talk to your child about these kinds of things. Know where they are and who they are with. Please understand you can't trust everyone. Trust your gut instinct!"},{"Title":"Stolen Innocence: The Jan Broberg Story","review":"This spell binding true story has so many unusual events that were created by the perpetrator and so many hardships for his victim and her family. I felt the courage of the young innocent child to protect her family from destruction was inspiring even though she didn't realize she had been brainwashed. I think that every girl over the age of 12 should read this book and certainly every parent in the country. I read the story in one sitting because I could not put it down. It reads like a Grisham crime novel only it is true and more fantastic than any fiction I have ever read. Well written, compelling and I would recommend it to any one looking for a great story to read and learn from. It had a great forward and afterward written by Superior Court Judge Charles Gill which really legitimized this unbelievable story for me. I was entertained and I learned a ton as well! Great read!!!"},{"Title":"Stolen Innocence: The Jan Broberg Story","review":"Jan Broberg Felt is my 3rd cousin's wife. I found her story both tragic and compelling. Indeed the book is a &quot;page turner.&quot; I'm proud Jan now carries the Felt family name because of how she has aquitted her life since the tragedy. Robert Berchtold should have gone to jail for a long time, but he weasled his way free. Even this month I hear he tried to run down one of Jan's body guards. He's a real piece of work."},{"Title":"Stolen Innocence: The Jan Broberg Story","review":"In October 1974 in Pocatello, ID, an impossibly cruel and manipulative sleazeball - a 40 year old sociopathic pedophile named Robert Berchtold - kidnapped Jan Broberg, the 12 year old daughter of his best friends, Bob and Mary Ann Broberg. Berchtold and Jan were discovered 6 weeks later illegally married in Mexico, at which time Jan was returned to her parents. But during the 6 week period, Berchtold brainwashed Jan in a manner so devious, so deviant, and so cruel, that - unbelievably - 18 months later he convinced her to leave with him again. This time they were gone 3 months before Jan was found and returned home. During these two occasions, Jan was terrorized through lies, fed drugs, and sexually molested all the while almost incomprehensibly believing a story so absurd that it defies credulity. But remember that when the lie was first implanted, Jan was a nave 12 year old girl. And while Jan was home, Berchtold basically stalked the family, offering jobs to Jan and cheerfully calling to talk to them as if nothing had happened and acting like he was sure that the Brobergs understood that their 12 year old daughter was meant to be with this 40 year old puke.The story is told by Jan's mother, Mary Ann Broberg, in her book, STOLEN INNOCENCE. On the positive side, the story is fascinating and the book is a fast and exciting read. Mary Ann wrote the book 19 years after the first kidnapping as a form of therapy, and the reader shares the family's impossible anguish, wants Jan to be safe and returned home, and unreservedly hates Robert Berchtold.The style of writing is generally too day-time-soap for my taste. I understand that this family experienced an ultimate terror, but I'd simply have preferred a less melodramatic style in its recounting. Part of my problem may be that I simply don't understand the dynamics and collective personality of the Broberg family. I kept thinking I was reading about the Cleavers with Mary Ann playing the role of June.There is also a great deal of made up in conversation in the book. Most of it is in the segments depicting times when Jan was gone with Berchtold. This is necessary, as otherwise Mary Ann would have been unable to adequately write those segments, and she states in her introduction that she has done so. My problem is that some of the dialog does not ring true.At one point she has Berchtold saying to Jan, \\"Crap, you're beautiful.\\" Now I'm as romantic as the next guy, but I never considered using that line. Maybe I'll try it.And a cop who has been looking for Berchtold refers to him as \\"That big jerk.\\" I've known a number of cops in my life, and while their descriptions of Berchtold may have varied, they would all have been considerably more colorful than \\"big jerk'. I mean it sounds like he's describing someone who has once again shoplifted a pair of socks.But Broberg is not a professional writer and all things considered she has done a pretty credible job. The book is honest and certainly better written than books by many of the cynical or talentless true crime purveyors - Michael Benson, Fred Rosen, and Aphrodite Jones come to mind - who actually call themselves writers. All in all she's done a good job.Finally, Mary Ann's description of her behavior during the family's crisis is nothing short of infuriating. Her passivity and naivet&eacute; - which to her credit she acknowledges herself - are maddening. After the first kidnapping, Robert calls the house and says he wants to speak to her and insists that Jan be there. So what does Mary Ann do? SHE BRINGS HER DAUGHTER TO MEET WITH HER ABDUCTOR, essentially delivering her to Berchtold.At another point Jan, by then all of 13, has obtained money from Robert and is found at the airport by Mary Ann as she's buying a ticket to meet Robert in Wyoming. Mary Ann tells Jan she can't go; Jan says, in effect, \\"Watch me!\\"; and Mary Ann, rather than physically stopping her or exerting any parental cojones, watches her go because she'd have caused a scene. Jan's parents had no idea how to handle the kidnappings and with the best of intentions did EVERYTHING wrong, though Bob came to his senses a lot quicker than his wife. To Mary Ann's credit, she does not deny these facts.The book ends with an afterword by a Connecticut Superior Court Judge who lists 10 major mistakes the Brobergs made when dealing with Berchtold. It is much to Mary Ann Broberg's credit that she chose to include this section, and its inclusion is in keeping with the basic honesty of the book. Broberg has done a good job with STOLEN INNOCENCE, and I recommend it to anyone interested in the subject matter."},{"Title":"Stolen Innocence: The Jan Broberg Story","review":"Fantastic!!! everyone should read it especially teenagers and young parents with younger children because its really a story to help protect children."},{"Title":"Jeremiah, Lamentations (Mastering the Old Testament)","review":"Here is some real help in the formulation of studies or preaching for the busy but serious pastor/teacher of Bible content.

This time there is a cocaine drugs ring to infiltrate and take down, and Cherub are brought in to get close to the children of the drug baron, Keith Moore.These books are good action adventures, in the same vein as Alex Rider. The concept is perfect - how many children have not dreamed at some point of being a secret agent? Look at the success of Alex Rider or the TV programme M.I.High to see how this series will immediately stir the imaginations of its intended audience.The books are gritty. Not realistic exactly, but not stretching the bounds of disbelief too much, but also describing the world much as it is. That makes these books best suited to a young adult audience although I have known children as young as 9 to have read these. They no doubt enjoyed them, but parents of those 9 year olds may prefer to discuss some of the themes in the book. This story was not an epic struggle between good and evil. Instead the good guys have their faults and the bad guys have firendships, loyalty and love. This is a good challenging read for young people."},{"Title":"Class A (CHERUB #2) (Bk. 2)","review":"I purchased Class A for my 13 year old son who read it in no time at all along with the rest of the series.

As usual with breakthru authors, their efforts get commercially applied and the insightfulness of the original work is closeted, where it can conveniently be academically referred to &quot;what he said was...&quot; (ellipsis filled in by whatever your professor used to characterize the book.) Shannon took an early art form to a rigorous science. This is the book reporting the method of the since-evolved science of data communications, and a good bit more. The fact that I am the first reviewer in this forum speaks eloquently of the paucity of readers and the concomitant large number of data communication experts who have ignored the now larger issues it discloses than the single commercial application of one of its conclusions. Read it. You will agree with me that focusing on the source rather than the sink (terms he coined) is the weakness of communication theory as currently modeled on Shannon's first, obvious conclusion.

Vedder ret Sr Data Comm Eng, Bell Atlantic us000483@mindspring.com"},{"Title":"The mathematical theory of communication","review":"I think it is fair to say that this book, based on Shannons landmark paper represents what I believe to be, the most important engineering paper ever written in the history of the world (both up to this point, and likely will remain so in the future). In terms of \\"practical implementation\\" of theory, it's fair to say that this seminal work has had a far greater contribution to mankind than Einsteins' paper on general and special relativity (just don't say that to a physicists face).... All to often, famous theorists are relegated to \\"cult-like\\" obscurity. Persons like Shannon, Gallager, Forney, Komolgorov may be legendary within a cult-circle of die-hard communication theorists, but are relegated to unfortunate obscurity by the masses. It's rather unfortunate, with todays advanced communication systems, and techniques of coding (Turbo codes, modified LDPC codes, etc..)which push the boundaries to the ultimate limits as defined by Shannon.... that more people (both engineers, and laymen alike) don't recognize the names of early pioneers who started the revolution, and who's theories are the basis for many of our modern luxuries which allow us to download information at such rapid rates.People often underestimate the deepness of Shannons' work,due to Shannon's writing style. He was one of those rare writers (somewhat like Forney, or Massey) who can actually explain complicated subjects using mere words, without the need for prettying the theory up with fancy math. Comparing the equation filled textbooks of today, versus Shannon's work, one might get the impression that Shannon's work was simplistic. I think it's clear to anyone whos studied his work, that IT WAS NOT SIMPLISTIC. Obviously, there was alot of \\"behind the scenes\\" math which Shannon had to go through to actually codify his many theorems. Just because Shannon did not show extensive derivations for each one of his theorems does not mean that he was not a good mathemetician..It merely means that he did not want to write a 1,000 page paper... he wanted to keep it simple (as was the customary writing style in the early to mid 1900's).In short.. This book should be on YOUR shelf if you dont already own it, and if you are interested in information theory, and the deeper underpinnings of digital communications. I give the book 5 stars, not because it's any kind of elegant literary masterpiece; simply because it is based on the most important paper ever written. ... S.A. Hoffman -"},{"Title":"The mathematical theory of communication","review":"Where it all began.---The book grew out from an epic scientific paper in 1948, but luckly its author Shannon chose a light touch and a gentle delivery in his presentation. The paper became a book, with a 1949 first edition, which is now a classic, and which has been reprinted a number of times since, ending with the present lovely 1998 edition. It is still the place where readers can learn the essentials, including the two equations of information theory, that are now named after Claude Shannon."},{"Title":"The mathematical theory of communication","review":"This is the seminal work that may be said to include the basic concepts, definitions and theorems of information and communication theory. This book does not need any praise because anybody who had even an introductory education in computer science or electronics of communication will have met the name of Shannon (if you haven't yet, please rush to Google and read his achievements).The beauty of this edition is twofold. It includes two main parts. First part is by Weaver, and you don't need anything more than high school logic and algebra to understand the very clearly explained concepts. The second part by Shannon is 'the real thing' and for the mathematically educated reader, you need a fine grasp of probability theory, calculus, and a little bit of calculus of variations if you want to absorb all of the material.To sum it up, if you want to really understand what entropy means in terms of information theory, then this is THE book for it.

The problem it deals with is a classic one for electronics, telecommunications and computing - noise vs. fidelity of data transmitted. The solution it propounds is simple and yet so revolutionary that it charted the course of these fields since it was published.The basic premise of the book is that 'redundancy' or elimination of noise occurs at infinite time. 'Entropy' or shuffledness allows for some noise and produces more information because it requires reconstruction at the receiving end.The authors support their arguments with simple statistical formulae which explain how entropy and redundancy are inverse of each other.This book has been highly debated by both the people involved in the fields concerned and the people outside the field.Most of the debate surrounds the controversial aspect of Shannon and Weaver's definition of information in engineering terms, which excludes issues like relevance, meaning etc.A great deal of debate also got carried into social sciences and humanities where a new celebration of 'entropy' occured."},{"Title":"The mathematical theory of communication","review":"Typically, a paper which defines a new field of science is not the best introduction to new researchers in the field.

It portrays Beat development in late '40s Manhattan. The main characters are Ginsberg, Kerouac and Holmes before they were famous"},{"Title":"Go","review":"Just a clarification of the synopsis offered by amazon (or newsweek) above. Although Go was published in 1952,5 years before On The Road, by Jack Kerouac, Kerouac had actually written On The Road in 1950 and it took him 7 years to get it published. Part of the problem was he had to get signed releases from everyone in the book, himself. Also, he had to change the names of towns, etc. There was a bit of tension between Holmes and Kerouac, but for the Beat scholar, Kerouac's novel can't be touched. On The Road stands alone. However, to be fair, and see another's view of things, Go is a fine book as well."},{"Title":"Go","review":"&quot;Go,&quot; generally acknoweldged as the first of the Beat Generation novels, was Holmes' first novel and it shows many of the typical flaws of the first major work of a talented artist. The tone is incosistent, the plot tends to wander, and the first half the book has a tendency to drag. That said, &quot;Go&quot; is still a worthwhile novel. Much as his friend Jack Kerouac would later do, Holmes essentially records his life as an aspiring writer living on the fringes of the postwar New York underground. Under various aliases, such familiar characters as Jack Kerouac, Allen Ginsberg, and Neal Cassady wander through the book. In its loose, episodic fashion, &quot;Go&quot; tells the story of a young writer who, while desperately trying to complete his first novel, watches his friends and wife dance through a decadent society, fueled by their own desire to say something original in a world that seems to fear and despise anything less than the purely conventional. Its a familiar plot but Holmes truly manages to capture both the excitement and the fear that goes with being both young and undiscovered. This a book that will be easily understood by anyone who has ever been convinced that they, for whatever reason, have been blessed with the ability to see both the beauties and the horrors of modern life that the rest of the world seems to safely ignore. As well, the book serves as a sad lament for both the promise and the ultimate fate of the original members of the Beat Generation. Though Holmes couldn't have realized it at the time, some of the book's most powerful scenes comes from having the knowledge of the ignominous fates that await characters like Gene Pasternak (Jack Kerouac) and Hart Kennedy (Neal Cassady) once they find the success that they are so desperately seeking. Even if uneven, it makes for an exhilirating read that, in the wonderful final chapter, truly does leave the reader feeling as if he has -- for a moment -- been transported back to the New York of the 1950s, when it truly seemed that these fatally flawed geniuses held the future and the salvation of American literature in their hands.Though he is usually credited with both coining the much maligned term &quot;Beat Generation&quot; as well as writing &quot;Go,&quot; the first truly Beat novel, John Clellon Holmes has long been overshadowed by more experimental contemporaries like Jack Kerouac, Allen Ginsberg, and William S. Burroughs. As Holmes himself acknowledged in personal interviews and this autobiographical novel, he was always on the fringe of the main Beat group -- i.e., a somewhat conservative, responsible intellectual trying to make a name for himself amongst a group that prided itself on being neither conservative nor responsible. Holmes is one of the few important Beat figures to never figure importantly into any of Kerouac's novels and his writing style was far more conventional than those of the better known Beats. As a result, &quot;Go&quot; has too often been unjustly ignored by modern-day adherents to the Beat Generation. This is unfair because &quot;Go,&quot; though certainly imperfect, is still a valuable look at these future mythological figures before they become legends and is an entertaining work on its own."},{"Title":"Go","review":"Holmes is generally considered to be a Beat novelist, but that label creates unfair expectations for those who have not read his work. In truth, Holmes' writing is a narrow bridge between writer's of the 30's and early 40's and the Beats. His style is reminiscent of Thomas Wolfe to an extreme--something Kerouac was guilty of in 'The Town and the City.' The problem with this novel is that Holmes wants so badly to chronicle the activities and attitudes of the Beats, but he can't pull it off stylistically. Kerouac's spontaneous prose was better suited for the subject matter and themes. This is why Kerouac, not Holmes, is generally considered the King of the Beats. Holmes' prose is dense with word illustrations and bland dialogue. Compare this with Kerouac's economy of words and beat-laiden dialogue, and you'll see why Kerouac's chronicles of the Beat Generation more fully capture the essence and spirit of the movement. If you truly enjoy Thomas Wolfe, you'll like Holmes. But if you're thinking 'Go' is anything like 'On the Road,' think again."},{"Title":"Go","review":"Whenever the immortal giants are discussed and associated with The Beat Generation the trinity of Kerouac, Ginsberg and Cassady top the list. After reading &quot;Go&quot; by John Clellon Holmes I feel he deserves some recognition. His story follows 4 major characters that howl through early 50's New York along with a cast of minor junkies, addicts and Hobbes' wife who can't decide what she wants. From smoky jazz clubs like The Go Hole and all night &quot;tea&quot; parties Hobbes(holmes), Pasternak(kerouac), Stofsky(ginsberg) and Kennedy(cassady) face life's situations and decisions with actions and reactions that portrayed most everyone who would become what is known as &quot;The Beat Generation.&quot; And, as we all know, that was really the beginning of all that is hip, cool, far-out and trendy."},{"Title":"Go","review":"An Extremely Important Book In The Beat CanonWe all know that Jack Kerouac was a more important writer than J C Holmes. More poetic, more rhythmic, more original, more driven by his passion, but was he more aware of the situation, and the relationships, and insightful? That's what I'm left wondering after returning to Holmes' book Go after I put it down 30 years ago, (I'm reading the 1959 British version The Beat Boys). I didn't finish it the first time, probably got less than a quarter of the way through it because it didn't seem to contain Kerouac's dream I found it too conventional, literate, dense with detail, dry?Now having read all of the Kerouac canon and having searched volumes' of letters of such for further knowledge of The Beat Generation I happen back on Go and having a heavy bout of flu have the time to settle back by the fire with cat on lap and re-discover it - and by God it's all here, everything I ever wanted to know about the early days. You know how you wish you could have a time machine and travel back to be at a beat party in, say, 1949 and see Jack, and Neal, Luanne and Allen as they really were through the eyes of (yourself or) someone else - well now you can, it's incredible!And not written in retrospect by someone putting the record straight or playing to an audience, satisfying a fandom, but Holmes is writing about them before he even knew that they would ever become famous (why?). Why would you do that? They must have been an extraordinary group of people or just I suppose living life in a wild way that didn't go on in the war years. Do you write books about your groups of friends? Documenting their every move? Yet Holmes does, and it's lucky for us he did. And the insight he shows on what those guys were like! Wow! and not just a couple of paragraphs or a soundbite that you might get from a friend talking on a video documentary but page after page of observing their lives. Point made.This book is such a gift to Beat fans. As I say I attempted reading it about 30 years ago after reading Kerouac's euphoric hypnotic first person accounts of the Beatosphere and found 'Go' formal/dry/dense/ and not knowing the characters, gave up a quarter way through.If I say that this book is as good a book as On the Road you know I'm not spoofing, because I'm one of Jack's biggest, long standing, fans and I wouldn't say such a thing lightly. The difference being, probably, that whereas OTR appeals to everybody with no background knowledge of the beat scene of the late fourties with Go a little prior knowledge of that scene and it's characters helps.If Kerouac is the poet. Holmes is the realist. He lives with them, travels with them, enters into their 'experiences', but never judges, lets you draw your own conclusions. In fact it's questionable, was John a Beat? I think he'd say he was, he certainly loved them and was one of Jack's best friends.With the film (American: movie) of On the Road finally being released to cinemas (American: theatres) near you the biographies of the Beats will abound, but Go which came out before any of the beat books will probably in the end prove to be the best biography to get. The others will almost certainly be judgemental, the biographers will be running their moral slide rules across the Beats, like an investigator entering a monastery and saying \\"this is all very well but these men are shirking their responsibility to support a woman and procreate\\". The said investigator not questioning his morals that society these days helps him support the woman to procreate with tax breaks and such and the children he procreates will be put through a school system which he himself hated, a work system which he himself hated and maybe made to inflict suffering on others by joining the armed forces.This is a very long book.I started out reading it to gain insight into Kerouac and Cassady and ended getting insight into Holmes and even myself. Outside of the Beats there are some marvellous passages and character observations. Take this page for instance -Google: \\"Amazon\\"Then: \\"Go by John Clellon Holmes\\"Then: \\"Click to Look Inside\\" the book and search for the words:\\"cool, laughing couples\\"- how's that for wandering through a lonely city?orTake for, instance, this short passage:After a nights heavy party, the host Hobbes (Clellon Holmes) having seen Kerouac, Cassady and attendant girlfriends and others out, goes to the bathroom:\\"Hobbes was dizzy and nauseated from the beer and the marijuana and, leaving Dinah to arrange the spare blankets, he went into the bathroom to make himself vomit as was his habit whenever he was too drunk or sick to sleep.\\"While leaning over the toilet getting up his nerve, he thought that the moment before making yourself throw up must be very like the instant before suicide. You are almost content to bear the sickening headache and the torment in your stomach rather than go through that moment. But the prospect of relief made you fool-hardy and you jammed your finger down your throat.\\"Do you get many passages in Kerouac as self-realising and insightful as that?Was a time when I though that I'd discovered/read the whole Beat oeuvre: three quarters of Jack's books, Junky and Naked Lunch, Howl. That was about the lot I thought. Now I include Holmes' Go which I think can stand head and shoulders high with that group. Go, buy it!It's time to take Go from the back of the bookcase, dust the cobwebs off of it, and put it up front between On the Road and Junky where it belongs. When's the film of Go being made?But nothing I've told you so far prepares you for Part 2 Chapter 8 when Luanne and Neal fight this is some kind of crescendo but we're nowhere near the end of the book yet. It's so man/woman as they really are. So much deeper into male/female relationships than anything Kerouac attempted (or could accomplish) in his books. (From what I've read of him anyway.) This is probably because Holmes being a long-time married man could empathise with male/female entwinement better than Jack who was always on the retreat from it.I've got to Page 147 (three quarters of the way through) and I'm feeling emotionally drained. I've been to a beatnik party (O.K. a Beat party) with Jack Kerouac, John Clellon Holmes, Allen Ginsberg, Holmes' wife, Neal Cassady, Luanne Henderson, (all under their stage names, or pseudonyms to be precise), find out what their pseudonyms in the book are by Googling:>GO by John Clellon Holmes (Scribner's, 1952) Character name:&lt;This cast list thanks to the Beat scholar Dave Moore, of Bristol, U.K. on his website >beatbookcovers&lt;But as I was saying courtesy of this book I've been to a Beat party, I've scoured New York city with Neal Cassady for marijuana, I've frequented several cold water walk ups (which I take to be the American way of saying bed-sits in tenement blocks where you have to boil your own water (no heating), this is the late \`forties after all). Listened to hot bop jazz on the radio with those self-same Beats as I recovered from a hangover (\\"Turn it down!\\") in one of the walk-ups. But most importantly, lived through (or observed at close quarters) the emotionally wrenching warm blooded relationships of the people concerned. Only a married man or a man who had a great rapport with women could write about personal relationships with the opposite sex so un-flinchingly, and in this book John Clellon Holmes delivers the goods.This might seem like an over-long rave review but this book is a revelation. Holmes pokes into every corner of the Beat experience leaving no roach unexamined whether he's bathing Herbert Huncke's ulcerated feet while the exhausted engenderer undergoes cold turkey or attending a post war jazz fuelled jump-joint rave he's there, recording it for posterity."},{"Title":"Go","review":"At the moment of writing I have not finished John Clellon Holmes' novel yet. My reason for writing a review now is not to discuss the book (which seems to be quite eloquent and insightful thus far), but to warn potential buyers about the e-book.

And perhaps thats it failure... it failed to gloss over too many blasie days and focus on the story... Id say... if you love the Beats, read it.

He was also one of the first African-American professors at New York University, and was later a professor at Fisk University. He also wrote books such asGod's Trombones: Seven Negro Sermons in Verse (Penguin Classics),Black Manhattan,Lift Ev'Ry Voice and Sing, etc.This novel was first published anonymously in 1912, and describes the thoughts and experiences of a man whose light skin enabled him to \\"pass\\" as white. It was also the first first-person novel written by an African-American.Here are some quotations from the book:\\"I believe it to be a fact that the coloured people of this country know and understand the white people better than the white people know and understand them.\\" (Pg. 22)\\"I felt relieved, in spite of the size of the lower class. The unkempt appearance, the shambling, slouching gait and loud talk and laughter of these people aroused in me a feeling of almost repulsion.\\" (Pg. 55-56)\\"I have since learned that this ability to laugh heartily is, in part, the salvation of the American Negro; it does much to keep him from going the way of the Indian.\\" (Pg. 56)\\"The newspapers have already told how the practice of intricate cake-walk steps has taken up the time of European royalty and nobility. These are lower forms of art, but they give evidence of a power that will some day be applied to the higher forms.\\" (Pg. 87)\\"Was it more a desire to help those I considered my people, or more a desire to distinguish myself, which was leading me back to the United States? That is a question I have never definitely answered.\\" (Pg. 147)\\"(A)mong Negroes themselves there is the peculiar inconsistency of a colour question. Its existence is rarely admitted and hardly ever mentioned ... yet this influence, though silent, is constant. It is evidenced most plainly in marriage selection; thus the black men generally marry women fairer than themselves... the effect is a tendency toward lighter complexions, especially among the more active elements in the race.\\" (Pg. 154)\\"Can you name a single one of the great fundamental and original intellectual achievements which have raised man in the scale of civilization that may be credited to the Anglo-Saxon?

I never had the desire. I know what it feels like to be discriminated against simply because of my ethnicity. These days, there are so many people of mixed blood, and yet a person with one white parent and one black parent is still considered black, always wondered why. This book doesn't explain that but it brings up a lot of things to think about. And it might start a serious, deep discussion about what it actually means to be white, or to be black, etc., why must we categorized our ethnicity? He doesn't make excuses for himself, he doesn't shift the blame to anyone but himself. He takes full responsibility for what happens to himself. Which is refreshing. And you can understand why he chooses what he does in the end (especially given the time period the book was written in). I ended up feeling sad that he has given up half of who he is, half of his own history, half of his ancestry, and that his kids will miss out on that delight too. I still don't understand that mental problem people about one drop of non-white blood excludes you from being considered white, just makes no sense to me. Blood is blood. And these days, if you've ever had a transfusion, you might be getting blood for some other race.

Quiet but potent, such a scenario inevitably causes us to what's shifted from this account, and then what hasn't. For a portion of the book this issue seemed almost too light, too much a matter of verbal prejudice rather than more fundamental realities--but it came full force near the ending, with a vivid narration of a lynching.2] Debate concerning such racism. Here the work is less succesful, and seems to a greater extent dated and less useful. The larger approach is credible enough but the exploration of racism as a component of southern pride and regional nationalism feels incomplete. The arguments analyzed here are major racist tenets, but they don't get at some of major overlapping motifs behind abhorrence. Even more deficient are the counter arguments against racist definitions of blacks and black culture. The intent is certainly laudable, but the actual speeches given--largely pointing to black music as a self-evident sign of accomplishment rather than degradation--miss a lot and close the book on assessment in a way I doubt was applicable even in the author's time.3] Attempted opting out of this issue. This element is where the book shines, showing the systemically inhumane treatment of blacks, and the ambivalent and muddled human response to this. Faced with long odds and no prospects of racial equality, the protagonist chooses--as the title indicates--to pass as white and give up efforts for a wider struggle. Not an heroic choice, but eminently understandable, and puts a far more tangible face on the many characters real and fictional who did sacrifice deeply in a question for human justice."},{"Title":"The Autobiography of an Ex-Coloured Man","review":"This product I received it in a timely matter.

As a boy, the fictional title character is sent North with his Mother to be raised in Connecticut. He does extremely well in school and is even something of a musical prodigy.But, he is stunned when one day in school a teacher asks the white students to stand, and scolds him when he joins them. He confronts his fair skinned mother and she reveals that she is indeed black and his father is a white Southern gentleman. His father later comes to visit, and even buys him a piano, but the child is unable to approach and deal with him.As a young man, the death of his mother &amp; sale of their house leaves him with a small stake &amp; he determines to attend college. Though qualified, he rules out Harvard for financial reasons &amp; heads back down South to attend Atlanta University. However, his stake is stolen from his boarding house room before he can register &amp; he ends up with a job in a cigar factory.When the factory closes, he heads North again, this time to New York City and discovers Ragtime music and shooting craps, excelling at the one &amp; nearing ruin in the other. A white gentleman who has heard him play enters into an exclusive agreement to have him play at parties &amp; subsequently takes him along on a tour of Europe.Inevitably, he is drawn back to America and to music. He tours the South collecting musical knowledge so that he will be able to compose a uniquely American and Black music. But his idyll is shattered when he sees a white lynch mob burn a black man. In the wake of this experience, he decides to &quot;pass&quot; for white--not due to fear or discouragement, but due to &quot;Shame at being identified with a people that could with impunity be treated worse than animals.&quot;Abandoning his musical ambitions, he takes a job as a clerk, does well investing in real estate &amp; meets a white woman who he wishes to marry. After examining his conscience he decides to tell her that he is black. After taking some time to confront this fact, she consents to marriage.As the novel closes, the &quot;ex-colored man&quot; tells us: &quot;My love for my children makes me glad that I am what I am, and keeps me from desiring to be otherwise; and yet, when I sometimes open a little box in which I still keep my fast yellowing manuscripts, the only tangible remnants of a vanished dream, a dead ambition, a sacrificed talent, I cannot repress the thought, that, after all, I have chosen the lesser part, that I have sold my birthright for a mess of pottage.&quot;And the reader can't help but feel profoundly ashamed of a system of racial oppression that forced a man to make these choices--a wonderful novel.GRADE: B+"},{"Title":"The Autobiography of an Ex-Coloured Man","review":"I purchased this book several years back, as part of the research for my second book. I cannot recommend any book more highly. Anyone interested at all in African American life from the 1880s to the 1930s (particularly as it was lived in New York City from about 1899 to the Harlem Renaissance) should buy it. There is not a more fascinating autobiography in print anywhere! And the life of this man! He was the founder of the first high school for African Americans in the state of Florida, located in Jacksonville (the high school my own mother would attend); the first African American to pass the bar exam in the state of Florida; part of the first successful African American Broadway composing team (after he left Jacksonville and moved to New York City); composer of the lyrics to, \\"Lift Every Voice and Sing,\\" the song long considered the African American national anthem (his brother Rosamond composed the music); a consulate in Nicaragua and Venezuela; the first executive secretary of the NAACP, in which capacity he pioneered anti-lynching legislation (though he was unsuccessful in seeing it pass, the effort is described in the book, and is a fascinating lesson in the machinations of Congressional politics in the 1920s); author of groundbreaking fiction such as, \\"The Autobiography of an Ex-Coloured Man\\"; author of the nonfiction classic, \\"Black Manhattan.\\" The list goes on... His accomplishments, his dignity and intelligence were stunning, simply awe inspiring.

Great freebie. And no, this is not the author's \\"tale\\". I am sure some of the struggles faced are based on the author's vast knowledge but this is not James Weldon Johnson's word-for-word life story, though it obviously is based on details from his personal life.from Wikipedia:The Autobiography of an Ex-Colored Man by James Weldon Johnson is the fictional telling of the story of a young biracial man, referred to only as the \\"Ex-Colored Man\\", living in post Reconstruction era America in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century. The Ex-Colored Man was forced to choose between embracing his black heritage and culture by expressing himself through the African-American musical genre ragtime, or by \\"passing\\" and living obscurely as a mediocre middle-class white man.Though the title suggests otherwise, the book is not an autobiography but a novel. However, the book is based on the lives of people Johnson knew and from events in his own life. Weldon's text is an example of a roman &agrave; clef. (Roman &agrave; clef is a term used for a novel describing real life, behind a faade of fiction)"},{"Title":"The Autobiography of an Ex-Coloured Man","review":"Johnson's novel travels through various African-American societies (New England, Jacksonville, New York City, the Black Belt) in a story of a mulatto caught between two opposing racial identities. The novel is an epic journey (emotionally and physically) of this African-American, who is light enough to &quot;pass&quot; into the white American dominating the turn-of-the century. The Ex-Coloured Man's personal struggles to reconcile his true private self with his public self in a divided and prejudiced society makes this novel an emotional and enlightening read. Johnson takes up the issue of WEB DuBois's double-consciousness, and gives it life in the form of this ambivalent protagonist."},{"Title":"The Autobiography of an Ex-Coloured Man","review":"Many novels of the African-American experience in the United States use the theme of \\"passing\\". These novels generally involve a light-complexioned African-American who can \\"pass\\" for white. Among other things, novels based on a theme of \\"passing\\" allow the character and the author to comment upon black-white relationships in the United States from both sides -- from the black experience and from the white experience.Both white and black authors have made extensive use of the theme of \\"passing\\". The earliest novel involving \\"passing\\" of which I am aware is by William Dean Howells in his short 1891 book, \\"An Imperative Duty\\" which dealt with an inter-racial marriage. The African-American novelist Nella Larsen wrote a novel titled \\"Passing\\" set in the Harlem Renaissance. More recently, Philip Roth's novel \\"The Human Stain\\" involves the story of Professor Coleman Silk, a distinguished academic and student of the classics who passes for many years as white.Coleman Silk is the successor to the protagonist of James Weldon Johnson's only novel, \\"The Autobiography of an ex-colored Man\\" written in 1912. The unnamed protagonist of the book is an individual, like Roth's character Coleman Silk, with great intellectual and artistic gifts who is torn between the opportunities open to him as an, apparently, white person and his strong sense of black identity. Like Coleman Silk and the characters in most novels involving the theme of \\"passing\\", Johnson's protagonist marries a white woman and lives a life plagued with guilt regarding his abandonment of his heritage as an African-American. Johnson's short novel is, to my mind, the best written on the theme of \\"passing\\", and it is a fine novel indeed. The book initially was published anonymously. The writing is so powerful and believable that many readers took the book for a true autobiography until Johnson acknowledged his authorship in 1914. Many years later, Johnson wrote his own autobiography, titled \\"Along This Way\\" in part to show that the story of his own life was not the story of the protagonist in the \\"Autobiography\\".Johnson's story shows how his protagonist goes back and forth, both internally and in the outward events of life, about whether to make his way in the white or in the black world. He ultimately finds himself successful but unhappy. In addition to the story line of the book, Johnson uses the \\"passing\\" theme to allow many reflective passages by characters in the book on racial relationships in the United States early in the 20th Century. The most famous such scene occurs as the protagonist travels in a \\"smoking car\\" for whites on a train in the segregated South. He participates in a discussion among several white men of varied backgrounds on the \\"race question\\" as it was viewed at the time. There is also a chilling scene in the book involving a lynching, the burning alive of a black person. Johnson worked fervently in the latter years of his life to secure the passage of anti-lynching legislation in Congress.But Johnson's novel includes a great deal more than a consideration of race issues. The book offers an outstanding picture of life in early twentieth Century America -- in the South and in Johnson's beloved New York City. The book is filled with pictures of dives and gambling dens and of the trade of cigar making in both South and North. It is filled with the love of the piano and of classical music. Most strikingly, the book has the spirit and feel of ragtime, which reached the height of its popularity during the years in which the book appeared. Johnson shows great appreciation for this product of American culture.The book also illustrates some universal themes. The protagonist is troubled, specifically, by the conflict between his identity as an African-American and his wish to succeed as a white person. But the broader themes of the book are the consequences of lack of self-knowledge, the role of chance in human life, and the consequences of a certain sense of purposelessness and frustration, which plague many individuals separately from any consideration of race. Johnson develops these themes eloquently and ties them in well with his theme of \\"passing\\".Johnson's novel is an important work of American fiction which deserves to be read."},{"Title":"The Autobiography of an Ex-Coloured Man","review":"This is not the type of book that will grab you from the beginning and hold you until the end.

I believe that was the point he was trying to make.&quot;Autobiography of An Ex-Coloured Man&quot; was not the greatest work ever written, but is was one of the most thought-provoking and challenging."},{"Title":"The Autobiography of an Ex-Coloured Man","review":"This was my first kindle book and once I started reading I could not stop.

I couldn't put this book down, proved to be one of the finest I have ever read. While not a true autobio, the tale is wonderfully told and it's free....impossible to beat!"},{"Title":"The Autobiography of an Ex-Coloured Man","review":"James Weldon Johnson (1871 -1938) was the closest American approximation possible to a Renaissance man. He is best-known for writing the lyrics to \\"Lift Every Voice and Sing\\", considered the \\"African-American National Anthem.\\" He was a poet, the author of \\"God's Trombones\\" among much else (including the poem \\"Fifty Years\\" still one of the best meditations on Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation) and of the famous novel \\"The Autobiography of an Ex-Colored Man\\" (1912). But Johnson was much more. He served several tumultuous years in diplomatic service as American counsul to Venezuela and Nicaragua. With his brother, Rosamund, and Bob Cole, he formed part of a famed and highly-successful black songwriting and Vaudeville team in the early years of the Twentieth Century. Johnson founded the first African-American high school in his home town of Jacksonville, Florida and, almost in passing, he became the first African-American admitted to the Florida bar without attending Law School (by reading law and passing a treacherous oral examination.) Johnson was a newspaper editor and a founder of the NAACP where he took an active role in litigating against laws restricting the voting rights of African-Americans, and, in particular, worked tirelessly in support of Federal anti-lynching legislation. In the final decade of his life, Johnson taught creative writing and American literature at several universities and lived, for a time, the life of contemplation and reflection that he said had been his lifelong goal.Johnson lived an inspiring life. And in his autobiography, \\"Along this Way\\" (1933) he allows the reader to share in much of it. The autobiography is a lengthy and detailed work in which Johnson not only tells the story of his life, but he also describes a good deal of African-American history in the South, where he grew up, and in the rest of the United States during the pivotal half-century following reconstruction. We can see in Johnson's story, for example, how segregation and Jim Crow gradually but forcefully came to pervade the Southern States in the late 19th and early 20th century. Johnson also gives vibrant descriptions of life in New York City, of the growth of Harlem, and of African-American singers, actors and entertainers on Broadway -- in which he himself played a prominent role. There are chilling descriptions of lynching and of Johnson's efforts to bring this barbaric practice to an end. One of the more memorable scenes of Johnson's personal life in the book is a description of how he himself was almost lynched when he was observed talking alone to a light-skinned woman in a public park in Jacksonville. (His would-be attackers thought the woman was white.)The book is divided into four main sections, with the first describing Johnson's childhood and education at Atlanta University. Part two presents a picture of New York City and Johnson's efforts as a songwriter. Part three focuses on Johnsons counsular work in Latin America while Part four discusses Johnson's work with the NAACP. But these are only the broadest, bare-bones descriptions of an extraordinary life. Johnson combines his discussion of his public life with insightful comments on most of his writings, including his poetry, novel, his history \\"Black Manhattan\\" and his work as an anthologizer of African-American poetry and of Spirituals.There are moments in the book when I wanted to know more of Johnson's inner life. He tells us, for example, of his courtship of and marriage to Grace Nail but, with the exception of some discussion of her reactions to Johnson's diplomatic posts, we see little of her in the book. Johnson is reticent, in common with most writers of autobiography, in letting us see too deeply beyond the public figure. But at the end of the book, he offers the reader some broad reflections, centering upon his agnosticism and of his hopes and ambitions for humanity.Johnson's life focused upon his efforts to secure the rights of black people in the United States, but his life, work, and writings were universal in theme. In \\"Along this Way\\" he gives us the story of a life both active and reflective. His book is a precious work of American literature."},{"Title":"The Autobiography of an Ex-Coloured Man","review":"One of the superb American autobiographies, and one of the great autobiographies of any period. After reading an example of this calibre it does not surprise me that I am rarely able to read biographies... second hand views, with some exceptions (Philip Horton's biography of Hart Crane, Frank Harris' of Oscar Wilde) are simply not sufficient....those exceptions being almost invariably written by men or women contemporaries who lived and loved in the same circle as their subject.James Weldon Johnson was a great American, not just a great African American, and a master stylist. This book is a pleasure to read both for its countless wonderful episodes and for the inspiring way of its prosody. He is one of those writers who makes you feel that his wonderful style is an organic product of a graceful upbringing, it is classic and yet unmannered...or rather the manner, being the grace, is the man, all inseparable. There is an additional poignancy in the narrative, especially in the childhood portion, deriving from our knowledge that the nobility of his home education is a thing entirely vanished from the American scene. He went to school, but was also in every sense home schooled. See the autobiography of Kenneth Rexroth for a similar example...\\"The years as they pass keep revealing how the impressions made upon me as a child by my parents are constantly strengthening controls over my forms of habit, behavior, and conduct as a man.\\" (Along the Way, p. 19, Penguin ed.)This is certainly one of the best examples of Childhood Autobiography in the World Literature of any age. It should at the very least be required reading in AP English for Black History Month. The very highest endorsement."},{"Title":"The Autobiography of an Ex-Coloured Man","review":"It was an interesting read.

It is historical fiction and draws the reader in to understand what life was like for people during that time period."},{"Title":"The Autobiography of an Ex-Coloured Man","review":"I had to read this book for a class, and it turned out to be one of the best books on the syllabus. This is a short book, but it packs a punch! For those that don't know, this book is FICTION. Weldon Johnson was not light enough to pass for white (see writer Charles Chesnutt's works--who was light enough to pass--but lived as a Black man.). Many reviews give a synopsis of the book, so I won't repeat it here. Also, this book needs to be followed up with educated analysis because some of the reviews here are way off base in their interpretation.I highly recommend this book for junior-senior high school students, college students, and those interested in early 20th century African American/American literature. Excellent!"},{"Title":"The Autobiography of an Ex-Coloured Man","review":"The Autobiography of an Ex-Colored Man is an interesting portrayal of what it's like to be black in the early 1900s. Purportedly an \\"autobiography\\", it is the story of an intelligent young man who \\"ignores the best in himself.\\" He gets his money stolen and doesn't go to college, though he's extremely talented musically. The book tells of his life, from the craps tables of New York, to high society in Europe with his \\"millionaire\\" friend. I picked this one up on a whim, and really liked it.Though extremely short, the edition I read had small font, and it is a bit difficult to get through. However, it offers some interesting insights. I particularly liked the earlier sections of the book. The narrator (who, as far as I could tell, is unnamed) is really the only main character. The other people in the story come and go; no one sticks around for very long. The narrator describes things with intelligent language and acute perception. The writing style is dense, yes, but also rewarding. The \\"race question\\" is discussed a lot; I particularly liked the scene on the train where the Texan and the Yankee soldier are debating. I can really see both sides of the argument (even the Texan's, a little bit). But, obviously, the book is not just about race.When I say it's set in the 1900s, I think it is, because the book itself makes no mention of the time period specifically, except that it's after the Civil War. The book, however, was published in 1912.There are some interesting character studies in this book too. The millionaire friend, the porter, his mother, \\"Red\\", \\"Shiny\\", etc, are all well drawn and developed.I'd never heard of this book before, and I'm glad that I read it.

His life story is fascinating and sad, but he is just down right concieted. Another reason I didn't like the narrator is that he didn't seem very reliable. I couldn't be sure that the information he was presenting was accurate (In other words, it was like the wolf's version of &quot;The Three Little Pigs.&quot;). I could rattle off dozens of reasons why I did not like this character (in the end of the book, the biracial resolved that he would live as a person.

This book is a refreshing reminder that there are shades of gray as well. Johnson's prose is very fluid and, unlike some other reviewrs, I found the story line engaging. Finally, a remark about the last line--whether or not one agrees with Johnson's assessment, it is certainly the type of statement that stays with the reader long after the book has been put down."},{"Title":"The Autobiography of an Ex-Coloured Man","review":"For a book which was first published in 1912, this is an amazingly relevant work for today. Johnson's novel (hidden in the form of an autobiography) graphically looks at relations between the races in American. The nameless main character is born in the South to an African-American mother and a white Southern aristocrat. He and his mother move to Connecticut when he is very young, allowing Johnson to show us the benevolent face of pervasive racism of the United States. Johnson avoids the easy &quot;good&quot; vs. &quot;evil&quot; view of the oppressed vs. the oppressors. Instead, the narrator becomes a permanent outcast, returning to the South upon the death of his mother and then to the ragtime era New York City. The style of the novel is clear and extremely readable--and very current. The end of the novel dives deep into the issue of racism, causing both black and white readers to question their long-held assumptions about who they are and who they appear to be to others."},{"Title":"The Autobiography of an Ex-Coloured Man","review":"This is a tragic book in a lot of ways. It is a reminder that America has not fullfilled her promise to all of her children. It would be great to read a book like this as an object lesson in the bigotry of the past. We have made some progress but there is still much to be done. James Weldon Johnson produced a wrenching tale. That it is somewhat autobiographical adds to the ambivalent narration. First the narrator feels shame in his heritage but then grows to accept himself and feel pride in who he is. This tells a tale that America is often loathe to hear but it is important nonetheless. The aspect of a mulatto man passing for white is sad. One should be allowed to feel pride in multiethnicity. This is a horrible stain on our culture that so many people had to live in denial of who they really were. This book is a valuable document of America's dark side. I would hope that it experiences a much deserved revival now that evidence of Jefferson's relationship with Sally Hemmings has reopened the discussion on this sad piece of our history. Read this book and weep but most of all read this book and learn."},{"Title":"The Autobiography of an Ex-Coloured Man","review":"This story is a very emotional recollection of a man who was both black and white. A fictional account from an autobiographical standpoint of what such a life would look like, James Weldon Johnson takes us on a journey full of sorrow, bad mistakes, a glimpse of happiness, and a life lived around the world. We see the narrator has he grows, as he discovers his heritage, as he loses himself to his desires, and as he finally realizes the course of his life.__________________________________________It was seriously the LAST paragraph that did it for me. Honestly, I had no idea what I really thought of the book until I read the last paragraph. It was crazy, going on a journey like this one and getting so acquainted with the characters, and still being unsure of how I felt. It had amazing writing, great characters, and awesome facts to back up the culture - and still it was missing something. It was just...empty. Despite all the facts and character development, despite all the places the narrator went and all the people he met, I felt that he didn't do anything. He waltzed through life with rich people, as a gambler, as a traveller, always searching for something more, always selfish. Even when he finally decides to do the right thing, he gets distracted. I wanted him so badly to do something worthwhile.Seriously, the LAST paragraph, maybe the last two paragraphs, but really the very last, turned the whole book around and took me by surprise. And while before I wasn't sure if I would recommend it, now I know that I would recommend it highly. It frustrated me, it made me feel, and it surprised me. Great book!Favorite character: the \\"girlfriend\\" or the \\"widow\\". A tie between them.Favorite aspect: Everything. But to name just a bit of it: foreign language, the way the narrator describes different cities and how the people in them live, the talks about mulatto folk in the South and in the North.... I really could go on!One word to sum up this book: Surprising. Really surprising. Please read this book!"},{"Title":"The Autobiography of an Ex-Coloured Man","review":"I found this book on the bottom shelf in my college bookcase. From the first chapter, I found myself on an old, winding, rollercoaster. James Weldon lived a life in early to mid-twentieth century more filled with extraordinary adventures than many men today. The matter that he did so 'passing' as Caucasian isn't just a coincidence. Character is what matters. . .as a reader should derive from his story; however, the matter of race devoured Weldon's every chance at completing each sweet piece of life-pie.I cannot say more to those who never understood a Black man than to read...this...book!!

My favorite thing about the book was that when the main character travels around the world. The locations and people have such lively and colorful descriptions they almost seemed real.The book was written in 1912 by James Weldon Johnson who wrote the book as if it was a factual biography.

I use this in conjunction with RACE & MEMBERSHIP (by Facing History & Ourselves- collection of readings related to Eugenics Movement in USA) and with the film, \\"Imitation of Life\\" (the color version, not not the original black and white). Be mindful that it's high-end vocabulary as the author, like many Black writers of the day, sought to not only show that the main character wanted to impress those he came in contact with but that the author himself may have been trying to prove his own intelligence in writing the novel.

If so, that individual would realize those words ring hollow. Marsh is an author who manages to successfully convey substantive messages in an otherwise common medium. She combines various genres of fiction to create a different category all her own. She's neither Terry McMillan, nor Octavia Butler - but a blissful amalgamation of the two.In The Aura Of Love, Kathy J. Marsh tells the story of Remy and Jace's forbidden relationship and all the opposition they encounter along the way. Though such a tale may sound derivative or even hackneyed on the surface, Marsh's realistic take on intercultural romance is anything but clich&eacute;'. For starters, Marsh depicts her characters as being another species of human being altogether. This is an inspired decision. It enables the reader - conventional humans like you and me - to ponder otherwise emotionally charged issues in the light of objectivity. If Marsh had adopted a more traditional approach, no doubt, such introspection might not be possible. Hitting too close to home.The Auralites are a race of teleporters that project either a blue or purple aura that is only discernible to their own kind. Human beings, consequently, are oblivious to their distinction and only see them as random people. This permits Auralites to peacefully co-exist with humanity, but not necessarily among themselves. The Auralite race is segregated along Blue and Purple covens with neither group trusting the other. Indeed, after a long and sordid history similar to America's own racial problems, the Blue and Purple are only just now beginning to advance toward social equality. But that road is a slow and arduous one.It is within this context that we meet our protagonist, Remy Rene. Remy is a sexy entrepreneur with a bevy of family, friends and business associates at her disposal. She is Essence, Time and Cosmopolitan magazine all rolled up into one. She epitomizes feminism and is totally content with her lifestyle. That is, until she meets Jace Williams. From the moment of their first encounter, Remy and Jace are totally smitten with each other. He is the missing piece to her puzzle. She is the soul mate he always wanted. He is the man of her dreams. She is the embodiment of his value system. But they are also members of opposing covens - blue and purple. Hence the problem. What will her family, friends and business associates say? Plenty!Ultimatums abound in this book. Both Jace and Remy are threatened with ostracism if they don't abandon their relationship. Those threats aren't just idle rhetoric either. As romantic love blossoms between them, their social circle quickly begins to disintegrate. And just when you things couldn't get any worse, life throws a curveball and our heroes require their social circle to avert a disaster.Will family and friends put aside their differences long enough to save innocent lives? Read this wonderful book and find out...Its interesting Marsh chose to title her book, The Aura Of Love as opposed to The Blue or Purple Aura Of Love. The reason should be obvious. Love is universal and too big to be monopolized by any one race, group or coven of people."},{"Title":"The Aura of Love","review":"When Jace and Remy meet and subsequently fall in love, the happily ever after they desire is not quite within their reach. Being of different auras, blue and purple, they face the challenges many interracial couples face today. The fact that they are both African American is beside the fact. Their auras are the basis of judgment. You can't change history, and the reality is - once upon a time the blue auras suppressed the purple. Both Jace and Remy have loved ones who are against their union. At times Remy wonders if the relationship is worth all the drama. When Jace's dad reveals a shocking secret it only adds to the couple's stressful situation. Throw in a dreaming journalist and an unsuspecting party revealing crucial information and the story takes a shocking turn.The power of love comes alive in this extraordinary debut by Kathy J. Marsh. Using auras as a metaphor for race relations she touches on a range of subjects and manages to blend them together in this cleverly written story. I was pleasantly surprised by the depth of the story and characters. There were minor editing and arrangement issues that are to be expected with one's first book. I did find there to be too much emphasis on the island (home of the auralites) with out an explanation for certain aspects, one being why the auralites were only of African American descent. Still, it was an original and entertaining story that I found a pleasure to read.EnglishrulerARC Book Club IncStar Rating: 4 Stars"},{"Title":"The Aura of Love","review":"The Aura of Love is a real thought-provoking tale by Kathy J. Marsh about a race of power possessing beings called Auralites. They are called Auralites, because of the color of their auras. Humans are unaware of their existence, because all Auralites live on an island not far from Charlotte, NC. In this race of beings, there are two covens: The Blue coven and the Purple coven. The mistrust and racism among the two covens is the main focus of this story. Remy, a Purple Auralite, is a dress maker who owns her own blooming small business. One day, while in a book store picking up the latest installment of her favorite series she meets Jace, a Blue Auarlite. After talking to Jace for awhile in the book store she realizes not only do they click, but he's one of her favorite authors. It's obvious throughout the book that the two have feelings for each other, but Remy is very hesitant about acting on her feelings because Jace is a Blue Auralite. In the meantime, unbeknownst to the Auralites, someone is telling a human reporter about their total history of existence through a series of dreams. Just as Jace and Remy come together as a couple, the Auralites discover that someone is revealing their existence when they see an article in a famous human magazine. Unfortunately, they discover who the guilty party is and who is revealing their existence. They must find the reporter before their council of leaders find him and try to put a stop to the stories. For if the council of leaders discovers who the reporter is and the Auralite who is telling him about their existence, they will put them both to death.This book was really a joy to read and have all the makings of a series. Even though it started out kind of slow, it quickly picked up and held my attention hostage. The characters were enjoyable, because they were given very realistic characteristics. I swear that I have girlfriends who have the same attitude and mannerisms as Remy's. Also, Jace and his best friend Darius reminded me of my brothers and some of my male cousins. I must say that Ms. Marsh expertly weaved a tale unlike any that I have ever read. Not only did the book have touches of mystery and family drama, but it dealt with current social and dating issues as well. Sometimes, I couldn't tell if I was reading fiction or in the middle of a discussion about the different attitudes of dating with some of my single friends. This book will really make you think and become conscious about your feelings when it comes to dating. If you really like a good book that makes you think, then I truly recommend Aura of Love.

She is a seamstress who inherited the shop from her family. She took much pride in her work and loved what she did for a living. Despite her past and the tragedies she experienced, she still enjoys her work.Jace Williams is a blue auralite who is a great author - who happens to be Remy's favorite author. When Jace and Remy meet for the first time, there is a weird connection between them.Many of their family and friends do not condone the two as a couple. Deep and dark secrets will hit the fan, sooner than expected. Will Jace and Remy remain a couple? Will the secrets destroy the two?\\"The Aura of Love\\" by Kathy J. Marsh was a very long story. It gives more than enough information regarding both characters. It is quite a scientific story with some real life realities, but overall it was an average read.I rate this book a 3. I feel the author included too many details making the story extremely long. However, the story was a different - which I liked and applaud the author for, but again, she gave too much information."},{"Title":"The Aura of Love","review":"Kathy J. Marsh, author of short stories - Struck by Lightening and Wedding Interrupted and recent nominee at the Harlem Book Fair for an African American Literary Award in the Romance category - is deserving of the many kudos she has received for her first full length novel.The Aura of love is a timeless story of love against enormous odds but it's told with a supernatural twist. Marsh has created loveable, rich characters in Jace and Remy. To the ordinary human eye they are both attractive African American professionals who seem to have a serious chemistry between them when they first meet. Those that share their secret - those known as Auralites, can see clearly that each is from a distinct coven with very different histories, histories which make them natural enemies. The star-crossed lovers find themselves having to choose between blood-ties and love-ties. Marsh uses allegory beautifully to illustrate the age old antagonist - prejudice and show how it affects our most intimate relationships - sometimes overtly and sometimes in ways we may keep hidden from ourselves.The reading is thought provoking, funny ( I laughed out loud), and subtly sexy. The story is layered with plot and sub-plot as Jace pursues Remy (brothers take a lesson), family secrets are discovered and the true nature of both friend and relative is exposed. The continuity in the telling was solid. I found no I un-dotted nor T un-crossed (not that I was looking - wink/wink). After the first crescendo and there were a few, I was leery - I had quite a lot of book to go but I was pleasantly surprised. The reading was fast paced and held my attention until the very end. I found her narration fresh and witty. Sister may have you breaking out your dictionary. I think I learned a few new words .That's what it's all about for me though - I want to be enriched in some way when I read. I was not disappointed here. Well done Kathy Marsh.Terri E.

Marsh's The Aura of Love, the monster called caste prejudice rears its ugly head within the African American community. It opens with a narrator taking a journalist, through his dreams, on a trip back in time revealing the history of the Blue and Purple Auralites. The Journalist is intrigued and begins to write a series in the human NewsNow Magazine. The Council, ruler of The Island, threatens death to the traitor and accomplices who revealed their world to humans. Everyone is suspect until proven otherwise. The drama gets heavy.Remy, a purple aural lady meets and falls in love with Jace, a blue aural, and they are dogged because of their coven differences. Intercoven dating is considered taboo. Ms. Marsh captures it in a modern-day fresco, tracking prejudice through family and friends. What is more, this type of prejudice still exists today.Kara, Remy's friend who has a blue aura, suffers a broken psyche when she learns disturbing news about her real family. Both Jace and Remy's parents go through emotional breakdowns attempting to deal with their personal caste demons. Reggie, Jace's brother, and Sasha, Remy's sister, contrive to perpetrate evil on the couple because of their relationship. It's one thing after another for poor Jace as he fights for temper control. He obviously stole my heart.Kathy's journey through \\"another world,\\" and yet not, is smoothly written and filled with well-developed characters. I couldn't help but experience her story of misunderstanding, prejudice, hate and love. It was most entertaining. Kathy J. Marsh has a bright future as a writer. I suspect her next novel will be even more exciting. If you like speculative fiction, you'll love The Aura of Love.

She pays attention to details, such as how the Auralites get along with humans on the mainland. Their history is a fascinating parallel to black and white relationships that is treated with delicacy and empathy.I came to care for Remy and Jace, as well as their equally well-drawn friends and relations. The plot has all the off-again on-again stress of a good love story with the added interest of finding out who is the betrayer of their culture.

THIS BOOK WILL START SLOW AND STEADY, BUT WILL END FAST AND FURIOUS!!!!!!!! I AM AWAITING THE SEQUEL."},{"Title":"The Aura of Love","review":"In \\"The Aura of Love,\\" Kathy J. Marsh writes about exotic beings that live on an island that is cloaked by their special powers so humans cannot detect their aepeaceful existence. These beings are powerful, superhuman, can heal themselves and usually live longer than two human lifetimes combined. However, a peaceful existence has only been a recent state for them.Like humans they were segregated by their aura, having to deal with one Auralite oppressing the other. Each being gives off either a purple or blue aura, which is why they are referred to as Auralites. Marsh writes a tale of two Auralites, a blue and a purple one, overcoming the odds of discrimination and hate to love one another and that is only the beginning.The tale of Jace (a fine blue brother) and Remy (a fine purple sister) has great potential. Of course it has components of your typical romance, boy meets girl, boy gets girl and boy loses girl only to get her again; however, the fantastical element of super human beings that can disappear and reappear for traveling purposes adds an intrigue that has gravitational powers. The story itself is interesting, well paced, funny and moving. Marsh has a gift for portraying humor in words. I actually had a few laugh-out-loud moments.With that said, the editing and formatting left lots to be desired. There are issues that need to be fleshed out such as where did the Auralites come from, what is their purpose and why are they all African American. There are also language discrepancies. Slang and plain old bad grammar are not necessarily one in the same. At times it was hard to believe that educated people would use in-your-face bad grammar being that Jace is an author and Remy is a sophisticated businesswoman. Lastly, the grammatical issues were practically nil; however, a book with this much potential deserved to be tightened.Although, \\"The Aura of Love\\" is plagued with editing and formatting issues, Marsh is to be commended for her imagination and how she wove the story together. The concept is great! I also enjoyed how she paralleled the concerns of racism, interracial dating, reparations and other race related issues between the aural world and the human one. Marsh packed quite a bit into this one novel, actually making it one that I surprisingly enjoyed. Unfortunately, the execution was lacking. Nevertheless, Marsh is definitely an author to be on the look out for.Wanda M. TobyAPOOO BookClub"},{"Title":"The Aura of Love","review":"Kathy is a true wordsmith in every sense of the word!

So much hurt, pain, and hatred still linger; and so many people continue to see race rather than seeing a person for who he or she is.I love the obstacles the characters are challenged to overcome.

Well done, Kathy, well done!"},{"Title":"The Aura of Love","review":"Reviewed by Linda Benninghoff for Reader Views (11/06)In this riveting novel, Kathy J. Marsh tells the story of a blue Auralite and a purple Auralite dating. As the story goes on, a complete imaginative picture of the island on which two Auralites, Jace and Remy, live is built up. The novel purports to be a paranormal romance, yet there is little of the paranormal about it. The Auralites do have some magical powers, but really they resemble human beings--and these human beings are fully drawn. They are all Afro-American, their purple and blue auras invisible to the humans who see them. The story is rich, and, while it is a page-turning romance, it is also social commentary.The world of the island, set in the Caribbean where blue Auralites at one time exploited purple Auralites, resembles the United States with its former slavery and current race relations. As Remy, a purple Auralite, dates Jace, a blue Auralite, the story centers around the difficulties of interracial dating. The repercussions for Remy and Jace are vast. Remy loses business clients, and Jace, at least for awhile, loses a mother.The fantastic society of purple and blue Auralites doesn't have any seams showing. The characterization is rich. Besides being about interracial dating, this book is also about families. Jace, who is a noted author, is very much involved with his mother, father and brother. The parents and siblings enter into the drama and become three-dimensional when they find they have some relatives they knew nothing about.Remy's family and friends are also three-dimensional. Sasha, her sister, disapproves of blue Auralites and disapproves of her dating Jace. Her friend, Kara, also disapproves--so much so that she behaves cruelly, in a way that is out of character for her. Remy and Kara part company, at least for a while.I thought this story was a successful metaphor for race relations in our own country. It is a story in its own right too, and I found the idea of the island in the Caribbean, where purple and blue Auralites live, so believable that I thought I could travel there and visit, if only I knew its secret location. It was the romance that interested me most and forms the backbone of the story. Through ups and downs, Jace and Remy try to stay together and manage to discover that love is stronger than purple or blue auras. This was an excellent and meaningful book. As I turned the pages of \\"The Aura of Love,\\" the tension heightened and I couldn't put it down.Book received free of charge."},{"Title":"The Aura of Love","review":"Enchanting and amazing is Kathy J.

Marsh is the tale of love on an island inhabited by the Auralites, people who hide their island from humans by casting a veil over it. It is invisible even though they are close to Charlotte, North Carolina. Remy Renee falls in love with Jace Williams, best-selling author of a book about vampires. The only problem is Remy is a purple Auralite and Jace is a blue Aralite. The two should never mix, according to most Auralites. Back in the 1800s, the blue Aralites took advantage of the purples and more or less enslaved them, forcing them work for humans and give them, the purples, most of their paychecks. From then on the prejudice between the two groups was rampant. Neither Jace nor Remy could help the way they felt about each other and so they most definitely suffered the consequences of a society brought up in hate.This is a fantastic story that is so reminiscent of black and white relations in the United States. The parallels are astounding. Jace and Remy, two very well developed characters, falter and sometimes fall as they attempt to deal with not only the prejudice of friends but also of family. Jace's mother is particularly virulent, with Remy's not far behind. It forces Jace and Remy to make hard choices, as I am sure people in black and white relationships must do. Marsh keeps the tension going and the interest up. It's hard to put down.

Now the rcc refutes these truths. I'm nearly sixty now and have turned my life over to Jesus Christ some 10 years ago after searching for the truth that God chose to reveal to me.

I will print the jacket of my copy below for reference..................................................................Roman Catholicism By Lorraine Boettner The widespread activity of the Roman Catholic Church makes it imperative that all Christians regardless of denomination should know something about it's doctrines, it's practices and it's goals for the future. Dr. Boettner has written an interesting and informative book from the viewpoint of evangelical Protestantism which presents the two systems in strong contrast. The present day Roman Catholic Church is compared with the Church of the first century. And Protestantism is shown to be not a new system that arose at the time of the reformation, as some have attempted to represent, but a return to New Testament Christianity and the simplicity of the apostolic Church. Constant reference is made to Scripture teaching,and the material is presented in non-technical language that the average Christian can follow with ease. Some of the major subjects discussed are: The Church, The Priesthood, Tradition, Peter, The Papacy, Mary, The Mass, The Confessional, Purgatory, the Infallibility of the Pope, Penance, Indulgences, Salvation by Grace, Ritualism, Celibacy, Marriage, The Parochial School, Contrasting Moral Standards, Intolerance and Religious Persecution. Historical aspects and the relationship of Church and State are also dealth with. Designed to be a standard work on the subject, this book undoubtedly will live for years as the most comprehensive and penetrating analysis available fo the two systems. It is an Evangelical Book Club selection................................................................My name is Scott D. Berner, I am a Baptist minister and have studied the Roman Catholic Church for many years. Dr. Boettner's book is an EXCELLENT reference work and highly educational. I value it highly as part of my personaly library and refer to it's documentation regularly in sermons and radio broadcasts. It is a work of Truth.The chapters on Roman Catholic doctrine are witout error or misrepresentation, I can assure the customers of Amazon of this. To the very best of my ability and study of these matters I do so attest this to be true.In chapter 18 of this great book, &quot;XVIII - Intolerance - Bigotry - Persecution&quot; , one may find a rare expose of the true historical record of this religious institution. To rate this book anything but FIVE STARS is almost a sin. I just thought I would take a minute to set the record straight. May God bless all who read this book with understanding and boldness to stand for the Truth.Just for the record I would disagree with Dr. Boettner on numerous of his doctrinal teachings. I do not espouse the Presbyterian doctrines, for I am a Freewill Baptist and find this to be closer to the &quot;faith ONCE delivered to the saints&quot;. However, our differences being what they are, still, I cannot but recommend this book for all students of history and the Roman Catholic Church. It is a worthy book. I thank Amozon for making this book available to the masses. It is my staunch opinion that every faithful Christian should have a copy of this book!"},{"Title":"Roman Catholicism","review":"Catholic apologetics cannot ignore Boettner's account of the Inquisition, the Hugenot Holocaust of 1572 or the overall political machine which smokescreens its hidden agenda behind a non-scriptural, works-oriented system.

The CCC is cross referenced with the Holy Bible so one can read the Roman Catholic side of the argument.If in the end one still disagrees with the teachings of the Roman Catholic Church, at least that person went to the source for accurate information.For a side trying to refute a theory or in this case religious denomination it is unethical as a scholar to present a presentation of your opposing theory in what can be proceed as an unbiased way.In short if one wants to learn about Roman Catholicism go to the source, in this case the Catechism of the Catholic Church. If one wishes to learn about Fundamentalism one can read any number of works by several educated Fundamentalist writers.This is a poor work.(Also a note should be made that not all Catholics who believe in Papal succession and the Mass are \\"Roman Catholics\\" or Latin Rite Catholics; there are over 20 liturgical rites in the Catholic Church.

Hmmm, kind of like Pope John Paul II was not a good ally of President Reagan ? John Paul II and his support of Solidarirty was not at all helpful ?

The book was brought to my attention by my wife who has many Catholic friends who she said were very upset by this book. So I took it upon myself to objectively read the book to see for myself what all the controversy was all about.When I read Boettner's book (Yes I did read the entire book, all 466 pages of it) I found so many flaws, made up dates, councils that did NOT take place, and unsubstantiated claims just in the first few chapters, that I HAD to completely finish the book just to see for myself how much of a bigoted author this Loraine Boettner is, and WHY he would write such a book.In the end Boettner never tells the reader WHY he wrote this book, but if I were a Psychologist of a Psychiatrist I would come to the conclusion that here is a man (Boettner) who is extremely jealous of the Roman Catholic Church, and has such a visceral hatred of the Catholic Church that his religiously demented personality demanded that he put down in writing what was in his mind.When Boettner wrote this book it was published in 1962. Why he couldn't wait until the end of the 2nd Vatican Council (1962-1965) probably tells me that he had to put down in writing his pent up hatred before the Catholic Church, through the results of the conclave, changed any of his antagonisms. From what I have read about Vatican II it has changed the Catholic Church a lot, while still maintaining the core beliefs of the Catholic Church that go directly back to the time of Christ.Loraine Boettner did not die until January 1990, but he never wrote a direct rebuttal to this book. Which will lead you to ask WHY? The answer is simple: After the book was released it was clear that Boettner made a fool of himself, and to admit that he was wrong in his dates and other fantastic claims he would have been made to look like more of a fool.It was noted straight away that Boettner's book \`Roman Catholicism' was full of false information and unsubstantiated claims. At the time of it's publication Boettner was already an author who had four previous books published. And for him to admit in a follow up book that he was wrong, would have had him put on a \`Black List' of writers never to be published again, despite his Publisher being; The Presbyterian and Reformed Publishing Company. This publisher of Theological works is known for their theological bigotry, against any Church or organization that doesn't believe what they do, but especially against the Catholic Church. But it still does not answer the question why this book has been reprinted again, and who is responsible for the book being reprinted.In the introduction alone Boettner lists dates that are not accurate, not just by years or decades, but by CENTURIES! And he goes on to invent councils and conclaves that never happened. True, some of councils he lists did take place, but in referring to these councils and what was the major theological item that that council will be remembered for are totally inaccurate. To a theologically un-educated individual it seems that he is an impressive writer that took the time to investigate all he wrote is true and accurate, so naturally the reader assumes everything being written is true and correct.The one thing that got me to read Boettner's book in it's entirety is that in his introduction Boettner lists 44 items that he calls; \\"Some Roman Catholic Heresies and Inventions\\" and goes on to list the dates of their Adoptions over a period of 1650 years. To the un-educated individual this seems impressive, to start his book with such bravado. But with me Boettner was dealing with an individual who took the time to really investigate these \`Heresies and Inventions.' No matter what were Boettner's thoughts as he wrote these \`Heresies and Inventions' there were too many to hit the reader with at the very beginning of the book, and second they sounded too fantastic. In investigating these claims I found that every one of these 44 claims were not only un-substantiated, but downright fraudulent and full of half-truths.There is an old saying that says that a man who tells lies, like politician tend to do, simply hides the truth. A man who tells the truth, like a military officer when questioned by his superior, is an honorable individual. But a man who tells half-truths, like Boettner, has simply forgotten where and what the truth is.It didn't take me long in reading Loraine Boettner book to realize that he epitomizes the old axiom that was used so successfully by Adolph Hitler. Boettner's claims are so fantastic that like Hitler, Boettner is one that thinks, by his writing; \\"If you tell a big enough lie, People will believe it.\\"Boettner tries to give the impression to the reader that he is an academic, when all he is, is a frustrated bigoted writer who is so jealous, and so scared of the Catholic Church that he MUST tell lies that are big enough that people will believe him.Just to give an example of the wild claims that Boettner writes to try to make the reader believe he is an academic, are his claims that the Roman Catholic Church did nothing to help defeat the spread of communism throughout the world and that only the Protestant nations of the world were the only catalysts in fighting Communism. Boettner even goes on to name countries like the United States, Canada, The Netherlands and Spain having spearheaded the fight against the spread of Communism.This again sounds to the reader that Boettner did a good investigative job in naming what he claims are predominant Protestant countries that were leading the fight against Communism.However I'm one who believes that statistics don't lie and one only has to look at statistics to show that in Canada 42.6% of the population is Catholic, as opposed to Protestants representing only 23.3% of the population. In the Netherlands Roman Catholicism is the largest Christian denomination, larger than all the other Christian denominations put together. *In the United States Roman Catholicism has a membership of 74,455,877 million persons, far outdistancing the closest Protestant denomination of Baptists whose membership in July 2010 was recorded at 32,591,991 million individuals divided into 19 different Baptist sects, with the Southern Baptist Convention being the largest with a membership total of 16,228,438. *Then we have Spain, who was been a very strong and supportive member of NATO, where 94% of the population of over 40,500,000 million people profess Catholicism as their Religion. *Finally in the fight against Communism, lets look at Poland where 89.8% of the population of over 38,500,000 million people are Roman Catholic.*During the cold war the government of this Poland may have been communist, but it was the courageous fight of the people of Poland that started the domino effect that eventually toppled every country in Europe that were members of the Warsaw Pact and at one time had a Communist government loyal to Moscow.*Bottner's total ignorance of how the communist system of government works shows out here. In the Marxist-Leninist Communist system of government only 10% of the total adult population were allowed to become \`card-carrying' members of the party. Levin believed that the smaller the number of dedicated Communists that held the reigns of power would suffice to keep the country under the yoke of Communism.This is why we have countries like Poland, Hungry, East Germany, Bulgaria, Romania and Czechoslovakia, for example, where extremely small numbers of loyal Communists controlled the government while large segments of the population never belonged or supported the Communist system of government they had between 1945 and 1989.Hence you have seen uprisings starting in Czechoslovakia in 1948 against Communism, which ended when the President of Czechoslovakia was \`pushed' out the window of the upper floor of the Hradcany Castle by Communist agitators to take over the government of that formally \`free' country after World War II. Other uprisings against Communist rule were in Poznan, Poland in June of 1956, in Budapest, Hungary in late summer and early fall of 1956, and again in Czechoslovakia in 1968 only 2 months before the Olympic Games.Who can forget the look on the Czech athletes at the Olympic Games in Mexico City in the fall of 1968 when any Czech athlete was on the same stand to receive their medal with an athlete from the Soviet Union. Not only would they not shake the hand of the Soviet athlete, but actually walked off the stand if the Soviet athlete received the gold medal and the Soviet national anthem was played.All of these uprisings prior to 1989 resulted in the small minority of the people that formed the government of those countries having to call on the Soviet Union to send in tanks and the military from the Soviet Union to squash these uprisings.And this dynamic 'domino effect' was directly caused by the fall of the communist government in Poland, again a country whose population was made up of almost 90% Roman Catholics.The fall of the communist government of Poland was followed shortly afterward by the fall of the communist governments of Hungry, Czechoslovakia, and even the former communist state of the DDR, the Deutsche (German) Democratic Republic of East Germany, and eventually Russia herself in 1991.Do you remember that November of 1989 when the Berlin Wall came down?Even \\"Republics\\" in the old USSR split away from Moscow, leaving only the \\"Republic\\" of Russia on its own. Among the modern day countries that were created after the fall of communism in the former Soviet Union are: The Ukraine and Belarus, not to mention the formation of the three Baltic Countries that were all former \\"Republics\\" in the Soviet Union of: Estonia, Latvia, and finally Lithuania, who population is 79% Roman Catholic.**All these figures can be substantiated by referring to the \\"CIA World Factbook, 2011\\" which is available thru Amazon, or any reputable book retailer.I could spend page after page in listing all the unsubstantiated claims Boettner makes in his book, many of which are just downright lies written to make the reader believe what they are reading are the true facts.In the end I could say is that this book could be considered a \\"Hate\\" book written by someone who really does hate the Roman Catholic Church. I find it very interesting that the Roman Catholic Church itself ignores Boettner's book, and many of the other Anti-Catholic literature, and leaves it up to laity of the church to defend it from hate mongering writers like Loraine Boettner, and other virulent Anti-Catholic writers like Bob Jones and Jimmy Swaggart, because the church itself has better things to do than to answer all the Anti-Catholic Hate literature, and leaves these \`rebuttals' up to the laity of the Church through organizations like \\"Catholic Answers\\" based in El Cajon, California.Just consider that if this book had been written against the Jewish faith, the Anti-Defamation League would have had Boettner in court long ago, but the Roman Catholic Church would rather spread the word of Christ and let these hate writers burn themselves out as will be their eventual fate.One last observation in regards to Boettner's book is that I spent many, many years in Europe, and it is only in America that these books are published to any large degree. Which brings me to ask myself the question of; Why is it that only in America do hate filled Anti-Catholic fundamentalists write this trash.If I could give the book NO Stars at all I would, but Amazon requires I give a book a rating from 1 to 5 stars. Well here is a hate filled book that is full of lies and unsubstantiated claims that make the writer look about 2\\" tall.No matter how many times this book continues to be reprinted, it only shows that there are still more hate filled Anti-Catholic mongers out there trying to spread Loraine Boettner's bigoted views. This book should be pulled from the shelves of all reputable bookstores, and thrown into the trash.And don't forget that the author of this review comes from a family that is Lutheran!"},{"Title":"Roman Catholicism","review":"Highly unscholarly.

And no ill will should be held towards them. I as a Catholic may have done the same if I had been born into similar circumstances as those well meaning yet misinformed Christians. Let all Catholics remember the words of Archbishop Sheen, \\"There are not one hundred people in the United States who hate The Catholic Church, but there are millions who hate what they wrongly perceive the Catholic Church to be.\\"In this day and age however, there is no reason whatsoever to take the claims of this book at face value when so many of its accusations can be disproved with a simple google search. Karl Keating's book Catholicism vs Fundamentalism soundly puts to rest the untruths of Boettners opus. I would recommend his website Catholic Answers to any Protestants who would like to get an honest presentation of Catholic Doctrines.

If you want to read about Catholicism, try reading the Catechism of the Catholic Church,also try the Bible, it's also a good Catholic book since it was a Catholic council in the 4th Century which compiled the Bible and declared the books sacred and canonical, I think many forget that the Bible did not just fall down from the sky, there were hundreds of Christian books and Gospels, e.g. The Gospel of Thomas, and it was the Catholic Church, the only Church in existence who compiled,proclaimed,and preserved the Bible. Consequently this being True not only is The Bible inerrant, but also the Council of the Catholic Church which proclaimed it 'sacred and canonical'. Please if you want to read about Catholicism go and read what She herself teaches, why don't you are ya too afraid? I know Luther was afraid when he read the whole Bible, so scared he had to rip seven books out.

Where do I start?...it leads me to ask the question, what in the world was this publisher thinking? Boettner's book stands upon the rantings of unhappy Catholics and the anti-Catholic works of people such as Paul Blanshard and his ilk. Relying upon such people is like relying upon your political candidate to tell you all the \\"great stuff\\" about their opponent! Blatantly unbalanced, Boettner theatricizes a parody of the Catholic view and simply refutes that. Sadly deficient.It is unfortunate that this man did NOT do his homework when writing this unbalanced work. In the words of Karl Keating, \\"But he was not as interested in accuracy as in sensationalism, which is always the enemy of truth. This story is such a great blow against the Catholic Church-why spoil it with the facts?\\"In my fact finding perusal at the library, I came across Karl Keating's book CATHOLICISM AND FUNDAMENTALISM.

Since this book is the one from which many of my Protestant friends received theor view of the Catholic Church, either directly or indirectly, I thought I would read it to see, as it were, what the \\"other side\\" was saying.Clearly Boettner has done some serious research for this book. He cites from a multitude of sources in his vitriolic attack upon the Church. And therein lies the problem. According to Boettner, apparently, anything written by any Catholic over the 2,000 years of the Church is definative Catholic doctrine (as least so far as when he agrees with it). A catechism written by a priest is not a definative statement of Catholic Doctrine and can be, and indeed sometimes is, wrong. Should I damn all Protestant doctrine because Marting Luther wrote \\"The Jews and Their Lies\\" in which he advocated burning down synagogues and denying Jews the right to praise God or to use the Torah?Boettner takes great delight in setting up his own straw-men and then merrily knocking them down. Even when Boettner does quote from official Church documents, they are often quoted partially or out of context.I grant that there are some serious differences between Catholic theology and Protestant theology. A reasoned, scriptural and historical debate on such issues can go far in understanding where we agree and where we differ. (c.f. Norman Geisler's Roman Catholics and Evangelicals: Agreements and Differences).

It is so funny and out of date that I can remember it by rote.&quot;If the United States were to become Roman Catholic, the result, undoutedly, would be the conquest of this nation and the rest of the world by Russian Communism&quot;.Don't get me wrong, I think the RC church is fatally flawed and unbiblical - but linking Commies and Catholics is not only unwarranted, but hysterical.

Among the modern day countries that were created after the fall of communism in the former Soviet Union are: The Ukraine and Belarus, not to mention the formation of the three Baltic Countries that were all former \\"Republics\\" in the Soviet Union of: Estonia, Latvia, and finally Lithuania, who population is 79% Roman Catholic.**All these figures can be substantiated by referring to the \\"CIA World Factbook, 2011\\" which is available thru Amazon, or any reputable book retailer.I could spend page after page in listing all the unsubstantiated claims Boettner makes in his book, many of which are just downright lies written to make the reader believe what they are reading are the true facts.In the end I could say is that this book could be considered a \\"Hate\\" book written by someone who really does hate the Roman Catholic Church. I find it very interesting that the Roman Catholic Church itself ignores Boettner's book, and many of the other Anti-Catholic literature, and leaves it up to laity of the church to defend it from hate mongering writers like Loraine Boettner, and other virulent Anti-Catholic writers like Bob Jones and Jimmy Swaggart, because the church itself has better things to do than to answer all the Anti-Catholic Hate literature, and leaves these \`rebuttals' up to the laity of the Church through organizations like \\"Catholic Answers\\" based in El Cajon, California.Just consider that if this book had been written against the Jewish faith, the Anti-Defamation League would have had Boettner in court long ago, but the Roman Catholic Church would rather spread the word of Christ and let these hate writers burn themselves out as will be their eventual fate.One last observation in regards to Boettner's book is that I spent many, many years in Europe, and it is only in America that these books are published to any large degree. Which brings me to ask myself the question of; Why is it that only in America do hate filled Anti-Catholic fundamentalists write this trash.If I could give the book NO Stars at all I would, but Amazon requires I give a book a rating from 1 to 5 stars. Well here is a hate filled book that is full of lies and unsubstantiated claims that make the writer look about 2\\" tall.No matter how many times this book continues to be reprinted, it only shows that there are still more hate filled Anti-Catholic mongers out there trying to spread Loraine Boettner's bigoted views. This book should be pulled from the shelves of all reputable bookstores, and thrown into the trash.And don't forget that the author of this review comes from a family that is Lutheran!"},{"Title":"Roman Catholicism","review":"Unscholarly would be too nice a term for this book.

Nothing changed with Vatican II (or it shouldn't have if the RCC is as unchanging as it's adherents like to claim, or did we get a new and different RCC with Vatican II, in which case it's not the same church as the original and would be in contradiction to the original teachings, making it apostate).In any case, give the man his due (though I disagree with his Reformed position myself) and recognize his work for the excellent documentation and him for the scholar that he was."},{"Title":"Roman Catholicism","review":"I agree that this could have been written with a lot more love and a lot less judgment.

Boettner's book is, however, also infamous. The book's infamy stems from its method of argumentation which combines various strategies: not only biblical exegesis, citation of Reformed creeds, quotations from Protestant authorities, and social analysis, but also innuendo, guilt by association, half-truths, and distortions of Roman Catholic teaching. Today, the book is also rather dated, failing to take account of the Second Vatican Council and other developments in 20th century Roman Catholic biblical and theological studies. For all its 450 pages, there is very little of continuing and helpful substance. It is, however, fun to read and bears witness to the polemics of an earlier era (one would wish!).I do not have the space here to give a complete analysis of Boettner's shortcomings, but will cite some representative examples. Moreover, I do not speak here as an apologist for the Roman Catholic church. I am, in fact, like Boettner, a Reformed Protestant, though also a philosophy professor at a Roman Catholic University. It does not seem to me, however, that the cause of Protestant Christianity is well-served by inaccurate portrayals of other traditions or criticisms that only attack straw men. I write this review, then, on behalf of truth.Boettner's first chapter combines various ends: defining Protestantism, attempting to associate Catholicism with communism, accusing Catholicism of developing various heresies and inventions, and painting a portrait of the supposedly sad state of Roman Catholic nations. Let's consider his discussion of the &quot;heresies&quot; and &quot;inventions&quot; which he implies are held to be part of the unchanging and infallible teachings of the Roman Catholic Church and thus are &quot;binding&quot; upon all Catholics (pages 7-10).In point of fact, very little of what he mentions would fall into that category. For instance, fasting on Fridays, the temporal power of popes, the withholding of the cup from the laity, and the use of Latin, have all changed since they were never a matter of Catholic &quot;doctrine&quot; per se. Moreover, Boettner distorts the implementation of many of these practices. For instance, the &quot;imposition&quot; of the Latin language by Gregory in AD 600 was done in order that the liturgy might be celebrated in the common language of the people (i.e., Latin), rather than in the Greek that was widely used up to that time. Likewise, while the discipline of celibacy was required for most priests since 1079, that is only true in the Latin rite of the Catholic Church. In the Eastern rite, married priests have always been permitted and are to this day. Nor was the Bible ever &quot;forbidden to laymen&quot; by a Council of Valencia in 1229. For one thing, there was no council in Valencia in 1229 since it was under Islamic control. A local council with local authority, however, was held in Toulouse that year and it did temporarily (and quite understandably) limit the use of the Bible by roving lay-preachers who were spreading the Albigensian heresy.As another example, we can consider Boettner's treatment of the mass in chapter eight. It is evident here that the book is quite dated, presupposing a eucharistic liturgy which hasn't been enacted (except rarely) in three decades (pages 169-171). Boettner's discussion of the Roman Catholic priesthood and the &quot;sacrifice of the mass&quot; gives little indication of any detailed knowledge about those doctrines, their histories, or their current status. For instance, he appears unware of centuries of debate among Roman Catholic theologians on whether the notion of the eucharistic &quot;sacrifice&quot; is to be taken in an &quot;oblationist&quot; or &quot;immolationist&quot; fashion. The &quot;oblationist&quot; view focuses more upon Christ's present priestly intercesssion before the Father. The &quot;immolationist&quot; view, on the other hand, focuses more upon Christ's presence upon the altar in a figure of death. While the latter view is certainly problematic for Protestants and the view against which we have traditionally objected, it is the former view (&quot;oblationism&quot;) which has gained ascendency in the 20th century and thus must be addressed today. And I know of no Roman Catholic theologian who would agree with Boettner's description that the mass is a &quot;re-crucifixion&quot; of Jesus and few who would even accept the language of the mass as a &quot;continuation&quot; of the sacrifice of Calvary (page 174). Unfortunately, Boettner's almost complete lack of bibliographical references to Catholic authorities makes it difficult to know from where he drew his information.I cite these few examples as representative of the ways in which Boettner's book falls short. As Protestants we certainly must maintain a faithful witness to Reformation truth, but that task is not advanced by careless scholarship, distortion of one's opponents, and slipshod argumentation. While there are some things of value in Boettner's classic book, I would advise those who are interested in understanding the teachings of the Roman Catholic Church to refer to offical documents (the catechism, councils, encyclicals) and their prominent interpreters among recent theologians."},{"Title":"Roman Catholicism","review":"I read this book back in the early 90's when it was given to me by a fundamentalist co-worker. I was a lax Catholic at the time who sailed through 12 years of Catholic schooling without ever really delving deep into my faith. I read the book with interest, and an open mind, since I already began having some serious challenges with what my friend was teaching me about the \\"obvious contradictions\\" (as he saw them) between Biblical teachings and Catholic doctrine. I found many of Dr. Boettner's historical accusations so over the top, and distorted that I soon began to question his scholarship (not to mention his motives) on everything else.My curiosity was piqued and I began to devour every book I could find that would shed some light on how the early Christians read and understood scripture (starting with William A. Jurgens', \\"Faith of The Early Fathers\\") . It took the good Dr. Boettner to get me interested enough to finally begin searching for the truth - and it led me deeper into the Faith I was raised in. Thanks Dr. Boettner!"},{"Title":"Roman Catholicism","review":"Boettner's work has been on my shelf for some time, has been read more than once, and frankly it amazes me that the publishers will not update or edit the work. If it's such a wonderful seller, maybe they don't want to \\"mess with success\\".The work reads well and lacks some of the caustic tone seen in these reviews. It lacks sound references in an academic sense - i.e., footnotes, bibliographies to specific editions, etc., typical for the time but unacceptable today. The reason? Because some of Boettner's facts are just wrong. Look at \\"Some Roman Catholic Heresies and Inventions in the introduction. \\"Baptizing of bells\\" is presented so the reader thinks that bells are actually baptized, a simply unexcusable stretch of the facts in a book filled with such items.Boettner consistently uses religious terms that mean different things to Protestants and Roman Catholics. This is the root of much of the book's misleading statements and a cause of this controversy. As Christians (you potential reader) I suggest you refrain from this book and look elsewhere. There are many better books (on both sides of the controversy!) That this one sells is largely due to the nature of the audience that reads it, an audience afraid to have its assumptions challenged and afraid to undertake the difficult labor of validating this work. Don't take this short-cut. Get James White's \\"The Roman Catholic Controversy\\" or on the other side try Karl Keating's book. Both of these writers do a good job of presenting the case as Christians ought to do, and include academically rigorous footnotes, bibiographies, etc. Those are good values for the money.Pick a side, pick a better book. But don't pick this one. It is dramatically outdated and very often clearly incorrect regarding today's Roman Catholic church.By way of disclosure, I'm Protestant clergy with a theology training from the University of Cambridge."},{"Title":"Roman Catholicism","review":"\\"Divine tradition is the writings of the fathers and doctors of the catholic church. Now God is infallible, so divine tradition should be also. But Boettner writes that Augustine, a prolific church father, wrote a book of retractions to his writings later in life. Another Church doctor, Alphonsus Liguori, in his book, the means of salvation and perfection, wrote that if God willed all the angels to go to hell, they would willingly do so to follow the divine will. This is absurd since God cannot make a contradiction.\\"In response to this post and this book, all I can say is that people need to do a better job of understanding what it is they are trying to condemn. First, Boettner misleads the reader to believe that Augustine \\"comes to his senses later in life\\". Maybe the reader should, himself, read Augustine to find the TRUTH. Boettner also attempts to build up a Catholic strawman and then knock it down. He does it well (who couldn't). In fact, if this was actually what the Church taught, I would be objecting myself. Furthermore, he is dishonest, which is a cardinal sin for a \\"scholar\\".For starters, Catholic tradition is not the \\"writings of the fathers and doctors of the Catholic Church\\". The Church fathers bear witness to Apostolic Tradition, but they aren't in themselves \\"Tradition\\". Thus, a Church Father OR Doctor CAN err. Their writings are only accurate in as much as they agree with what the Church has always taught. This does not mean that our understanding cannot grow or expand. However, teachings cannot be contradicted (i.e. cold-blooded murder is never morally acceptable). The teaching on infallibility only extends to matters of faith and morals. And that only extends to the Magisterium. Thus, a Pope declaring that one Bible is better than another one is not a contradiction on infallibility. \\"Faith and Morals\\" simply put are articles of the faith that are necessary for our salvation along with moral teachings that guide our faith.Furthermore, the teaching on infallibility only states that the Holy Spirit will PREVENT the CHURCH from teaching error in these areas. It does not extend to INDIVIDUALS, except the Holy Father (in Ex Cathedra pronouncements). These rarely occur. Thus, both the author's accusations and all critics of Catholic (Apostolic) Tradition are unfounded. Remember, all you critics of Catholic Tradition, the words of St. Paul, \\"So then Brothers, stand firm and hold to the TRADITIONS we brought to you, whether by word of MOUTH or by LETTER\\" (2 Thess 2:15). Also, that the \\"CHURCH of the living God, (IS) the PILLAR and FOUNDATION of TRUTH\\" (1 Tim 3:15). Thus, Scripture (which is a part of Tradition itself, said St. Paul in 2 Thess 2:15) bears witness to the Church's teaching on Tradition. A teaching that was handed down by Christ and the Apostles in the once and for all, complete deposit of faith.To sum it up, let us see what the Church teaches about it's own beliefs on Tradition. \\"Sacred Tradition and Sacred Scripture, then, are bound closely together and communicate one with the other. For both of them, flowing out from the same divine well-spring, come together in some fashion to form one thing and move towards the same goal\\" (CCC, 80). \\"The Tradition here in question comes from the apostles and hands on what they received from Jesus' teaching and example and what they learned from the Holy Spirit. The first generation of Christians did not yet have a WRITTEN NEW TESTAMENT, and the New Testament itself demonstrates the process of living Traidition. Tradition is to be distinguished from the various THEOLOGICAL, DISCIPLINARY, LITURGICAL, or DEVOTIONAL traditions (little \\"t\\"), born in the local churches over time. These are the particular forms, adapted to different places and times, in which the great Tradition (Big \\"T\\") is expressed. In the light of Tradition, these traditions can be retained, modified or even abandoned under the guidance of the Church's magisterium\\" (CCC, 83). Thus, man-made traditions can be modified or abandoned, but Apostolic Tradition is objective truth revealed by God and cannot ever change. This is what the Church claims infallibility over. Don't take my word for it, do your research, and try reading something other than anti-Catholic sentiment if you ACTUALLY want to learn what the Catholic Church teaches."},{"Title":"Roman Catholicism","review":"I am a Christian firmly entrenched in the same general branch of Protestantism as the author (Calvinism), and I own several of his books.

But, when searching for words to describe his treatment of Roman Catholicism, &quot;charitable&quot; doesn't come to mind. I'm not an expert on RC doctrine, but my impression is that the book repeatedly falls into the grave error of taking an aberration of one segment of Roman Catholicism or at a particular point in time, and painting the whole church with that brush. The net result is that even though he may have had the best of intentions, the book verges on slander at times. This is a shame for various reasons. I think there is a strong case that can be formulated against the Roman Catholic church -- it is more in need of reform than ever -- so why knock down straw men?

I think it merits two stars, but even then only with reservation. I don't recommend this book to anyone who doesn't have a strong theological background already. Then, if you are in a position where you need to do extensive research of Roman Catholicism (as a Protestant) or of Protestant critiques of Roman Catholicism, then this book should probably be just one of many that you read.

There is probably not a single page in this book that is not riddled with errors, but that is what one would expect from a misguided, misinformed and spiteful man with a terrible axe to grind against the Church of Jesus Christ.If you are interested in a much higher level of reading about the Catholic Church I would recommend \\"Triumph: The Power and Glory of the Catholic Church\\" by H.W.

Such slanderous attacks, having no foundation in truth, led me to consider that the Catholic Church is the one Church which Jesus promised would be so hated. This search led me to the deepest of convictions, and one which as a former Baptist I did not even want to consider, that the Catholic Church indeed is the Catholic Church mentioned in the Apostle's Creed and the Creed of the Council of Nicea.If your view of the Catholic Church is formed upon this book, you will have a very warped and inaccurate view indeed.

If that's the case, then I suggest they read the Catechism (so they can know what the Catholic Church actually teaches).

Sheen once said something along the lines of, \\"Few people in America hate the Catholic Church, but many hate what they mistakenly think is the Catholic Church.\\" There is a great deal of truth in Sheen's observation. Oppositions to the Catholic Church are often full of misrepresenations and misconceptions concerning its teachings and practices, such as the accusations that Catholics worship Mary or think the Pope is sinless. In some cases these misrepresentations may be deliberate, the result of hateful bigotry. More often, however, those who make such assertions have been unfortunately misled by anti-Catholic propoganda - propoganda like Lorainne Boettner's Bible of anti-Catholicism.Whether Lorainne was himself misled or in fact deliberately misrepresented the Catholic Faith, his book, Roman Catholicism, is full of inaccuracies.Here are some of his historical inaccuracies in his list of \\"Catholic Inventions\\":Transubstatiation was not invented in 1215. It had been believed for over a thousand years prior to this. 1215, however, was the first time it was formally defined and given the name Transubstantiation.Contrary to Boettner's claim, the Bible was not forbidden to laymen and placed on the Index of Forbidden Books in 1229. The Bible could not have been placed on the Index of Forbidden Books, which did not yet exist and would not for another several hundred years. At the Council held at Toulouse, France (which is certainly the council Boettner mistakenly thought was in Muslim occupied Valencia and called by that name), a inaccurate translation of the Bible published by an heretical sect (which claimed that there were two gods and that marriage was evil) was condemned.The Sign of the Cross was practiced by Christians since before Tertullian wrote of it in 211 (not 300, as Boettner states), perhaps even since the time of the Apostles.The worship of images was authorized in 786. In fact it was never authorized, as Catholics do not worship religious images anymore than the United States worships the Lincoln Memorial or Mount Rushmore, but merely use them as reminders of God and his followers or as aids in prayer. In 787, a council condemned the iconoclastic heresy which asserted that statues of Jesus were unacceptable. The council did not condone worship of such images, however.Confession to a priest existed long before 1215. Cyprian, Origen, and others refer to it nearly a millenia earlier. Nor do Catholics go to a priest instead of to God for the forgiveness of sins.Finally, the \\"Apocryphal books\\" (seven dueterocanonical books which Protestants do not accept as Scriptural) were not added to the Bible at the Council of Trent. Rather, Martin Luther had removed them, and the Council affirmed what had always been held - that they were truly books of the Canon of Scripture which was established definitively at the Councils of Rome, Hippo, and Carthage in the late 4th century.These are only some of the inaccuracies contained in Lorainne Boettner's inaccurate, unreliable, and seriously misleading book, Roman Catholicism. It is unfortunate that many have been led into a false view of history and the Church by this book, and whether one is Catholic, Protestant, or otherwise, nothing should justify going to it for information regarding the Roman Catholic Church."},{"Title":"Roman Catholicism","review":"The anti-Catholics' Bible, it contains lots of misconceptions about the Roman Catholic Church, plenty of alleged quotations but without many citations to any source.

As Bishop Fulton Sheen said, &quot;There are not many people in the United States who hate the Catholic Church, but thousands of people who hate what they mistakenly believe the Catholic Church to be.&quot; A refutation of parts of this book can be found in Karl Keating's &quot;Catholicism and Fundamentalism.&quot; Boettner clearly demonstrates his little knowledge of Roman Catholic history"},{"Title":"Roman Catholicism","review":"I always find it interesting when certain groups of people attack the Catholic Church based on the assertion of &quot;inventing&quot; doctrine. They often point to the dates when the Church officially names such previously shared and accepted beliefs. They say 'That proves that it was &quot;invented&quot; by the Church because it was documented well after the death of the apostles.&quot; The Catholic Church, when a long standing, all the way back to the first and second centuries, tradition becomes challanged or distorted will establish a special council to lay out the exact meaning and often name to a doctrine (example being - The Trinity) to do away with misconceptions. I use the example of the Trinity because most protestants are unaware of the Council of Nicene back in the fourth century that officially defined and named what was considered to be a commonly held TRADITION, but had at that time come under attack from various heretics. The word TRADITION scares most protestants because in order to discredit the Catholic Church they have decreed that all TRADITION passed down from the earliest of times is false if not found in the Bible. If you are a protestant reading this, read about the history of forming the New Testament. It wasn't handed directly from God's hand to Christians, but was a long process of evaluation in determining what was divinely inspired and what was not. Many books were left out that some wanted to include - they are known as the &quot;Gnostic Gospels&quot;. It was the Catholic Church who determined which books were to be included and which ones were not. This was 300 years after the Apostles. Please tell me what bible were the earliest of Christians using to verify and justify their beliefs prior to the fourth century. They relied on TRADITION.

Went to Catholics schools, and entered the Sisters of Saint Joseph of Orange where I received an extensive education in the Catholic theology.After I left the Order, I spent many years searching for the truth. I have spent the last 30 years in the Protestant Community, and have experienced various Denominations.During that time, I studied the Bible, learning the Greek, studying it in the original. So I don't think I could be called ignorant of what I speak of either Protestants or Catholics or the Bible.I found Loraine Boettner's Roman Catholicism in the library of the small ChristianCollage I was attending. What he wrote was inflammatory, unjust, uncalled for (especially against the nuns). Strawmen were thrown up and torn down. The most ridiculous and humiliating things were stated as facts. So little was based on fact that I was appalled.I reported the book to the President of my Collage and he backed up the book. This for me precipitated a crisis. I left the School but not the study of Scripture. I will never forget the deep humiliation that had been heaped on Christ. What Boettner never realized is that in his hatred of the Catholicism he left, his lashing hate ridiculed and degraded Christ himself. How this hate can be tolerated in Churches that dedicate themselves to Christ I do not know. Jesus was clear that we were to love our enemies, our perceived enemies here.Those afflicted with this kind of hate should be prayed after. They are burdened with a cancer that can only eat them up and kill the freshening of the Spirit. I was saddened to find that instead of healing what was eating into Mr. Boettner, his cancer has been encouraged.We are moving into a new age where Christianity is being attacked on all levels both in America and without. We had all better come to Christ, beg forgiveness for our petty hatreds,and unite as He wanted us to be. Christ is the Message.

His writings are very easy reading- hard to put down. Artful comparisons between Protestants and Catholics."},{"Title":"Roman Catholicism","review":"Having been brought up a Catholic, and having had a catholic religious education for many years, let me say a few words in defense of this book. It should be read by catholics to see what the skeptical side has to say. Although I do not agree with everything the author has to say, he does make some good points. In one section of the book, he talks about divine tradition. In a catechism called 'My Catholic Faith' by Bishop Morrow in the lesson on divine tradition, it clearly states that divine tradition should be believed in as firmly as the bible, since both come from God. Divine tradition is the writings of the fathers and doctors of the catholic church. Now God is infallible, so divine tradition should be also. But Boettner writes that Augustine, a prolific church father, wrote a book of retractions to his writings later in life. Another Church doctor, Alphonsus Liguori, in his book, the means of salvation and perfection, wrote that if God willed all the angels to go to hell, they would willingly do so to follow the divine will. This is absurd since God cannot make a contradiction. If this were so I wouldnt blame the angels for becoming atheists. Boettners book is well written and shows some of the other inconsistencies in the church. However, he does throw the baby out with the bathwater. There are inconsistencies in the Catholic Church and in the intrests of truth, one would do well to read this book."},{"Title":"Roman Catholicism","review":"After reading in-depth treatments on anti-Catholicism wherein this book never gets mentioned such as in Robert N. Bellah'sUncivil Religion: Interreligious Hostility in America(with the second section--pages 39-109--titled \\"Protestant-Catholic Tensions\\"), wherein this book is briefly but respectfully mentioned such as in Philip Jenkin'sThe New Anti-Catholicism: The Last Acceptable Prejudice(page 44, states \\"respected Presbyterian scholar Lorraine Boettner published the first of many editions of a comprehensive polemic against the Catholic Church\\"), wherein this book gets credited as a conservative perspective such as inRevolution in Rome(page 19, \\"the truth is, Boettner notwithstanding, that both the spirit and the doctrine of Catholicism are changing\\"), one can conclude that un-biased scholars see this work as an important polemic worthy of attention and consideration.Now giving this work some attention: if the Catholic Church is truly changing in spirit and doctrine, it is certainly surprising and unexpected to find the Roman-Catholic Ignatus Press publishing the sort of scholarly myopic attacks on Boettner's book that exist inCatholicism and Fundamentalism: The Attack on \\"Romanism\\" by \\"Bible Christians\\"."},{"Title":"Roman Catholicism","review":"Last year I began to study for myself the differences between the Protestant, Roman Catholic and other \\"Religions\\" claiming to be based on the Bible. This book was an excellent source of scholarly work complete with references. I have read and am concerned by other reviews written by seemingly Protestant imposters that seek to attack the book in an effort to keep the dark secrets of the Roman Catholic Church hidden.Also, as a quick note, previous reviews claim poor documentation and quotes in the book. This is an out and out fallacy. There are approximately 130 quoted authors and texts and I have yet to find one that was false or even controversial.I will admit that some of the things claimed to be believed and taught by the Catholic Church were hard to swallow. But after doing further research on my own including the Roman Catholic Catechism, Vatican II Council documents, etc., I found them all to be legitimate claims. I am afraid that either the people writing the negative reviews are either oblivious to the false and blasphemous teachings of the Roman Catholic Church, or they know them to be true and are trying to guard them from being exposed.This is a fantastic book and a Must Have for anyone truly seeking honest and straight forward knowledge about God's plan for man and for His True church-which does not fit with the teachings of the Roman Catholic Church.One reason that it is so cheap (as one of the negative reviewers mentioned) is because it seems to be written with exposing the truth in mind and not personal gratification or greed.I would like to close with this final statement. I have an older copy of the book, and wanted to order another copy for a friend. (I am not willing to give mine up :o) This book was first published in 1962, and the copy I have is dated 1987. At that time it was in its 26th Printing. This is a fantastic book. When I noticed the ratings, I attribute that to people buying the book thinking that it will support the Roman Catholic doctrine and not expose it for what it is. The Truth seems to sting those living in the dark."},{"Title":"Roman Catholicism","review":"This is a great book that really uncovers much of the paganism and just plain made up traditions for which the Catholic church has become known. I was freed from a \\"pre-Vatican II\\" church some years ago. It was a group of Catholics and their very elderly priest who rejected the changes made after the Second Council. They practiced the old ways (which is what Lorraine's book mainly addresses). They kissed a box filled with \\"relics\\"...you would not believe how many churches have a piece of the cross that was used to crucify Christ! Sometimes they hosted the \\"pilgrim\\". this was a case with a statue of the Virgin Mary. It circulates and when your household has it you sit around it everyday and say certain prayers to Mary. For those who do not believe that Christ is re-crucified in the Eucharist, I site the following: \\"356. Why does Christ give us His own body and blood in the Holy Eucharist?Christ gives us His own body and blood in the Holy Eucharist: first, to be offered as a sacrifice commemorating and renewing for all time the sacrifice of the cross; second, to be received by the faithful in Holy Communion; third, to remain ever on our altars as the proof of His love for us, and to be worshipped by us.\\" and \\"357. What is the Mass?The Mass is the Sacrifice of the New Law in which Christ, through the ministry of the priest, offers Himself to God in an unbloody manner under the appearances of bread and wine.\\" These are taken from the Baltimore Catechism of the 50's. This is falsehood plain and simple. Christ offered himself once and for all...not continuously. Some might answer...but the Baltimore Catechism is not used anymore. That would mean that the church is not un-changed through history...but changes continuously to teach \\"new truths\\". Yet God is the same before, now, and forevermore. Christ offers the wine and the bread to all in the Bible. In the 1400's the Catholic church officially decided to keep the cup from the laity. This is in no way supported by Scripture where we are instructed to take both. I could go on and on. The teachings of the Catholic church MUST be compared to Scripture. Where they disagree...the Scripture must stand in authority. Even Paul said that if he or even the angels were to teach apart from the teachings of Christ they must be rejected."},{"Title":"Roman Catholicism","review":"I grew up observing many catholic neighbors and classmates going thru the preposterous and ridiculous &quot;rituals&quot; and &quot;sacriments&quot; that were invented by the popes and &quot;councils,&quot; and are absolutely NOT IN THE BIBLE.Most of the reviewers are obviously roman catholicswho feel a &quot;need&quot; to &quot;protect&quot; themselves, but never point out ANYTHING that is &quot;untrue!&quot; They just &quot;SAY&quot; it is untrue!

His book, \\"Roman Catholicism\\", is spot on and accurate in its assessment of the man-made doctrines and traditions of the Roman Catholic institution. Having been taught, since childhood, the so-called traditions of Rome, it is refreshing to me that Boettner can still be read and perhaps even be used to help save some souls from the inventions of Romanism. His work will never be outdated. Don't let such reviews, like Garver's above nit-picking, discourage anyone from reading this book. Yes, Garver did fine an error with Boettner's citation of \\"Valencia 1229\\", but the mistake was in name only and not outcome. It should read \\"Toulouse 1229\\", which did restrict the use of the Bible. Regardless of the Albigensians, or what they believed, the so-called church and council had no right to place the Bible on a forbidden book list, which is the correct and accurate point Boettner outlines in his \\"Roman Catholicism\\". On the major issues Boettner is spot on and accurate. Take something major like the invention of the role of papal authority, or the Pope as the Universal Bishop over all of the church. Boettner perhaps doesn't list every single reason for discrediting this hoax invented by Rome, but let Pope Gregory the Great offer support where Boettner might be lacking, \\"Certainly Peter, the first of the apostles, himself of the holy and universal church, Paul, Andrew, John, what were they but heads of particular communities? And yet all were members under one Head [Jesus Christ]. Was it not the case, as your Fraternity knows, that the prelates of this Apostolic See, which by the providence of God I serve, had the honor offered them of being called Universal Bishop, by the venerable Council of Chalcedon. But not one of them has ever wished to be called by such a title, or seized upon this ill-advised name, lest if, in virtue of rank of Pontificate, he took to himself the glory of singularity, he might seem to have denied it to all his brethern.\\" (Epistle XVIII). The reader can get the whole truth by reading the teaching and letters of Pope Gregory the Great, but for now Boettner's work will stand the test of time, especially when measured as a complete work, and not against a minor mistake in name only and not a point of fact. May the Lord Jesus Christ bless all the readers of Boettner's \\"Roman Catholicism\\", which other than the Bible, the Roman Catholic will fine no better book to read.

One reviewer I saw even referred to the author as a \\"her\\" ... any reader of the book would know that Lorraine Boettner is a man! This book is a great source of embarrasing information. You will learn how many Catholic doctrines are not only unbiblical, but also relatively recent concoctions. You will learn of many of the frauds that the Catholic Church has perpetrated on its unsuspecting followers - such as the house in Italy that they claimed was Mary's flown in from the Holy Land. The greed, the corruption, the bizarre practices - it's all here. Let's not forget the atrocities, such as the Inquisition and the war crimes in Croatia that the Catholic Church was so intimately involved with. Sadly, pointing out the truth about Catholicism has been termed \\"bashing\\" and is now politically incorrect. It has been getting harder and harder to find resources that tell it straight.

Has intellectual honesty gone out of style? It seems that Boettner's hatred of the Catholic Church lead this pitiful man to throw truth and accuracy out the window when he wrote this forgettable work of lies and distortions. In fact, the reader can visualize Boettner with clinched fists and gnashed teeth as he swerves recklessly from one mistaken conclusion to another. WHY IS THE TRUTH SO SCARY TO SOME? Disagree with the Catholic Church all you care to. But for goodness sake - disagree with what the Church REALLY believes and REALLY teaches. Even some scholarly sounding types who attempt to quote from Church documents in these reviews reach completely erroneous conclusions because of the same anti-intellectual approach that Boettner takes. Instead of this baloney, try some real food for the brain - Rome Sweet Home by Scott and Kimberly Hahn, Born Fundamentalist;Born again Catholic by David Currie, Surprised By Truth by Patrick Madrid, Answering a Fundamentalist by Albert Nevins, By What Authority? by Mark Shea, or try the Catechism of the Catholic Church.

Indeed, I would even say that most fundamentalists who rely on this book as their source manual, or \\"anti-Catholic Bible\\" as Karl Keating put it, are aware of the dishonesty, but continue to use it in hopes of swaying the uneducated with sensationalist and inaccurate citations.For example, Boettner claims that extreme unction, the Catholic sacrament also known as anointing of the sick, was invented in 526 AD. The implication being that it was not practiced by the early Church, but was, as the story goes, Roman paganism incorporated by the state. What he doesn't tell you is that this practice can actually be found in the Bible. The Epistle of James 5:14-15 reads \\"Is any among you sick? Let him call for the elders of the church, and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord; and the prayer of faith will save the sick man, and the Lord will raise him up; and if he has committed sins, he will be forgiven.\\"I dare any person who finds accuracy in this book to support the vicious claims it makes. You won't see it. Jimmy Swaggart, Jack Chick and Bob Jones University avoid open debate; the reason being, as Plato predicted, because they know they are spreading malicious propaganda. To confront those they persecute would give them a chance to defend themselves, and with reasonable argument comes a clearing in the fog. The lies fall apart.Look at some other claims \\"Roman Catholicism\\" makes. Boettner believes that transubstantiation, or the idea that Jesus is literally present in the Eucharist, was invented in 1215 AD. In reality, that's when the term \\"transubstantiation\\" was deemed fit to describe the miracle of the Mass. The actual doctrine of the Real Presence comes from the Gospel of John, chapter six: \\"Amen, amen, I say unto you: except you eat the flesh of the Son of man and drink his blood, you shall not have life in you\\" (verse 54). Boettner claims to derive his theology from the ante-Nicene Fathers (that is, early Christians who lived after the apostles but before Constantine). In actuality, EVERY SINGLE Church father believed in the Real Presence.\\"They abstain from the Eucharist and from prayer, because they confess not the Eucharist to be the flesh of our Saviour Jesus Christ, which suffered for our sins, and which the Father, of His goodness, raised up again.\\" Ignatius of Antioch, Epistle to Smyrnaeans, 7,1 (c. A.D. 110).\\"For not as common bread and common drink do we receive these; but in like manner as Jesus Christ our Saviour, having been made flesh and blood for our salvation, so likewise have we been taught that the food which is blessed by the prayer of His word, and from which our blood and flesh by transmutation are nourished, is the flesh and blood of that Jesus who was made flesh.\\" Justin Martyr, First Apology, 66 (c. A.D. 110-165).\\"He acknowledged the cup (which is a part of the creation) as his own blood, from which he bedews our blood; and the bread (also a part of creation) he affirmed to be his own body, from which he gives increase to our bodies.\\" Irenaeus, Against Heresies, V:2,2 (c. A.D. 200).\\"For the blood of the grape--that is, the Word--desired to be mixed with water, as His blood is mingled with salvation. And the blood of the Lord is twofold. For there is the blood of His flesh, by which we are redeemed from corruption; and the spiritual, that by which we are anointed. And to drink the blood of Jesus, is to become partaker of the Lord's immortality; the Spirit being the energetic principle of the Word, as blood is of flesh. Accordingly, as wine is blended with water, so is the Spirit with man. And the one, the mixture of wine and water, nourishes to faith; while the other, the Spirit, conducts to immortality. And the mixture of both--of the water and of the Word--is called Eucharist, renowned and glorious grace; and they who by faith partake of it are sanctified both in body and soul.\\" Clement of Alexandria, The Instructor, 2 (ante A.D. 202).Don't buy the vicious lies."},{"Title":"Roman Catholicism","review":"As an ex-protestant seminarian and now a Catholic priest I know how wrong Boettner is first hand.

Dr. Boettner quotes priests, ex-priests, bishops, cardinals, popes, nuns and ex-nuns in this lengthy, but captivating piece of research. One of the most valuable insights that he brings to the table is the fact the the Catholic church in the United States is very different than the Catholic church in most other countries - mostly because the U.S. is dominanted by Protestants. He delves into non-Biblical traditions of Romanism and the oppressiveness that the political hierarchy brings to countries that are dominated by Catholicism. Every Christian should read this book. It gets five stars from me."},{"Title":"Roman Catholicism","review":"Please do not waste your time on this obviously anti-Catholic book.

I attend a Classical School, study Latin, Greek and the Great Books. If half of this book by Boettner is true, it is enough to condemn this church.

For the Catholics here, you might want to read Martin Chemnitz's Tridentine Commentary available through Concordia Publ House. Three volumes. Good stuff. Good history. Good review of the fathers. As a Protesting Roman Catholic, those fathers are our's, given Rome's perversion of the Gospel and excision from the continuing church. The terms of readmission remain the same as in the days of the Reformation. Repent and embrace the apostolic witness of supreme guidance. Thanks. Have a published lined up and maybe will do alot of research, writing, and updating. But the rubbishy comments below by Cath's are one-sided. Can you folks still read Reformation materials? While the Index of Forbidden Books was in effect until the 1960's (talk about anti-intellectualism and control), have any of the Prot-bashers below read, let's say, 200 books for starters from the Reformation period?

Anyone who wants to defend the faith should get this book.If you need answers to this book, you can check out, &quot;Catholicism and Fundamentalism...&quot; by Karl Keating.

There are too many inaccuracies and complete &quot;nontruths&quot; for this book to be taken seriously."},{"Title":"Roman Catholicism","review":"No, I am not Catholic, but after looking at this book I have realized that it is nothing more that a book full of lies - thousands of items and quotes taken out of context so that they seem to be the truth. This book has been turning devout Christians against their faith for a long time and I think that it is time for that to stop. DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK UNLESS YOU WANT TO BURN IT. As a Christian we should strive to build each other up no matter what the doctrinal differences are - so this book is a piece of trash."},{"Title":"Roman Catholicism","review":"A book that has become famous (or infamous) for the way in which it misrepresents the faith of Catholics, particularly by making false and misleading claims without support or references. Boettner presents Catholicism as HE understands it, without any real effort to ask real Catholics why they believe what they do, and cites as sources many ex-Catholics, ex-priests and ex-nuns. Sadly, many people have taken this book at face value, without bothering to look any further, and have grown up with a vision of Roman Catholicism which is hideously wrong. A book which has been refuted over and over again for its bias, and which should have gone out of print a generation ago."},{"Title":"Roman Catholicism","review":"Oh come on! EVEN if you don't agree with Catholicism (as a future seminarian, I happen to) you can find BETTER material. I mean, if any educated Catholic tells you that this stuff is rubbish, you should believe them. We are not ashamed of our beleifs nor do we hide from our history. There was an inquisition (even though it was NOTHING like most Protestants try to make it), there were and are some problems (not in DOCTRINE, perhaps in management and catechesis), but nothing to the distorted degree presented in this work of fiction. I highly recommend that this book be buried forever as it might be MORE useful as landfill!"},{"Title":"Roman Catholicism","review":"This book is without question a codex of lies from someone who hates the Catholic Church. The truly sad part is that some people actually eschew the Bible in order to support Boettner's rancid work.The book is useful for Catholic apologists to understand the genesis of some of the more laughable arguments made against Catholicism.As a source of honest information, it's a sad joke.

As a life-long Catholic, I must say that her book betrays a fundamental (no-pun intended) ignorance of the true history and nature of Catholicism. The author describes a Catholicism based upon her own misconceptions (and those also held by her fundamentalist colleagues) rather than the reality of the Church itself. This distortion is not surprising, as the purpose of the book is to foster the author's own personal point of view by castigating an institution which, while flawed (as any human endeavour is flawed) is Christianity.Even worse, the book also shows a fundamental ignorance of the Bible and contextual scholarship itself; rather the author twists and parses words and phrases to suit her own purposes without.The author would do well to actually read and understand the Bible. Perhaps she would better understand what Roman Catholicism and even in a broader context, all of Christianity is about."},{"Title":"Roman Catholicism","review":"Mr Boettner's book has absolutely no basis in the real world.

If you read \\"Catholicism vs. Fundamentalism\\" by: Karl Keating to obtain the REAL beliefs and teachings of the Catholic Church, and then you read this, you will realize that this book doesn't present Catholicism fairly, honestly or correctly...in the least! Not even close. This has to be one of the worst books, right on par with Fundamentalists like Jack Chick and Dave hunt.Trust me, this book will not, in any way, help you to understand what the Catholic Church truly believes at all. It's only success, besides consistently lacking footnotes, is to MIS-represent the Catholic faith with straw man arguments.If you really want to know what the Catholic Church teaches read:1. \\"Catholicism and Fundamentalism,\\" by Karl Keating2. \\"Surprised by Truth,\\" By: Patrick Madrid3. \\"Pope Fiction,\\" by Prtick Madrid4. \\"What Catholics Really Believe,\\" By Karl Keating (Answering 52Misconceptions about the Catholic Church)5. \\"The Catholic Answer Book\\" (4 books in set - All are great), ByPeter M.

Boettner was horribly misinformed about what Catholics actually believe or was so blinded by anti-Catholic bigotry that he didn't care to get his facts straight.

Apparently, they print them cheap in order to get them in the hands of as many people as possible? I started reading it and had to stop--it was so full of lies and inaccuracies--it insulted my intelligence."},{"Title":"Roman Catholicism","review":"I bought this book because it was given either one or five stars. So I thought it must be very (!) controveral. If you are looking for a scholary insight in catholic theology, you will be at the wrong place. You can get better books on this subject by evanglical scholars. I highly recommend the book of John Armstrong (ed.)&quot;Roman Catholicism etc&quot;. To get catholic theology right read catholic sources and compare it with the evangelical view. If you do this you get some new ideas and possibillities to interpret scripture. Especally if you compare the modern evangelical thoughts with the Early Fathers. There you can see protestant errors, but also catholic errors. For an honest seeker of information this book is too polemical, but it is not as bad as some of the (fundamentalist) catholic rewiewers said."},{"Title":"Roman Catholicism","review":"This book is full of problems (like implicit christological errors), but my favorite errors in it are the historical ones.The best example regards the use of icons. Boettner mentions the iconoclastic controversy which ended with the Seventh Ecumenical Council (Nicaea II), then goes on to say that one of the chief issues dividing Catholics and Eastern Orthodox today is the use of icons: according to this book, the Eastern Orthodox refuse to have icons! This is not only historically inaccurate (the Eastern Orthodox have always accepted the Nicaea II Council), it can be disproven by simply walking into any Eastern Orthodox church. Eastern Orthodox churches are full of icons and sacred images! If a book doesn't have simple facts like these straight, how can one trust it with more nuanced questions of theology and philosophy?Boettner's Roman Catholicism, with its shoddy scholarship throughout, reminds me most of God's decree &quot;You shall not bear false witness.&quot;If you're curious about the history of Christianity and the development of Christian doctrine."},{"Title":"Colonial Applique (That Patchwork Place)","review":"Sheila Wintle has taken some old early American designs, enhanced with her own artistic spin and appliqued a delicious assortment of quilts! Her used of bold colors and modern fabric designs do not take away from the colonial designs.

The colors are rich and luscious and the medallion design is cleverly put together by using the acanthus leaf to surround the carnation blooms in a wreath style.The plus in this book is that Ms. Wintle took the time to give beginners directions on applique, quilting, the purchase of supplies, fabrics, how to make stems, border treatments, mixing and matching patterns and fabrics, and consistently offers valuable personal tips that most don't consider. Her various ideas for pieced and appliqued borders enable anyone to enlarge the quilt designs.The patterns are fresh and lovely, so that even a seasoned quilter will find inspiration.A must for any quilter's library."},{"Title":"Adventure Guides Spain","review":"I chose this guide to go to Spain.

It has a good moral, and is all in all a great read.

In it, the main character, Morwenna, accidently inherits the last five wishes left over from the creation of the world. At first she is overjoyed, untill she realizes the rules: she can't wish for anything for herself, she can't tell anyone about the wishes, and if she uses up all five wishes she'll die. This gets especially complicated when she has to use up several of the wishes to save her friends. The ending came as a complete surprise, and I have to admit, it was more than a little disturbing. Did Morwenna learn anything? I guess that's for the reader to decide. I had expected something redeeming to happen and for everything to turn out all right for everyone but I was wrong.

He's written some amazing books, in all kinds of genras, but this one just didnt add up to his normal standard. From the beginning there is a problem with no solution. I kept waiting for one of Avi's famous ending twists, but there was none, and when I finished the book I frowned said, hmm, so much for clasic Avi style, maybe he just wrote it to make another dollar.

Morwenna has to stay with a man who knows she has the wishes. He makes Morwenna use the wishes even though she doesn't want to.HER LAST MUST LAST HER A LIFETIME!\\"A great book that makes you kepp wanting to read for ever and never put the book down.\\"-Julia"},{"Title":"Bright Shadow","review":"How would you feel if you were a wizard, yet you had to keep it a secret from your best friend? Bright Shadow tells the story of a young girl named Morwenna who receives a gift filled with wishes, but cannot use them on herself. At first she is scared to hold the wishes because it is a big responsibility. Ruthvin, the nasty king, wants to catch Morwenna and keep her in captivity so he can have the wishes she protects. Morwenna has many challenges in this book because she can not use her wish to save her friend.Bright Shadow is an extremely wonderful book. It is exciting and surprising. Things happen at unexpected times. For example, in the first chapter everything is calm. Characters are described, but there is little action or emotion. Then in the second chapter you can feel a strong hate that King Ruthvin puts out by the way he speaks to Pindel. \\"You are in the presence of the King,\\" Ruthvin snapped at the old man. \\"My law requires you to bow when I pass by.\\"One of the major themes in Bright Shadow is listening to your inner voice. Morwenna gets herself in a lot of trouble because she does not listen to her inner voice. She keeps hearing \\"keep them safe,\\" meaning not to tell Swen about the wishes, but she doesn't pay attention to this. When she tells Swen, the voice screams. Because she tells Swen about the wishes, he dies and Morwenna feels responsible.Avi has a talent for telling the reader what the characters are feeling. She uses wonderful language to describe the characters. Here is how she describes King Ruthvin. \\"King Ruthvin was a small, lean man, hard and tight as if put together with wire bits. In one hand he held a short whip. In the other a just delivered message.\\" Her language creates vivid pictures in the reader's mind.I recommend this book to people of all ages who like fantasy.

Each one is well written, filled with intrigue, and subtly thought provoking. The tales go beyond religion by surprisingly digging into the psyche of humanity as rarely seen in short stories. The authors include many genre top guns like Anne Perry, Dianne Day, Nancy Pickard, and John Lutz, etc., but none of the writers fail the audience, as every story is powerful yet entertaining.

There are poems on gooseberries, coyotes, and the change of seasons, and many are tongue in cheek, like a cross-cultural conversation with a hippie and cataloging the trials of raising a son who takes after yourself.Yes, many of the poems are \\"curmudgeonly.\\" He complains about hunters and tourists, Californians and city folk in general, the environmental and social havoc of strip mining and clear cutting, and people who want to off-load their unwanted pets and unruly kids in the country. But just as often there is heart-felt sentiment, in the loss of a good hired hand who moves on, the loss of a neighbor whose ranch gets foreclosed, the retirement of an old rodeo bareback rider.McRae's poems belong on anyone's shelf of western literature. He's the genuine article."},{"Title":"Cowboy Curmudgeon and Other Poems","review":"This is one that you'll not put aside until you git done with it. Laughter, tears, plain ol' country.

Harper is a great and seminal self-help book and introduction to Rational Emotive Therapy (RET) or Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy (REBT) for the lay person. The book was originally published in 1961 and is dated. Arguably many modern advances in this area of psychology are made within the framework of Cognitive Behaviorial Therapy (CBT).In addition to being dated, the original Guide was printed by a substandard publisher, Wilshire Book Company. It's layout, presentation, typeface, etc. amount to a jumbled, visually confusing mess. This seems to be the case in most, and certainly the current, Wilshire edition.In 1975, Prentice-Hall, Inc. published Rational Living (A New Guide (ASIN: B000ERLZ5I) which no longer seems available. But I tracked down a used edition and it is a much nicer text. I highly recommend this version. (Amazon has multiple used listings for A New Guide, but most indicate that it is still a Wilshire publication. I am not sure whether this is accurate.)It is well worth picking up a used copy of the Prentice-Hall version, at least if you're a book snob like me."},{"Title":"A guide to rational living","review":"I can only tell you that I am about to purchase my 3rd copy of this book.

Written for the general public, but frequently used by practitioners, it describes all aspects of Ellis' theory and how to apply the theory to specific problems.This book includes chapters on:How Far Can You Go With Self-therapy? (chapter 1)Thinking Your Way Out of Emotional Disturbance (chapter 5)Overcoming the Influences of the Past (chapter 7)Tackling Your Dire Need for Approval (chapter 10)Reducing Your Dire Fears of Failure (chapter 11)Conquering Anxiety and Panic (chapter 15)Research Evidence to Support the Principles and Practice of Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy (chapter 22)This book is a moderate read, and is written for the person who wants to learn more about REBT, and who is willing to invest some time and effort in learning. Therefore, this book would not be for the person who wants a quick, easy read. Also, when buying this book, make sure that you get the third edition. Ellis has continued to revise his theory since originally publishing this book in 1961, and has made subtle changes along the way.Overall, I prefer Ellis' writing style to most other authors. He is clear, leaving few unanswered questions. He describes his theory in a way that makes sense. No REBTer, or practitioner's, library is complete without this book."},{"Title":"A guide to rational living","review":"I really wanted to like this book based on the numerous glowing reviews, but was extremely disappointed. The Authors purport to explain Rational Emotive Behavioral Therapy and how it can be used to improve your life. Basically, we take a small upset, and through unhelpful (irrational) beliefs make it seem a catastrophe: ie. A student fails an exam and instead of saying, \\"This is disappointing and I'm upset about it,\\" instead says, \\"I'm a complete FAILURE in life!\\"While they do a good job of explaining in exhaustive detail the concept that we often take small upsets and exaggerate their meaning through our beliefs into great upsets, they do not present any clear program or exercises to change this behavior. In short, a self-help book this ain't. I was looking for something to better help me deal with depression, and the frustrations and upsets of life, but after reading this book felt I got nothing out of it, and am returning it. I really wanted to like this book, but:- The writing style is sometimes difficult to understand, and often seems smug, condescending, and harsh toward the patients described.- Nothing in the book tells you 'What to Do' to cure your unhappiness, even the chapters which seem to promise exactly that deliver nothing.- There are no exercises or writing assignments, it seems the authors expect you will get better from simply reading, or rather, don't expect it.- The entire first chapter is devoted to telling you that without a therapist you will never see major improvements. While this may be true (due to our own blindspots) the book devotes itself to explaining REBT without even trying to offer any help or advice on using the techniques.In short, while I now understand some of REBT and feel a trained REBT therapist could be of use, I don't feel this book offers anything of value in changing our moods and behaviors, except the understanding that we often make things worse than they are through exaggerating beliefs. I will now try instead the highly recommended:The Feeling Good Handbook,Mind Over Mood: Change How You Feel by Changing the Way You Think, andFeeling Good: The New Mood Therapy Revised and Updated."},{"Title":"A guide to rational living","review":"Step One: getting past your ego defenses at least enough to see that your problem is you. Step Two: understanding when, where and how you went wrong (cognitive behavior theory recommended). Step Three: figuring out what to do about it ... how to dump your unhappy, self-destructive behaviors so you can move on into a happier, more self-fulfilling future.Albert Ellis suggests that \\"bibliotherapy\\" (self-help through reading) can be markedly effective for all but the most seriously upset, as opposed to the time and expense of conventional counseling or therapy. His book \\"A Guide to Rational Living\\" isn't new, but it's still one of the best guides for anyone ready for \\"Step Three\\". This isn't a clinical treatise abounding with \\"shrink-speak\\", but something more akin to a very erudite grandfatherly talk ... a conversation that contains a lot more common sense than nebulous theory, with wisdom that you'll find immediately useful.

Although I am not depressed and don't consider myself to have &quot;a problem&quot;, I learned a great deal from this book. I have redefined a lot of &quot;musts&quot;, &quot;oughts&quot; and &quot;shoulds&quot; that I had created for myself. I really like the part where the authors recommend the readers to focus on the enjoyment of doing things rather than focus on being good at them. Especially defeating is to work at something in order to become better than others.Another great point is trying to direct less negative energy towards what other people do and how they choose to act. In a democracy, they may do as they please, and is it really worth the time and effort to try and make them change? Or even worse, just upset yourself about it, without even considering to influence them to change? There is a woman in my yoga class that always irritated me by commenting on everything we did in class and sometimes brought things to eat into the exercise room. Instead of directing energy towards her behavior and on how she was influencing the effects of my training in a negative way, I should have been minding my own business and not let myself be bothered. It really is no big deal, it was just all in my head.Read this book, not matter who you are."},{"Title":"A guide to rational living","review":"In this book, Albert Ellis talks about his REBT (Rational Emotive Behavioral Therapy) technique to tackle virtually any unhealthy negative emotions that people can have. He emphasizes his point that we largely create our own emotions by thinking in certain ways. He also says other people and situations work only as a trigger, but they do not cause emotions in us. He explains logically and carefully how we can change our thoughts and as a result change how we feel about ourselves, other people and situations. I love this book. So I bought some more of his books, and his same technique is used in all the books I have read. He is very consistent with himself, clear, and is a good writer. Using his REBT technique is not something easy. Making any significant and constructive change in life cannot be done overnight, but only with persistent practice and effort. I recommend this book to anyone. Yes, absolutely any one of us will be able to benefit from this book somehow. For me, this book gave me a chance to grow up further. It made me more mature and happier."},{"Title":"A guide to rational living","review":"If you are uncertain about buying this book, just take a look at how many people have given this book 5 stars. I have read self-help books before and found most of them to be full of it. Dr. Ellis really has something here. This is a book that can really help you. It has really helped me. I know it may be hard to believe that a book can improve your life but the ideas in this book did just that. If you're not familiar with REBT,you will be after reading this book. It is a simple technique that you can apply to anything that is bothering you about yourself or your life. It's helps you to work on your thoughts. And no, it's not easy, it takes work, but it is possible. I have bought this book several times always to give it away to someone else.

It is rooted in Irrational belief #2, as referred to in this guide -- the idea that you have to be totally competent and achieving. Constantly believing this led me to perceive that nothing I was ever doing was enough, and also led me to compare myself with everyone to see who had achieved more. Overall, I would feel great when I fared better than someone but would become unnerved when I was worse off. This book helped me to see how destructive and unproductive this is. The authors go as far as calling people with this sort of irrational belief &quot;disturbed.&quot; I didn't like that much until I realized that it is essentially true -- there is no benefit or reason to hold such distorted ideas. Now that I am aware of where my &quot;disturbed&quot; thoughts are stemming from, I can put an end to them by dispelling my irrational belief.

The authors believe that self-analysis, no matter how limited it is, can be useful, and that human emotions and feelings do not magically exist in their own right. Rather, they stem directly from ideas, thoughts, attitudes, or beliefs that can usually be radically changed by modifying the thinking processes that create them.They explain how rational analysis helps you to search out and forcefully attack the root of emotional problems and do it successfully, without the necessity of years of long, drawn-out psychoanalysis.Here in straightforward language, without the use of technical terms or professional jargon, you will learn how to recognize neurotic behavior ... overcome the influence of the past ... erase dire fears of failure ... conquer anxiety ... acquire self-discipline ... overcome inertia and become creatively absorbed in the world around you.This book will give you a lucid explanation of a sound new approach to psychotherapy - its meaning, its application and its potential in our irrational world of today.--- excerpts from book's end page"},{"Title":"A guide to rational living","review":"This book has helped me make major changes in my life.

Unlike the majority of other \\"self help\\" literature I had seen up to that point, this book didn't paint a dreary picture of spending year after year, wallowing in my own navel, forever progressing towards \\"health\\" without actually attaining it; as is often the case, especially in the 12 Step programs.The Guide is a no-bulls**t manual for approaching psychological and emotional disturbances and bad habits, hitting them \\"at the base of the flame\\" as it were, and providing the reader with a solid roadmap to navigating out of even extreme emotional and psychological problems.Nothing replaces a solid therapist, but where many therapists try and sell you on the idea that you're going to have to spend a lifetime on the couch, the Guide emphasizes PROGRESS over all else, insisting that we are CREATORS of our own thought processes and our own paradigms, instead of PRISONERS of the damage done to use by past harms, childhood, et al.Now, if you're perfectly comfortable being addicted to \\"self help\\" and enjoy shelling out thousands every year just to sit in a therapist's office, traveling endlessly down past roads without actually moving a single inch into your future, then you won't want this book.But if you are SICK of yourself, or how you act, or how you think, or how you feel, and you want to know how to make some BIG changes and make them LAST, I think there has not been a better text written on the subject, both in terms of practical application and in terms of being time-tested and true. This is not a \\"fad\\" or a \\"cult\\" fix. This is bald, often brazen \\"slap you upside the head\\" wisdom which cuts through the touchy-feely jargon and endless murk, so that you can start feeling AND acting better, right now, and make REAL CHANGES in yourself, for now and for the future.Want to know more?

Take this passage from page 99: \\"Adults often act in an immature, childish manner. One of the essences of their humanity is fallibility. Consequently, they find it exceptionally easy to do sloppy, wishfulfilling thinking. And thereby often get what they don't want.

Ellis believed that people can change their emotions as well as their behaviors by disputing their irrational thoughts with facts and reason.In this book he goes through what he believes are the top 10 irrational ideas that cause most people to experience unpleasant emotions needlessly.Ellis is not known for being a great writer, but in this book he pulls it together. The tone is direct as well as clear, free of psychobabble, and you never doubt that you are being addressed by one of the great psychological minds of the 20th century.Dr. Ellis views evolved substantially over the decades and many editions of this book. To get a modern view of the concepts that Dr. Ellis considered to be the most important I would recommend starting the book at chapter 20, going to the end and then starting from the beginning.Beware, there are multiple editions of this book. To get the latest edition with the most content make sure you have the 3rd 1975 (august) edition. For some reason some book sites list this publishing year as 1997.

Identified, questioned, examined, uprooted and replaced with more realistic -- and functional -- notions, they can become the foundation for a belief and appraisal system by which anyone can cope with pretty much any curve ball life pitches at them.However radical, as well as grandiosely expressed some of his ideas may seem; Basco, Beck, Seligman, Wessler, Young and all who have ridden on his coattails owe a debt to Albert... not to mention the millions whose lives have been saved and/or greatly improved by disovering for themselves how things really -are-... as opposed to what they -think- they are.There are a lot of Ellis-authored books available, but having read several of them (as well as many of Aaron Beck's), it seems to me that this one stands out as the seminal piece for professional and lay readers alike.

The Old Order was convinced that there was something &quot;wrong&quot; with being human, (i.e. Original Sin, The Fall, Ad Nauseam), and Rational-Cognitive Behavioral Therapy,(sounds Orwellian doesn't it?), makes the same mistake, though it pretends not to. Orthodox religion presented to us what was and was not acceptable, what was and was not healthy, and Rationalism has been quick to catch the falling garter as Old Dame Christianity slowly passes into obscurity.

It is a comprehensive guide to overcoming self-defeating thoughts that lead to negative feelings and neurotic behaviors. It promotes the Rational-Emotive Therapy model, which posits that all negative feelings that limit human potential are based on irrational thoughts. Therefore, one must identify the these self-downing thoughts and systematically root them out and replace them with thoughts that will help achieve greater success and contentment. After a thorough introduction to the process in the first nine chapters, there is a chapter on each of the ten irrational ideas that plague people. Throughout the book there are examples of dialogs between the authors and patients struggling with various irrational ideas and neuroses. These examples serve to inform the self-talk of the reader, and show how to derail irrational thinking and replace it with more constructive thinking. The book may be bit too academic for some: the authors put their theory in the context of Freud, Skinner and primal scream psychologists and others, which makes more sense if the reader has some familiarity with those. The language is all 60s-ish, which does not detract from the essential usefulness of the message. I recommend the book for anyone, at any stage of life, who is struggling with anxiety, resentment, needs for approval, feeling out of control, depression, lack of discipline, fear of failure, or desperate unhappiness. While the book was not intended as a cure-all and the authors recommend using it in concert with counseling, I cannot see how it could do anything but help."},{"Title":"A guide to rational living","review":"When I started college I was a complete and utter anxious ship-wreck. I couldn't sleep, think straight, and felt like I was going to lose my mind. Basic daily tasks suddenly became terrifying or anxiety provoking. It was a scary and exhausting time for me.On the edge, I went to see my school counselor. She recommended I read Ellis's books and his Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy style. I have to admit, I expected very little. Honestly, I felt like she had passed the buck and gave me a book instead of helping me. However, I was desperate and would have tried anything short of an exorcism to feel better. I read his first book, \\"A new guide to rational living.\\" (I would recommend reading this book before \\"How to control your anxiety before it controls you\\", this one gives more background.) I was astonished. Within a few weeks, I legitimately felt noticeably better. Nearly two years later, I can honestly say his books changed my life and multiple friends and family members who have borrowed my books.It takes time and won't happen all at once. As Ellis would say, you spent a life time learning how to be anxious, and can't undo that in a day. It took me about a year to get much better, two years to completely change my life, and three to be an entirely new person. I am deeply saddened that Ellis died recently. I would have loved to thank him for completely overhauling my life and making me a much happier, outgoing, and less anxious person.PS. Dr Ellis is in fact a well respected psychologist. Even the great Beck recognizes his work. Ellis' work is based on his empirical studies with real patients he counseled throughout his long career. His stuff is not Dr.Phil style non-sense like \\"You're like a shoe with no strings,\\" or the ever classic Dr.Phil statement \\"get over it!\\" I hate when people tease psychological books because Dr. Phil (and others like him) poisoned the entire genre. \\"Those\\" people and first and foremost entertainers. Dr.Ellis is real, and his work actually helps!!!"},{"Title":"A guide to rational living","review":"I read the third edition of \\"A Guide to Rational Living\\" about a year after reading \\"Feeling Good\\" by David Burns. Both books are helpful and advocate similar methods of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). However, I preferred Dr. Burns' book because it gives many more specific mental exercises to work on in dealing with different mental problems. Dr. Ellis does apply CBT methods to a broader range of issues and his book is certainly less work to finish, but I don't think it's as effective without all the worksheets and charts to do that are in \\"Feeling Good\\". I picked up a \\"Guide to Rational Living\\" mostly because it was the first popular book written about CBT and I was curious to read Dr. Ellis' take on it. It's still worth reading but I think it does show it's age a little especially when it tries to refute Freud's theories which I thought had already been largely disproved by modern psychology."},{"Title":"A guide to rational living","review":"Just a word to students and those who believe that people must learn to counsel themselves.

I think that if everyone read and understood Ellis' insights the world would be a better place. Ellis' ideas on how we can correct our \\"crooked\\" thinking are fairly straightforward and should be accessible to all. The copy that I got was in good condition for being over 30 years old, but the paperback binding had become brittle and crusty so the pages broke loose when I opened the book.

While many psychologists and authors focus on one or several &quot;pet techniques,&quot; Ellis and this book show you how to adapt an integrated set of rational (cognitive), emotive, and behavioral tools to your personal situations. And Ellis writes this and many of his other books for us non-psychologists...not just for &quot;professionals.&quot;The book starts by briefly summarizing the results of Ellis' ground-breaking work on what we do that causes us to feel and behave differently than we want. The author then teaches his general cognitive system...which includes very specific instructions...on how to change these feelings, behaviors, and thoughts. Ellis terms this system the &quot;A, B, C, D&quot; method of &quot;disputing&quot; irrational thoughts that are &quot;irrational&quot; because they (i) are not true and (ii) produce results that we don't want. The book then moves beyond this general system and shows you how to easily use cognitive, emotive, and behavioral tools to effectively stop your unwanted patterns. While the methods are extremely user-friendly, they do require work...beyond the reading.Because this book shows how to effectively tackle a wide variety of patterns...the following is a partial list of chapters:1. Overcoming the influences of your past2. Refusing to be desperately unhappy3. Tackling dire needs for approval4. Eradicating dire fears of failure5. How to feel undepressed though frustrated6. Conquering anxiety7. Acquiring self-discipline...and others.While many other psychologists/authors, such as David Burns in his &quot;Feeling Good: The New Mood Therapy,&quot; use cognitive methods, Ellis shows how to use many of them far more effectively than most others. And he also includes emotive and behavioral tools, many of which he created years ago and that his non-for-profit institute has used successfully for decades. While Burns' book has some excellent additional tools, I strongly suggest that you start with &quot;A Guide for Rational Living&quot; and then move on to Burns' book if you want.I've gone back to this and a few others of Ellis' books several times during the last 10 years or so. After working through a new situation, I keep realizing how much this one volume still does for me.In my opinion, the book's only weakness is its stlye of writing. It's older style is less interesting than that in some of Ellis' newer books.

No longer would we have to settle for self-help pablum like \\"The Power of Positive Thinking\\", because now we had a piercing book for the masses that explained both clearly and thoroughly three things that no popular work had ever told us before. First, we don't just \\"get\\" upset, we \\"do\\" upset. Or, in other words, we make ourselves emotionally disturbed. Second, the authors plainly explain how we make ourselves upset. We create our own emotional disturbances mainly through our irrational (aka, unhealthy, self-defeating) thinking. And third, Ellis and Harper give us many effective techniques to combat these thinking patterns. The techniques suggested are divided into cognitive, emotive and behavioral categories, although in fact there is significant overlap for the simple reason, as the authors point out, that we don't just think or feel or behave in a vacuum.

TO be really happy.This book is the excpetion. This book can help almost any person to be happy.The basic idea of the book is this: People have certain beliefs about things. For example you might have the belief that you must be liked by everybody. Beliefs like this cause you to become very upset when you realized that this belief is being broken and twisted by the world in which you are living. For example, if you believe that the world should be fair, then anytime the world treats you unfairly, you will very depressed.

I agree with Philip, another reviewer, in that the REBT approach is the most profound and consistent way of cognitively, emotively, and behaviorally disputing your irrational beliefs. It not only urges the reader to ask: Where is the evidence for the validity of my beliefs? (like other Cognitive therapy approaches), but goes one step further by questioning the basic philosphies, e.g.: Even if I fail at very important tasks, does that make ME a failure? The answer: certainly not, because I am not my behavior and I am far too complex to be given any single global rating. In the essence it all comes to this: rate behaviors and deeds, but never the total person. Accept yourself and others unconditionally, even if you don't like certain behaviors, and, finally, achieve high frustration tolerance.This book is the best starting point to get introduced to the fascinating philospohy of Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy.

Our public wisdom is right. So I come back here after gaining great benefit from reading the reviews as well as this book itself to share my opinions with potential buyers and hope my review would get you to know this book more.Dr. Albert Ellis is an acclaimed psychotherapist. He is the founder of REBT (Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy) and originator of the cognitive behavior therapy. What I admire Dr. Ellis is that he coped with those Freudian psychotherapists back in 1960s, in which neuroscience has not developed so well as today. Today more and more neuroscience studies have shown that Freudian subconscious therapy that urges clients to go back to their childhood to discover their deep-rooted hurt heart would do little to help a person to get over his/her destructive emotions. Recent studies have supported Dr. Ellis's theory largely. Such as (1) Our neurons keep developing. (2) Laziness or over-comfort would not bring about happiness. (3)TAN, found by Ann Graybiel and her colleagues in 90s, is an influential factor of habitualization in cognitive behavior therapy, and proves that our will would change the accustomed way of thinking in our brain to be feasible.The reasoning that REBT explains about our disturbed feelings can be abbreviated into a string of letters: ABC. A stands for \\"Activating event\\" or \\"Adversities\\", IB is \\"Irrational Beliefs\\", and C is \\"Consequences\\". The authors argue that while we encounter unpleasant happenings we will naturally feel frustrated, sorrowful, and sorry. And they are healthy feelings, which are part of our human instinct. So we could avoid badness that we don't desire with these feelings. However, despair, depression, rage these sort of self-downing feelings are another story. They do not stem from activating events, but are the creations of our irrational beliefs. A cannot directly lead to C. They are the irrational beliefs that work right behind our thinking process to create prolonged, self-defeating disturbed feelings.The authors spent a fairly large amount of time expounding on why and how REPT works in the early chapters. They even quoted the doubts the readers might want to ask and answer them with sound argument. The way we think is well explicated. They are very honest: No single self-help book or therapy works for \\"everyone\\" since personal valuation and commitment differ. But according to their counseling records and research their therapy would help most. They recommended you to try out their therapy, read on to see if their words make sense. Along with millions of other readers, my answer is a hundred percent positive.They stated ten irrational beliefs that are the underlying power that holds us back, letting us feel anxious, depressed, incompetent, and etc., with each belief described through a total chapter. In the first part of a chapter, they listed several reasons to convince readers that those beliefs are really irrational, and then at least one case was unveiled to show a clear picture what and how these beliefs are held within. Cases are sometimes generic but mostly iconic. At the closing comments in each chapter there are several ways to cope with the irrational beliefs.Not until I read A Guide did I realize that I have so several sabotaging irrational beliefs that disrupt my psyches. For example, irrational belief #2 \\"The idea that you absolutely must be thoroughly competent, adequate, and achieving\\" fits my profile. I used to be a sort of perfectionism thinker. I would just refuse, say, to write this review because of a bunch of silly reasons- I'm tired, my brain not functioning well right now, maybe tomorrow I'll get sober and so on. And my deep-rooted IB was actually the dire fear of failure. I now know I could value myself not in an achievement-oriented fashion. That IB was even blocking me from clear thinking and performing. In P122 it suggests,\\"...stress your doing rather than perfectly well. Not that you won't find it desirable to perform well. Often you will, because by doing so you gain more goods, services and favors. Fine! But not necessary.\\"I now have found this IB inside me and know how to tackle it. I'd accept myself first before finishing an outstanding work. That's called USA- Unconditional Self Acceptance, and is also the main concept of REBT.Rational thinking is different from positive thinking. Positive thinking is way better than negative thinking, of course. For example, \\"If I work hard enough I'll succeed at exam\\" is definitely better than\\" even if I work this hard I will still likely to fail\\". But positive thinking has its downside: (1) you can't totally control the environment (2) It may automatically lead to irrational thinking without debunking irrational beliefs beforehand: \\"I work hard I'll succeed. So I work hard I mustn't fail. If I fail...\\" That's another \\"MUSTurbatory\\" thinking. Instead, rational thinking is like this: I prefer success so I work hard. But even if I don't succeed I still accept myself as a valuable person.\\" In rational thinking you don't down yourself because of your poor performance. And usually, like the authors argue and to my own experiment, the more you take off your \\"must\\", \\"should\\" IBs the better you perform because you don't let your destructive feelings created by IBs distract you and eat you up.Well, I highly recommend this great self-helper to anyone who wants to lead a better life and get rid of those disturbed emotions. It teaches you to cope with your anxiety, panic, depression, anger, discovering your underlying irrational beliefs that cause them and to gain self-discipline. This is indeed one of the best self-thelper ever written. In short, it's easy to read (with numerous cases shown), easy to understand, and simple to follow."},{"Title":"A guide to rational living","review":"Albert Ellis is the grand-daddy of modern psychology, and this book is the classic.

In this approach, it is not necessary to define deep-seated reasons for the behavior, but to recognize it as it is and to take corrective action. With time, our new healthy thinking becomes habitual as well.After a few introductory chapters, several chapters follow that deal with specific situations, such as anxiety and panic, fear of failure, and self blame. All are very helpful.I noticed, however, and the therapist agreed with me, that after a few chapters it gets repetative.

One of Bill Gate's all-time favorite books."},{"Title":"A guide to rational living","review":"The field of psychology is in disarray. What began in the late nineteenth-century as an exploration into the dynamics of the mind (i.e., psyche) and human behavior has been torn asunder by the variant \\"schools\\" of psycho-dynamics. After years of psychoanalysis, more people found \\"relief\\" in Wayne Dyer's \\"Your Erogenous Zones\\" than benefitted from twenty years of Freudian or Jungian psychoanalysis. With the advent of TCAs and SSRIs, even more people found relief in a little pill than in two centuries of talk therapy. What we know or don't know about psychiatry and psychology is more baffling now than ever will. For whatever it is worth, the human psyche is more evasive than tangible, and I'm not sure more damage than good has been done under its various mentors.I have come to believe that three aspects of human behavior are unquestionable: (1) What we learned as children plays a more significant role in human dynamics than we'll ever know; (2) no matter what era one lives in, there's always a degree of alienation, anger, and angst; and (3) that certain chemical imbalances in the brain play an important, if not vital, role in how we adapt to life in general, and to change in particular. Treatment of neurosis and affective disorders usually requires that we adapt better than we have, and \\"traditional\\" psychoanalysis has been found seriously wanting. That having been said, I want to evaluate two books outside that domain and within the domain of \\"self help\\" that appear to be of enormous benefit. They are: (i) Albert Ellis' and Robert Harper's \\"A Guide to Rational Living, and (ii) Elliot Cohen's \\"What Would Aristotle Do?\\"Both books are in the domain of Cognitive, or Rational-Emotive, Behavioral Therapy. The more I've studied the historical, intellectual, and hermeneutic influences from the Hellenistic Period, the more I am convinced that the cognitive \\"therapy of desire\\" and the cognitive \\"treatment of upheavals of thought\\" play a significant role in how we adapt to our daily lives than anything approaching Freud or Jung will ever do. Simply by changing our attitudes, reactions, and plights against our most basic emotions, the more we are adept at, and adapt to, leading more successful, healthy, and balanced lives. Both \\"A Guide to Rational Living\\" and \\"What Would Aristotle Do?\\" are in this latter venue. Both books are invaluable in teaching the reader how to overcome obstacles in one's life in a way that is both realistic and therapeutic.The first misconception to get over is that the passions (i.e., emotions) are somehow separate and distinct from our ratiocinative faculties of the mind. Both cognitive and evolutionary psychology have demonstrated, without argument, that the two function occur within the same mental framework (cf., Daniel Goleman's \\"Emotional Intelligence,\\" which locates all emotions in the amygdala). The second misconception to overcome is that emotions, qua emotions, are generally unhealthy, e.g., the Stoics. Take one example: The fright/flight response is an evolutionary response to fear that all of us animals, including human ones, have for self-preservation. This emotion, like many others, are key to our survival. As Martha Nussbaum argues cogently, even love and compassion are survival-oriented emotions (see her \\"Upheavals of Thought.\\").Most debilitating emotions arise because we have not taught ourselves how to think/emote rationally. Both books argue and attempt to treat this. The difference between the two is that \\"A Guide to Rational Living\\" is less adept at how to change our rational control over our emotions, while \\"What Would Aristotle Do?\\" explicates the process in considerable detail. Either book is better than nothing, but clearly the later gives explicit directions on how to overcome irrational thinking. Aristotle (yes, him) distinguished between theoretical and practical reasoning over two millennia ago, and his assessment has not been devalued over time. In practical reasoning - the reasoning that determines how we act either ethically or emotionally, one begins with a universal premise, then supplying a particular premise, and then coming up with a conclusion or action. For example: \\"Do good, avoid evil\\" is a universal premise; than add the particular premise: \\"If I am good to John, he'll be good to me.\\" In this case the universal premise is probably correct, but the particular premise is fallacious. Just because I love John does not mean he'll love me. When John fails to be good to you, the usual response is something like, \\"he hates me,\\" \\"because he hates me, I am no good,\\" \\"you idiot, I did my best, and you didn't reciprocate,\\" etc. Sometimes, it's because of a faulty universal premise: \\"If I'm good, others should be good.\\"In either case, both universal and particular premises are irrational. First, no one is wholly good, and secondly, even if one believes himself good, doesn't mean someone else is.Both books illustrate the fallacies of such arguments. And, once one sees the fallacy of this kind of argument, the more one feels anger, frustration, and depression dissipate. I personally think, \\"What Would Aristotle Do?\\" brings out these fallacies more clearly, but both books touch on the same irrational beliefs that lead to the same irrational emotions. Whether it is the universal premise or the particular premise, or both, that cause our fallacies and lead us into emotional grief, it is, after all, our faulty thinking that leads us to disappointment, anger, frustration, depression, etc.. Learning how to detect and correct such premises is what both books are about. \\"What Would Aristotle Do?\\" tends to be more attractive to those who are more \\"rational\\" about their thinking process, whereas \\"A Guide to Rational Living\\" tends to more attractive to those who are more emotive. Both books will get you to the desired end. And either book will \\"get you there\\" for less than one-fifth the price of a single psychoanalysis. And, for those seriously depressed, another book worth considering is \\"Feeling Good: The New Mood Therapy,\\" which also uses CBT to alleviate much distress. I wasn't impressed with it as I was the other two. But whatever you do, invest in at least one of these books; unhealthy emotions and depression are not necessary, as each shows."},{"Title":"A guide to rational living","review":"After reading Ellis' &quot;Reason and Emotion in Psychotherapy,&quot; I must say I am disappointed by this book. The flashy, self-helpish cover should have been a clue: this is strictly for the layperson, and even there it is not spectacular.The authors were speak down to the reader. The language is simple and repetitive. In addition, the authors spend far too much time discussing other types of therapies, why rationality does not conflict with emotion, and so forth, rather than on how and why their therapy works.I suspect, from the cover, language, and design of the book that the authors were primarily motivated by profit. For instance, there is a whole chapter, *the first chapter*, on how one should always seek professional help rather than administer help for oneself. While in extreme cases this is understandable, it is simply insulting to the reader's intelligence to suggest that he or she cannot help themselves properly.There are more criticisms of the book, but I have a sincere respect for Dr. Ellis and in no way do I wish to dissuade others from using REBT. I merely want to warn those looking for hardcore information to steer clear of this poorly constructed book.If you want better books on cognitive therapy, read Ellis' more scholarly works or Epictetus' Handbook."},{"Title":"A guide to rational living","review":"read this book more than 10 yeas ago, bought this one as a gift.

I've read and re-read this book so many times that I wore out the binding of one copy and had to purchase a second copy. Using the wisdom in this book, a person can help himself master many emotional problems that stem from crooked thinking. This book puts most other self-help books to shame.

It is without a doubt the best self help book ever written. It shows in clear language how people get sick believing the stupidest things about themselves and the world. I wish I had read this book when I was 18, it would have saved me a lot of trouble. By being skeptical about things and using the information and excercises this book provides, one can prepare himself to deal with a world that is mostly insane. As Dr. Ellis himself writes in the book, one can hardly think of a world more irrational than this one. But he does a good job of preparing his readers to deal with the world. The information in this book is worth many times more than the largest of fortunes. I mean this literally. This book saved me more trouble than I can count.

I like the general idea of this book. You can change the way you feel by changing how you react to people, situations, events.

This is the whole book, and I get that, but what the book lacks are real ways to actually do this. Its easy to say you should recognize and stop this destructive habit, but I already knew that. That is the reason I bought the book. What I want to know is HOW. HOW! This book was sorely lacking in real, practical ways on how to overcome these habits and thats why I gave it one star.

If you absolutely have to read self-help books, I wouldn't want to discourage you from reading this one. It is, in fact, one of the better ones.What I think we all should do when we read self-help, however, is question the source. Who is this guy who is telling me all these things? Has he gotten where he is by the sheer application of his own techniques, or by other methods as well? Is he telling the entire truth, or is he just giving me a statement of his own opinion in a way that is very persuasive? Whoever gave him a monopoly on rationality?I have been depressed severely for a number of years and I have tried to become happier simply by altering my thinking patterns. I think you deserve to know it hasn't worked for me so far. Granted, it is a step in the right direction, but for some of us other things are required. For some people, it might be pills (medication). For others, it might be opportunity.For me, however, to be told I am simply being irrational is an insult. Sometimes feelings are irrational, and sometimes they are not.I do not want to deter you from reading this book because to do so might mean that you would turn to other books which could be much less helpful to the average person. I may seem a bit extreme but there are two sides to every issue and every side deserves a chance to be heard.Books like this are good, but they are not a panacea, and they are not a substitute for social action where appropriate (I think Ellis may have mentioned volunteering in his book, but I can't remember). We can't make all of our problems go away just by thinking them away.I would say, get this book, and if it is helpful to you as it has been to many people, that's great. But if you read the book and afterward you understand what I am saying come back and vote \\"yes\\" on my review. Vote \\"no\\" only if it is absolutely necessary!Eli"},{"Title":"A guide to rational living","review":"I havn't read a book this good sense Wendell Johnson \\"People in Quandaries\\". In general semantics they teach you the dangers in the word \\"Is\\" when people mistake their Maps for being the Territories.Ellis and his REBT has took it to a whole new level when he show you more dangers in the words \\"Should\\", \\"Must\\" and \\"Ought\\" when people do the impossible assume they have god-like powers and try to make the Territories into their Maps."},{"Title":"A guide to rational living","review":"This book got so many positive reviews, I just thought something had to be wrong. No book can really be so good. I read the book awhile ago, and liked it, but I don't think any book deserves to get so many five star ratings.Please keep in mind that what I am about to say has much to do with being a devil's advocate, and should not be construed as giving advice.First of all, I HATE the use of the world \\"rational\\". What Dr. Ellis seems to be saying is that being unhappy is irrational. I strongly disagree. This world can be very intense, and there are many problems to deal with. Dr. Ellis says that when we expect too much, we are bound for disappointment. He is entirely correct in saying this. But I do think that people have a right to expect AT LEAST A LITTLE out of life, and some people get nothing at all.While Dr. Ellis may be right that much unhappiness may be somewhat irrational, I don't think he is universally right.One thing I have always thought is that people don't pay enough attention to the fact that many of these authors have a good education, intelligence, and make pretty good money from writing books. Many times they are also attractive. Writing successful books confers self-esteem on the author. They receive much attention and gain respect.Sometimes I think that depression is very rational, and I also believe that suicide is sometimes rational. People often have a pretty realistic assessment of their situation in life.You mean to tell me that if Dr. Ellis was never able to graduate from high school, and instead of going to college he was sent to prison, was gang raped, had no friends, and so on, that he would honestly be able to tell himself \\"oh, well, I guess I haven't done well so far in life, but I can still be happy\\". Gimme a break!Now naturally, most of us don't fall into such an extreme category, but I think by using such extreme examples we can see how ridiculous it all is. Yes, in most cases, people have the potential to be happier than they are, but certainly not all the time. There are even bound to be some people with very troublesome backgrounds who go on to achieve much success in life. But we shouldn't ignore that statistically, the odds are against that person.Let's all be optimistic about the possibilities life holds. But lets also be sober about the true facts of our life. There is much about life that is irrational, including some facets of your book, Dr. Ellis.I don't think everybody has a chance to have self-esteem. I really don't. Self-esteem is based on real accomplishment, and many of us do not accomplish much. Maybe that's what you will talk about in your new book \\"The Myth of Self-Esteem\\", but somehow I doubt it. I will have to buy the book used and read it to know for sure.MJ"},{"Title":"A guide to rational living","review":"Summary: A person is not obliged to be, feel, or do anything in particular, and should not expect anyone else to be, feel, or do anything in particular.

The authors style of writing and thinking also show some example of being outdated."},{"Title":"A guide to rational living","review":"As a practising therapist and a reader of many psychology/self growth orientated books I found this one to be a little astounding in some instances. I found the very patriachal approach quite off putting.....especially in one part where the authors answer to a very unhappy wife with an abusive and neglectful husband was to advise her to have more sex with him!

I cannot believe there are people who didn't enjoy this book. It's clever and innovative with a great premise. I've read Ms. McCoy's angel books and they were good, but this one is great.Zara, an alien woman comes to earth looking for her perfect match and finds him in Daniel Murphy. Daniel had to kidnap his own son and is in hiding himself. When he meet's Zara he's a goner. This book has mystery, suspense, comedy and HOT HOT Sex scenes. It reminded me of that movie Starman. The idea in that movie was simple too. We never find out why the alien hero comes to earth, but he and the heroine fall in love and he is forced to go back but we never really know why.

Way to go, Judi!"},{"Title":"Wanted: One Perfect Man (Starlight Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"This book jumped out at me from a super market rack as I passed it. The cover captivated me. It was colorful and the lady sitting inside the crescent moon with her legs dangling over its edge reminded me of Jeannie in I Dream of Jeannie. I read the description on the back cover then looked at the cover again. Although I wasn't shopping for a book, I was tempted to buy it when I thought of the old adage that you can't judge a book by its cover, so I put it down and went back to my shopping. But after I got home, the cover haunted me, and when I went back to buy the book there were none left. I went to a bookstore and bought the book and after reading it I realized that the old adage about judging a book from its cover is not always right. The story, in this case, turned out to be just as good, if not better, than the cover could have suggested.The story was interesting, suspenseful, and exciting and kept me turning the pages. The main characters are interesting and realistic. Even the secondary characters are exciting and realistic. The sexual tension is guaranteed due to the story premise of a female alien needing one perfect man to impregnate her because the men on her planet are infertile. Thankfully, the science part of the fiction is simple and does not get too involved in boring scientific explanations and justifications - just enough to carry the story. The story is well written and after I finished reading the book I felt good all over. Wanted: One Perfect Man kept me entertained, interested, wondering, and tense from beginning to end. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Wanted: One Perfect Man (Starlight Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"This latest book by Judi is a whimsical, entertaining sci-fi romance that kept me interested from start to finish!

I loved the idea of a single father raising his son, on the run and in hiding from wealthy evil relatives. I liked Zara, the alien. The weakness here was in the author's writing style and dialogue. The story just plodded along. I was not surprised or delighted at anything. I would have preferred a little more wit or interest in the dialogue. It wasn't as fun or heartwarming as I had hoped. I think it may have been lacking emotional development. I didn't feel the emotions of Daniel or Zara as much as I do in other romance novels. Following are a few other specific problems I had with this book.CAUTION SPOILERS:1. The author used one of my pet peeves: using vague communication to create conflict. Daniel and Zara have sex for the first time. The next night, Daniel invites Zara to his home for the evening. Zara is vague and doesn't answer directly. Then, in her presence, Daniel makes plans with some guys for the night. The next day Zara doesn't know why Daniel is angry at her.2. I was curious as to how Lerner, the private detective, found Daniel. That would have added something interesting to the story, but the author never answered that question.3. The epilogue was like the start of another story. It had almost no connection to the Zara story. There were too many unanswered questions. What was the big discovery that kept Lucas from getting any sleep for three nights? Was it related to the aliens like Zara? What did he know, and how did he know it? Was the woman next to him an alien? It was an unsatisfying epilogue.Sexual language: moderate. Number of sex scenes: three. Setting: around 2004 (small town) Button Creek, Texas. Copyright: 2004. Genre: romantic science fiction."},{"Title":"Wanted: One Perfect Man (Starlight Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I'm a big fan of movies/t.v. shows such as, &quot;Roswell&quot; &quot;Taken&quot; and &quot;Starman&quot;.

Her chosen mate, Daniel Murphy is hiding from his dead wife's parents in a smalltown in the BIG state of Texas with his son Will due to custody issues. The situations the characters encounter throughtout this story are fun and exciting enough to keep the reader turning the page.

The set up was great and I enjoyed the first part of it. Then it just goes flat. I didn't feel the chemistry between these two characters. The hero is way too nice. So nice that he's boring. There was no conflict between the two besides the lies they kept from each other. When Zara confesses that she's an alien, it's no big deal...no one even disbelieves it for a second. I got through half the book and then didn't pick it up again for about 4 days. That is not a good sign for me. The epilogue was just a sneak preview for another book I guess. I wanted to know what happened on the spaceship. I guess I'll never find out since I won't pay money for another one of these books."},{"Title":"Wanted: One Perfect Man (Starlight Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"This was a really great read!

Content in his solitary life with Will, Daniel is shaken by his immediate attraction to the new mystery woman working at the diner. Stranger still are the other new characters in their sleepy little town. Could Daniel's past be catching up with him even as he tries to plan for a future with Zara?Judi McCoy's WANTED: ONE PERFECT MAN is a star-crossed romance...literally. While the plot may pay homage to movies like Starman and television shows like The X-Files, the story never gets bogged down in science fiction. Instead it focuses on the poignant relationships that lie at the heart of this charming tale. Daniel is a man willing to do anything for his child, while Zara is a woman who loves deeply but knows the sorrow of parting will come.

I always look forward to Ms. McCoy's fanciful novels, but she's outdone herself with this one. A mixture of romance and sci-fi with heavy emphasis on the romance, the story is told with her usual humor and imagination. Zara is an alien, sent to earth on a mission with eight other women. Centuries of gene manipulation have left her world in chaos, with the males on her planet unable to produce viable sperm or have sex.

While on the rooftop with Will studying the heavens together, they notice strange lights in the sky with one splitting away from the others. In spite of his former credentials, Daniel cannot explain to Will what they saw.Daniel meets Zara, the new waitress at Coombs Luncheonette. Like every other male including his son, Daniel cannot resist her lure. Zara feels the same way but it is also especially nice to his son. However, her desires are irrelevant as she comes from another planet in which the men are ill and assigned earthly breeding has occurred. She has been designated to mate with Robert Lotello, whom she has not been able to locate because her stud Robert Lotello is in hiding under the alias Daniel Murphy.This is a whimsical science fiction romance that sounds like Starman, but has a heavier emphasis on the star crossed relationships than on the suspense. The lead couple is a delightful pair while his son is too precocious for this world. The Button Creek crowd adds warmth and emphasizes the differences between the two planetary species in a positive uplifting way so that readers enjoy a fine tale that should lead to the telling of the romances of several other Female ET lights too.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Wanted: One Perfect Man (Starlight Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"Judi McCoy has created a series as sweet and unforgettable as her.

Having won 40 acres of land in the Georgian lottery, David sets out to strike his fortune in gold. On his way north he meets Jeremiah Moon, a teamster traveling to Cassville who seems to know the way of things in Cherokee country. However, when he arrives at his destination he discovers that the Cherokee family living on his land is not at all what he believed the Cherokee people to be. Upon discovering a very civilized family headed by Alec Montgomery (Un-ga-nu-we-u-we is his Cherokee name), who is half Cherokee and half white. The moment in the book where I realized I was reading something special was the last paragraph of chapter 8. Jeremiah was threatening to run Alec and his family off of David's land, brandishing David's deed and saying that they had the law on their side and Alec had best start packing his things together and move on. Alec's reply was unforgettable.Alec did not seem to hear him. \\"It just isn't possible,\\" he muttered, \\"even for white people. Take a man's land, his house--everything he's got. Throw him out--let him starve, him and his family.\\" He got to his feet, a terrible expression on his face. \\"By God, I'm ashamed of it--ashamed of every last God-damned drop of white blood in my veins! You're right, I'm a half-breed--half Cherokee and half son-of-a-bitch! Now you damned white robbers get off my porch and off my land before I forget my Cherokee raisin' and shoot you in the back--like a white man!\\"After befriending Alec and his family, David is struck with many obstacles to his prosperity. The land isn't fit for mining. He doesn't have the heart to kick the Cherokee family off of the land they have farmed for generations. After he falls in love with Alec's daughter, Awanita (a Cherokee!) some of the white folk of the town of Cassville aren't as understanding as he'd hoped they'd be.David's character was a bit confusing for me. At the start of the book he was very open-minded and understanding, a trait instilled to him from his father. But as the book drags on David seems to flip flop back and forth between being understanding and bigoted. It almost seems that his character is very easily influenced, which may very well be the intent of the author considering David's numerous indiscretions.Aside from that, however, the book is very engrossing and really imparts a feeling of helplessness the Cherokee Nation must surely have felt as the Georgian government slowly drove them from their land. For that historical aspect alone the book is well worth reading."},{"Title":"Helen: Myth, Legend, and the Culture of Misogyny","review":"The absence of an index or a bibliography was a major annoyance to me in reading this work. You just have to plow through the notes and appendix to find the author's sources - whether he has read Marija Gumbutas or Gerda Lerner or Rene Eisler or Merle Stone. And you can't look up words or place names. Much of the material in the notes could, I think, have been incorporated into the text so that the reader doesn't have to keep flipping back and forth from notes to text. Also, the beginning chapter was verbose and repetitive compared to what follows. But all that aside, *Helen* is a splendid and scholarly book worthy of being read and reread, mainly for its psychological depth and sophisticated scholarship. It's like champagne and caviar. Elegant.Drawing on a vast and impressive classical base, Meagher explores the question of Helen and by extension of Pandora, Ariadne, Aphrodite, Eve and Mary - in other words - all the goddesses and mortals who epitomize womankind. They are woman's &quot;eikon&quot; or &quot;eidos&quot;, not individuals. Moreover, they are men's projection of womankind, not the reality.Meagher doesn't spend much time on sociological answers to the problem of misogyny such as that males stamped out the goddess religion so that they could take over the property owned by females (as Merlin Stone has charged in *When God Was a Woman*) or that virulent gender persecution was due to left-brain unbalance brought on by literacy (as Leonard Shlain has suggested in *The Alphabet vs. the Goddess*) or even that misogyny is a reflection of man's jealousy of woman's procreative powers as numerous scholars have declared. Instead, he explores the deep psychological depths of man's hatred for woman through the centuries and comes up with man's experience of powerlessness over his desire. Desire turns to hate and rage over that powerlessness until he wants to control and punish the object of his desire. That is why, in his mind, the victim (woman) is always to blame. &quot;Constitutionally out of control, [man's] thirst for control is seemingly insatiable.&quot; Love and war are eternally linked. &quot;Kredemna&quot; in Greek means both a city's battlements and women's veils and eros has thanatos as an overtone.Meagher draws on history, literature, and archeology to make his case that Helen and all her sisters throughout time have gotten a raw deal. Helen was just part of the process of simultaneously deifying and demoninzing woman. She was &quot;sundered, disempowered and eroticized.&quot;In his conclusion, Meagher says that &quot;...when history is murdered and the past is forgotten, a great many things are lost. This volume has focused on two: the humanity and the divinity of woman.&quot; I believe that anybody interested in the subject will want to read this book.pamhan99@aol.com"},{"Title":"Hanging Judge","review":"The eponymous Judge is a real life historical figure ,Isaac Parker ,whose vigorous pursuit and punishment of malefactors while on the Federal Bench at Fort Smith ,on the cusp of Indian Territory ,from 1875 onwards earned him that soubriquet ,and the disapprobation of the more Liberal Eastern newspapers .He had frequent recourse to the rope ,often via mass executions and his methods were highly regarded by the locals ,if not by the Eastern establishment .He is shown in the novel as a decent man marked by an unswerving dedication to the law and its upkeep. He is a key figure in the book but not its main character.The book opens on a hanging -that of a mixed race (part white part Indian)youth Barney Tankard who while drunk om illicit whiskey had killed a man .The whiskey has been sold to him by Harvey Oates who has built up a substantial business by illegally selling liquor to Indians but whom the law can never quite catch in the act .Sam Dark the Marshall who brought him to book is sickened and guilt ridden at his death .When the vengeful Tankard family confront him he is rescued by the timely arrival of Justin Moffittt who wants to become a Marshall too and is taken on ,Sam acting as his mentor.Enlisting the aid of the Tankard family Sam goes after Oates and seeks to bring him to justice .The story from then on mixes the pursuit of Oates with the maturation of Justin ,from a deep suspicion of Indians to an acceptance ,and to a realisation that devotion to the law may run contrary to personal feelings and friendships.The action scenes are plentiful and vividly described but it is the personal journey of Justsin and Sam that gives this book its edge and biteThe ending is powerful and bleak and the book is a must for Western lovers and will be enjoyed by broad minded readers who do not normally explore that fictional terrain"},{"Title":"Hanging Judge","review":"the book is more of a young man maturing and an old sheriff guiding than a judge making men swing. still a good story."},{"Title":"I Never Knew I Had a Choice: Explorations in Personal Growth.","review":"The last Corey book which I have read is Theory and Practice of Conseling and Psychology.

The title of the book suggests that the book's design is to enlighten the reader about the nature of such choices.Unfortunately, in the my eyes and those of the other introspective members of a class just finished that required this book, the book is a failure in that it attempts to cover so very much material, is insufficiently edited, and generally fails to focus attention on the key life choices suggested by the book's title. Instead, we found the book a rather empty promise of good things to come.Chapter one begins with some good insight into various ways we learn or relate to the world that may differ from others. That's useful information. Chapter two deals with the major issues children must deal with to mature (at least in western cultures). Chapter two is the highpoint of the book, and its rapidly downhill from there thru another 400pgs and 12 chapters.A typical chapter will open with 2-4 pages of well conceived, well written text outlining in general terms a life issue such as sexuality or aging. But then the authors will drone on in needless and counter-productive detail without every reaching a point or conclusion, and often going into tantential personal examples that add little -- both clear signs of an absentee editor.The chapter on sexuality has no -- repeat, no -- mention of birth control, abortion or masturbation, suggesting a Catholic bias to their approach. Does that make sense to you if this is a book about choice?In fact, my central complaint about this book is that the title could have been a great focal point for the authors. Instead, it seems to have been a marketing afterthought and has little to do with the authors' book.Our class of 13 had a hand in selecting this book at the beginning of our spring term.

The notion of personal growth involves the induvidual in defining and assessing growth for him- or herself. Personal growth is best viewed as a lifelong process rather than as a fixed point at which you arrive. You will face numours crisis at various stages in your life. These crises can been seen as challenges to change, significant others, your community, and your world. You do not grow in a vacuum but through your engagement with other people. To continue to grow, you have to be willing to exercise new choices and take action to bring about change. Ask yourself these questions:What do I want for myself, for others, and from others?What do I like about myself?What about my life am I having difficulty with?How would I like to be different?What are possible consequences if I do or do not change?How will my changes affect others in my life?Whate range of choices is open to me at this time in my life?How has my culture influenced the choices I have made? How might my cultural values either enhance of inhibit my ability to make changes?\\"Frequently, the book starts by comparing and contrasting the induvidual and the collective. It tries to create a divide between you, the induvidual, and the collection around you. It does this paragraph in and out. It uses the philosophy of integration. It builds itself in esteem... tries to tear down in esteem other beliefs, such as Socrates, and place itself in the void. It tries to make a void within you so you long for the book through rough spots in your life.What this book wants to do is make an ice cream sunday from the bottom up out of the reader using Maslow's hierarchy of needs. It's from food->safety->love->esteem needs->self-actualization. The intent of this book is to create lots of neat perfect looking chocolate ice cream sundays. Self-actualization is the cherry on top. This is all very well intentioned. But it asks you to give up your induvidualality in the process."},{"Title":"I Never Knew I Had a Choice: Explorations in Personal Growth.","review":"This book in its 7th edition is well written and easy to understand. \\"I Never Knew I Had a Choice\\" is yet another fine work by the educational psychology team of Gerald and Marianne Schneider Corey and one that you do not have be a psychologist to appreciate. It is written so that anyone who is on a quest to search their inner-self can benefit from it.What I like most about this book is its structure. Prior to the beginning of each chapter is a self-inventory questioner that opens up the mind of the reader by planting seeds of thought to germinate and encourages reflection on the upcoming pages. The questions are designed to boost the reader's perception and digestion of the the material.I feel that if there was one psychology book any person could pick up and learn how to help themselves this book would be it. It is well rounded and well written. It is the kind of text that if one wanted to know what the basic tenets of psychology are all about in a nutshell, this is the book I would recommend.It appropriately begins with an invitation to personal growth and transitions the reader to review and to reflect; first on their childhood and then adolescence setting up an internal foundation for which the reader can build upon on before going into adulthood studies and other theoretical constructs.Chapter 4 covers the all-important theme of maintaining sound health practices and is a miniature lesson in health psychology. In the following chapters, the Coreys deal with the subject of stress and how best to manage it. They also cover the topics of love, sexuality, and relationships in the ensuing chapters.In addition, the Corey's addresses the all-important subjects such as our search for meaning and purpose, the foundation of meaning, and the importance of embracing diversity. They illustrate well our values in action and challenge us to self assess with a discrimination index to see where our real values lie with concern to an area that is vital to human growth and evolution.The book in the seventh edition, not too sure of the others, is dedicated to a student of the Corey's named Jim Morelock who died at the tender age of 25 years making their chapter on death and loss even more meaningful to the reader.

He is a creative writer.I have read poorly written stories about Kateri Tekakwitha and this one is not. However, this book does not justify the true story or the real character, Kateri. I do believe that the author based his writings on facts written by Jesuits.Most people today have no clue how deeply embellished these histories really are, Jesuits as well as other past historical writers wanted the world to believe that all Native people were cruel savages with no morals. They embellished and exaggerated to win over society, to make people agree with their cause, or to just simply cause a war. The fact is Whites wanted Indian land, they would use any means to get it.Past writings may say that Indians engaged in wild sex orgies, or abuse their family like in this novel, however, oral history, pictures, and other journalists( who lived among the Natives without a cause), will tell you something completely and trustfully different. The sad thing is this history seems to be put aside for the more wilder version, people today, who do not spend the time to research and educate themselves continue these lies without knowledge and teach them to the younger generation. One day, Native heritage will be nothing more than a pack of lies that justifies the annihilation of a race.If you are looking for a more trustworthy or true-related story about Kateri, I suggest you look for another book."},{"Title":"Eternity and Other Stories","review":"I don't often respond to reviews, but I do want to respond to a cheap shot taken at me by Tim Symms--certain of his comments about my 9/11 story, Only Parlly Here, cast aspersions on my character, and other of his comments embody an attitude I find somewhat sad.Mr. Symms seems especially chagrinned--indeed, insulted--that I dare write about 9/11 not having been in NYC at the time, not joining in the relief effort. Well, I almost was. I was scheduled to fly to NYC on Sept. 12 to attend my son's wedding. When I was able to reschedule, I spent several weeks in the city, some of that time with a group of people who were cleaning up the debris. My story involves itself with that time, not the attack. What really burns me about Mr. Simms' comments is his statement, \\"Lucius wasn't in New York during the attack. He was in our homeland, however. He went to the movies...\\", thereby implying that I went out for some light entertainment and some tasty popcorn that same day. Part of my income is derived from doing movie reviews. I was doing my job and, further, when I went to the movies several days later, I was mainly fleeing my apartment, escaping the barrage of horrific imagery on my television set. I wanted to be alone in the dark where I could think about my son, about other matters, where I could feel the beating of my heart,and not have its beats programmed by the insipid commentary of Paula Zahn et al. Doubtless, while I was so engaged, Mr. Simms was saving the planet from his command center in Boca Raton, but that's another subject entirely.This idea that 9/11 is so vast and sacrosanct that it cannot be touched, that we must wait to savor all its aftertastes, that if it is to be approached at all, we must bow out heads and paint them gray...Where did it come from? Vietnam, I think. We'd had it with Vietnam, too much TV, etc, and we didn't want to hear novelists on the subject. Thus a lot of great Vietnam novels (MEDITATIONS IN GREEN, for example) written during or immediately after the war were more-or-less overlooked or just plain ignored. Wherever it came from, this desire not to know, not to hear from our most eloquent voices, until after a mourning period and then a period of acceptance or whatever, it's time we got over it. Since 9/11 there have been disasters that dwarf the fall of the towers -- are we to wait years before we write about them, and if we do, won't other disasters supplant them? Given the frequency of disasters, there's likely going to be a logjam. Speak now is my advice. Speak now and speak often. You may not have ten years. Even if you do, your immediate reactions are as a valuable, perhaps more valuable, than ones processed from memory.I'm sure there'll be at least one major 9/11 novel. It'll be praised for its \\"great humanity;\\" weigh slightly under eight pounds; win the Pullitzer; have legions of readers (Mr Symms among them, no doubt) who'll tote it around like it was the Bible; avoid dealing with politics in any controversial way; contain a predictable assortment of characters (including at least one college professor); have a sub-plot involving yuppie redemption; and, who knows, perhaps it'll even be readable.I tried to post this without a rating, but they won't let me, so...that being the case, damned if I'm gonna give myself less than five stars.Lucius Shepard"},{"Title":"Eternity and Other Stories","review":"What is Tim Symms on about?He appears to object to Lucius Shepard's 9/11 story because 1) it was written shortly after 9/11 and estimable figures like Norman Mailer, Ian McEwan, and VS Naipaul have advised that such a vast subject should be processed slowly over the years, or else, in McEwan's case, not addressed at all; 2) because it's the \\"superficially whimsical tale of a grad student anda ghost...\\" 3) because he was not there in NYC. And he does all this in a review entitled IS THIS ALL WE NEED TO KNOW ABOUT 9/11?To answer Symm's question, of course it isn't. Shepard's piece is a short story, and no story, no novel, no non-fiction work is likely to tell us all we need to know about it, until--that is--Time or some other corporate entity gives us an event book, ALL YOU EVER NEED TO KNOW ABOUT 9/11.Shepard's story, far from whimsical and superficial, is a beautifully observed, concise work of fiction that details the numbness we all felt at the time. It does not attempt to gauge the economic aftershocks, the geo-political concerns, etc., that arose from that day--that was not its purpose. Despite the testimony of Mailer, Naipaul, and McEwan, some fiction benefits from immediacy, the way good journalism does.\\"Only Partly Here\\" is not about a ghost and a grad student. It's about a man who has been a student and now works clearing away the debris left from the destruction of the towers. The woman in question may or may not be a ghost; she may be, and this is my reading, a real person whom the man, in his trauma and confusion, relates to as a ghost. Shepard leaves it to thereader to make this choice. Curiously enough, Symms says Shepard relies on \\"the art of the fantastical to explain 9/11,\\" and then goes on to cite a Patrick McGrath novella about a ghost and a psychiatrist as being better and more complex. More complex? Dude, it's a novella. By virtue of length alone, it's bound to be more complex than Shepard's piece. Better, I can'tsay, not having read it. But McGrath is a fine writer...as is Shepard.As to Shepard's not being present in NYC at the time of 9/11, does Symms think Hemmingway did everything he wrote about? Novelists and short story writers frequently write about events they did not participate in, but Symms, making an odious comparison between Shepard's absence from Ground Zero and George Bush's, seems to think this is a pre-requisite to writing.Shepard's female character wants to know what it's like in the pit where the towers were, and his male protagonist is too wasted by the experience to tell her--that strikes me as a wonderful metaphor for the way Americans were feeling on 9/11 and directly afterward. Just because we weren't theredoesn't invalidate what we felt. To dismiss what is patently an excellent collection--and this is a great story collection, folks--on the basis of a misapprehension concerning one story is shameful. Five stars all the way.Symms suggests that Shepard wrote better in the eighties. Forget about it. ETERNITY AND OTHER STORIES is the real quill."},{"Title":"Eternity and Other Stories","review":"Lucius Shepard, Eternity and Other Stories (Thunder's Mouth Press, 2005)Lucius Shepard is one of America's finest overlooked writers, a man who has labored in relative obscurity (relative, that is, to the popularity he should have obtained twenty years ago) his entire career, turning out finely polished gems of prose in a world that, it would seem, prizes rough cuts. Eternity and Other Stories is Shepard's most recent, as of this writing, collection of short fiction, and like every other book of Shepard's I've read to date, I can unhesitatingly give it the Misanthrope (and Goat) stamp of approval.While the stories here are very good-- open to a random page and you'll get finer writing than you will in 95% of the books published last year, guaranteed-- the collection is slightly inconsistent. Shepard's penchant for thick, somewhat difficult prose always runs the risk of a story getting bogged down in a lack of pace, and it does happen here on occasion; \\"Hands Up! Who Wants to Die?\\" is an especially slow trek, without the kind of million-dollar payoff at the end that makes some difficult books among the best you'll ever read (Grass' Dog Years and Walker's The Secret Service come to mind). But these are balanced out by the stories that, while still thick going, grab you and absolutely refuse to let go until you've turned the final page; these comprise the bulk of the book. \\"Jailwise\\" and \\"Eternity and Afterward,\\" the book's final two pieces, are especially good at this sort of thing, despite being the two longest stories here (I didn't count words, but I'd be willing to bet that \\"Eternity and Afterward\\" is almost as long as Shepard's brilliant 2004 novel Viator); they caused me to forgo food and sleep.There aren't enough different ways for me to say \\"you can't go wrong with Lucius Shepard;\\" eventually I may have to stop reviewing his work altogether, simply because the reviews will turn into carbon copies of one another. But really, there's nothing else to be said-- you can't go wrong with Lucius Shepard. ***"},{"Title":"Eternity and Other Stories","review":"I was happy to see Mr. Shepard's contribution here and I hope he keeps reading these comments.Only Partly Here is a special story for me. I was present one-block from Ground Zero during the attack, at my office in a building just North of the Post Office. I saw people die that day and ran for my life like thousands of others (both, for the first and only time in my life), and felt that I had experienced war. The weeks afterwards were as unreal as any that can be lived. There was a bar across the street from my office that I believe Mr. Shepard must have visited because he captured it perfectly in the 'Blue Lady' -- its called Dakota's Roadhouse and is notable only for cheap drinks and a good jukebox, and it was a hangout for people from my agency for a time, and later for the pit workers. We moved to Maiden Lane while the pit was still burning, but we went back to Dakota's as soon as it reopened. We were steeped in the smell of our City still burning, and we had many occasions to visit the death-stalked \\"London during the blitz\\" landscape that was previously a big piece of our lives and our city.I read Only Partly Here as soon as it was published in Asimov's and I cried. It captures perfectly the mood, the place and the time. It also captures perfectly the peculiar pain a man feels when trying desperately to connect with a woman who, even if living, is not truly present for other people. I never connected with my particular living ghost of Ground Zero, but I connected totally with Mr. Shepard's story. It is the finest piece of 9/11 literature I know, and one of the best short stories I've read, period. Thank you, thank you Mr. Shepard.

(I'm hard-pressed to think of a \\"whimsical\\" Lucius Shepard story, maybe a few darkly humorous ones, but that's about it.) One erroneous and tangential set of comments about a single story in a book doesn't add up to a review; I don't get it. Equally puzzling to me is this reference to Mr. Shepard's \\"high period\\" during the 80s. He first hit the scene during the 80s, but for anyone paying attention, Lucius Shepard's high period is right now; for the last few years, he's published well over a quarter million words of short fiction annually -- in addition to a novel now and then -- and nearly all of it superior to his work in the 80s that won the Hugo, Nebula, and World Fantasy Awards. This is a fine, representative collection of what he's been up to. There's not another writer working that can so deftly capture and amplify the atmosphere of foreign settings and cultures, using the fantastic to achieve an effect of both utter realism and profound strangeness.

There is definitely a \`fantastical' and dream-like streak in these stories, but not so much for fantasy's sake as in the sense that the boundaries of the real, the possible and the explicable are imaginatively stretched to reveal the horrors or mysteries that lie beyond. Unlike most \`fantastical' or SF writing, this is fiction primarily concerned with people, places, and ideas. Lucius Shepard's grasp of foreign cultures and places is second to none in American fiction, and I dare say in English-language fiction. He makes writers far more famous than him seem dull and provincial.I envy those about to discover this marvellous writer. If you hunger for more after you finish this, his novel A Handbook of American Prayer is likewise wild, brilliant and disturbing. His shorter novel Trujillo is a dark gem, and I'm about to chomp my way through the rest of his work. I'm addicted."},{"Title":"Eternity and Other Stories","review":"As with so much of his writing, here Shepard once again proves himself a poet who just happens to write in the genres of fantasy and sci-fi. That few of his stories tie up neatly just adds to their sense of a world unraveling, which seems to be a central theme of his work.Stories like A Walk in the Garden, Crocodile Rock, The Drive-In Puerto Rico, Eternity and Afterward--heck, to tell the truth, all of them--are haunting in their descriptions of their protagonists' struggles against the unknown, entropy, injustice, the dissolution of themselves, or whatever else sparks Shepard's imagination, and it is his ability to make each character real that tinges each story with a kind of sadness that reaches down into the gut and wrenches, much like the best of, say, Russell Banks' or Stewart O'Nan's work.It is his very power to move, perhaps, that caused the tempest in the teapot in Amazon's reviews about Only Partly Here, which I took as a elegy of what we all lost on that terrible day.....And for what it's worth, I couldn't care less about the rants of sensitives regarding 9/11; I was in downtown Manhattan that day, and still it seems obvious to me that to insist that writers ignore moments of historical tragedy is to disregard the power and scope of many of history's greatest works--War and Peace, All Quiet on the Western Front, Night, and many others come to mind.--And absolutely it is to distract us, potential readers, from the great and beautiful jewels of stories collected here.For my sake, I just wish Mr. Shepard wrote faster, because I love his work and can't wait for his next novel or short story collection. Easily he's one of my favorite sci-fi/fantasy writers. After reading this collection, he may become one of yours as well."},{"Title":"Eternity and Other Stories","review":"This is a collection that is a bit more of a supernatural focus, I suppose, even if only a light element at times.Eternity and Other Stories : Only Partly Here - Lucius ShepardEternity and Other Stories : A Walk In the Garden - Lucius ShepardEternity and Other Stories : Crocodile Rock - Lucius ShepardEternity and Other Stories : Hands up!

Jay McInerney for one said that like most novelists he went through a period of intense self-examination and self-loathing after the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center.Another advantage to Lucius taking on this challenging subject matter in the tight constrictions of short fiction is that, as McInerney also says, he was incapable of reading a novel following the attack.Lucius has also shown the courage of his convictions. Writing, indeed getting over a long slump in the 1990s, and keeping writing (unevenly perhaps) where other writers were distracted. Some worked as volunteers feeding national guardsman and rescue workers, or were right by Ground Zero and so went to bed at night behind police barricades and in the odor of acrid electric fires. Lucius was not there (as readers of his blog and movies reviews will know). But he didn't have to be. He took control of the situation, of the narrative of 9/11 if you will, from a distance. He was, like Bush, elsewhere at the exact moment, but that doesn't matter.British and American authors (including Naipaul) have said that they agree with McEwan and that fiction seemed inadequate to the moment of a post-Sept 11 world.The New York Times has said that novelists have failed to engage with the \\"post 9/11 era\\". Clearly, they have neglected to read science fiction (where Shepard is unfortunately ghettoized).We live in a cultural gap, an era in 2005 that debates (again) whether the novel is dead, whether documentarists such as Morgan Spurlock and Michael Moore are the only artists able to make sense of the world, and where some argue that our novelists have yet to \\"weigh in\\" and \\"make sense\\" of the events of 9/11/2001 and 7/7/2005.McInerney says that \\"it is to the novel that we turn to confirm our own senses and emotions to create narratives that reveal to us emotional truths. We desperately want to have McEwan or Delillo or Roth.\\" Interestingly, he has also said that Mailer advised him that he should wait ten years before attempting a novel about 9/11. Mailer, the mainstream's own Lucius Shepard, counseled a slow and steady pace to analyze the vastness of the experience.Lucius Shepard, as close readers of his high period in the 80s will know, is never slow and steady. He is an instinctive writer, and thus cannot analyze his own fictional processes. His vision of how to explain 9/11 relies on the art of the fantastical. Patrick McGrath's novella \\"Ground Zero\\" is a more complex story, and centers around a prostitute who lost a lover in the World Trade Center and is haunted by his ghost.The psychiatrist treating the prostitute is eventually driven mad by the events she herself failed to witness. This is, of course, more attention-grabbing, it being a mainstream story published by a more widely read and more successfully established writer than a \\"genre\\" writer. Unfortunately, it is also the better-written and realised story. Shepard's is good, but in the wider understanding of 9/11 it pales beside McGrath. What McGrath also touches on, ironically, is that his is the story of mental illness brought about by being absent from the main event itself. According to the Electric Story website, Lucius wasn't in New York during the attack. He was in our homeland, however. He had gone to the movies."},{"Title":"Banned Books: Literature Suppressed on Political Grounds: Literature Suppressed on Political Grounds","review":"Today, if you are caught smuggling a Bible into communist China, your punishment will be more severe than if you were caught smuggling drugs.

Not that I don't appreciate the lagniappe, but the book reads like an &quot;HP-UX Guide to Systems Administration&quot; rather than a &quot;Guru's Insight Into Virtual Partitions&quot;. If you are looking to gain insight into Vpars and the SuperDome, you'll get a whopping 14 pages dedicated to this subject matter as Paniotowski based nearly all of his work on the L and N class systems. On a positive note, after reading the few chapters that were actually dedicated to vpars, I did learn a few things that I had not come across in other literature.

Marty points out the many benefits organizations can gain by splitting one physical system into several smaller virtual systems. Among these are increased system utilization, server consolidation, and the ability to easily migrate between a development and production environment.I work with an HP Channel Partner and can say that several of my customers have implemented vPars on equipment that was underutilized. For example, servers that were only running at 20 percent of capacity are now running several instances of HP-UX and utilizing 60 to 70 percent of their capacity.Marty not only gives you the commands you need to configure vPars, but helps you understand the prerequisites for partitioning a system.

This is TOTALLY wrong ! Once you open the book you will see that it was \\"edited\\" by Elizabeth Foerster-Nietzsche, i.e. the real Nietzsche's sister. In fact, it is a narration by her, inserting in that narration some correspondance between Wagner and Nietzsche.The reader must be warned that, unlike her brother, Elizabeth was an extreme proto-Nazi and a super anti-Semite. Later in her life, together with her husband who shared the same views, she left for Latin America to start a \\"pure aryan race\\". Germany, in their view was too infected by foreign corruptive elements (read the Jews), which made the development of such a pure race there impossible ! Pharantetically, the colony they so started in Latin America, developed into a group of totally degenerated people mainly addicted to alcohool and drugs.Elizabeth is also known to have deformed constantly her brother's writings to make them more pallatable with her own ideology. So everything in this book is distorted with her own views. Of course, there is nothing wrong to read those views, as long as the reader is aware that they do belong to the sister and not to the real Nietzsche.A trivial example of the sister distortions is stated by herself in the book: She says that those who look into to details of the big Nietzsche vs. Wagner FIGHTS will have to look elsewhere. Her memoirs concentrate only on the \\"good initial times\\" between the two. The reader must know that Nietzsche, after an initial admiration and praise for Wagner, did turn TOTALLY against him. You can read Nietzsche on that matters in publications like : \\"NIETZSCHE CONTRA WAGNER\\" and \\"THE CASE OF WAGNER\\". Nietzsche did leave the first Bayreuth RING festival in disgust, in the middle of it, sensing that the entire Wagner entreprise was turning into a celebration of proto-Nazism (yes, Nietzsche sensed that so much ahead in his time ! ), of German pure aryan race ideology and of obsessive anti-Semitism.Again, there is nothing wrong with this publication, as long as the reader knows that the views expressed there are those of Elizabeth and that the entire correspondance between the two geants have been reviewed and edited by her."},{"Title":"ISLIP TOWN'S WORLD WAR II EFFORT","review":"I bought this for my husband, because his late, beloved father's photo and WWII service history are included in the book.

Mark Virkler's book, however, is the only one I found that gave practical how-to steps. It is not a book for just reading. I believe if you don't take the time to do the things the author suggests (setting aside time, journaling, listening to see what you hear, etc.) then it will probably end up being just another nice book that you've read. Practicing is essential. If you do, I sincerely believe you will hear the voice of God. For those individuals who have an analytical type mind, this book could be very helpful as well. I have done lay counseling with individuals for several years now using a method called \\"listening prayer\\". I am only a facilitator who helps people learn how to hear God for themselves. I can honestly say I have never had anyone who did not hear God's voice during a prayer session. This is not because of my counseling abilities, but because God loves to talk to His children. It has deepened my faith and made me aware of the incredible love God has for each of us."},{"Title":"Dialogue with God","review":"The book is more than just a reading book--it's an applications book. There are exercises that goad your faith and urge you to hear the voice of your Creator. I thoroughly enjoyed the book and most of all, I enjoyed putting those simple steps into practice."},{"Title":"Dialogue with God","review":"Mark and Patti Virkler's book, Dialogue with God: Opening the door to two-way prayer, explores the place of intuition, imagination, and journaling in the process of one's spiritual development. The Virklers, writing from a conservative and charismatic perspective, argue that Christians should be able to discern God's voice in their own hearts.After an introductory chapter, the authors explore four keys to discerning the leadings of the Holy Spirit in the midst of daily life, giving a chapter to each key concept. First, one should become aware of spontaneous thoughts and feelings, especially when one is in times of prayer and meditation. Second, one should learn to quiet the mind through exercises such as deep breathing and meditative music. Third, one should make use of visualization techniques by imagining a scene from the Bible or making an effort to remember one's dreams. Fourth, one should keep a journal in order to keep track of these efforts and chart one's spiritual growth over time.After these chapters, the authors offer an allegorical interpretation of the Tabernacle furniture in the Hebrew Scriptures for the purpose of focusing one's meditations. Next are two chapters on the nature of prayer and how one can be sure that she or he is hearing God's voice clearly. Chapter 9 presents excerpts from the journals of several students who have made use of the Virklers' teachings on this subject. The final chapter summarizes the contents of the previous ones and brings them together under the overarching goal of deepening one's personal relationship with God. The book has several useful appendices giving biblical references and excerpts from Christian mystics and saints throughout history who have had experience with seeing visions during prayer.I found this book to be highly useful and instructive in the process of learning to keep myself open to the movement of the Spirit in my own spiritual life. Their advice via the four key concepts is practical and simple, which I appreciated. However, the book is not without its faults.Ironically, my primary criticism of the book is that it does not treat Scripture seriously enough. The exegetical technique used by the authors is haphazard at best. The authors tend to make use of Scripture in quips and verses, rather than in terms of the Canon as a whole, individual books, paragraphs, or pericopes. They completely ignore questions of genre, socio-historical context, and narrative structure. Their use of the Bible seems to treat it more like a book of magic spells rather than a collection of inspired texts.That being said, I would still recommend this book to readers as a text on personal spiritual development. I have implemented their four key concepts in my own life and have found them to be useful. I have had more success in discerning the voice of the Spirit and I plan to continue to follow some of the Virklers' advice. If one is able to bear in mind that this book is not intended as a work of exegesis, but is rather a resource for spiritual growth, then one can easily excuse some of the liberties the authors take with the biblical text itself. Sections such as the authors' treatments of the prophet Habakkuk or the allegorical interpretation of the Tabernacle furniture bear a resemblance to various monastic texts such as John Cassian's Conferences or the Philokalia of Eastern Orthodoxy. As a devotional text on Christian spirituality, I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Dialogue with God","review":"This book is of great value in my opinion.

The best that it should have been rated is 'good'."},{"Title":"Dialogue with God","review":"The bad news regarding Dialogue with God is that for me, it hints at a separation theology; such that God is over there while we are over here. Next, this work and the exercises espoused therein rely extensively on scripture, and that scripture is of course the inerrant word of God. Another topic that I'm not at all sanguine about are the concepts of eternal damnation and Satan, which are mentioned as some sort of imprecation should we not approach God in the manner prescribed, at the time required, with the proper attitude of praise and worship. Lastly, it is readily apparent that eastern religions are treated with some derision and are the work of the devil or some demonic entity. Suffice it to say that the God that I'm currently getting to know, understand and love: is a God of unconditional Love that is everywhere (i.e. there is nowhere that She isn't) accepts everyone just as they are at all times and is closer to us than our own heartbeat.However there is some very beautiful prose and anecdotes that at least at first blush seem to come from the heart. Whether the author knows it or not, he has offered some advise that actually include some eastern mysticism. For example the Christian trinity is known and acknowledged in certain Hindu scriptures as: Brahman (God the father, or cosmic consciousness) Kutastha Chaitanya (The Only Begotten Son of God) and Aum or Om (the Holy Spirit - Aum eventually became \\"Amen\\" to the ancient Egyptians.) Moreover, the author repeatedly admonishes his readers to seek the counsel of spiritual elders/brothers to help in clarifying and confirming potential dialogues with God. This practice can certainly be traced back to the yogic (yoga, meaning God Union) tradition of seeking spiritual instruction/inspiration from a Guru (Guru, meaning loosely, one whom dispels darkness.)While this book only lightly resonated with me, that does not mean it can't be of great practical value to another. I applaud the authors in their attempt to expand current Christian understanding, practice and thinking, as in my humble opinion, it has languished for far too long. 3 stars on the board with a real 2 and from me."},{"Title":"Dialogue with God","review":"This book is a must for those who want to hear God's voice.

Read it!"},{"Title":"Fission","review":"The nearly undisputed Empress of SoCal poetry, Laurel Ann Bogen has garnered- and deserved- the accolades of L.A.'s literati elite (whoever they are- and why don't we get invited to their parties?) without losing her grasp on the everyday world. Bogen writes with a near devastating ferocity and a spell-binding sort of grace. The breadth of her literary canvas is startling. Whether her muse is waxing political (&quot;The War nestled dreamily like all good babies/ broken crockery and smashed in faces. Our world without end. Amen.&quot; or carving a Halloweenish portrait of a Jack O' Lantern (ending with an elegant, &quot;What do you fear&quot;) Bogen transcends the earthbound scribbling of other writers. Her poetry is a window into a world of horrific beauty and exquisite madness. It is supple, surprising, and imminently moving. Her world is a disconcerting place- strange and wracked with pain, but instantly recognizable. It's the world outside your window."},{"Title":"Crash Course for the ACT, Second Edition (College Test Prep)","review":"Okay, this book - the second edition - does teach you some neat small tricks here and there, but ladies and gentlemen, this is beyond pale - THE MISTAKES in the book, especially in the MATH section. For all of you who are going to give it to your kids' eyes - please please pay attention:1) The answers for the task on COS, SIN, and TG of angle b on page 104-105 (revealed on page 106) ARE WRONG. I was shocked to see such negligence in an instruction book. They confused SIN with COS. Please de-confuse the kids.2) Task # 12 on page 162 is explained in a wrong way (explanation and answer are given on page 201), they say \\"Plug in 2 for x\\". Well, plugging in 2 for x does not work. Use other variable.3) Task # 2 on page 163 contains NO right answer among the multiple choice - what they give you as a right answer on page 201-202 is WRONG. Variable l there is missing it's 4th degree.I am really saddened to see such negligence in a book like this.

MERIDIAN Vol. 4: COMING HOME collects issues #21-26 and this one, so far, is the last trade to reprint this series. CrossGen went bankrupt in 2004 so it hasn't really been that long. I've still hopes that the rest of the issues will be collected in trade (the series ran for 44 issues). Heck, I'm still hoping someone with pull will pick up Sephie's story. Same for the rest of the CrossGen comics, or most of them, anyway.Long ago, on the planet Demetria, a terrible cataclysm on the world's surface catapulted gigantic rocks into the sky where they hung around, kept buoyant by ores with lighter-than-air properties. These rocks then were fashioned into floating island city-states with trade between them becoming the primary source of commerce.The prosperous floating city of Meridian is inhabited by renowned shipbuilders and highly coveted by Ilahn, the dour Minister of the floating city of Cadador. When Ilahn poisons Turos, the Minister of Meridian - who happens to be his brother - he sets in motion an epic adventure full of blood and thunder and war in which he's cast as the villain. MERIDIAN is set in the shared CrossGen Universe - also known as the Sigilverse - and so the mysterious sigils - brands which bestow amazing powers to their bearers - soon make their presence known. Ilahn is the benefactor of one sigil which marks his throat and grants him the power of decay and destruction. Ilahn becomes the new Minister of Meridian and begins to crush the city under his boot heel.But a sigil has also passed on to young Sephie, daughter of the murdered Turos, and Sephie now has the power of renewal, of healing and immeasurable energy. Sephie, gentle and inexperienced, now bears the burden of freeing her people and reclaiming Meridian. She flees Ilahn's clutches and undertakes an arduous journey. She begins to foment insurrection. She has tons to learn.The fourth volume and writer Barbara Kesel and fabulous artist Steve McNiven have brought us to this point now, when after many adventures Sephie, ready or not, at last returns to Meridian and must face her uncle Ilahn in battle. Sephie has made alliances but still finds herself overwhelmed by a new and terrifying war machine called a cannon. Too, Ilahn is aided by one of the ever meddling godlike Firsts. One edge for Sephie is the knowledge and tactics she'd picked up from the otherworlder Samandahl Rey. Will it be enough?I can see why MERIDIAN was regarded with such favor. Great writing, great art, awesome teenaged heroine. Thru all she's endured, Sephie retains an innocence about her, and this innocence is her most endearing quality. Kesel juggles a vast and likable cast, but it's really all about Sephie (okay, okay, Ilahn himself is a dark and fascinating character). We see Sephie forced to grow up quick. We see her good heart and watch as she rails against committing acts of violence, however necessary. And we see her learn the true burden of leadership, that responsibility must inevitably trump personal desires and personal choice. There's romance for Sephie with her dashing best friend, but she nips that in the bud because of the distraction it provides. And then Sephie finds herself confronted with a horrible choice: save the life of a loved one or save as many people as she can. Tears and heartbreak and betrayal and the mantle of command, they murder Sephie's youth. I wish I knew how everything turned out."},{"Title":"Meridian v. 4: Coming Home","review":"With the great art, young woman focus, and advanture storyline, I have just now gotten into comic books! I can't put down each book that comes out until I finish it. I definitely recommend this series to any teen-age girl. Doing what must be done, Sephie is moral and brave. Like I said, I can't wait for the fifth book!"},{"Title":"Meridian v. 4: Coming Home","review":"Beautiful illustrations engaging story line and fantastically colored, Meridian is one of my favorite comics of all time.

We read the version of the Ramayana offered in it. I & my classmates found that it was lacking in some important details of the epic. My professor said that he chose this one because it was a \\"cheap, small book.\\" However, he did not realize that this new version has huge print so it is a massive book. He is not going to require it for any future class. I recommend finding a used copy of the old version or else an alternative."},{"Title":"Oh, Jerusalem","review":"The subject of this book arise passions all around the world: the birth of the State of Israel in 1948. Since then controversy, war and a seemingly endless conflict between Jews and Arabs rage unquenched.Any text approaching these events will be immediately scrutinized and criticized by confronting parties.The authors are not rookies; they have a well earned reputation thru their previous book \\"Is Paris Burning?\\" (1965). They apply the technique of interviewing key witness, ranging from public figures to almost unknown particulars. All of them have their saying and express their viewpoints unrestricted.Collins and Lapierre take this huge mass of information to produce a coherent, ordered, dynamic and griping story. At the same time they managed to keep the balance without avoiding sore spots.This is an informative book commendable for anyone who is interested in Near East story. You may start from here and proceed afterwards with more partisan essays, giving them credit as it suits to your particular beliefs.Reviewed by Max Yofre."},{"Title":"Best Friends","review":"Something to buy for your friends to show them examples of just how friendships all fall into a similar mold."},{"Title":"Autobiography of Delfina Cuero: A Diegueno Woman","review":"I gave this 5 stars for its significance to understanding San Diego, rather than for the composition or structure of the book. It was fascinating to read tales about the daily life of an indigenous person living off the land in San Diego. It was such a short time ago! I learned about rituals and stories told, medicinal herbs, and the critical search for food in a rich recount of an overlooked, under-examined culture. It made me fall in love with my hometown in a new way."},{"Title":"Olympia: Paris in the Age of Manet","review":"This is a marvelous book and a great companion to Ross King's \\"Judgment of Paris\\". Friedrich's serendipitous approach means one is never sure what he's going to examine next: is this sentence about Offenbach going to lead to a whole exposition of that composer's place in 19th century French music and society? Is Manet's syphilitic condition going to be mentioned in passing or is the author going to expound on the origins of the disease, its treatments at the time and its ghastly symptoms, pre antibiotics? Friedrich is hardly attention-deficit though, he treats each subject with due care and unearths all kinds of interesting historical tidbits. Manet is the connecting theme throughout and his life is examined closely as are the travails and triumphs of his impressionist followers: Degas, Morisot, Monet, Pissarro at al. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Olympia: Paris in the Age of Manet","review":"This book is a fascinating and fun read about the people and culture of Manet's time. It may not be for someone looking for technical historical accuracy or for an indepth review of Manet the artist, but if you're looking to learn about this period of time and enjoy the ride, this one's for you."},{"Title":"Olympia: Paris in the Age of Manet","review":"Reading about France and particularly Paris in the 19th century is about as much fun as you can have with history. There is Napoleon, Louis Philippe, the great novelists like Flaubert and Hugo, the Revolution of 1848 which aided and abetted Marxism and then there is the deliciously ridiculous Louis Napoleon and his twenty year \\"empire.\\" Think Schwarzenegger as an American dictator and maybe you get close to the second Napoleon era.But with impressionism and in particular, Edward Manet we have the clear stirrings of modernism and Friedrich takes that as his subject. Or so it seems. The question of modernism is clearly raised but hardly tackled and Manet comes somewhat alive in these pages as do many other people but not really the history. Its as if the people are characters in a historical drama but the sets are crudely painted cardboard. This a romp through a colorful, eventful period and nothing more.I found Ross King's \\"The Judgement of Paris\\" which covers similar ground, much more compelling because he grounded his narrative in a conflict between Manet and Meissonier which made not just the personalities but the events described come alive. He also did much better at conveying the horror of the Prussian siege of Paris during 1871."},{"Title":"Olympia: Paris in the Age of Manet","review":"This book is mostly a collection of spicy anecdotes, with a little historical narrative thrown in. If you're looking for any kind of in-depth analysis of the era, or of Manet's art, look elsewhere; if you want a light read, it's OK."},{"Title":"Olympia: Paris in the Age of Manet","review":"Paris during the reign of Louis Napoleon was a fascinating period, and its figures were larger than life: Napoleon, Eugenie, Berlioz, Wagner, Hugo, Zola, Manet, Monet and the \\"great horizontals\\". Americans, English, Germans, Italians and Russians went to Paris for culture, art and, let's face it, a little bit of sex. Unfortunately, this period needs a first-rate historian and Otto Friedrich is not that. You read \\"Olympia\\" in spite of the writer, as the history of a fascinating time and the men and women who made it great."},{"Title":"The Psychology of Good and Evil: Why Children, Adults, and Groups Help and Harm Others","review":"This book of Mr. Staub is just impressive. It explains how, depending on the education you give the children of your country, they will become 'blind' patriots or 'constructive' patriots. It explains how you can propagate goodness in society and how you can detect and stop evilness. If there is a treaty in this world that gives the clues to stop terrorism, nazism, and any act of undesired violence, but also how to heal wounds between different groups who were enemies in the past and from there build a new caring, loving, friendly society, it is this book of Mr. Staub. Just impressive : Probably few men like Mr. Staub in this world have done so much for peace to appear and propagate between human beings."},{"Title":"Win32 System Services: The Heart of Windows 98 and Windows 2000 (3rd Edition)","review":"I can't say enough good things about this book.

On a serious note, this is a good book. In a concise and always-to-the-point manner it covers a multitude of frequently happening systems-programming scenarios (with lots of sample code). It's almost like an intelligently written reference combined with a readable programmer's guide. For an initial in-depth study Richter's books are better, but this one is good to scan through once and keep it within reach. You will use it all the time (I do, and I have all editions of it). Whenever you, sort of, know what you need but don't quite remember the exact how-tos, this book will give you a quick and exact answer.Bottom line: unequivocally worth having.PPS. I was motivated by Mr Rothwell's review to post this; his review, I think, is unfair: the problem he experienced is due to a manufacturing defect and has nothing to do with the book's value (btw, my copies, all editions, have all been printed OK, so it _is_ possible to get a well-made copy).

The standard-priced copy I ordered and received from Amazon was the worst I have seen. I honestly don't know if it is Prentice Hall PTR decision to print books in such poor quality or I received a faked copy from Amazon.The whole book is just like a photocopy from the original book. Some of the printed words are so faint that it is hard to read; on the first page of most chapters, the first letter in the opening sentence is half-missing in the print; the paper used was obvious of inferior quality. I would actually doubt it is an original real book. I have not read the book yet. This sounds like a good book but you need to be able to read it as well.

The book is full of errors, typos, and many of the answers to the questions are placed incorrectly resulting in an absolutely frustrating experience for someone who is probably already suffering anxiety at having to take the SAT II to begin with. (I know it was for me). I suggest you buy a similar book from another publisher. Their editors messed up. When trying to take practice tests and determine how I'd do on the SAT II, I was confronted with answers for questions all jumbled, making me (at first glance) believe that I had repeatedly failed the practice exam and giving me no hope for the real test. (You can surely imagine how frustrating this was after all of the studying I had been doing!) Many questions also did not have supporting information in the review part, so there was no way to go back and look up something you might not understand and need to review again. Some of the answers given in the answer key were not backed up by the explanations and some of the explanations contradicted themselves so you kind of didn't really know if your answer was right or not, which doesn't help much. Please note that I'm an honors student with a very high average so it's not like I'm whining and just trying to blame the publishers. I just think that it's important for the book to HELP you study for the SAT II, not CONFUSE you. In short: this book helped only slightly, and I would NOT recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"McGraw-Hill's SAT Subject Test: Biology E/M: Biology-E and Biology-M (McGraw-Hill's SAT Biology E/M)","review":"I am totally disgusted with this review book. I have been studying this review for a little over a week and I just cannot stand it anymore. I find a typo on every page, literally. The tests are both unrealistic and have the wrong answers printed in the back of the book. Additionally, there is no scoring guide to even gauge how well you are doing. Not that that would matter, because there is really no way to even find out which questions you got wrong in the first place.

Along with the many typos, this book doesn't even teach everything that is found in the practice tests in the back of the book, and even made mistakes in the answer key.

But seeing as though McGraw-Hill got the forumla for the Krebs Cycle wrong due to a typo, I have lost a lot of confidence. 2 NADH ARE NOT THE NET GAIN FROM KREBS PER PYRUVATE!

She carried her readers on a well-orchestrated journey with many interweaves of truisms that concern this earthly existence. It is difficult to imagine a person's ability to come away from &quot;A Journey to Hell and Back&quot; without asking the existential question - &quot;What is the meaning of Life?&quot; Surely, Ms. Johnson caused this reader to reexamine the question, and to reckon with the power of the human will to survive. However, Ms. Johnson moved a step beyond survival. She has PREVAILED!! She prevailed beyond her overwhelming yearn for acceptance that this reader sensed throughout her story.Charlotte Russell Johnson's story is like a nightmare. It reminds this reader of a child's sudden awakening from a nightmare, and the child finds that his mother is there, saying all those appropriate things, like &quot;it is going to be okay, I am here, hold my hand&quot;. And when Ms. Johnson awoke from her nightmare, she found God there, and realized that He was there all the time. He was reassuring to her that she would be okay and that she is His child, and thereby, meeting the greatest acceptance of all. Yes, Charlotte Johnson has been to hell. However, more importantly, she came back. Just as the great Shirley Caesar frequently says, &quot;if there is a way in, then there is a way out.&quot; If you are not sure, just think about Calvary.Best Wishes Charlotte,James"},{"Title":"A Journey to Hell and Back","review":"This book takes you thru the life of a woman who has truly been to hell and back and has survived to tell the story.

Her life is a perfect example of how the devil and the Lord are both drawing us to them. They put before us death and life and ultimately it is up to us to chose whom we will serve and who we will belong to. On this earth, it seems that that the draw to a sinful destructive way of living is more powerful. Yet, as Charlotte so honestly expresses, when the scales fall from our eyes we can see how God is protecting us even in the midst of a horrible situation. Why and when the scales fall off is a mystery. But we do know God desires that ALL of us come to be free from a life of destroying ourselves and our loved ones through self physical abuse of our bodies and the mental and emotional pain that follows a life of sinful indulgences. What's more is Charlotte doesn't just leave us with a yearning for our own healing. She gives us her e-mail at the back of her book so we can request prayer. She responded to my e-mail in one day! Finally, I admire her courage to tell her life story so honestly.

As a child she was overweight, had low self esteem issues and grew up in a single parent home. As she came upon her teenage years Charlotte blossomed into a beautiful young woman. She was very intelligent at an early age and had the tools to achieve whatever goals and dreams she had in mind. Charlotte had one major downfall, herself. She liked to take walks on the wild side and that often got her into trouble.With her intelligence and book smarts Charlotte just knew that one day she would go to college. Instead she fell into a world of drugs, pregnancy, prison and despair. Her penchant for trouble led her to a very bad situation that would forever change the course of her life.A Journey To Hell and Back by author Charlotte Russell Johnson is filled with pain and hope. The author is very honest and up front about the bad choices that she has made in life. She also shows that she has overcome her troubles and has become a productive member of society. My only complaint about this book was repetition. Throughout the story the author kept referring to certain events over and over again and that proved to be distracting. After reading her story I have tremendous respect for Charlotte Russell Johnson and wish her well with her life and any future projects.Reviewed by Simone A.

And I noticed how well the scriptures she uses every few pages totally fits her situation. Those spoke to me as well.Ms. Johnson, keep on the narrow path and remain thankful for everything He does for you. I am now ready to read your book Mama's Pearls.

She purchased \\"A Journey To Hell And Back\\" by Charlotte Russel Johnson. Charlotte is a local author from here in Columbus, GA.This book really touched me deep into my soul. It's a story of a very hard life started at a very young age. Charlotte told about how she grew up in the projects, left the projects and only to return to the saftey of the projects. She told us how she sold drugs right here on Victory Dr. A street many of us drive everyday.

Ms. Johnson never considered herself an author, not by any stretch of the imagination. However, after living life dangerously close to the edge, hitting rock bottom, using faith to pick herself up again, dust off the pieces and rejoin the human race &#8211; Ms. Johnson is a firm believer that with God&#8217;s help &#8211; anything is possible.Ms. Johnson is the new author of a book entitled, &#8220;A journey To Hell and Back&#8221; &#8211; a personal saga. The first 100 pages of the book were written in two weeks, although the book had been eight years in the making. The book is a strongly written, powerful account of a life that at times is hard to believe, at intervals sad, at time peaks encouraging and overall worth living.The Columbus native was born and raised in Warren Williams Public Housing.

History has a number of these oddities whose influence is more decisive than their immediate results. Valmy comes to mind in the time of the French Revolution. A paltry action, but it helped save the new French Republic.In Ireland the Boyne remains an event held hostage by political agendas and sectarian interests. In the North it is celebrated every year by the infamous Orange Parades on the 12th of July. Yet the battle was fought on the 1st of July 1690 (old style) not the 12th. The Boyne was also not as truly decisive as the Battle of Aughrim fought a year later on the same July 12th date, 1691. Through a bizarre twist of fate the Boyne is celebrated as the battle that saved Protestanism in the North, yet because of the change over from old to new calanders in that period, the event is now celebrated on July 12th. Most north irish are not aware of this irony. They celebrate the 12th of July as Willaim's victory at the Boyne, instead of Aughrim in 1691. Again, politics have subordinated history to its own purposes here.So much for history's irony concerning this event. The author has attempted to put together a comprehensive study of the battle. One that is badly needed I might ad! For too long this event has been viewed simply as an English vs Irish issue. It was only in a very limited and almost accidental sense. The Boyne was part of the grander scheme of events associated with the wars of Louis XIV of France in europe. With Catholic James II desposed by his own incompetence by the Glorious Revolution in 1689, England brought over William III of Holland and his English wife, Mary, James II ardently protestant daughter. James abandoned his English crown and rushed to France to seek help from Louis XIV. Distracted by his numerous wars on the Continent, Louis was only willing to provide limited help, although he did see the danger of William of Orange becoming de facto king of England. But Louis was more interested in matters in Germany at the moment instead of the Netherlands and England. He would later perhaps regret that stratgeic gaffe. Still, we can see that all parties wanted to use Ireland as a means in which to regain the English crown. Makes no bones about it, this was a purely dynastic war. There were few notions of nationalism or patriotism here! The Irish people really did not stand to benefit no matter which party won, despite what propagandists for both Protestant and Catholic have said since. This is also the beginning of the lost cause strugle of the Stewarts and their Jacobite followers who would attempt several more claims on the English crown after their failure in Ireland.The author points out many of these facets and provides a helpful background analysis of the leaders and troops involved. The Boyne was truly a battle of light-weight generals. William was no genus, and James was barely competent! So its no surprise that the Boyne is really more an accident than a planned event. By comparing this battle to others in the period the author provides a good means to see it objectively. While there are frequent and lenghy digressions at times, the information imparted is well worth the diversion. The discussion of the emerging military technologies of the battle is really what makes the Boyne interesting from a military history perpective. The gradual eclipse of the Pike, and Matchlock musket, to be replaced by the newer Flintlock and socket bayonet package is a minor revolution in military developments itself. All of the various armies of the period were in different processes of accepting this switch over, which the Boyne shows well because so many different national contingents fought there. William as Stadtholder of the United Provinces in the Netherlands has access to Dutch, as well as newly formed English regiments, and through his political and relgious alliances Danish, Irish Protestants and French Hugannot troops as well. James II has Jacobite Irish, displaced English Catholics and a brigade of French regulars. Again, we can see that this is a battle being fought on many different social, political levels.The author's actual description of the battle attempts to correct many long felt assumptions. William did not intend to feint against Jame's left frank, and attack in the middle. He was seeking a battle of encirclement, but the clumsy methods of coordinating troop movments in the period prevented any such development, and what William got was a weakening of the Jacobite center to refuse against his flank movements. This enabled him to force acorss the Boyne at Oldbridge his Dutch, Danish, Irish, and French Hugannot regiments aganist a weakend Jacobite center. The fighting that resulted was desultry, and of relitively brief durration. The Jacobite cavalry covered itself in glory by charging heroically against William's massed infantry, but the of the Jacobite foot were gradually puished back by superior discipline and firepower. James who kept the French and other good Irish troops off on the Left against a threat that never materialized also ruined his chances for a better outcome. If the French had faced off against the Dutch Guards at Oldbridge a different battle might have resulteThe author provides a nice summation of events occuring after the battle, and shows that while the french failed to do much in the battle itself, they did help form a strong rearguard to save James defeated, but un-destroyed army. In fact this book shows that had james stuck it out in ireland after the battle he might easily have gott'en a better result in the next action. Instead like jacobites who would follow him, he took ship at the first set-back. With an event like this shrouded in so much Irish myth and lore, its good to see an Irishman trying to give us a clear version of things. This book should be required reading throughout ireland, especially in the North where they have a somewhat skewed perspective of this event. A really good read for those interested in warfare of the period, as well as Irish history."},{"Title":"Greater U Street (DC) (Images of America)","review":"The U Street Area of Washington, D.C. has had a long and varied history. It is best known as Washington D.C.'s Black Broadway for the vibrancy of its nightlife and for the many African American performing artists and intellectuals it attracted during the 1920s - 1930s. But U Street included much more than entertainment. It was the center of a largely self-contained African American community whcih flourished during the years of segregation beginning in the early 20th Century. In the late 1960s, U Street was decimated by the riots that followed the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and the community was slow to recover. Today, with the completion of the U Street Cardozo Metro Station, the African American Civil War Memorial, and the Reeves Municipal Center, U Street is a thriving and lively neighborhood in a city very different from the segregated Washington D.C. prior to the 1960s The Greater U Street Area became a National Register Historic District in 1999.In his photographic history \\"Greater U Street\\" (2002), published as part of the \\"Images of America\\" series, Paul K. Williams offers an overview of U Street from its beginnings to the present day. Williams is a Washington D,C, historian who works with a firm that specializes in historic properties. He has written several books about Washington D.C. neighborhoods for Images of America.In a brief opening chapter, William begins with the Civil War era when the area that became U Street was used as an encampment area for Union soldiers. William offers some rare views of Civil War life and of the hospitals and orphanages, and some of the people, that made U Street home before the 20th Century.The remainder of the book traces the development of what became black U Street, the \\"City Within a City\\". Williams offers a view of both change and continuity. Many historic buildings on U Street were designed by African American architects, flourished through the 1960s, and then fell into neglect. Williams traces the history of buildings such as the Whitelaw and Dunbar Hotels, the 12th Street YMCA. and the True Reformers Building, all of which have a long history within the community. Williams also devotes substantial space to old Griffith Stadium, located at the eastern boundary of the U Street Corridor, the site of the current Howard University Hospital. Griffith Stadium was on of the few Washington D.C. facilities which was never segregated. It was home to the old Washington Senators as well as to Washington D.C. teams in the Negro Leagues.Williams documents U Street as the \\"Black Broadway\\" and his book is replete with photographs of performers who appeared on U Street. These include Bessie Smith, Billie Holiday, Sarah Vaughn, Ella Fitzgerald, Duke Ellington, Cab Calloway, Pearl Bailey,Louis Armstrong, and Harry Belafonte. The list could be extended. U Street was also home to the early African American lyric soprano, Lillian Evans Tibbs, known as \\"Madame Evanti\\" and to literary figures such as Langston Hughes, Jean Toomer, and Alain Locke who are also portrayed briefly in Williams's book.In the chapter from which I took the title to this review, Williams shows everyday life on U Street during the 1940s and 1950s. During this time, the area included many African American owned businesses some of which, such as the Industrial Savings Bank and the small Whitelaw Market, still operate today. For me the high point of the book is a series of photographs by the African American photographer Gordon Parks which show a wide variety of U Street life, from stores to homes to street. Parks's photographs together with others (pp. 71-84) bring the U Street area to life as little else can.Near the end of the book, Williams offers several photographs of the destruction resulting from the riots on U Street in 1968. He also tells the sad tale of the subsequent deterioration of many of the community landmarks. Recovery was slow, in part because the construction of the Metro station restricted access to U Street, driving out many of the businesses that tried to return to the area in the early 1970s.The final chapter of the book shows briefly the current resurgence of U Street, juxtaposed with photographs of historical buildings that remain in a state of decay. Appropriately, the book both begins and ends with photographs of a landmark U Street restaurant, Ben's Chili Bowl, which survived both the 1968 disturbances and the Metro construction to celebrate its 50th Anniversary in August 2008. Ben's Chili Bowl is itself the subject of a recent book in the Images of America series.Those who live in or visit Washington D.C. have the opportunity to visit U Street for themselves, to walk a historic trail, and to see the sites described in this book and more. But for those who may see U Street and for those who have no contact with it, this book captures something of a special community.Robin Friedman"},{"Title":"Greater U Street (DC) (Images of America)","review":"I really enjoyed the book, being a native Washingtonian it brought back some old memories."},{"Title":"Greater U Street (DC) (Images of America)","review":"I really enjoyed the book, being a native Washingtonian it brought back some old memories."},{"Title":"Greater U Street (DC) (Images of America)","review":"One of his many on the city's neighborhoods, this book captures the old balck U Street in all its glory.

Maybe it is just my perception or the expectation I had after reading these reviews but before buying the book that lead to my disappointment in the book. What were my expectations...? I did expect Galen to tell me what he thinks and feels before, during, and after taking those great pictures. I did NOT expect a HOW-TO book (which it is definitely not). I expected a book about artistic approach to the outdoor photography. What I found instead was mostly a travel log. The first 2 chapters were as close to my expectation as it ever got. The author talked some about his creative approach and very little about his technical one. The rest of the book doesn't even present his \\"photographic philosophy\\". He simply talks about his travels, places he visited, people he met. All that would be great for an illustrated travel book but not for a book that was supposed to tell me about how HE came to those pictures, what (in his opinion) made those pictures great or standing out (there is some of it but so little it almost doesn't exist). The book's title has \\"inner game\\" words in it. I wanted to know what that \\"inner\\" game was before, during, and after taking EACH picture (or at least most of them). Overall - disappointing and expensive for that."},{"Title":"Galen Rowell's Inner Game of Outdoor Photography","review":"If you're a serious photographer (amateur or pro) and find your interest in shooting lagging occasionally, Rowell's enthusiasm might be contagiousness enough to provide a cure. This man was passionate about photography and went to extraordinary ends to get the shots he visualized. The majority of the book deals with his philosophy of photography and how he accomplished what he did. There's also much excellent technical advice. The book's only shortcoming, from my very personal perspective (take it for what it's worth), is the undercurrent of Rowell's ample ego. Were the personal pronoun &quot;I&quot; deleted from the book, its page count would be reduced considerably. Nonetheless, I still strongly recommend &quot;Inner Game&quot; for the highly passionate and very personal account that it is - an extraordinary photographer's testimonial to a life totally devoted to the art of photography and love of nature. It makes you want to climb a mountain and take pictures!"},{"Title":"Galen Rowell's Inner Game of Outdoor Photography","review":"I have enjoyed Galen Rowell's photography and writing for many years. His column in &quot;Outdoor Photography&quot; magazine is probably the main reason I renew my subscription.This volume, like its predecessor &quot;Galen Rowell's Vision,&quot; is a collection of his columns from that magazine, arranged thematically, with more of his photos to illustrate the points made. He ranges from how to photograph, to technical issues and equipment, to environmental issues, to seeing and creating.I don't want to be Galen Rowell. I don't want to photograph like Galen Rowell. But I like his viewpoint and outlook. He seems to be able to put these things into words a bit better than most other photographers. This is a worthy addition to any outdoor photographer's bookshelf, not to mention the armchair photographer."},{"Title":"Galen Rowell's Inner Game of Outdoor Photography","review":"I could not possibly say enough about the brilliance of Galen Rowell. It is self-evident from his photographs that he is both a technical master and an artist with tremendous vision -- he possesses an extraordinary ability to capture and convey breathtaking images and moments in time.What is extremely lucky for other photographers like me, constantly striving to learn and improve, is that Galen Rowell is also a phenomenal writer. Some can do; some can teach -- Galen Rowell is one of those rare instances of a master of both.The first time I picked up his Mountain Light (a MUST read), I heard a voice speaking to exactly all of the difficulties I had encountered in my work, explaining what the problems were, and clearly showing me how to correct them.Some of Galen Rowell's photographs are so extraordinary that some people doubt whether they are authentic -- let me just say, read Galen's teachings, apply them to your own work, and you will understand the power of this man's vision. Before studying his work and writing, I would not have believed what I could do with my own camera.Galen Rowell's Inner Game of Outdoor Photography is yet another magnificent addition to his collection of works which will allow any photographer to expand and fulfill their potential, and to achieve realization of their artistic and personal vision."},{"Title":"Galen Rowell's Inner Game of Outdoor Photography","review":"This is a review that I have been meaning to write for some time, but with the recent, tragic death of the author in a light plane crash, its time to put pen to paper.Galen Rowell was one of the outstanding adventure photographers of our time. A major proponent of \\"participatory photography\\", Rowell's unique approach was based less on equipment and technique, and more on vision and philosophy. Participatory photography is an approach where the photographer is not a passive observer of the subject, but someone who is interacting with the environment and the subjects. Rowell was an active participant, and as such was a noted mountain climber and hiker, skills that allowed him to get a unique perspective that most photographers don't even get close to.Most of us have seen those photos of a climber hanging delicately from a cliff face, and marvelled at the extreme situation in which that climber has got themselves into. Yet few of us stop to think about the photographer, who is right there in the same place taking that photo. Many times that photographer was Galen Rowell.His remarkable photographs have been featured in National Geographic, Outdoors and Outdoor Photographer. He wrote 18 books; some of them coffee table books, others more instructive about his approach to photography, and some of them about climbing.The Inner Game of Outdoor Photography is one of Rowell's most recent books. Inner Game is a compilation of various articles that Rowell has written over the years for Outdoor Photographer magazine.Clearly underwater photography is a form of participatory photography - it is difficult for the photographer to be passive. Although not known for underwater images, Rowell's philosophy and approach is one that underwater photographers should consider. Few other photographers become so much a part of their environment as underwater photographers!As a matter of interest, Rowell did in fact do some underwater photography, and some of these pictures are published in Inner Game. When you look at these, underwater photographers may notice some backscatter - a curse that most land based photographers never learn much about. But the composition, the organisation of the elements within the photo and the technical exposure are up there with the best, as you would expect. His landscape and adventure photography are without equal.Many underwater photographers have an extensive library of books on our subject. Many of us read up on photographic fundamentals, landscape photography, macro photography and so on, due to the parallels between topside and underwater techniques. This book is different - it focuses on the philosophy and approach. These are aspects independent of environment.The Inner Game of Outdoor Photography is a superbly written and beautifully illustrated book. I would recommend this book highly to underwater photographers, landscape photographers, and indeed to any photographer who understands the importance of vision in image creation...."},{"Title":"Galen Rowell's Inner Game of Outdoor Photography","review":"Galen Rowell's photographies speek for themselves (marvelous illustrations!!!). This book provides the intellectual background (basically a compilation of more or less independent essay from \\"Outdoor photographer\\"). Just like other outdoor photographers Galen Rowell states that being a promissing (or talented) outdoor photographer one basically needs to be a naturalist.Hence this book is short on technical advice (that's why I rated it only with 4 stars), but if advice is given it's precious (fill flash and flash compensation, aerial \\"wisdom\\" etc.). IMHO it is a backdraw that it sometimes reads like a Nikon advertisement.After the more technical first part the rest of the book primarily deals with ethical (e.g. altering of digitized images, overcrowded tourist ressorts etc.) topics and major experiences.Although Rowell sometimes sounds a bit snobbish, always being the first, the last, the only one, the most patient, the best informed etc. (which he probably was), it's exciting to read throughout the entire book.I'm gratefull for new insights and the inspiration to focus on human perception when composing images (actually the book deserves some more stars for this). This book encouraged me to think about composition rather from the viewers perspective than from the photographer's. Rowell gives some book recommendations, but I started with Richard Zakia's very readable \\"Perception and Imaging\\" for it was the most recent on the market.Throughout the book Rowell emphazises that well made photographies convey a particular spirit from the photographer experiencing the situation towards the viewer whose only chance to capture the mood is to find it in the photography.Rowell tells you what it took him to take his pictures and, besides just interesting anecdotes, encourages to commit to the situation.If you're searching for technical advice look for something else (e.g. John Shaw's Nature Photography Field Guide which is simply brilliant). Sooner or later you'll come across Galen Rowell and you'll find out that it's not just handling your gear."},{"Title":"Galen Rowell's Inner Game of Outdoor Photography","review":"As an underwater photographer, I have a lot of books about this type of photography, but not many about topside shooting. Frankly, I have read enough about apertures and shutter speeds to last me a lifetime.This book appealed to me because it talks less about the technical aspects, and more about the philosophical approaches to outdoor photography. Galen Rowell has made some incredible photographs, and I am inspired by his approach and how he remains true to his vision.There is also a good discussion on the ethics of digital manipulation - a very timely and relavant topic.Get this book. Having read it, I have been inspired to order 3 more of Rowell's books"},{"Title":"Galen Rowell's Inner Game of Outdoor Photography","review":"The best book I have ever purchased and I have read a lot of books. Have read this one four times in the 2 years I've had it and actually found more useful information each time. I think this is due to the fact that it seems you can only unlock in your mind the sense of what Galen is saying once you have taken something, applied it to your photography, seen a dramatic improvement and then gone back to check you haven't missed anything. It is then that the magic occurs and what appeared on first reading to be a simple statement is now laden with meaning not visible before. I expect to learn from these passages for some time to come as my photography evolves. The first half is particularly insightful and ultimately very applicable, despite first appearances.A true look into a highly creative mind, it is a pleasure and somewhat of a privilege to take this walk with Galen."},{"Title":"Galen Rowell's Inner Game of Outdoor Photography","review":"People that purchased this book thinking they will be instructed on how to insert TAB-A into SLOT-B will be very disappointed.People that purchase a book on electrodynamics to tell them how to change a light-bulb will also be disappointed.Let's be very clear about this: This is not a How-To book. If you're looking for a How-To, there are people lined up around the block to tell you what to do.This is a book about capturing emotion, feeling, and energy in a photograph. Most importantly, this book discusses the need to be able to communicate these feelings and energy to other viewers. Without this, your photograph has failed. This is how to put parts of yourself (not physically) into the images you've captured. This is book that explores more the philosophy of photography than anything else.I've certainly gained a much greater appreciation on what it takes to capture those elements from this book. It's not a be-all-end-all to photographic discussion, but it has made me think. The first part of the text has probably been the most valuable, but each section thereafter ties into elements of the first section in quite interesting ways.This book is not only humbling, (as are most books written by professionals and read by amateurs,) but it is uplifting. It has both inspiring me to start down the path to being a better photographer, and has shown me with frightening clarity how my habits could turn that path into the road to mediocrity.It's sad that Mr. Rowell's voice and shutter have been silenced, but I'm glad to have been introduced to his work and writings."},{"Title":"Galen Rowell's Inner Game of Outdoor Photography","review":"Galen Rowell has become my Nikon guru. Why?? I have read enough technical information about photography to last for ages.Why do I like this book so much?? Simple....he rarely mentions any technical information, but rather, spends all of his time discussing the very important item of vision, seeing the world around us, and the essence of light and photography.This book is helping me to understand to not \\"shoot\\" and run, but rather, to look carefully before you shoot.After reading this book, I immediately found his web site, and was bummed to see that all of his workshops for 2002 are filled.Maybe in 2003, because as good as this book is, I cannot wait to actually hear him speak!!"},{"Title":"Galen Rowell's Inner Game of Outdoor Photography","review":"There is plenty of philosophy in this book based on his own experiences. If you're looking purely for a techniques book or how-to or teachings of his techniques, you'd might be disappointed because it's not organized as such although some good techniques and info are in there. You just need to do some information-mining."},{"Title":"Galen Rowell's Inner Game of Outdoor Photography","review":"As befitting a book on photography, colour separation & reproduction are excellent, photographs printed on high grade gloss paper. The font might prove a tad small for some, but the ample spacing between lines does help make for easy reading. The binding on the hard-cover version is sound & strong.As the title suggests, the book is not quite your usual travel photography book, certainly the chapters are not laid out in any conventional manner.Chapter 1 deals with the author's own inner vision, of what creates an good image. Rowell is unafraid to share his philosophy on image making.Chapter 2 explains how both equipment and mind can (and perhaps ought) to be pushed to their respective limits. Rowell is careful to emphasise that often - less is more.In Chapter 3, Rowell writes about melding of camera person's mind's eye visions with the realities & practicalities of a field trip or expedition.And finally in the last Chapter, Rowell shares his thoughts and views about how an image may be communicated to the world.While the title does caution this is not quite your average photography book - the book itself is not some esoteric journey into the dark recesses of a photographer's mind. Rowell is much too pragmatic for that.As always Rowell remained forthright and direct. The contentsensibly written, and helps the reader appreciate the mental preparations required to make good images on a field trip ... the book is by and large about how a camera persons needs to learn/understand how imagination, mind-set and perspective often determines the type & quality of images made ...While not quite the book for the new photographer trying to figure out f-stops, Rowell does shares technical tips and suggestions for the making better & more effective images.For many of us, a time comes when we begin to truly realise (not just mouth the words) but truly realise that getting the latest or most expensive equipment just isn't improving our images ...And that's when we need to read this book ..."},{"Title":"Galen Rowell's Inner Game of Outdoor Photography","review":"I've been a working photographer for 13 years so &quot;How To&quot; books are not really on my list. This book is very good in that it is more about the mindset of making good images and less about how to do it. It is in the end a collection of his Outdoor Photography articles. Since that was one of the only reasons I ever bought the magazine I find the book very useful."},{"Title":"Galen Rowell's Inner Game of Outdoor Photography","review":"The book includes amazing photographs stunningly printed but the narrative is the best part. Mr. Rowell shares technique and insite about his work and life that is valuable for any photographer regardless of their skill level. This book should be required reading for all landscape and travel photographers."},{"Title":"Galen Rowell's Inner Game of Outdoor Photography","review":"As an amateur photographer and outdoor enthusiast I really enjoyed Galen Rowell's book of essays on various aspects of outdoor photography. It really opened my eyes to new shooting ideas and has helped me to tell better stories with my pictures. He covers all aspects of outdoor photography and adventure which should help any aspiring outdoor photographer. His environmental concerns give much food for thought even 10 years after his untimely death."},{"Title":"Galen Rowell's Inner Game of Outdoor Photography","review":"This book has allowed me to grow as a photographer and overcome the preconceptions I had about photography. I don't know if it made me a better photographer, but I learned to have more control of the process. Highly recommended!!"},{"Title":"Galen Rowell's Inner Game of Outdoor Photography","review":"Lovely imagery. It's amazing that he shot everything with a 35mm. But he was a climber and it would be too much weight to haul a 4X5 up a mountain. His imagery really is excellent. I can understand his energy level as I suffer from the same affliction or maybe it is just determination to get that image. He certainly was an optimist and a very determined photographer. His books really reflect that thinking and being. For me it really is about his images though as they are artful, majestic, calming and introspective. There is solace in them, which is something that this \\"modern society\\" sadly lacks and way underrates. The silly thing of it is that it does not cost anything. So even in this bad economy it costs you little, except sweat.Others talk about his quirk of running to get a shot. I don't think there is a landscape photographer who has not done that or at least waddled very quickly and even for a mile or two or more. Then at other times it is like Still Hunting deer, where walking faster than a quarter of a mile and hour is way too fast. And you are all eyeballs, analyzing, probing, seeing."},{"Title":"Galen Rowell's Inner Game of Outdoor Photography","review":"\\"Galen Rowell's Inner Game of Outdoor Photography\\" is a collection of articles written for Outdoor Photographer magazine organized into four broad categories. Interspersed between the articles are sections of photographs. Each article is cross-listed with relevant photographs, and vice-verse. This cross listing is an effective device; coming back to various photographs as I read the essays forced me to really think about them.The first section deals with \\"creative and cognitive processes.\\" These range from the inner desire needed to go out and get that shot to an almost scholarly examination - complete with annotated bibliography - of the processes involved in human sight and the differences between what people see and what film records. I found this section to be the strongest aspect of the book as well as the most useful and interesting.The second section consists mainly of technical material ranging from how to pack your gear to ways to use flash in outdoor settings. It is pitched at a higher level than an introductory photo guide, suitable for an advanced novice like myself.The third section is primarily a collection of travel stories, often only tangentially touching on photography. However, these articles provide the context in which many of the photographs in the book were taken. Arguably, context is the crux of photography. As Rowell points out, photographs are used to tell a story - though maybe not the one intended by the photographer.The last section conveys Rowell's view on the positive and negative effects that photography and outdoor travel have on the natural environment, as well as on the art of color outdoor photography vis-&agrave;-vis fine art photography. These essays are thought provoking and, like the rest of the book, very well written.I had feared from the title that I was in for a bunch of pseudo-spiritual babble, but instead I found a fairly deep, if meandering, discussion of the spectrum of what outdoor photography involves."}]`),B={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:C},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:S,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},x={class:"card-container"},H=["disabled"],W={key:0},E={key:1};function M(n,o,s,u,r,i){const c=f("PoemCard");return e(),t("section",null,[o[1]||(o[1]=a("div",{class:"top-banner"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),a("div",x,[(e(!0),t(g,null,y(i.visiblePoems,(h,m)=>(e(),w(c,{key:m,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(e(),t("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:o[0]||(o[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(e(),t("span",E,"Loading...")):(e(),t("span",W,"See more"))],8,H)):p("",!0)])}const P=d(B,[["render",M],["__scopeId","data-v-060bb488"]]),j=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"people/63.md","filePath":"people/63.md"}'),R={name:"people/63.md"},L=Object.assign(R,{setup(n){return(o,s)=>(e(),t("div",null,[b(P)]))}});export{j as __pageData,L as default};
