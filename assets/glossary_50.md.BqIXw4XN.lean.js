It was only after years within the education reform movement that Natalie Wexler stumbled across a hidden explanation for our country's frustrating lack of progress when it comes to providing every child with a quality education. The problem wasn't one of the usual scapegoats: lazy teachers, shoddy facilities, lack of accountability. It was something no one was talking about: the elementary school curriculum's intense focus on decontextualized reading comprehension \\"skills\\" at the expense of actual knowledge. In the tradition of Dale Russakoff's The Prize and Dana Goldstein's The Teacher Wars, Wexler brings together history, research, and compelling characters to pull back the curtain on this fundamental flaw in our education system--one that fellow reformers, journalists, and policymakers have long overlooked, and of which the general public, including many parents, remains unaware. But The Knowledge Gap isn't just a story of what schools have gotten so wrong--it also follows innovative educators who are in the process of shedding their deeply ingrained habits, and describes the rewards that have come along: students who are not only excited to learn but are also acquiring the knowledge and vocabulary that will enable them to succeed. If we truly want to fix our education system and unlock the potential of our neediest children, we have no choice but to pay attention.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=L-bvDwAAQBAJ&dq=Community+Building+in+the+Classroom&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Manager's Pocket Guide to Project Management (Manager's Pocket Guide Series)","description":"This time saving guide presents project management concepts and tools simply and effectively for the manager or administrator who is finding themselves managing and devoting more and more time to special projects.

Seeing the handsome, virile laird Payton face-to-face, however, threatens a centuries-long enmity -- and awakens Mared's deepest desires. But she will not be swayed.

Human beings speak to one another. Sounds, scents, and postures allow animals to make their point. While individual cells cana?t talk, hiss, growl, or bare their teeth, they nevertheless communicate regularly. Their language is based not on words or gestures, but on chemistry a\\"using molecules where we would use words, constructing sentences from chains of proteins. The cells that make up the bodies of muticellular organisms inform, wheedle, command, exhort, reassure, nurture, criticize, and instruct each other to direct every physiological function, report every newsworthy event, record every memory, heal every wound. And each of those chemical conversations represents an opportunity for scientists and physicians. The molecular biologists who worked for over a decade to sequence the human genome have sometimes referred to that sequence as the a?book of life.a To our cells, that a?booka is no more than a dictionarya\\"only living cells can converse, forming the network that allows our 60 trillion cells to function as a single organism. For nearly a century, researchers have been straining to hear the whispered conversations among cells, hoping to master the basics of their language. They know that if we can decipher and translate this cellular chatter, we have the potential for sending signals of our own that could repair wounds, reduce cholesterol, control insulin levels, or even block the reproduction of cancer cells. The possibilities are as endless as they are intriguing.

Drawing on the continent's rich history of inspiring exploration and artistic endeavors, Paul D. Miller a.k.a. DJ Spooky has put together his own multimedia, multidisciplinary study of Antactica. Book of Ice is one aspect of this ongoing project. In light of climate change and tireless human enterprise to be present everywhere on the planet, Miller uses Antarctica as a point on entry for contemplating humanity's relationship with the natural world. Using photographs and film stills from his journey to the bottom of the world, along with original artworks and re-appropriated archival materials, Miller ponders how Antarctica could liberate itself from the rest of the world. Part fictional manifesto, part history and part science book, Book of Ice furthers Miller's reputation as an innovative artist capable of making the old look new. The Book of Ice contains an introduction by celebrated physicist Brian Greene, author of the bestselling Fabric of the Cosmos. \\"This is not cool, this is freezing. I still have frostbite.\\" --Stefan Sagmeister \\"A rare mind encounters a rare place--this is an entirely new take on the bottom of the world, very cool (but getting warmer).\\" --Bill McKibben, American environmentalist, journalist, and author \\"Antarctica is full of wonder. Paul D Miller has visited and returned with treasure. You hold in your hand interviews, photographs, histories, architectural plans, propaganda, sheet music, hyperlinks and a manifesto demanding that you never set foot there. This is work as unbounded and untameable as the continent itself. Read it and feel dislocated in the best possible way.\\" --Raj Patel, author of The Value of Nothing","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=YfimjGQIo7gC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Understanding Environmental Administration and Law, 3rd Edition","description":"Understanding Environmental Administration and Law provides an engaging, introductory overview of environmental policy.

When the managers refused to comply, they lost their jobs but not their resolve they sued the company. Their case grew into the largest racial job discrimination class action lawsuit of its time. Shoney s eventually offered to settle out of court, and the nearly 21,000 claimants divided a $132.5 million settlement, bringing to an abrupt end a landmark case that changed corporate attitudes nationwide. The Black O is a fascinating, behind-the-scenes story populated with many unforgettable characters, including civil rights lawyer Tommy Warren, the former college football star and convicted felon who took the case; Ray Danner, the ironfisted former CEO who developed the Shoney s concept; and Justice Clarence Thomas, former head of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, which sat idly by for years while complaints mounted against Shoney s.

Marie Martin traces the evolution of post-World War II Cambodian politics and society, examining the disintegration of a once-peaceful nation. Interviews with peasants, refugees, politicians, and intellectuals, as well as exhaustive archival research, make this both a stirring ethnographic portrait and an exacting political analysis. Twenty-five years of research and travel in Cambodia, much of it spent living in peasant villages, give Martin a unique perspective on the country's tragedies. She explores the influence of colonialism, Sihanouk's fragile position, popular socialism, and the Vietnam War, and also charts the politicization of Khmer youth, the right's rise to power, and peasant revolts. The horrors that occurred under the Khmer Rouge are documented, as are the grim atrocities of the Vietnamese occupation. Martin also examines the tenuous political configurations of present-day Cambodia and considers the country's future. No book in English deals so completely with the political culture of Cambodia, and no writer has been more unrelenting and impassioned in testifying to the agony of the Cambodian people than Marie Martin. Her book will be acclaimed for its wealth of new information and for bearing eloquent witness to Cambodia's tragic story.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=vLk5c5S51FYC&dq=CAMBODIA:+A+SHATTERED+SOCIETY&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"1776-1976, 200 years of Cochran family descendants: A brief history and genealogy","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ly1wHAAACAAJ&dq=1776-1976,+200+years+of+Cochran+family+descendants:+A+brief+history+and+genealogy&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Strings: The Miracle of Life","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=5kJOtwAACAAJ&dq=Strings:+The+Miracle+of+Life&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Slam Dunks and No-Brainers: Pop Language in Your Life, the Media, and Like . . .

The second edition features a new introduction by Robert Allen that includes a discussion of the political economy of commercial television. Two new essays have been added--one an assessment of postmodernism and television, the other an analysis of convergence and divergence among the essays--and the original essays have been substantially revised and updated with an international audience in mind. Sixty-one new television stills illustrate the text. Each essay lays out the general tenets of its particular approach, discusses television as an object of analysis within that critical framework, and provides extended examples of the types of analysis produced by that critical approach. Case studies range from Rescue 911 and Twin Peaks to soap operas, music videos, game shows, talk shows, and commericals. Channels of Discourse, Reassembled suggests new ways of understanding relationships among television programs, between viewing pleasure and narrative structure, and between the world in front of the television set and that represented on the screen. The collection also addresses the qualities of popular television that traditional aesthetics and quantitative media research have failed to treat satisfactorily, including its seriality, mass production, and extraordinary popularity. The contributors are Robert C. Allen, Jim Collins, Jane Feuer, John Fiske, Sandy Flitterman-Lewis, James Hay, E. Ann Kaplan, Sarah Kozloff, Ellen Seiter, and Mimi White.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=y1NdjVYghE0C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Witch in History: Early Modern and Twentieth-Century Representations","description":"'Diane Purkiss ... insists on taking witches seriously.

The first substantive Okinawan-English lexicon in more than a century, it represents a much-needed addition to the library of reference materials on the language. The Wordbook opens to lay user and linguist alike an area heretofore accessible almost exclusively in Japanese works and adds to the general body of scholarship on various Ryukyuan languages and dialects by providing a succinct but comprehensive picture of modern colloquial Okinawan. The current work comprises nearly 10,000 entries, many with encyclopedic discussion, drawn from a wide variety of sources in addition to the author s native knowledge and from numerous areas of interest, with emphasis on the cultural traditions of Okinawa. Entries reflect both contemporary Naha usage and archaisms and areal variants when these are of cultural, historical, or linguistic interest. Thus, in addition to being a comprehensive portrait of the modern Okinawan language, the Wordbook serves as an implicit introduction to the rich field of Japanese dialect studies. Prefatory material discusses the phonology of Okinawan and the romanization scheme employed in the book, with particular attention to phonological features of the language likely to be unfamiliar to native English speakers and those acquainted only with Japanese. A general introduction to the conjugation of verbs and adjectives in Okinawan is made as well.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=8guTfpBKm5kC&dq=Okinawan-English+Wordbook:+A+Short+Lexicon+of+the+Okinawan+Language+With+English+Definitions+And+Japanese+Cognates&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A slaver's log book: Or 20 years' residence in Africa : the original manuscript","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=rMG4AAAAIAAJ&dq=A+slaver%27s+log+book:+Or+20+years%27+residence+in+Africa+:+the+original+manuscript&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Evanescence Fallen","description":"(Piano/Vocal/Guitar Artist Songbook). 11 songs from the 2003 hit major label debut album arranged for piano, voice and guitar.

Keohane is one of the most widely respected leaders in higher education. A political theorist who served as President of Wellesley College and Duke University, she has firsthand knowledge of the challenges facing modern universities: rising costs, the temptations of  corporatization,  consumerist students, nomadic faculty members, and a bewildering wave of new technologies. Her views on these issues and on the role and future of higher education are captured in Higher Ground, a collection of speeches and essays that she wrote over a twenty-year period. Keohane regards colleges and universities as intergenerational partnerships in learning and discovery, whose compelling purposes include not only teaching and research but also service to society. Their mission is to equip students with a moral education, not simply preparation for a career or professional school. But the modern era has presented universities and their leadership with unprecedented new challenges. Keohane worries about access to education in a world of rising costs and increasing economic inequality, and about threats to academic freedom and expressions of opinion on campus. She considers diversity as a key educational tool in our increasingly pluralistic campuses, ponders the impact of information technologies on the university s core mission, and explores the challenges facing universities as they become more  global  institutions, serving far-flung constituencies while at the same time contributing to the cities and towns that are their institutional homes. Reflecting on the role of contemporary university leaders, Keohane asserts that while they have many problems to grapple with, they will find creative ways of dealing with them, just as their predecessors have done.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=TSmn-5gXfTcC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Words from an Unchained Mind","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=HifPAAAACAAJ&dq=Words+from+an+Unchained+Mind&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Playing Commedia: A Training Guide to Commedia Techniques","description":"This book consists of practical games and exercises to introduce actors, directors, and teachers to the skill, characters, and history of Commedia dell' Arte.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=CMgeAQAAIAAJ&dq=Playing+Commedia:+A+Training+Guide+to+Commedia+Techniques&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Flaubert and Madame Bovary;: A double portrait","description":"Francis Steegmuller's beautifully executed double portrait of Madame Bovary and her maker is a remarkable and unusual biographical study, a sensitive and detailed account of how an unpromising young man turns himself into one of the world's greatest novelists. Steegmuller starts with the young Flaubert, prone to mysterious fits, hypochondriacal, at odds with and yet dependent on his bourgeois family. Then, drawing on Flaubert's voluminous correspondence, Steegmuller tracks his subject through friendships and love affairs, a trip to the Orient, nervous breakdown and tenuous recovery, and finally into the study, where a mind at once restless and jaded finds a focus in the precisely detailed reality of an imagined woman, utterly ordinary in her unhappiness, whose story was to revolutionize literature.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=syPvfjNA8KkC&dq=Flaubert+and+Madame+Bovary%3B:+A+double+portrait&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"All-Audio Italian CD (LL(R) All-Audio Courses)","description":"The second edition includes updates and insights on current research and pedagogical practice that have developed over the last decade.

Now, in The Nature of Economies, Jacobs proposes a radical notion that has breath-taking common sense: economies are governed by the same rules as nature itself. With the simplicity of an extremely wise and seasoned thinker, Jane Jacobs shows us that by looking to nature, we can develop economies that are both efficient and ecologically friendly. The Nature of Economies is written in dialogue form: five intelligent friends discussing over coffee how economies work. The result is a wonderfully provocative, truly ground-breaking work by one of the great thinkers of our time.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=cCeorIlLMzYC&dq=The+Nature+of+Economies&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Economic and social history of medieval Europe,","description":"The Belgian historian attempts an international viewpoint in this general history of the social and economic evolution in Western Europe","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=7E43AAAAIAAJ&dq=Economic+and+social+history+of+medieval+Europe,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Complete Illustrated Guide to Alexander Technique: A Practical Approach to Health, Poise, and Fitness","description":"Traces the history of the Alexander Technique from Alexander's first experiments on himself, to the confirmation of his technique by medical professionals and its application in everyday life.

Our society is not a melting pot but a salad bar--a bazaar in which the purveyors of goods and services spend close to $2 billion a year marketing the foods, clothing, objects, vacations, and events that help people express their (and others') ethnic identities. This is a huge business, whose target groups are the \\"hyphenated Americans\\"--in other words, all of us. As immigrant groups gain economic security, they tend to reinforce--not relinquish--their ethnic identification. Marilyn Halter demonstrates that, to a great extent, they do it by shopping. And their purchasing power is enormous. How has the marketplace responded to this hunger? Instantly and wholeheartedly: tweaking old products and inventing new ones; launching new brands in supermarkets, new music groups, vacation itineraries, language courses, toys, greeting cards, et cetera. This nexus of business and ethnicity is already seen as the hottest consumer development of this decade, and Halter is uniquely qualified to describe its origins, the exponential growth of products and advertising, and the phenomenal sales of items from salsa to Chieftains CDs. She addresses her subject with an abundance of anecdotal evidence, telling examples of ethnic marketing, and interviews with entrepreneurs (many of them immigrants) who are vigorously seizing the opportunities offered by the business of ethnicity. Shopping for Identity is provocative, intriguing, and farseeing, illuminating an important aspect of our contemporary way of life while validating the yearning we all feel for connection to our roots.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Gg9TFbaFQEkC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Alvin's secret code","description":"Twelve-year-old Alvin and his best friend Shoie use their knowledge of codes and ciphers to solve a dangerous mystery.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Yo07F0ylobgC&dq=Alvin%27s+secret+code&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Frequency of Occurrence and Ease of Articulation of Sign Language Handshapes: The Taiwanese Example","description":"In the growing body of research on sign language linguistics, one area of inquiry considers an important component of all sign languages -- handshapes -- and whether the use of specific kinds increase in direct relation to the ease of their formation. Author Jean Ann provides significant clarification in her book \\"Frequency of Occurrence and Ease of Articulation of Sign Language Handshapes: The Taiwanese Example.\\" Ann employs a straightforward methodology in her examination of the use of Taiwan Sign Language (TSL) handshapes in five succinct chapters. In the first chapter, she discusses the two approaches linguists have taken toward understanding languages, and how these theories have influenced sign language researchers' consideration of the ease of articulation and frequency of handshapes. In her second chapter, Ann delineates the physiology of hands and explains why certain digits move with greater dexterity than others. Ann applies this physiological information in the third chapter to construct a model for determining the ease of articulation of any logically possible handshape. She divides the handshapes into three categories, ranging from impossible to easy. In the fourth chapter, she applies her model to examine the patterns of TSL, first by describing the 56 handshapes identified in TSL, then determining how often each is used. She then compares the usage data to the handshapes' ease of formation. The final chapter summarizes her findings and suggests implications of this work that are bound to generate further speculation and study on sign language handshapes in the future.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=jjq-jwEACAAJ&dq=Frequency+of+Occurrence+and+Ease+of+Articulation+of+Sign+Language+Handshapes:+The+Taiwanese+Example&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Versatile Vizsla","description":"Written by a long-time breeder/handler of Vizslas, this book covers every aspect of the Smoothcoated Vizsla.

Here he speaks to our yearning to live undivided lives lives that are congruent with our inner truth in a world filled with the forces of fragmentation. Mapping an inner journey that we take in solitude and in the company of others, Palmer describes a form of community that fits the limits of our active lives. Defining a  circle of trust  as  a space between us that honors the soul,  he shows how people in settings ranging from friendship to organizational life can support each other on the journey toward living  divided no more.  This paperback edition includes two new and useful features. Circles of Trust is a DVD containing interviews with Parker J. Palmer and footage from retreats he facilitated for the Center for Courage & Renewal (www.CourageRenewal.org). Bringing the Book to Life, by Caryl Hurtig Casbon and Sally Z. Hare, is a reader's and leader's guide to exploring the themes in A Hidden Wholeness. The DVD illuminates and illustrates the principles and practices behind circles of trust. The guide includes questions that connect the DVD to the book, offering \\"a conversation with the author\\" as well as an engagement with the text. Together, these features give readers new ways to internalize the themes of A Hidden Wholeness and share with others this approach to sustaining identity and integrity in all the venues of our lives. Inspired by Palmer s writing and speaking and challenged by the conditions of twenty-first century life people across the country, from many walks of life, have been coming together in circles of trust to reclaim their integrity and help foster wholeness in their workplaces and their world. For over a decade, the principles and practices in this book have been proven on the ground by parents and educators, clergy and politicians, community organizers and corporate executives, physicians and attorneys, and many others who seek to rejoin soul and role in their private and public lives. A Hidden Wholeness weaves together four themes that its author has pursued for forty years: the shape of an integral life, the meaning of community, teaching and learning for transformation, and nonviolent social change.

Cervantes published his book in Spain in 1613. The assemblage of unique characters (eloquent witches, talking dogs, Gypsy orphans, and an array of others), the twisting plots, and the moral heart at the core of each tale proved irresistible to his enthusiastic audience. Then as now, Cervantes's readers find pure entertainment in his pages, but also a subtle artistry that invites deeper investigation. Edith Grossman's eagerly awaited translation brings this timeless classic to English-language readers in an edition that will delight those already familiar with Cervantes's work as well as those about to be enchanted for the first time. Roberto Gonz lez Echevarr a's illuminating introduction to the volume serves as both an appreciation of Cervantes's brilliance and a critical guide to the novellas and their significance.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=L0HJAQAACAAJ&dq=Exemplary+novels+of+Cervantes&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"In a German Pension (Hesperus Classics)","description":"Katherine Mansfield's 'In A German Pension' is a remarkable collection of short stories displaying all Mansfield's skill in the genre.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ACerxwEACAAJ&dq=In+a+German+Pension+(Hesperus+Classics)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Handbook of psychic discoveries","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=p06xswEACAAJ&dq=Handbook+of+psychic+discoveries&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"117 days","description":"An unforgettable account of defiance against political terror by one of South Africa's pioneering anti-apartheid activists An invaluable testimonial of the excesses of the apartheid system, 117 Days presents the harrowing chronicle of journalist Ruth First's isolation and abuse at the hands of South African interrogators after her arrest in 1963.

The third volume in the Redefining Urban and Suburban America series describes anew the changing shape of metropolitan American and the consequences for policies in areas such as employment, public services, and urban revitalization. The continued decentralization of population and economic activity in most metropolitan areas has transformed once-suburban places into new engines of metropolitan growth. At the same time, some traditional central cities have enjoyed a population renaissance, thanks to a recent book in \\"living\\" downtowns. The contributors to this book probe the rise of these new growth centers and their impacts on the metropolitan landscape, including how recent patterns have affected the government's own methods for reporting information on urban, suburban, and rural areas. Volume 3 also provides a closer look at the social and economic impacts of growth patterns in cities and suburbs. Contributors examine how suburbanization has affected access to employment for minorities and lower-income workers, how housing development trends have fueled population declines in some central cities, and how these patterns are shifting the economic balance between older and newer suburbs. Contributors include Thomas Bier (Cleveland State University), Peter Dreier (Occidental College), William Frey (Brookings), Robert Lang (Virginia Tech), Steven Raphael (University of California, Berkeley), Audrey Singer (Brookings), Michael Stoll (University of California, Los Angeles), Todd Swanstrom (St. Louis University), and Jill Wilson (Brookings).","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=63HQDAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Denial of Bosnia (Post-Communist Cultural Studies.)","description":"In 1997, Rusmir Mahmut&?ehaji&?, one of Bosnia& s leading public intellectuals, was scheduled to lecture on Bosnia at Stanford University but was unexpectedly denied an entry visa by American authorities. This book, first published in Bosnia in 1998, is an expanded version of that lecture. It is an indictment of the partition of Bosnia, formalized in 1995 by the Dayton Accord. It is also a plea for Bosnia& s communities to reject ethnic segregation and restore mutual trust. For the first time, English-speaking readers can hear this important voice of dissent from within Bosnia-Herzegovina. Mahmut&?ehaji&? (pronounced & ma-moot-che-HI-itch& ) argues for the history and reality of a Bosnia-Herzegovina based upon a model of & unity in diversity.&  He shows that ethnic and religious cultures have coexisted in Bosnia for centuries. Partitioning of Bosnia, therefore, should have been unthinkable except that a multi-ethnic, multi-faith Bosnia stood squarely in the way of Croatian and Serbian leaders determined to enact their own nationalist programs. The decisive moment came when the international community accepted the Serb-Croat argument that ancient ethnic hatreds were endemic to Bosnia. At that point, ethnic segregation became not only acceptable but desirable. With the complicity of Western powers, Serbs and Croats proceeded to carve out ethnically cleansed states. Mahmut&?ehaji&? examines the reasons why Western liberal democracies have regarded with sympathy the struggles of Serbia and Croatia for national recognition, while viewing Bosnia& s multicultural society with suspicion. As one of Bosnia's former political leaders in the early peace talks, he describes with authority how the parties were often physically aligned during formal talks, with Bosniak negotiators on one side of the table and everybody else& Serb, Croat, and international representatives& on the other. In the end, justice was subverted and the final solution justified on the basis of an intractable & conflict of civilizations.&\\" Mahmut&?ehaji&? confronts the religious dimension of the Bosnian dilemma with refreshing honesty. As a Bosniak committed to interreligious dialogue, he calls for more than simple toleration among Serbs, Croats, and Bosnians. He remembers that Judaism, Christianity, and Islam all share the same deity, and it is this common transcendent perspective that should open the door to the acceptance and celebration of religious diversity. Only in this way will Bosnia reclaim its unique civilization. The Denial of Bosnia has dire implications for the future of a Europe searching for a viable post&Cold War order. Will Europe accept ethnic segregation as a solution to the contradictions of ethnic diversity or find a way to protect and build upon this diversity? Bosnia, though currently divided and shaken to its foundations, could become a model for European progress. The greatest danger is for Bosnia to be declared just another ethnoreligious entity, in this case a & Muslim State&  ghettoized inside of Europe. If protected and allowed to develop, however, Bosnia too could find a place in the new European order.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=vUckngEACAAJ&dq=The+Denial+of+Bosnia+(Post-Communist+Cultural+Studies.)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Detective LaRue: Letters from the Investigation","description":"While on vacation, Mrs. LaRue receives letters from her dog Ike who has been falsely accused of harming the neighbor's cats and is trying to clear his name.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Mdw-5UtUWasC&dq=Detective+LaRue:+Letters+from+the+Investigation&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Workforce America!: Managing Employee Diversity as a Vital Resource","description":"Outlines the coming decline of the white- and male-dominated workforce and explains how managers must adjust to this trend","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=fU1hAAAAIAAJ&dq=Workforce+America!:+Managing+Employee+Diversity+as+a+Vital+Resource&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Computer Concepts Quicktorial [With (3) Contains Hands-On Exercises...]","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=DoJYAAAAMAAJ&dq=Computer+Concepts+Quicktorial+%5BWith+(3)+Contains+Hands-On+Exercises...%5D&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Poetry of Stephen Crane.","description":"This collection offers the complete poems of Stephen Crane (1871 - 1900), as well as essays on him by Joseph Conrad and Willa Cather.

The Woman of the Pharisees, which was first published in English in 1946 and became one of Mauriac s most accomplished novels, is a penetrating evocation of the moral and religious values of a Bordeaux community. In Brigitte, we see how the ideals of love and companionship are stifled in the presence of a self-righteous woman whose austere religious principals lead her to interfere disastrously in the lives of others. One by one the unwitting victims fall prey to the bleakness of her  perfection.  A conscientious schoolteacher, a saintly priest, her husband and stepdaughter and an innocent schoolboy are all confronted with tragedy and upheaval. But the author s extraordinary gift for psychological insight goes on to show how redeeming features inevitably surface from disaster. The unfolding drama is seen through the discerning eye of a young Louis Brigitte s stepson whose point of view is skillfully blended into the mature and understanding adult he later becomes.

In August of 1942 the first American marines charged Guadalcanal, igniting a six-month battle for two thousand square miles of jungle and sand. In that gruesome stretch sixty thousand Americans made the jump from boat to beach, and one in nine did not return. James Jones fought in that battle, and The Thin Red Line is his haunting portrait of men and war. The soldiers of C-for-Charlie Company are not cast from the heroic mold. The unit s captain is too intelligent and sensitive for the job, his first sergeant is half mad, and the enlisted men begin the campaign gripped by cowardice. Jones s moving portrayal of the Pacific combat experience stands among the great literature of World War II.

As British and American forces strike into the soft underbelly of Hitler s Fortress Europa, the new weapons of war come clearly into focus. In North Africa, tank battles unfold in a tapestry of dust and fire unlike any the world has ever seen. In Sicily, the Allies attack their enemy with a barely tested weapon: the paratrooper.

This train travels through history making stops in time to learn about the progress of travel by rail. Hop up into the cab of a speeding modern-day locomotive and look down the tracks into the past. Perhaps these are the same tracks that the diesel-electric locomotives of thirty years ago thundered down, pulling their loads. Perhaps you can see the steam engines of thirty years before that. Watch time unravel and the landscape change as the history of trains barrels through the pages of STEAM, SMOKE AND STEEL: BACK IN TIME WITH TRAINS. The first trains puffed great billowing clouds of smoke and showered passengers with burning embers as they sped down the rails at a pulse-pounding twenty miles an hour! By the 1850's, however, trains were traveling much faster, much farther, and much cleaner and train travel contributed to the growth of our nation. Young readers will be fascinated by the exciting -- and sometimes dangerous -- story of trains while they learn about the different kinds of engines, equipment, and jobs necessary for operating trains throughout history. The young narrator introduces readers to trains from the time of his great-great-great-great-great grandfather at the turn of the nineteenth century to his father's train of today, showing the great changes that invention and progress have brought over time. Patrick O'Brien's striking illustrations emphasize the beauty, grandeur, and romance of the train. Detailed and richly textured oil paintings take readers on a trip through time to ride aboard open-air cars, travel through mountain passes, and roar down the rails on high-speed bullet trains. Budding engineers will love getting a glimpse at the past and dreaming about the future of trains.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=QPVKEAAAQBAJ&dq=Steam,+Smoke,+and+Steel:+Back+in+Time+with+Trains&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Diagnosing and Treating Codependence: A Guide for Professionals Who Work with Chemical Dependents, Their Spouses, and Children (Professional Series)","description":"In Practicing Prodependence: The Clinical Alternative to Codependency Treatment, Drs.

Wade, the debate over reproductive rights has dominated America s courts, legislatures, and streets. The contributors to The Reproductive Rights Reader embrace reproductive justice for all women, but challenge mainstream legal and political solutions based on protecting free choice via neutral governmental policies, which frequently ignore or jeopardize the interests of women of color and the poor. Instead, the pieces in this interdisciplinary book including both legal cases and articles by legal scholars, historians, sociologists, political scientists and others favor a critical analysis that addresses the concrete material conditions that limit choices, the role of law and social policy in creating those conditions, and the gendered power dynamics that inform and are reinforced by the regulation of human reproduction. The selections demonstrate that the right to choice is not an automatic guarantee of reproductive justice and gender equality; to truly achieve this ideal it is essential to recognize the complexity of women s reproductive experiences and needs. Divided into four sections, the book examines feminist critiques of medical knowledge and practice; and the legal regulation of pregnancy termination, conception and child-bearing, and behavior during pregnancy.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=3jUTCgAAQBAJ&dq=God+in+Chinatown:+Religion+and+Survival+in+New+York%27s+Evolving+Immigrant+Community+(Religion,+Race,+and+Ethnicity)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Creating Masculinity in Los Angeles's Little Manila: Working-Class Filipinos and Popular Culture, 1920s-1950s (Popular Cultures, Everyday Lives)","description":"In this new work, Linda Espa?a-Maram analyzes the politics of popular culture in the lives of Filipino laborers in Los Angeles's Little Manila, from the 1920s to the 1940s. The Filipinos' participation in leisure activities, including the thrills of Chinatown's gambling dens, boxing matches, and the sensual pleasures of dancing with white women in taxi dance halls sent legislators, reformers, and police forces scurrying to contain public displays of Filipino virility. But as Espa?a-Maram argues, Filipino workers, by flaunting \\"improper\\" behavior, established niches of autonomy where they could defy racist attitudes and shape an immigrant identity based on youth, ethnicity, and notions of heterosexual masculinity within the confines of a working class. Espa?a-Maram takes this history one step further by examining the relationships among Filipinos and other Angelenos of color, including the Chinese, Mexican Americans, and African Americans. Drawing on oral histories and previously untapped archival records, Espa?a-Maram provides an innovative and engaging perspective on Filipino immigrant experiences.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=AhGgymG6luMC&dq=Creating+Masculinity+in+Los+Angeles%27s+Little+Manila:+Working-Class+Filipinos+and+Popular+Culture,+1920s-1950s+(Popular+Cultures,+Everyday+Lives)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Davenport's Art Reference & Price Guide 1997/1998 (2 vols in 1)","description":"The comprehensive and authoritative book on international artists providing auction dates & prices plus biographical data for over 250,000 artists.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=7zQDAAAACAAJ&dq=Davenport%27s+Art+Reference&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"First Reader in Korean: Writing in Mixed Script","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=SMAPAAAAYAAJ&dq=First+Reader+in+Korean:+Writing+in+Mixed+Script&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"History, Manners, and Customs of the Indian Nations Who Once Inhabited Pennsylvania and the Neighboring States","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=F8wLAAAAYAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The House of Death and Other Feluda Stories","description":"Six exciting stories of deceit, intrigue and murder, featuring Rayys super-sleuth Feluda, a.k,a, Pradosh Mitter, and his lieutenants, cousin Topshe and the dim-witted crime-writer, Lalmohan Babu.

Much has been written about shamanism in both scholarly and popular literature, but few authors have linked it to another significant visual realm art. In this pioneering study, Rebecca R. Stone considers how deep familiarity with, and profound respect for, the extra-ordinary visionary experiences of shamanism profoundly affected the artistic output of indigenous cultures in Central and South America before the European invasions of the sixteenth century. Using ethnographic accounts of shamanic trance experiences, Stone defines a core set of trance vision characteristics, including enhanced senses, ego dissolution, bodily distortions, flying, spinning and undulating sensations, synaesthesia, and physical transformation from the human self into animal and other states of being. Stone then traces these visionary characteristics in ancient artworks from Costa Rica and Peru. She makes a convincing case that these works, especially those of the Moche, depict shamans in a trance state or else convey the perceptual experience of visions by creating deliberately chaotic and distorted conglomerations of partial, inverted, and incoherent images.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=dJljkxOP27IC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Clive Barker's books of blood: Volumes one, two and three","description":"A landmark collector's edition of short stories by an immensely popular horror writer brings back the terrifying tales with which he first gained acclaim.

The German victory of 1940 stunned the world. France, thought to be a major European power with one of the world's largest armies, collapsed in less than seven weeks. The secret of the Wehrmacht's success lay in its revolutionary new tactics of blitzkrieg: lightning war. Fast-moving tank divisions supported by armored, mobile infantry swept over opposition, helped by both conventional bombers and deadly Stuka dive-bombers. Alan Shepperd's highly detailed text examines the tactics, organization, and equipment of the Allied and German forces, and provides a daily account of the most crucial period of the battle. The tank marks as great a revolution in land warfare as an armored steamship would have marked had it appeared amongst the toilsome triremes of Actium. So said General Heinz Guderian, architect of the stunning German victory over France in 1940. Alan Shepperd examines tactics and the German's application of them to their 1940 French campaign, as he looks at the differing organization and equipment of both Allied and German forces. He gives a daily account of the most crucial period of the battle, that of May 10-17, and also examines the evacuation of Dunkirk, in which 337,000 troops, mostly British, were taken out of the Germans' clutches at the last moment by the Royal Navy supported by a vast armada of privately owned vessels. Not only are German strengths looked at but Allied weaknesses are also examined: their ineffective use of tanks, the obsolete French defensive strategy, and, possibly most importantly, the political splits within France that demoralized her army and combined with the German's speedy advance to bring collapse about so quickly.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=WM8WAQAAIAAJ&dq=France+1940+:+Blitzkrieg+in+the+West+(Praeger+Illustrated+Military+History)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Savage Hearts Volume Two: The Clyde Caldwell Sketchbook","description":"Admiring a Caldwell painting is like peering through a portal to an alternate dimension; you can actually see the fantastic come to life in vivid detail.

However, John was the one who finally decided to move from Toronto to church headquarters in Ohio, and it was John's commitment that survived their temple worship experience there, when it was disrupted by several pistol- and bowie-knife-wielding apostles. As half the church fell away in Ohio, the Taylors escaped to Missouri with the faithful, just in time for the 1838 Mormon War. John's role became that of an advocate with Congress to convince them that it was the non-Mormons who had sacked the county seat and burned their own homes, for instance. As a literary experience, this was good preparation for later editorships of church newspapers in Illinois, New York, and Liverpool. From his personal letters and speeches, and from the diaries and reminiscences of associates, vivid images of Taylor's life appear: his children crossing the Missouri River on the backs of oxen  bulls ; one of his ten plural wives packing a piano instead of a cookstove for the trip and then later regretting it; and Native Americans teaching him how to burn a cricket-infested field, gather the roasted insects, and grind the carcasses into flour. Taylor's eventual tenure as church president was spent  on the dodge  from federal marshals, and prior to that he often lived out of a suitcase, rotating from one of his sixteen families to the next. Among his greatest achievements was the settlement of as much territory as was colonized by his more famous predecessor, Brigham Young. Taylor was also a visionary man. His personal spirituality led the church through one of its most turbulent times; his revelations later inspired the Mormon fundamentalist schism, as well. This controversy, mingled with the drama of internecine power struggles and interpersonal conflict, makes The Last Pioneer suspenseful and largely unforgettable.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=BsZAPQAACAAJ&dq=The+Last+Pioneer:+John+Taylor,+a+Mormon+Prophet&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Wrangler (Hearts Of Wyoming) (Silhouette Special Edition)","description":"THE SHERIFF'S LADY She was the best wrangler he'd ever seen.

He chronicles the art of conversation in Western civilization from its beginnings in ancient Greece to its apex in eighteenth-century Britain to its current endangered state in America. As Harry G. Frankfurt brought wide attention to the art of bullshit in his recent bestselling On Bullshit, so Miller now brings the art of conversation into the light, revealing why good conversation matters and why it is in decline. Miller explores the conversation about conversation among such great writers as Cicero, Montaigne, Swift, Defoe, Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, and Virginia Woolf. He focuses on the world of British coffeehouses and clubs in  The Age of Conversation  and examines how this era ended. Turning his attention to the United States, the author traces a prolonged decline in the theory and practice of conversation from Benjamin Franklin through Hemingway to Dick Cheney. He cites our technology (iPods, cell phones, and video games) and our insistence on unguarded forthrightness as well as our fear of being judgmental as powerful forces that are likely to diminish the art of conversation.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=zz5ZAwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"God, the Substance of All Form","description":"2010 Reprint of 1962 edition.

Because God is individual consciousness, your consciousness is infinite, and as you become more aware of the infinite nature of your consciousness, that consciousness begins to appear in infinite forms of good. Then you understand the great truth that nothing can be added to you, and nothing can be taken from you: you are eternally complete and whole because embodied within you is the substance of all life.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=3adRewAACAAJ&dq=God,+the+Substance+of+All+Form&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hard Bounty (Pinnacle western)","description":"Bounty hunter Asa Cain tracks outlaws through the Wild West, but his job suddenly becomes personal after the Dolven gang destroys his family ranch in West Texas and kidnaps his mother and sister.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=C-mUSZgC98YC&dq=Hard+Bounty+(Pinnacle+western)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Legacy of the Blue Heron: Living with Learning Disabilities","description":"Chronicles the author's devastating educational experiences, his diagnosis of a learning disability and the incredible work he has done from that pivotal moment.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=KCElAQAAIAAJ&dq=Legacy+of+the+Blue+Heron:+Living+with+Learning+Disabilities&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Game of Dark","description":"In his masterly survey, Written for Children, John Rowe Townsend describes A Game of Dark as  ambitious and harrowing .

Here, collected in this volume, are Wordsworth s finest works, some of the most beautiful poems ever written: from the famous lyrical ballads, including  The Tables Turned  and  Lines Composed a Few Miles Above Tintern Abbey,  to the sonnets and narrative poems, to excerpts from his magnum opus, The Preludes. By turning away from mythological subjects and artificial diction toward the life and language around him, Wordsworth acquired for poetry the strength and new sources of inspiration that have allowed it to survive and flourish in the modern world.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=SOv1AgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"You're a Good Man, Charlie Brown (Vocal Selections)","description":"(Vocal Selections). 10 songs from the endearing Broadway production, including: The Baseball Game * The Doctor Is In * Happiness * The Kite (Charlie Brown's Kite) * Little Known Facts * My Blanket and Me * Schroeder * Snoopy * Suppertime * You're a Good Man, Charlie Brown.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Q48AAAAACAAJ&dq=You%27re+a+Good+Man,+Charlie+Brown+(Vocal+Selections)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Athenian democracy,","description":"The Athenian democracy of the fifth and fourth centuries B.C. is the most famous and perhaps most nearly perfect example of direct democracy. Covering the period 403-322 B.C., Mogens Herman Hansen focuses on the crucial last thirty years, which coincided with the political career of Demosthenes. Hansen distinguishes between the city's seven political institutions: the Assembly, the nomothetai, the People's Court, the boards of magistrates, the Council of Five Hundred, the Areopagos, and ho boulomenos. He discusses how Athenians conceived liberty both as the ability to participate in the decision-making process and as the right to live without oppression from the state or other citizens. Equality was conceived of as an equality not of nature but of opportunity.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=o2mgjqbFGp4C&dq=Athenian+democracy,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Pale Horse Coming","description":"Pale Horse Coming, featuring Stephen Hunter s beloved sniper heroes Earl and Bob Lee Swagger, the first Swagger thriller from the Pulitzer Prizewinning author.

The novelist has spared no language has minced no words to describe the violent scenes of a violent time. \\"In some instances facts appear distorted out of their true perspective, and in others the author makes unwarranted charges. It is not within our province to edit the historical side of Dumas, any more than it would be to correct the obvious errors in Dickens's Child's History of England. The careful, mature reader, for whom the books are intended, will recognize, and allow for, this fact. The contents of these volumes of 'Celebrated Crimes', as well as the motives which led to their inception, are unique. They are a series of stories based upon historical records, from the pen of Alexandre Dumas, pere, when he was not \\"the elder,\\" nor yet the author of D'Artagnan or Monte Cristo, but was a rising young dramatist and a lion in the literary set and world of fashion. Dumas, in fact, wrote his 'Crimes Celebres' just prior to launching upon his wonderful series of historical novels, and they may therefore be considered as source books, whence he was to draw so much of that far-reaching and intimate knowledge of inner history which has perennially astonished his readers. The Crimes were published in Paris, in 1839-40, in eight volumes, comprising eighteen titles all of which now appear in the present carefully translated text. The success of the original work was instantaneous. Dumas laughingly said that he thought he had exhausted the subject of famous crimes, until the work was off the press, when he immediately became deluged with letters from every province in France, supplying him with material upon other deeds of violence! The subjects which he has chosen, however, are of both historic and dramatic importance, and they have the added value of giving the modern reader a clear picture of the state of semi-lawlessness which existed in Europe, during the middle ages. \\"The Borgias, the Cenci, Urbain Grandier, the Marchioness of Brinvilliers, the Marchioness of Ganges, and the rest what subjects for the pen of Dumas!\\" exclaims Garnett. Space does not permit us to consider in detail the material here collected, although each title will be found to present points of special interest. The first volume comprises the annals of the Borgias and the Cenci. The name of the noted and notorious Florentine family has become a synonym for intrigue and violence, and yet the Borgias have not been without stanch defenders in history....","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=RYnUCgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Jericho Moon","description":"The heroine of the Battle of Tyre, mercenary Barra the Pict, signs on for a rescue mission in the deserts of Canaan lured by the promise of rich rewards for the rescue of the Prince of Jebusai","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=9dTK1qGkaaQC&dq=Jericho+Moon&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Heading Uptown","description":"Nina Fischman, a Jewish lawyer living on Manhattan's Upper West Side, must look into the suspicious death of the principal heir to a large fortune","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=eW8y6mpXwlEC&dq=Heading+Uptown&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Victorian underworld","description":"Beneath the respectable surface of Victorian England lay a criminal world as diverse, turbulent and vicious as any.

Thirty-five-year-old Rikki was named one of America's top five female trial attorneys by Time magazine for her work in criminal defence, one of the toughest branches of law for a woman to enter. She defended clients ranging from accused drug smugglers to media moguls to well-meaning Christian Scientists Ginger and David Twitchell, whose beliefs were put on trial after the death of their child. She waged a war of nerves with Boston police and the FBI during negotiations for the return of fugitive sixties radical Katherine Ann Power. As Rikki moved from success to success, however, the frenetic lifestyle of a defence attorney began to damage her health and happiness. She suffered from exhaustion, chronic back pain, and two failed marriages, but considered these afflictions to be part of \\"the price of the prize.\\" After several decades as a practicing attorney, she joined Court TV, where she gained national prominence covering the O.J.

Trained in the Confucian classics, he was a schoolteacher early in life, but after decades of study under the foremost masters, he gave up his livelihood to devote the rest of his life to the propagation of the Way of Karate. Under his guidance, techniques and nomenclature were refined and modernized, the spiritual essence was brought to the fore, and karate evolved into a true martial art. Various forms of empty-hand techniques have been practiced in Okinawa for centuries, but due to the lack of historical records, fancy often masquerades as fact. In telling of his own famous teachers--and not only of their mastery of technique but of the way they acted in critical situations--the author reveals what true karate is. The stories he tells about himself are no less instructive: his determination to continue the art, after having started it to improve his health; his perseverance in the face of difficulties, even of poverty; his strict observance of the way of life of the samurai; and the spirit of self-reliance that he carried into an old age kept healthy by his practice of Karate-do.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=I55NEAAAQBAJ&dq=Karate-Do:+My+Way+of+Life&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Son of Italy","description":"In his narrative of his fruitless labor as a pick and shovel worker in America, D'Angelo, who immigrated from the Abruzzi region of Italy, describes the harsh, often inhumane working conditions that immigrants had to endure at the beginning of the twentieth century.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=CHaW-PRlZdAC&dq=Son+of+Italy&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"License to Drive","description":"Get the extra practice you need to succeed in your driver education course with this hands-on Student Workbook.

The nineteenth century in Europe was a time of unprecedented artistic achievement. It was also the first age of cultural globalization an epoch when mass communications and high-speed rail travel brought Europe together, overcoming the barriers of nationalism and facilitating the development of a truly European canon of artistic, musical, and literary works. By 1900, the same books were being read across the continent, the same paintings reproduced, the same music played in homes and heard in concert halls, the same operas performed in all the major theatres. Drawing from a wealth of documents, letters, and other archival materials, acclaimed historian Orlando Figes examines the interplay of money and art that made this unification possible. At the center of the book is a poignant love triangle: the Russian writer Ivan Turgenev; the Spanish prima donna Pauline Viardot, with whom Turgenev had a long and intimate relationship; and her husband Louis Viardot, an art critic, theater manager, and republican activist. Together, Turgenev and the Viardots acted as a kind of European cultural exchange they either knew or crossed paths with Delacroix, Berlioz, Chopin, Brahms, Liszt, the Schumanns, Hugo, Flaubert, Dickens, and Dostoyevsky, among many other towering figures. As Figes observes, nearly all of civilization s great advances have come during periods of heightened cosmopolitanism when people, ideas, and artistic creations circulate freely between nations. Vivid and insightful, The Europeans shows how such cosmopolitan ferment shaped artistic traditions that came to dominate world culture.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=J7KDDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Wake Up, I'm Fat!","description":"In a humorous autobiography, the Emmy Award-winning actress shares her observations on the trials and tribulations of being overweight, and chronicles her journey from childhood to Hollywood success.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=JikERK21MOMC&dq=Wake+Up,+I%27m+Fat!&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mama's Bank Account","description":"How a Norwegian mama gradually Americanizes her family with the aid of her wit and understanding","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=NVwiJzYgYmUC&dq=Mama%27s+Bank+Account&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Summer in December / The Bay of the Nightingales / Return to Dragonshill (Harlequin Omni, No. 31 )","description":"Now in paperback. Was a monstrous killer brought to justice or an innocent mother condemned? On an April night in 1989, Jo Ann Parks survived a house fire that claimed the lives of her three small children. Though the fire at first seemed a tragic accident, investigators soon reported finding evidence proving that Parks had sabotaged wiring, set several fires herself, and even barricade her four-year-old son inside a closet to prevent his escape. Though she insisted she did nothing wrong, Jo Ann Parks received a life sentence without parole based on the power of forensic fire science that convincingly proved her guilt. But more than a quarter century later, a revolution in the science of fire has exposed many of the incontrovertible truths of 1989 as guesswork in disguise. The California Innocence Project is challenging Parks's conviction and the so-called science behind it, claiming that false assumptions and outright bias convicted an innocent mother of a crime that never actually happened. If Parks is exonerated, she could well be the \\"Patient Zero\\" in an epidemic of overturned guilty verdicts but only if she wins. Can prosecutors dredge up enough evidence and roadblocks to make sure Jo Ann Parks dies in prison? No matter how her last-ditch effort for freedom turns out, the scenes of betrayal, ruin, and hope will leave readers longing for justice we can trust.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=D-KCDwAAQBAJ&dq=Summer+in+December+/+The+Bay+of+the+Nightingales+/+Return+to+Dragonshill+(Harlequin+Omni,+No.+31+)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"St. Paul, the traveller and the Roman citizen","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=_cZ4kQhiRjQC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Created Writing: Poetry from New Angles","description":"While still considering the traditional elements of the poem, Paul Agastino has written a text using poetry by students and small press poets to allow for a fresh treatment of the subject.

Buchmann, one of the world's leading authorities on bees and pollination, and Gary Paul Nabhan, award-winning writer and renowned crop ecologist, explore the vital but little-appreciated relationship between plants and the animals they depend on for reproduction -- bees, beetles, butterflies, hummingbirds, moths, bats, and countless other animals, some widely recognized and other almost unknown.Scenes from around the globe -- examining island flora and fauna on the Galapagos, counting bees in the Panamanian rain forest, witnessing an ancient honey-hunting ritual in Malaysia -- bring to life the hidden relationships between plants and animals, and demonstrate the ways in which human society affects and is affected by those relationships. Buchmann and Nabhan combine vignettes from the field with expository discussions of ecology, botany, and crop science to present a lively and fascinating account of the ecological and cultural context of plant-pollinator relationships.More than any other natural process, plant-pollinator relationships offer vivid examples of the connections between endangered species and threatened habitats. The authors explain how human-induced changes in pollinator populations -- caused by overuse of chemical pesticides, unbridled development, and conversion of natural areas into monocultural cropland-can have a ripple effect on disparate species, ultimately leading to a \\"cascade of linked extinctions.\\"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=YWTZs5fSqb8C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Wilderness Road","description":"First volume of series to commemorate our national trails.

Impey packs his prose with wonderful anecdotes and weird factoids.  New York Times Book Review Human exploration has been an unceasing engine of technological progress, from the first homo sapiens to leave our African cradle to a future in which mankind promises to settle another world. Beyond tells the epic story of humanity leaving home and how humans will soon thrive in the vast universe beyond the earth. A dazzling and propulsive voyage through space and time, Beyond reveals how centuries of space explorers from the earliest stargazers to today s cutting-edge researchers all draw inspiration from an innate human emotion: wanderlust. This urge to explore led us to multiply around the globe, and it can be traced in our DNA. Today, the urge to discover manifests itself in jaw-dropping ways: plans for space elevators poised to replace rockets at a fraction of the cost; experiments in suspending and reanimating life for ultra-long-distance travel; prototypes for solar sails that coast through space on the momentum of microwaves released from the Earth. With these ventures, private companies and entrepreneurs have the potential to outpace NASA as the leaders in a new space race. Combining expert knowledge of astronomy and avant-garde technology, Chris Impey guides us through the heady possibilities for the next century of exploration. In twenty years, a vibrant commercial space industry will be operating. In thirty years, there will be small but viable colonies on the Moon and Mars. In fifty years, mining technology will have advanced enough to harvest resources from asteroids. In a hundred years, a cohort of humans born off-Earth will come of age without ever visiting humanity s home planet. This is not the stuff of science fiction but rather the logical extension of already available technologies. Beyond shows that space exploration is not just the domain of technocrats, but the birthright of everyone and the destiny of generations to come. To continue exploration is to ensure our survival. Outer space, a limitless unknown, awaits us.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=DAedBAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Knight's Castle: A Pop-Up Book","description":"A small white mouse wanders into a castle where he sees a bat, a coat of arms, a dragon's head, and a shining knight","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=n17ftwEACAAJ&dq=The+Knight%27s+Castle:+A+Pop-Up+Book&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Young Wives-Overseas","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=pxzfwAEACAAJ&dq=Young+Wives-Overseas&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Tv Weddings","description":"Covers more than forty television weddings providing plots, dates of broadcast, and profiles of characters","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=EIjUDTkzNg0C&dq=Tv+Weddings&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The sonnets, Triumphs, and other poems of Petrarch; (Bohn's illustrated library)","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=1Cfhzkgp1UoC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Rand Mcnally 2006 Dallas And Fort Worth, Taxas: Street Guide (Rand McNally Streetfinder)","description":"Denver's #1 street atlas with over 2,500 updates from last years edition make this atlas the product of choice for anyone who needs to get around the area.

This book examines the first great law and economics movement in the early part of the twentieth century through the work of one of its most original thinkers, Robert Hale. Beginning in the 1890s and continuing through the 1930s, progressive academics in law and economics mounted parallel assaults on free-market economic principles. They showed first that \\"private,\\" unregulated economic relations were in fact determined by a state-imposed regime of property and contract rights. Second, they showed that the particular regime of rights that existed at that time was hard to square with any common-sense notions of social justice. Today, Hale is best known among contemporary legal academics and philosophers for his groundbreaking writings on coercion and consent in market relations. The bulk of his writing, however, consisted of a critique of natural property rights. Taken together, these writings on coercion and property rights offer one of the most profound and elaborated critiques of libertarianism, far outshining the better-known efforts of Richard Ely and John R. Commons. In his writings on public utility regulation, Hale also made important contributions to a theory of just, market-based distribution. This first, full-length study of Hale's work should be of interest to legal, economic, and intellectual historians.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=6U0jifXSJmsC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Video Basics 3 Workbook","description":"By Herbert Zettl, this student workbook, in a 3-hole punched/tear-out worksheet format, provides a review of each chapter of the main text.

In fact, the whole island is now under quarantine, and she is stranded until the borders reopen. Completely isolated, she must venture beyond her comfort zone.

So many of us are feeling fed up, burned out, and unhappy at work: the constant pressure and stress, the unending changes, the politics--people feel as though they can't give much more, and performance is suffering. But it's work, after all, right? Should we even expect to be fulfilled and happy at work? Yes, we should, says Annie McKee, coauthor of the bestselling Primal Leadership. In her new transformative book, she makes the most compelling case yet that happiness--and the full engagement that comes with it--is more important than ever in today's workplace, and she sheds new light on the powerful relationship of happiness to individual, team, and organizational success. Based on extensive research and decades of experience with leaders, this book reveals that people must have three essential elements in order to be happy at work: A sense of purpose and the chance to contribute to something bigger than themselves A vision that is powerful and personal, creating a real sense of hope Resonant, friendly relationships With vivid and moving real-life stories, the book shows how leaders can use these powerful pillars to create and sustain happiness even when they're under pressure. By emphasizing purpose, hope, and friendships they can also ensure a healthy, positive climate for their teams and throughout the organization. How to Be Happy at Work deepens our understanding of what it means to be truly fulfilled and effective at work and provides clear, practical advice and instruction for how to get there--no matter what job you have.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=6n1TDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Billboards: The Secrets of Free Money for Doing Nothing and the Coming Landowner Revolution","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=vZoCAAAACAAJ&dq=Billboards:+The+Secrets+of+Free+Money+for+Doing+Nothing+and+the+Coming+Landowner+Revolution&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"American Cabinetmakers: Marked American Furniture: 1640-1940","description":"The first book to catalog and illustrate American furniture that bears the signature, label, brand, impression, or ink stamp of its maker.

They terrorized their foes with a series of dramatic murders of Islamic leaders, as well as of some of the Crusaders, who brought their name and fame back to Europe.Professor Lewis traces the history of this radical group, studying its teachings and its influence on Muslim thought.

It focuses specifically on how environmental conditions and administrative and political aspects of cities affect the decisions to implement specific retrenchment strategies during periods of revenue decline or stagnation. The book takes the reader beyond the rationalistic and incremental approach of urban decision-making and demonstrates that decisions requiring fiscal retrenchment can be confusing and ill-planned. It also reveals how any action taken by the city will reflect the chief executive officer's perception of what the situation demands. The first part of the book, The Evolution of Financial Decline, discusses the structural antecedents that have contributed to the decline of financial sources. Here, the major literature that investigates the causes and consequences of urban fiscal strain is reviewed. In Part Two, Reacting Toward Fiscal Stress, the chapters deal specifically with different management techniques available to municipalities to cope with resource decline. The strategic advantages and political ramifications of these approaches are discussed in detail. These chapters also provide an inventory of response techniques for urban managers. Part Three, Retrenchment and the Urban Policy Process, builds upon the garbage can model developed by March and Simon by proposing that the retrenchment process is haphazard and random. The book concludes with some considerations of what happens to the urban policy process during periods of resource scarcity. This book should appeal to anyone interested in public administration, urban studies or political science.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=CH2RAAAAIAAJ&dq=Managing+Fiscal+Strain+in+Major+American+Cities:+Understanding+Retrenchment+in+the+Public+Sector+(Contributions+in+Political+Science)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Gold Bug","description":"Set on Sullivan's Island, South Carolina, the plot follows William Legrand, who was recently bitten by a gold-colored bug.

On a bright Sunday morning in June 1934, Laurie Lee left the village home so lovingly portrayed in his bestselling memoir, Cider with Rosie. His plan was to walk the hundred miles from Slad to London, with a detour of an extra hundred miles to see the sea for the first time. He was nineteen years old and brought with him only what he could carry on his back: a tent, a change of clothes, his violin, a tin of biscuits, and some cheese. He spent the first night in a ditch, wide awake and soaking wet. From those unlikely beginnings, Laurie Lee fashioned not just the adventure of a lifetime, but one of the finest travel narratives of the twentieth century. As I Walked Out One Midsummer Morning, written more than thirty years after the events it describes, is an elegant and irresistibly charming portrait of life on the road first in England, where the familiar landscapes and people somehow made Lee feel far from home, and then in Spain, whose utter foreignness afforded a new kind of comfort. In that brief period of peace, a young man was free to go wherever he wanted to in Europe. Lee picked Spain because he knew enough Spanish to ask for a glass of water. What he did not know, and what would become clear only after a year spent tramping across the beautiful and rugged countryside from the Galician port city of Vigo, over the Sierra de Guadarrama and into Madrid, and along the Costa del Sol was that the Spanish Republic would soon need idealistic young men like Lee as badly as he needed it.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=tnqdAwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"You May Kiss the Bride","description":"You May Now Kiss the Bride tells how to transition successfully from courtship ecstasy to married bliss.

He explains why a couple, after a few months of married life, may be puzzled and ask themselves, \\"Is this the same person I knew in courtship?\\" He then offers solutions that are guaranteed to work because their source is the Bible. Already married? You May Now Kiss the Bride also makes clear what to do to recapture the joy of married life and turn an unhappy marriage around. A damaged marriage heading for divorce can be repaired! The author explains how. Jesus said divorce is unnecessary, and You May Now Kiss the Bride explains why Jesus spoke \\"the exception clause\\" and what He meant by it. The book also presents simple diagrams illustrating authority and submission, why males and females handle problem-solving differently, and how the definition of love differs when female, male, or God uses the word. You May Now Kiss the Bride is ideal for both pre-marital and post-wedding counseling. Any person desiring stronger personal relationships with others can also profit from this book.

You promised, dear Lumen, to describe to me that supremest of moments which immediately succeeds death, and to relate to me how, by a natural law, singular though it may seem, you lived again your past life, and penetrated a hitherto-unrevealed mystery. Lumen. Yes, my old friend, I will now keep my word; and I trust that, thanks to the life-long communion of our souls, you will be able to understand the phenomenon you deem so strange. There are many conceptions which a mortal mind finds difficult to grasp. Death, which has delivered me from the weak and easily-tired senses of the body, has not yet touched you with its liberating hand; you still belong to the living world, and in spite of your isolation in this retreat of yours amid the royal towers of the Faubourg St. Jaques, you still belong to the life of Earth, and are occupied with its petty distinctions. You must not, therefore, be surprised if, whilst I am explaining to you this mystery, I beg of you to isolate yourself still further from outer things, and to give me the mostfixed attention of which your mind is capable. Qu?rens. My one desire is to listen to your revelations; speak, therefore, without fear and to the point, and deign to acquaint me with those impressions, as yet to me unknown, which are experienced upon the cessation of life. Lumen. From what point do you wish me to begin my recital? Qu?rens. If you can recall it, I shall be pleased if you will begin at the moment when my trembling hands closed your eyes. Lumen. The separation of the thinking principle from the nervous system leaves no remembrance. It is as though the impressions made upon the brain which constitute memory were entirely effaced, to be renewed afterwards in another form. The first sensation of identity felt after death resembles that which is felt during life on awakening in the morning, when still confused with the visions of the night, the mind, wavering between the past and the future, endeavours to recover itself, and at the same time to retain the vanishing dreams, the pictures and events of which are still passing before it. At times when thus absorbed in the recollection of a delightful dream, the eyelids close, and in a half slumber the visions reappear. It is thus that our thinking faculty is divided at death, between a reality that it does not yet comprehend and a dream which has completely disappeared. The most conflicting impressions mingle in and confuse the mind, and if, overwhelmed by perishable feelings, a regret comes into the mind for the world that has been left behind, a sense of indefinable sadness weighs upon and darkens the imagination and hinders clearness of vision.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=O-A6DQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Writings of Henry David Thoreau Journal Edited by Bradford Torrey XII March 2, 1859-November 30, 1859 (Thoreau's Writings, 16)","description":"This book examines key cases of terrorist violence to show that the invention of terrorism was linked to the birth of modernity in Europe, Russia and the United States, rather than to Tsarist despotism in 19th century Russia or to Islam sects in Medieval Persia. Combining a highly readable historical narrative with analysis of larger issues in social and political history, the author argues that the dissemination of news about terrorist violence was at the core of a strategy that aimed for political impact on rulers as well as the general public. Dietze s lucid account also reveals how the spread of knowledge about terrorist acts was, from the outset, a transatlantic process. Two incidents form the book s centerpiece. The first is the failed attempt to assassinate French Emperor Napol on III by Felice Orsini in 1858, in an act intended to achieve Italian unity and democracy. The second case study offers a new reading of John Brown's raid on the arsenal at Harpers Ferry in 1859, as a decisive moment in the abolitionist struggle and occurrences leading to the American Civil War. Three further examples from Germany, Russia, and the US are scrutinized to trace the development of the tactic by first imitators. With their acts of violence, the  invention  of terrorism was completed. Terrorism has existed as a tactic since then and has essentially only been adapted through the use of new technologies and methods.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Ymc1EAAAQBAJ&dq=The+Writings+of+Henry+David+Thoreau+Journal+Edited+by+Bradford+Torrey+XII+March+2,+1859-November+30,+1859+(Thoreau%27s+Writings,+16)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Horus Rising","description":"Black Library presents the Masterworks  a curated collection of novels celebrating the very best science fiction and fantasy set in the worlds of Warhammer.

According to Robert D. Tollison in the foreword, \\"The central purpose of the book was to examine the simple precepts of Keynesian economics through the lens of public-choice theory. The basic discovery was that Keynesian economics had a bias toward deficits in terms of political self-interest.  Democracy in Deficit opened the door for much of the current work on political business cycles and the incorporation of public-choice considerations into macroeconomic theory. Even in the area of monetarism, Buchanan s landmark work has greatly influenced the sway of contemporary theorists away from the nearly universally held belief of Keynesian theory. Democracy in Deficit contributes greatly to Buchanan s lifelong fiscal and monetary rules to guide long-term policy in macroeconomics. The book serves to bolster Buchanan s central beliefs in the necessity of a balanced-budget amendment to the U.S. Constitution and in monetary rules rather than central bank discretion. The book is co-authored with Richard Wagner, a respected colleague of Buchanan, whom Buchanan recognized as helping to keep the book free of polemics and on target with its central purpose of applying the elementary theory of public choice. James M. Buchanan is an eminent economist who won the Alfred Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 1986 and is considered one of the greatest scholars of liberty in the twentieth century.

In The Philosophy of Mass Art, Noel Carroll, a leading figures in the field of aesthetic philosophy, attempts to address that lacuna. He shows why philosophers have previously resisted and/or misunderstood mass art and he developsframeworks for understanding the relation of mass art to the emotions, morality, and ideology discussing the accounts of such theorists in the field as Collingwood, Adorno, Benajmin, McCluhan, and Fiske. Mixing conceptual analysis and many vivid examples, the author proposes the first significant attempt at a philosophy of mass art in the analytical tradition concluding there are strong grounds for approaching mass art in the same fashion as high art.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=028-tAEACAAJ&dq=A+Philosophy+of+Mass+Art&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"What Is a California Sea Otter?","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=-ygXAQAAIAAJ&dq=What+Is+a+California+Sea+Otter%3F&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Studies on hysteria","description":"Hysteria the tormenting of the body by the troubled mind is among the most pervasive of human disorders; yet, at the same time, it is the most elusive.

Many pages of this volume illustrate Dr. Dewey's ideas for a philosophy of experience and its relation to education. He particularly urges that all teachers and educators looking for a new movement in education should think in terms of the deeped and larger issues of education rather than in terms of some divisive \\"ism\\" about education, even such an \\"ism\\" as \\"progressivism.\\" His philosophy, here expressed in its most essential, most readable form, predicates an American educational system that respects all sources of experience, on that offers a true learning situation that is both historical and social, both orderly and dynamic.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=JhjPK4FKpCcC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Walt Disney in Counted Cross Stitch","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=sHNsDwAAQBAJ&dq=Walt+Disney+in+Counted+Cross+Stitch&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Walz genealogical record","description":"Wilhelm Walz was born in 1835 in Weiler, Germany, and married Fredericka Gerstenlauer.

This essential guidebook won't get you where you want to go faster, but it does provide great suggestions for eating well, taking care of business, and having fun while you wait. In clear, cleverly written profiles of each airport, Harriet Baskas, Expedia.com's airport expert, spells out: the best places to eat and what local specialties to try; diversions for kids (playgrounds, observation decks, and museums); quick trips to make by cab (including times to the nearest city); locations of business centers and data ports; shops with interesting, reasonably priced items; well-stocked bookstores; art and history exhibits; clean places to shower and quiet corners for taking a nap. In some airports, she reveals, you can even get a dentist to look at that troublesome tooth, a shoemaker to fix a wobbly heel, and a masseuse to case travel-induced kinks -- and crankiness.

At times, as in the early days of the Korean and Vietnam Wars and in the Falklands conflict, carriers alone could deploy high-performance aircraft to the battlefield. In other operations, such as enforcing the no-fly zones and the U.S. invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq, only carriers could provide the bases needed for sustained combat and support operations. This second volume of Norman Polmar's landmark study details the role of carriers in the unification of the U.S. armed forces and strategic deterrence, fiscally constrained Great Britain, the development of British Commonwealth and ex-colonial navies, and the efforts of France and the Netherlands to rebuild their fleets. The role of the modern carrier-nine nations currently possess them-is discussed, as are the issues confronting nations that might acquire them. Chapters on the Soviet Union's effort to produce carriers are included for the first time. The development of both carrier planes and the many \\"oddball\\" aircraft that have flown from carriers-such as the U-2 spy plane-are also examined. Appendixes include comprehensive data on all carriers built and converted through 2006. This volume is a valuable companion to the critically acclaimed Volume I, which covers aircraft carrier development and operations from 1909 to 1945.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=6z7quhWS-BoC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"SHOOT THE PIANO PLAYER.

Price, president, Franklin Mutual Advisors, Inc. Benjamin Graham has been called the most important investment thinker of the twentieth century. As a master investor, pioneering stock analyst, and mentor to investment superstars, he has no peer. The volume you hold in your hands is Graham's timeless guide to interpreting and understanding financial statements. It has long been out of print, but now joins Graham's other masterpieces, The Intelligent Investor and Security Analysis, as the three priceless keys to understanding Graham and value investing. The advice he offers in this book is as useful and prescient today as it was sixty years ago. As he writes in the preface, \\"if you have precise information as to a company's present financial position and its past earnings record, you are better equipped to gauge its future possibilities. And this is the essential function and value of security analysis.\\" Written just three years after his landmark Security Analysis, The Interpretation of Financial Statements gets to the heart of the master's ideas on value investing in astonishingly few pages. Readers will learn to analyze a company's balance sheets and income statements and arrive at a true understanding of its financial position and earnings record. Graham provides simple tests any reader can apply to determine the financial health and well-being of any company. This volume is an exact text replica of the first edition of The Interpretation of Financial Statements, published by Harper & Brothers in 1937. Graham's original language has been restored, and readers can be assured that every idea and technique presented here appears exactly as Graham intended.

In this sixth entry in ISI Books  Library of Modern Thinkers  series, Mark T. Mitchell reveals how Polanyi came to recognize that the roots of the modern political and spiritual crisis lay in an errant conception of knowledge that served to foreclose any possibility of making meaningful statements about truth, goodness, or beauty. Polanyi s theory of knowledge as ineluctably personal but also grounded in reality is not merely of historical interest, writes Mitchell, for it proposes an attractive alternative for anyone who would reject both the hubris of modern rationalism and the ultimately nihilistic implications of academic postmodernism.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=OihlswEACAAJ&dq=Biography+-+Marks,+Leo+(1919-2001):+An+article+from:+Contemporary+Authors+Online&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Timeless Halloween Collectibles, 1920 To 1949: A Halloween Reference Book From The Beistle Company Archive With Price Guide (Schiffer Book for Collectors)","description":"The definitive reference guide for vintage Halloween collectors and designers looking for the best in Halloween graphics. 100s of pieces from the Golden Years of Halloween production, 1920 through 1949, with stock numbers, initial release year, and objects proper name, in over 350 photographs include some never-before-seen items.

His political tenure included three terms as Speaker of the Illinois House, four terms as minority leader, and two terms as secretary of state. The sponsor of hundreds of bills, he worked tirelessly for his constituents in southern Illinois. He also worked tirelessly to promote his own interests. In this first political biography of Powell, Robert E. Hartley follows the money. He tells how this man of humble origins and meager means amassed a world-class political and financial base. Part of that story is the disclosure of a personal fortune that boggled minds, including the unbelievable yarn of the $800,000 cash found in the hotel room following Powell's death. Powell never earned a state salary of more than $30,000 per year, yet in the last year of his life, his federal income tax return showed an income of more than $200,000. At his death his estate totaled $3.2 million, and, when settled in 1978, was worth $4.6 million, including nearly $1 million in racetrack stock. Following Powell's story, Hartley takes us deep into the Illinois political world of the 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s, a time when politicians were on an \\"honor system\\" regarding their financial holdings. This was before disclosure of political contributions, before computer records, and before public meetings laws.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=kvhGCy2CO1cC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The aims of education & other essays","description":"The general topic of this volume is education on its intellectual side.

Here a city slicker got a country girl pregnant and then took a bullet in the back. Wolfe s job was to get an innocent man exonerated of the crime and catch a killer in the process. But when he packed his silk pajamas and headed west, he found himself embroiled in a case rife with local cynicism, slipshod police work, and unpleasant political ramifications. In fact, Nero Wolfe was buffaloed until the real killer struck again, underestimating the dandified dude with an unerring instinct for detection. Introduction by Don Coldsmith  It is always a treat to read a Nero Wolfe mystery. The man has entered our folklore.  The New York Times Book Review A grand master of the form, Rex Stout is one of America s greatest mystery writers, and his literary creation Nero Wolfe is one of the greatest fictional detectives of all time. Together, Stout and Wolfe have entertained and puzzled millions of mystery fans around the world. Now, with his perambulatory man-about-town, Archie Goodwin, the arrogant, gourmandizing, sedentary sleuth is back in the original seventy-three cases of crime and detection written by the inimitable master himself, Rex Stout.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Lg4PRTx6D-sC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sons on Fathers: A Book of Men's Writing","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=kzXmAAAAMAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"What Is Cool?: Understanding Black Manhood in America","description":"Marlene Kim Connor's anatomy of cool reveals it as a vital code of behaviors and attitudes that plays an often disregarded role in shaping the conception of manhood among young black boys: \\"Cool, at its most basic, is a way of living and surviving in an inhospitable environment, a rational reaction to an irrational situation, a way of fitting in while standing out, of gaining respect while instilling fear.\\" In this thoughtful, impassioned, and provocative book, Connor uncovers cool's history, explores its essence, and explains why, even though it deserves praise, cool often becomes an insidious force affecting black American life today.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=1tBKAAAAYAAJ&dq=What+Is+Cool%3F:+Understanding+Black+Manhood+in+America&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Let My People Eat!: Passover Seders Made Simple","description":"There are more than the ceremonial four questions when it comes to the Passover Seder: What kinds of traditional dishes should I make?

That Simpson survived his experience on Peru's Siula Grande is a revelation of the power of the human spirit to overcome fear, pain and deprivation of almost unimaginable intensity. He did not expect to live it all over again - more than once. The first test was to write his award-winning account of the ordeal in Touching the Void. That meant dragging the terrifying experience out of the deeper shadows of his memory. Next, another fall in the Himalaya crippled and almost broke him. He felt forced to test his nerve again, and struggled on crutches to 20,000 feet on Pumori, near Everest. On his descent he heard that a young, first-time climber had been killed by a chance rockfall. What sense could he make now of this game of ghosts that had claimed the lives of so many of his friends over the years he had been climbing, while he had survived so many events that should have meant certain death? In an attempt to find catharsis for his confused emotions he wrote this e xtraordinary memoir, revealing his early ife and his fifteen years of climbing on three continents, before and after the life-changing experience of Siula Grande. His gripping story recounts, with total honesty, experiences that range from hilarious to poignant to nearly unbelievable. Here are the signposts that have directed him since childhood to measure fear and embrace the unknown. He wonders about the luck or the choices along the way that have caused the loss of so many climbing friends: Ghosts everywhere I look, all Isee are ghosts - or perhaps I am the ghost, a spectre of my past, standing in the rubble of my present, anxiously awaiting the future. This is a compelling work of adventure and introspection that will hold both moutaineers and armchair travelers spellbound.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=cBNd8j36Dj8C&dq=This+Game+of+Ghosts&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Culture, Identity, and Politics","description":"An exploration of the relationship between culture and politics in the modern world through essays on such varied topics as the Ayatollah Khomeni, Czech dissidents, and Malinowski.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=hHThx759I-kC&dq=Culture,+Identity,+and+Politics&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"On the Day I Was Born","description":"The earth celebrates the birth of a newborn baby.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=SU01vgAACAAJ&dq=On+the+Day+I+Was+Born&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"American Women","description":"Rich in detail, filled with fascinating characters, and panoramic in its sweep, this magnificent, comprehensive work tells for the first time the complete story of the American woman from the Pilgrims to the 21st-century In this sweeping cultural history, Gail Collins explores the transformations, victories, and tragedies of women in America over the past 300 years. As she traces the role of females from their arrival on the Mayflower through the 19th century to the feminist movement of the 1970s and today, she demonstrates a boomerang pattern of participation and retreat. In some periods, women were expected to work in the fields and behind the barricades to colonize the nation, pioneer the West, and run the defense industries of World War II. In the decades between, economic forces and cultural attitudes shunted them back into the home, confining them to the role of moral beacon and domestic goddess.

From a nearly lawless port, to a sedate, conventional company town defined by Boeing Aircraft, to an accessible paradise for artists and recovering urbanites, Seattle repeatedly tried and failed to become bigger, wealthier, more like \\"major league\\" cities. In the late 1980s, Seattle's time suddenly arrived. Microsoft, Amazon, Starbucks, McCaw Cellular/AT&T Wireless, and dozens of local dot.com startups began to drive a booming national economy. Seattle became a city of instant millionaires and brand name shopping, skyscrapers and sports franchises-- the place everyone wanted to visit, topping lists of America's \\"most desirable\\" cities. But with such wealth came consequences: overdevelopment, paralyzing traffic, racial and class divisions, and a street population of teenagers discarded by the new culture, whose rage and disaffection fueled the rise of bands such as Nirvana. Striving to reach its ambitions, Seattle seemed to be losing the struggle for its soul. And when it hosted the 1999 World Trade Organization convention, the city's conflicted personalities clashed, as violent riots by residents and a coalition of protestors left the downtown decimated and the nation transfixed by the spectacle of globalization gone wrong. In Seattle and the Demons of Ambition, Fred Moody uses his own background as a native son, along with wide-ranging encounters with others, to trace the growing pains of the city he loves. Profiling Bill Gates and never-quite-champion football coach Chuck Knox, a pair of ambitious entrepreneurs and a homeless sculptor once profiled in the New Yorker, grunge music superstars and the preyed-upon children of the documentary \\"Streetwise,\\" Moody offers a dramatic, entertaining, and insightful portrait of the city that defined economic and technological change in the America of the 1990s","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=2fPYIMubfgwC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Metropolitan Seminars in Art: Great Periods in Painting, Portfolio D: Venus Revisited: Classical Myths in the Renaissance (Metropolitan Seminars in Art, D)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=x-5NmgEACAAJ&dq=Metropolitan+Seminars+in+Art:+Great+Periods+in+Painting,+Portfolio+D:+Venus+Revisited:+Classical+Myths+in+the+Renaissance+(Metropolitan+Seminars+in+Art,+D)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sugarfree New Orleans, A cookbook based on the Glycemic Index","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=eUQBAAAACAAJ&dq=Sugarfree+New+Orleans,+A+cookbook+based+on+the+Glycemic+Index&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The concept and estimation of economic life in the residential appraisal process","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=bsu-AQAACAAJ&dq=The+concept+and+estimation+of+economic+life+in+the+residential+appraisal+process&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Last Train from Atlanta","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=oIGqAAAACAAJ&dq=Last+Train+from+Atlanta&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ethnography for Marketers: A Guide to Consumer Immersion","description":"'Ethnography for Market Research' provides a comprehensive step-by-step guide for planning and executing consumer studies that lead to innovations in products, services, and communications.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=O88vfGNiH_8C&dq=Ethnography+for+Marketers:+A+Guide+to+Consumer+Immersion&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Facts on File Dictionary of Cliches (Facts on File Library of Language and Literature)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=CDjltwEACAAJ&dq=The+Facts+on+File+Dictionary+of+Cliches+(Facts+on+File+Library+of+Language+and+Literature)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Candorville: Thank God for Culture Clash","description":"An insightful comic strip filled with edgy dialogue and thoroughly modern situations, Candorville: Thank God for Culture Clash by Darrin Bell is made for today's world.

'Magic' and 'consciousness' are concepts that are often fraught with prejudice and ambiguity respectively. Greenwood develops a new theory of magical consciousness by arguing that magic ultimately has more to do with the workings of the human mind in terms of an expanded awareness than with socio-cultural explanations.

For gallery assistant and art history addict Hanna Harvey, meeting Van Gogh is a dream come true until death follows the troubled artist to town and Hanna becomes the murderer s next target. When Alpha Wereboss Mark Abernathy goes missing, a new wave of murders draws the attention of drool-worthy Detective James Morrison, further complicating Hanna s epic dating dilemma. Only absinthe-swilling bodyguard Toulouse Lautrec stands between Hanna and the malevolent murderer whose grudge runs deep and appears to be connected to the mystery of her bloodline. Damning evidence convinces Morrison that saving Hanna s life requires ending Abernathy s, and she s forced to choose between protecting the man who holds the key to her past, or spilling her secrets to the detective who could promise her a future.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=e232DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"I Will Marry When I Want (African Writers)","description":"This is the renowned play that was developed with Kikuyu villagers at the Kamiriithu Cultural Centre at Limuru.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ZJb_7iOEhr0C&dq=I+Will+Marry+When+I+Want+(African+Writers)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Girls' Toys of the 70's & 80's: Toy Pages From the Legendary Sears Christmas Wishbooks 1970-1989","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=yRTEAAAACAAJ&dq=Girls%27+Toys+of+the+70%27s&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Never again","description":"NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER ? From two survivors of the Parkland, Florida, shooting comes a declaration for our times, and an in-depth look at the making of the #NeverAgain movement. On February 14, 2018, seventeen-year-old David Hogg and his fourteen-year-old sister, Lauren, went to school at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, like any normal Wednesday. That day, of course, the world changed. By the next morning, with seventeen classmates and faculty dead, they had joined the leadership of a movement to save their own lives, and the lives of all other young people in America. It's a leadership position they did not seek, and did not want--but events gave them no choice. The morning after the massacre, David Hogg told CNN: \\"We're children. You guys are the adults. You need to take some action and play a role. Work together. Get over your politics and get something done.\\" This book is a manifesto for the movement begun that day, one that has already changed America--with voices of a new generation that are speaking truth to power, and are determined to succeed where their elders have failed. With moral force and clarity, a new generation has made it clear that problems previously deemed unsolvable due to powerful lobbies and political cowardice will be theirs to solve. Born just after Columbine and raised amid seemingly endless war and routine active shooter drills, this generation now says, Enough. This book is their statement of purpose, and the story of their lives. It is the essential guide to the #NeverAgain movement.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=N7xVDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"God Thinks You're Positively Awesome: Discover Your True Beauty-- Inside and Out","description":"Encourages teenage girls to see themselves as unique creations of God, recognizing and rejecting superficial images of beauty, and offers practical advice on grooming, diet, and developing one's talents.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=f-tRtY9pY8wC&dq=God+Thinks+You%27re+Positively+Awesome:+Discover+Your+True+Beauty--+Inside+and+Out&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Room with a View","description":"\\"A Room with a View is a 1908 novel by English writer E.

They took on the old-school Europeans in their own backyard, pushing a huge wave of support and excitement before them as they shook foundations of one of the world's most traditional sports. Then, on the brink of greatness, the house of cards folded.Now, for the first time, the full inside story of the Linda McCartney Pro Cycling Team can be told. Peaks and troughs, mood swings and wheel spins, millionaires and bankrupts, they're all there. You can read the truth about the stars, water-carriers and fixers that make cycling such an enthralling game. TEAM ON THE RUN is the unique story of how the most famous vegetarian in the world came to sponsor the world's only vegetarian professional sporting team. Hear about how a small-time British outfit grew so quickly they elbowed their way into the Tour of Italy, putting a fair few Roman noses out of joint before returning home with a share of the spoils. Then delve into the mystery of how a team personally funded and endorsed by one of the world's richest men could dissolve into thin air virtually overnight, millions in the red. Taking an anecdotal ride from the team's birth in 1998 to its spectacular implosion in 2001, you will be able to picture Sir Paul McCartney knocking out a quick 'Lady Madonna' for the boys on his 'old joanna' and David Mackenzie making the whole of Italy choke on its proscuitto and cabbage, until the boys limp home battered, bruised and penniless when the well runs dry. Written by the team's press officer, John Deering, TEAM ON THE RUN provides a revealing glimpse into the machinations and eye-popping realities of the cycling merry-go-round.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=kk0MAAAACAAJ&dq=Team+on+the+Run:+The+Inside+Story+of+the+Linda+McCartney+Pro+Cycling+Team&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"And the Dish Ran Away with the Spoon","description":"Every night the rhyme gets read.

Unlike many of his Symbolist generation, Bakhtin was not fascinated by his own self-image. This reticence to tell his own story was the point of access for Viktor Duvakin, Mayakovsky scholar, fellow academic, and head of an oral history project, who in 1973 taped six interviews with Bakhtin over twelve hours. They remain our primary source of Bakhtin s personal views: on formative moments in his education and exile, his reaction to the Revolution, his impressions of political, intellectual, and theatrical figures during the first two decades of the twentieth century, and his non-conformist opinions on Russian and Soviet poets and musicians. Bakhtin's passion for poetic language and his insights into music also come as a surprise to readers of his essays on the novel. One remarkable thread running through the conversations is Bakhtin's love of poetry, masses of which he knew by heart in several languages. Mikhail Bakhtin: The Duvakin Interviews, 1973, translated and annotated here from the complete transcript of the tapes, offers a fuller, more flexible image of Bakhtin than we could have imagined beneath his now famous texts.

These are the five teenagers lost in the Hemmings family's maze of tangled secrets. Only a generation removed from being Pennsylvania potato farmers, Gottfried and Marla Hemmings managed to trade digging spuds for developing subdivisions and now sit atop a seven-figure bank account--wealth they've declined to pass on to their adult children or their teenage grandchildren. \\"Because we want them to thrive,\\" Marla always says. What does thriving look like? Like carrying a snow shovel everywhere. Like selling pot at the Arby's drive-thru window. Like a first-class ticket to Jamaica between cancer treatments. Like a flea-circus in a double-wide. Like the GPS coordinates to a mound of dirt in a New Jersey forest. As the rot just beneath the surface of the Hemmings' precious suburban respectability begins to spread, the far-flung grandchildren gradually find their ways back to one another, just in time to uncover the terrible cost of maintaining the family name.

But what if changing how you think about stress could make you happier, healthier, and better able to reach your goals? Combining exciting new research on resilience and mindset, Kelly McGonigal, PhD, proves that undergoing stress is not bad for you; it is undergoing stress while believing that stress is bad for you that makes it harmful. In fact, stress has many benefits, from giving us greater focus and energy, to strengthening our personal relationships. McGonigal shows readers how to cultivate a mindset that embraces stress, and activate the brain's natural ability to learn from challenging experiences.

All you have to do is decode your Solar Return Chart to take control of events - and in this book, Sara Shipman tells you how. Solar Returns are one of the best tools of predictive astrology - and all the best tools are simple to use. In this book, Sara Shipman introduces you to Solar Return chart interpretation using a 'keywords' approach to analysing the planets, houses and rising sign in your Solar Return chart. To keep things easy, Sara bases her chart analyses in this book on four main questions - what, when, where and how - and the answers to those questions are written in your stars. In this book, Sara explains what a Solar Return forecast is, how it works and why it s different from your natal chart. She explains how Solar Returns work in cycles and looks at the question of timing your forecast. When can you expect to notice you new Solar Return chart taking effect? Is it an immediate noticeable change or does it overlap with the previous year s chart? These, and many other questions will be answered by Sara's in depth analysis of the planets, retrograde planets and astrological houses in your solar return chart. Sara also looks carefully at the importance of the rising sign in your Solar Return chart.

For his second book, Wolfe traveled from La Jolla to London in search of new lifestyles. The Pump House Gang is the result: a collection of essays that chronicles life at the end of the 1960s, written with all the panache and perceptiveness that made Wolfe one of our greatest American journalists. Running throughout The Pump House Gang is a central theme of Wolfe s writing: status. He discusses the 1960s phenomenon of retreating from conventional social hierarchies, which Wolfe calls  starting your own league.  Surfers, motorcyclists, lumpen-dandies, and stay-at-homes everybody s doing it. Except for die-hards in the crumbling old social worlds of New York and London, where the confusion is so great that nobody can tell whether this is really the path to the top they ve taken or just the service elevator.

Jack Claiborne combines these elements in The Charlotte Observer, a narrative that traces the development of the largest newpaper in the Carolinas from Reconstruction to the present. A business-oriented paper from the outset, the Observer began as a four-page, single-sheet publication, printed and folded by hand and distributed mostly by train. Today its huge presses print, cut, count, and fold more than 230,000 copies daily and 270,000 on Sundays for distribution by truck to mountain towns and coastal resorts as well as the sprawling neighborhoods of Charlotte. The rise of the Observer mirrors the rise of Charlotte as the Carolinas' largest trading, manufacturing, financial, and distribution center, and the evolution of the surrounding Piedmont countryside from an area of rolling farms and cotton fields to a dispersed urban region of manufacturing and commerce. In telling the Observer's story, Claiborne also recounts the birth and death of its formal rival, the evening Charlotte News (1888-1985). The story documents the Observer's embrace of the New South creed as it emerged as one of North Carolina's most influential newspapers and the voice of its industrial interests. Like Charlotte and the surrounding region, which were shaped by such men as Zebulon Vance, James Duke, Henry Belk, and Cameron Morrison, the Observer bears the imprint of many personalities, from pioneer industrialist D. A. Tompkins and the eloquent, outspoken editor J. P. Caldwell, to John S. and John L. Knight, leaders of the national company that owns the modern Observer. Spiced with vignettes of those and others who shaped and guided the paper, Claiborne's account captures the clash of ambition and personality that marked the paper's rise. The death of editor J. P. Caldwell in 1911 touched off a five-year struggle for power until the paper was purchased by Curtis Johnson, who built it into a large and highly profitable enterprise. Johnson's death in 1950 precipitated another five-year struggle, resulting in the paper's purchase by the Knights and their appointment of \\"Pete\\" McKnight as editor. Under McKnight the paper abandoned its rigid conservatism to become an advocate of social change across the South. Originally published in 1986.

C. The goal of this workshop was to bring photogrammetry and computer vision experts together in order to exchange ideas, concepts and approaches in camera calibration and orientation. These topics have been addressed in photogrammetry research for a long time, starting in the sec ond half of the 19th century. Over the years standard procedures have been developed and implemented, in particular for metric cameras, such that in the photogrammetric community such issues were considered as solved prob lems. With the increased use of non-metric cameras (in photogrammetry they are revealingly called \\"amateur\\" cameras), especially CCD cameras, and the exciting possibilities of acquiring long image sequences quite effortlessly and processing image data automatically, online and even in real-time, the need to take a new and fresh look at various calibration and orientation issues became obvious. Here most activities emerged through the computer vision commu nity, which was somewhat unaware as to what had already been achieved in photogrammetry. On the other hand, photogrammetrists seemed to ignore the new and interesting studies, in particular on the problems of orienta tion, that were being performed by computer vision experts.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=eZGqCAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"My present age: A novel","description":"Ed is punchy, unemployed, and on the wrong side of thirty.

Perfectly preserved, it established Giotto's genius for displacing the Byzantine style of painting and introducing the fundamental principles of Renaissance humanism into art. Painted around 1306, the nearly forty large frescoes that cover the walls and ceiling of the Chapel tell stories from the lives of the Virgin, Christ, and the Virgin's parents, Sts. Joachim and Anne. Created with a subtle yet brilliant array of colors - shimmering blues, golden reds, subtle ivories - these easy-to-read narrative panels have remained comprehensible and evocative to viewers for generations; this may be because, unlike much of the art that preceded Giotto, his images contain sacred figures that behave in human ways, bodies as well as faces that register human feelings familiar to us all. The Scrovegni Chapel is Giotto's masterpiece; it established him as the most famous artist of his day, not only in Italy but in all of Europe. It is little wonder that the art of Giotto has held the attention of Western civilization for over half a millennium\\"--Bookjacket.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=f57qAAAAMAAJ&dq=Giotto:+The+Scrovegni+Chapel,+Padua+(Great+Fresco+Cycles+of+the+Renaissance)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The popes at Avignon, 1305-1378 (Harper torchbooks)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=FCIQAQAAIAAJ&dq=The+popes+at+Avignon,+1305-1378+(Harper+torchbooks)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Belonging to God: A Personal Training Guide for the Deeper Catholic Spiritual Life","description":"This practical guide to the Catholic approach to spiritual formation, using rule and principles from the spiritual tradition and examples drawn from the lives of everyday people today.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=RrgJAAAACAAJ&dq=Belonging+to+God:+A+Personal+Training+Guide+for+the+Deeper+Catholic+Spiritual+Life&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Willing to Learn: Passages of Personal Discovery","description":"This book presents a biographical history of the field of systems thinking, by examining the life and work of thirty of its major thinkers.

Many think they know because the news or fashion media toss them an occasional piece of information. You manipulate and regiment your diet, but you do not simply eat with confident knowledge about exactly what your body needs, and when, and why. BodyFueling changes that with user-friendly education about eating and fitness that translates basic science into everyday terms, and deprograms diet thinking - the prevailing body of unhealthy attitudes and beliefs about food and fitness. BodyFueling offers a clear-headed and refreshing look beyond thoughtless diet platitudes, assumptions, and trying to \\"fix\\" your body - and a provocative, positive perspective on investing in your health and future. Eating to fuel your life, you'll enjoy more productivity, stamina, energy, vitality and leanness - and, most importantly, freedom from concern about fat, weight, and food. Eating will become joyful, healthful and satisfying. You'll be a powerfully informed consumer, not a sound-bite victim or a target for fads and fallacies. You won't \\"have to change your eating\\" - you'll want to fuel your body. BodyFueling is not a program. It's not about what you are \\"allowed\\" or can't have. Instead of giving you something to follow, it gives you knowledge - and the power to make truly informed choices for the rest of your life.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=M5N_PQAACAAJ&dq=BodyFueling:+Stop+Watching+Your+Weight,+Start+Fueling+Your+Life&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"But Ice Cream Melts","description":"Nerina Rammairone finds fragile bliss in the details.

When the biologists Aaron Hirsh and Veronica Volny, along with their friend Graham Burnett, a historian of science, lead twelve college students to a remote fishing village on the Sea of Cortez, they come upon a bay of dazzling beauty and richness. But as the group pursues various threads of investigation ecological and evolutionary studies of the sea, the desert, and their various species of animals and plants; the stories of local villagers; the journals of conquistadors and explorers they recognize that the bay, spectacular and pristine though it seems, is but a ghost of what it once was. Life in the Sea of Cortez, they realize, has been reshaped by complex human ideas and decisions the laws and economics of fishing, property, and water; the dreams of developers and the fantasies of tourists seeking the wild; even efforts to retrieve species from the brink of extinction all of which have caused dramatic upheavals in the ecosystem. It is a painful realization, but the students discover a way forward. After weathering a hurricane and encountering a rare whale in its wake, they come to see that the bay's best chance of recovery may in fact reside in our own human stories, which can weave a compelling memory of the place. Glimpsing the intricate and ever-shifting web of human connections with the Sea of Cortez, the students comprehend anew their own place in the natural world suspended between past and future, teetering between abundance and loss. The redemption in their difficult realization is that as they find their places in a profoundly altered environment, they also recognize their roles in the path ahead, and ultimately come to see one another, and themselves, in a new light. In Telling Our Way to the Sea, Hirsh's voice resounds with compassionate humanity, capturing the complex beauty of both the marine world he explores and the people he explores it with. Vibrantly alive with sensitivity and nuance, Telling Our Way to the Sea transcends its genre to become literature.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=nZH18qJRRKAC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Vietnamese American 1.5 Generation: Stories of War, Revolution, Flight and New Beginnings (Asian American History & Cultu)","description":"Riveting stories by refugees who fled Vietnam.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=_tgdeezAQuEC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Elementary differential equations","description":"Elementary Differential Equations, 10th Edition is written from the viewpoint of the applied mathematician, whose interest in differential equations may sometimes be quite theoretical and sometimes intensely practical.

Readers travel through dungeon prisons, see the ancient world as if it were today, and witness the marvelous work God can do through a few souls fully surrendered to His purposes. They witness Paul's conversion and spot his imperfections, yet still they enter his successes as the Lord uses Him to preach Good News to the lost and dying. Because there are hardships today, places where God is unwelcome, and people whose hearts are unreceptive, both young and old will benefit from knowing that Paul's God is their God-the God of the ages.

The life, the movement and color, the shifting individualities, the pretense, the bluff, the self-consciousness, the independence, the ennui, the darting or lounging servants, the very fact that of those before your eyes seven out of ten are drawn from distant and scattered places, are sufficient in themselves to invest the smallest hostelry with glamour.

She relates how each came to terms with her disability and achieved self-identity and self-sufficiency in an able-bodied world. Drawing on thirty extensive interviews, Mason skillfully interweaves her own experience of childhood polio with the voices of impaired women across generations and from diverse race, ethnic, class, and work backgrounds. Although each woman's story and perspective are unique, the compelling narratives in this illuminating and teachable volume reveal shared concerns and feelings about the ways in which the disabled see themselves, how others perceive the impaired, and how our workplace culture perpetuates the double hindrance of gender and disability discrimination. The women profiled here express in their own words the process of claiming their disability and integrating it into their identity, the adjustment to various dependencies and caregivers, and approaches to coping with social discrimination and marginalization. They also discuss overcoming such obstacles in the workplace as an employer's refusal to grant an interview, lack of accommodations after employment, and negative stereotyping on the job or in job placement. In these accounts we meet, for example, Debbie, born with cerebral palsy, who struggled to get her family to accept her as she is; Barbara, born with orthopedic problems, who confronted her mother's fear that she would not be employed or find a husband; and Adrienne, blind from birth, who aggressively confronted discrimination in the workplace through litigation. Taken together, the stories of these ordinary yet remarkable individuals build a sense of community. Working against Odds tells disabled women that they are not alone in grappling with the tremendous barriers to independence and helps able-bodied readers understand the challenging life choices and work experiences of those with impairments. As a whole, the insightful book offers an intimate view of disability history and issues in America.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=8t-7AAAAIAAJ&dq=WORKING+AGAINST+ODDS(Stories+of+Disabled+Women%27s+Work+Lives)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hearts of Fire: Eight Women in the Underground Church and Their Stories of Costly Faith","description":"\\"Eight women from eight very different backgrounds, yet the struggles they each faced rang with eerie similarity.

Some even argued that the massacres and outrages on both sides were too horrific to \\"deserve the name of a war.\\" The war's brutality compelled the colonists to defend themselves against accusations that they had become savages. But Jill Lepore makes clear that it was after the war and because of it that the boundaries between cultures, hitherto blurred, turned into rigid ones. King Philip's War became one of the most written-about wars in our history, and Lepore argues that the words strengthened and hardened feelings that, in turn, strengthened and hardened the enmity between Indians and Anglos. Telling the story of what may have been the bitterest of American conflicts, and its reverberations over the centuries, Lepore has enabled us to see how the ways in which we remember past events are as important in their effect on our history as were the events themselves.

In fact, the God of medieval Christendom was the Father of only one Son but many daughters including Lady Philosophy, Lady Love, Dame Nature, and Eternal Wisdom. God and the Goddesses is a study in medieval imaginative theology, examining the numerous daughters of God who appear in allegorical poems, theological fictions, and the visions of holy women. We have tended to understand these deities as mere personifications and poetic figures, but that, Barbara Newman contends, is a mistake. These goddesses are neither pagan survivals nor versions of the Great Goddess constructed in archetypal psychology, but distinctive creations of the Christian imagination. As emanations of the Divine, mediators between God and the cosmos, embodied universals, and ravishing objects of identification and desire, medieval goddesses transformed and deepened Christendom's concept of God, introducing religious possibilities beyond the ambit of scholastic theology and bringing them to vibrant imaginative life. Building a bridge between secular and religious conceptions of allegorized female power, Newman advances such questions as whether medieval writers believed in their goddesses and, if so, in what manner. She investigates whether the personifications encountered in poetic fictions can be distinguished from those that appear in religious visions and questions how medieval writers reconcile their statements about the multiple daughters of God with orthodox devotion to the Son of God. Furthermore, she examines why forms of feminine God-talk that strike many Christians today as subversive or heretical did not threaten medieval churchmen. Weaving together such disparate texts as the writings of Latin and vernacular poets, medieval schoolmen, liturgists, and male and female mystics and visionaries, God and the Goddesses is a direct challenge to modern theologians to reconsider the role of goddesses in the Christian tradition.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=jSm5H_exyfEC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"THE SPITFIRE STORY","description":"The Spitfire Story, published in association with Imperial War Museums, is a fascinating anthology of first-hand stories from Spitfire heroes and heroines of the Second World War.The Spitfire is the world's most iconic aeroplane. Coming into its own during the Battle of Britain, it became famous during the Second World War as the only plane that could match the enemy fighters in the sky.Yet, even today, the history of the Spitfire contains many hitherto hidden or little-known stories of the men and women behind the plane; not only the gifted creators and inventors who brought the Spitfire to life, or the brave fighter pilots from many countries who triumphed in battle, but also the thousands of other people whose lives were affected by their personal connection to it - engineers, ground crew, factory or office workers, and their families. Spitfire Stories recounts the memories and stories of these people, from the birth of the iconic Spitfire in the 1930s to the present day. Among these accounts is the extraordinary tale of the fighter pilot who only discovered, fifty years on, the tragic truth of his last Spitfire flight, the businessman whose blank cheque changed the course of the war, the ninety-five-year-old Royal Air Force engineer who was determined to be reunited with his beloved Spit before he died, and the little girl who inspired the plane's creation - and went on to marry a movie star.Using documents, letters and photographs from the Imperial War Museums' unparalleled archive, plus exclusive first-hand interviews, these stories of the Spitfire are a revelatory collection of small but significant histories, to be treasured by all who love and admire the iconic plane.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ZklNvgEACAAJ&dq=THE+SPITFIRE+STORY&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Bible Promises for the Healing Journey","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=08vqElvwzdsC&dq=Bible+Promises+for+the+Healing+Journey&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Saint's Last Tear","description":"\\"(Cioran's) statements have the compression of poetry and the audacity of cosmic clowning\\".--WASHINGTON POST.

Authors explore notions of play from diverse cultural viewpoints, as well as the impact of technology on play, and the kinds of resistant and liberatory play children might partake in. Informed by the field of performance studies, the book considers play as performance, asking questions about embodiment at physical, relational, and ideological levels, and considering ?performance? to be part of identity construction, as well as a component of enculturation into various societies. Of interest are the ways in which children try on various identities through their play, and how these identities may (re)define their attitudes, values, and beliefs. As curriculum and instruction have become open to the use of games - and children's material culture more generally - as a forum for learning, intersections have emerged between schooling and culture at large. This book broadens the scope of ?learning? to investigate how these cultural artifacts are open or closed to multiple perspectives and narratives, as well as how their use is constituted both in and out of the classroom.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=_sQwtEwPDLUC&dq=Kids+under+construction&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Works of Edmund Spenser (Poetry Library)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=5sx8xlAt6toC&dq=The+Works+of+Edmund+Spenser+(Poetry+Library)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Shadow of an Agony","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Mp0fAAAACAAJ&dq=The+Shadow+of+an+Agony&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Microsoft Frontpage 2000 Expert (One-Day Course, DDC)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=y9qlDH_3W7kC&dq=Microsoft+Frontpage+2000+Expert+(One-Day+Course,+DDC)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Living Orthodoxy: In the Modern World : Orthodox Christianity & Society","description":"Twelve lay and ordained Orthodox writes provide profound and fascinating insights into the role and mission of the Church in today's world.

The ossuary and its inscription are now regarded as authentic by top scholars in the field; they represent the first visual, tangible, scientific evidence of Jesus  existence. The implications are monumental for understanding Jesus, his family, and the Jewish Christian movement during the formative years of Christianity. Hidden for centuries, the ossuary was purchased many years ago by an Israeli collector of ancient artifacts who never suspected its importance. Only when the renowned French scholar Andr  Lemaire saw the Aramaic inscription (Aramaic was the language spoken by Jesus and his earliest followers) in April 2002 was its significance discovered. In October 2002, Lemaire announced the news to the world, asserting that it was almost certain that the inscription referred to Jesus of the Bible, his father Joseph and his brother James. Controversy immediately erupted over the age and authenticity of the inscription. The discovery also rekindled an ancient debate over whether Mary, the mother of Jesus, was a virgin throughout her life - a doctrine that still divides Catholics and Protestants. Hershel Shanks, a central figure of biblical archaeology, who led a forceful campaign to make the Dead Sea Scrolls available to the world, recounts the story of the ossuary s discovery and authentication. Ben Witherington III, a leading New Testament scholar, shows how the discovery reveals surprising facts about a story people thought they knew: how Jesus was raised in a large, religiously conservative Jewish family; how his brothers and sisters were skeptical about his claims - until he died; how Jesus  brother James went on to head the Jewish Christian movement in Jerusalem, becoming the leader Peter and Paul looked to for guidance and approval; how James brokered the major church controversy of the first century and wrote a book of the Bible; how he was martyred and soon written out of history by the Church of Rome. The dramatic discovery of the ossuary allows us to become reacquainted with the towering historical figure the apostle Paul called a  pillar of the church .","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=NnDSKgmm4gEC&dq=The+Brother+of+Jesus:+The+Dramatic+Story&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"In Remembrance of a Special Cat: A Keepsake Memorial","description":"This anthology of comforting words and thoughts offers nearly fifty selections from James Herriot, Cleveland Amory, Mark Twain, Lewis Carroll, Saki, and many others -- selections chosen to support the fifty-three million cat owners who have lost their animal friend.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Iv49GwAACAAJ&dq=In+Remembrance+of+a+Special+Cat:+A+Keepsake+Memorial&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Straw Dogs (Blue Murder Series)","description":"Olatundes lively imagination and wicked sense of humour maintain suspense and keep the plotline from tiring in this international, supernatural, semi-farcical thriller. Kirkus Reviews Shola Dina, son of a wealthy Nigerian socialite, is forced to flee from Nigeria to New York after the Abacha regime assassinates his father and threatens his life. As an migr in New York, he struggles to make ends meet. In May 1998, while employed as a waiter at an upscale restaurant, he has a chance encounter with Carol Moore, a notable Hollywood director, who casts him as a lead in her new movie. Things take an unexpected turn when Moore is murdered in her apartment midway into the movie production after she stumbles upon a telltale video recording of a covert plot to break into the White House to harm President Bill Clinton. Shola is implicated in her murder. The break in is sponsored by the Rose flower Committee, a secret Chinese hard-line communist organization which was founded during Chinas Cultural Revolution by Madame Mao and a young Chinese army officer, Tung Yuk-Kai, who had become a major general by 1998. Two weeks before China Summit II in June 1998, a Chinese secret agent contracted to execute the break in accidentally plunges to his death from the presidential bedroom of the White House. The Committee feeds American intelligence evidence linking Chinas President, Jiang Zemin, with the botched break in. Intensive investigations are quietly launched separately by the American and Chinese governments. Desperate to cover its tracks, the Rose flower Committee attempts its most daring mission a poison gas attack on a state dinner held in honour of Clinton in Beijing, a dinner scheduled to have Chinas top leaders in attendance. Straw Dogs is an account of the events surrounding the break in and the bomb plot. The novel has a cast of celebrities, disgruntled angels, secret service agents and members of the American Autosexual Society (AAS), an organisation which defends the rights of autosexuals; autosexual is a term which refers to an individual whose sexual preference is masturbation. The interactions of these odd characters results in a tale that is comic, action-packed and full of suspense.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=rirQhgeBu6cC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Wild Flowers of America","description":"Color plates are reproduced from the portifolio set North American wild flowers, as published by the Smithsonian Institution.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=q6dNAAAAMAAJ&dq=Wild+Flowers+of+America&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Beyond The Final Frontier","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=2La2rMJJKzQC&dq=Beyond+The+Final+Frontier&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Mystery of the Grail: Initiation and Magic in the Quest for the Spirit","description":"In this important study of the meaning of the Grail, one of Europe's greatest esoteric philosophers discloses the pre-Christian and initiatic sources of this symbolic motif that is so central to Western mythology and culture. He demonstrates how the main features of the legend are from an older tradition analogous to the great heroic sagas and cycles of the North, and that the Grail itself is a symbol of initiation. Evola uncovers the hidden meaning in the often surreal adventures of the knights who searched for the Grail, interpreting them as inner experiences and tests for the seeker. He also explores the history of the myth in the Middle Ages, its use by the Knights Templar and the Cathars, its legacy during the decline of the Holy Roman Empire, and its links with Rosicrucianism, alchemy, and Masonry.

Smash hits like Flash Gordon and The Lone Ranger demonstrated the enduring mass appeal of the genre.

In this open letter to Muslims and non-Muslims alike, Manji asks arresting questions. \\"Who is the real colonizer of Muslims - America or Arabia? Why are we all being held hostage by what's happening between the Palestinians and the Israelis? Why are we squandering the talents of women, fully half of God's creation? What's our excuse for reading the Koran literally when it's so contradictory and ambiguous? Is that a heart attack you're having? Make it fast. Because if more of us don't speak out against the imperialists within Islam, these guys will walk away with the show.\\" Manji offers a practical vision of how the United States and its allies can help Muslims undertake a reformation that empowers women, promotes respect for religious minorities, and fosters a competition of ideas. Her vision revives Islam's lost tradition of independent thinking. This book will inspire struggling Muslims worldwide to revisit the foundations of their faith.

Yet there are many discrepancies in the perceived meaning, spelling and usage between various countries and teaching methods, and this dictionary aims to prevent confusion by explaining the precise meanings of over 560 of the French technical terms used in classical ballet. The dictionary is also unique in that it addresses the problems of correct spelling and grammar, such as the fact that French nouns have a gender with which the adjectives qualifying them must agree. These details may be relatively unimportant to the average dancer, but it is essential that they should be correctly applied when dealing with the printed word. While most of the entries are concerned with the correct translation and basic explanation of technical terms, there are also extended entries which trace both the historical background and the linguistic origins of particular aspects of ballet terminology, such as the one on The Orientation of the Body in Space.

Frequently domesticity's style has been to make invisible the labor that produces it, allowing woman to be asserted or argued about in universal terms that downplay race, class, and material relations. American Domesticity considers this relationship in representations of domesticity and domestic labor over the last two centuries in didactic, cinematic, and feminist texts. While the domestic is usually conceived of as the antithesis of the public, economical, and political, Kathleen McHugh demonstrates how domestic discourse established the terms within which the most crucial national issues--the market economy, universal white male suffrage, slavery, the construction of racial difference, consumerism, spectatorship, desire, and even feminism--were conceived, assimilated, and understood. Beginning in the nineteenth century, the book investigates the historical roots of domestic labors invisibility in widely circulated didactic housekeeping manuals written by Lydia Child, Catherine Beecher, Mary Pattison, and Christine Frederick. It then considers how pedagogical discourses became entertainment discourses, their focus shifting from the silent era of film to the twilight of the classical period. The book concludes with an examination of the return of a pedagogical impulse within feminist film production concerning domesticity, comparing it to the concurrent rise of feminist film theory in the academy. Looking at this wide range of print and film texts, McHugh traces the outlines of a discourse of domesticity that claims to be private and universal but instead brokers difference within the public sphere.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=bMoIAOeFB2wC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Claret and Blue Blood","description":"From the World Cup-winning days of Bobby Moore, Geoff Hurst and Martin Peters to highly acclaimed modern-day heroes such as Joe Cole, Michael Carrick and Jermain Defoe, West Ham United supporters have always had the greatest affection for homegrown Hammers.

Many of us struggle to forge deep relationships with God and other people. Modern society has isolated us as rugged individuals, deceiving us into thinking we can make it through life on our own. Individualism has likewise shaped the pattern of Christian discipleship, privatizing faith and separating us from fellow believers. But we come to know God best when others help us on the way. And our friendships develop best when we seek after God together. What would it look like to pursue God not by ourselves but in the company of friends? According to the model of the New Testament, spiritual transformation takes place in the context of Christian community. By unpacking the Gospel narratives of Jesus' ministry with his disciples, Richard Lamb demonstrates how discipleship develops within the shared community life of groups of Christians. He explores a range of topics--such as spiritual friendship, hospitality, leadership, service, conflict, forgiveness and mission--in light of Christian community. Engaging stories from real-life experience show how people can form one another spiritually when their lives are tumbled against one another. If you long for more of God, deeper friendships or both, this book will help you on the journey. Discover the transforming power of discipleship in community. Join the pursuit of God in the company of friends.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=4h-Ovai85-gC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sheets of Sound for Guitar","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=cI2tswEACAAJ&dq=Sheets+of+Sound+for+Guitar&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sugarfree Holidays","description":"Sugar-Free Kids arms busy parents with a wide array of sugar-free recipes that children will love.

The search itself is a fascinating exploration of the idea of a feminine divinity. And Sch?fer's surprising but persuasive conclusions yield deeper understanding of the complex but frequently intimate relationship between Christianity and Judaism--and of the development of religious concepts more generally. Toward the end of the twelfth century, a small book titled the Bahir (Light) appeared in Provence. The first document of Judaism's emerging kabbalistic movement, it introduced a completely new view of God, one that included a divine potency that was essentially female. This female divinity was portrayed both as a mediator between Jews and God and as part of the Godhead itself. Examining Judaic history from the biblical Wisdom tradition to the Middle Ages, Sch?fer finds some precedents for the Kabbalah's feminine divinity. But he cannot account for her forceful appearance in twelfth-century southern France without reference to the immediate Christian environment, particularly the flourishing veneration of the Virgin Mary. Indeed, twelfth-century Jews and Christians were simultaneously rediscovering the feminine as an aspect of the Godhead after having abandoned it in favor of either an abstract, disembodied God or an exclusively male one. In proposing that the medieval cult of Mary--rather than eastern Gnosticism--is the appropriate framework for understanding the feminine elements in Jewish mysticism, Mirror of His Beauty represents a sea change in Kabbalah and Jewish-Christian cultural studies. It shifts our attention from the Byzantine East to the Latin Christian West. And in contrast to histories that treat the development of Judaism and Christianity in isolation, it leads us to a fuller understanding of Jews and Christians living in proximity, aware of each other.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=mf1ZDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Stained Glass Painting: Basic Techniques of the Craft (Chilton's creative crafts series)","description":"More than two hundred illustrations enhance a discussion of materials, strokes, lines, and designs for painting stained glass and advice on creating a suitable work area in a basement or living room","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=oZ3UAAAACAAJ&dq=Stained+Glass+Painting:+Basic+Techniques+of+the+Craft+(Chilton%27s+creative+crafts+series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"XAIPE","description":"XAIPE (Greek for \\"rejoice\\"), which first appeared in 1950, contains some of E.

Kirkus Reviews (starred review) In the dark years following the Civil War, America s foremost Arctic explorer, Charles Francis Hall, became a figure of national pride when he embarked on a harrowing, landmark expedition. With financial backing from Congress and the personal support of President Grant, Captain Hall and his crew boarded the Polaris, a steam schooner carefully refitted for its rigorous journey, and began their quest to be the first men to reach the North Pole. Neither the ship nor its captain would ever return. What transpired was a tragic death and whispers of murder, as well as a horrifying ordeal through the heart of an Arctic winter, when men fought starvation, madness, and each other upon the ever-shifting ice. Trial by Ice is an incredible adventure that pits men against the natural elements and their own fragile human nature. In this powerful true story of death and survival, courage and intrigue aboard a doomed ship, Richard Parry chronicles one of the most astonishing, little known tragedies at sea in American history.

At nightfall the room was filled with gypsies who glided around in clusters. They wore colorful thin flowing dresses and rummaged greedily through my drawers and books as if they would steal everything. I lay in bed as stiff as a board, trying to will myself invisible, praying they would not notice me looking . . . Daylight obliterated the gypsies, rendering them as thoroughly insubstantial as they had been real in the dark. I had a vague understanding that my vision was private, so I never told my family what I saw.  So began Corinne May Botz s fascination with the invisible, a phenomenon that has profoundly influenced her approach to photography in style and subject matter. For more than ten years, she searched for ghost stories in buildings across the United States. She ventured into these haunted places with both camera and tape recorder in hand; her photographs, accompanied by first-person narratives, reveal a rare glimpse into American interiors, both physical and psychological. This book includes more than eighty haunted buildings, from the legendary to the ordinary, including Edgar Allan Poe s house in Baltimore, a New Jersey tavern, and a Massachusetts farmhouse, a log cabin in Kentucky, and a number of private residences. The text includes ghost stories told to the author by those who lived through the moving rugs, creaking floors, apparitions, disappearing and reappearing objects, cries in the night, mysteriously burning candles, and other unexplained occurrences.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=d7dvDwAAQBAJ&dq=HAUNTED+HOUSES&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Fireplace & Mantel Ideas: Design, Build and Install Your Dream Fireplace Mantel","description":"\\"How to alter unsatisfactory fireplaces & to build new ones in the 18th century fashion\\"--Cover.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=QKtSAAAAMAAJ&dq=Fireplace&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Classical antiquities: II.

In New York City, a brutal act of violence summons a malevolent spirit and a growing congregation of desensitized worshippers in  The Whimper of Whipped Dogs,  an Edgar Award winner influenced by the real-life murder of Queens resident Kitty Genovese in 1964.

A legendary author of speculative fiction whose best-known works include A Boy and His Dog and I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream and whose major awards and nominations number in the dozens, Harlan Ellison strips away convention and hypocrisy and lays bare the human condition in modern society as ancient gods fade and new deities rise to appease the masses gods of technology, drugs, gambling, materialism that are as insubstantial as the beliefs of those who venerate them. In addition to his Nebula, Hugo, World Fantasy, Bram Stoker, Edgar, and other awards, Ellison was called  one of the great living American short story writers  by the Washington Post and this collection makes it clear why he has earned such an extraordinary assortment of accolades. Stories include:  Introduction: Oblations at Alien Altars   The Whimper of Whipped Dogs   Along the Scenic Route   On the Downhill Side   O Ye of Little Faith   Neon   Basilisk   Pretty Maggie Moneyeyes   Corpse   Shattered Like a Glass Goblin   Delusion for a Dragon Slayer   The Face of Helene Bournouw   Bleeding Stones   At the Mouse Circus   The Place with No Name   Paingod   Ernest and the Machine God   Rock God   Adrift Just Off the Islets of Langerhans: Latitude 38  54' N, Longitude 77  00' 13\\" W   The Deathbird ","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ahhoAwAAQBAJ&dq=Deathbird+Stories&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Natural Child: Parenting from the Heart","description":"Discover an age-old parenting method that treats children with dignity, respect, understanding, and compassion from infancy into adulthood. The Natural Child makes a compelling case for a return to attachment parenting, a child-rearing approach that has come naturally for parents throughout most of human history. In this insightful guide, parenting specialist Jan Hunt links together attachment parenting principles with child advocacy and homeschooling philosophies, offering a consistent approach to raising a loving, trusting, and confident child. The Natural Child dispels the myths of  tough love,  building baby s self-reliance by ignoring its cries, and the necessity of spanking to enforce discipline. Instead, the book explains the value of extended breast-feeding, family co-sleeping, and minimal child-parent separation. Homeschooling, like attachment parenting, nurtures feelings of self-worth, confidence, and trust. The author draws on respected leaders of the homeschool movement such as John Taylor Gatto and John Holt, guiding the reader through homeschool approaches that support attachment parenting principles. Being an ally to children is spontaneous for caring adults, but intervening on behalf of a child can be awkward and surrounded by social taboo. The Natural Child shows how to stand up for a child s rights effectively and sensitively in many difficult situations. The role of caring adults, points out Hunt, is not to give children  lessons in life  but to employ a variation of The Golden Rule, and treat children as we would like to have been treated in childhood. Praise for The Natural Child  I had grown jaded with the flood of parenting books, but The Natural Child is a rare and splendid exception . . . . I can t praise it sufficiently, and would place it along with Leidloff s Continuum Concept and my own Magical Child . . . . It could make an enormous difference if read widely enough.   Joseph Chilton Pierce, author of The Magical Child  In prose that is at the same time eloquent and simple, [Hunt] provides a mix of useful parenting tips that are supported by the philosophy that children reflect the treatment they receive. This is no less than an impassioned plea for the future not only our children s future, but the future of our way oof life on this planet.

Like most one-time Progressives, he looked forward to perpetual advance, spurred on by technology, inhibited only by irrational politicians, greedy interest groups, and what he called \\"individualism run riot.\\" His was an incremental idealism, wherein personal success was tempered and purified by service to others. \\"Character is made in the community as well as in the individual by assuming responsibilities,\\" wrote the man who had abandoned his engineering career to feed war-ravaged Europe, \\"not by escape from them.\\" In his 1922 work, the future president envisioned a delicate balancing act between capitalists, workers and a public represented by the national government. Should one group gain authority over the others, the result would be fascism, socialism, or tyranny by bureaucracy. And individualism-the mainspring of American greatness-would be crippled for good. Twelve years would pass before Hoover's next attempt at codifying values. The Challenge to Liberty was necessarily a very different work, less a summons to cooperation than a warning against incipient fascism. \\"I am no more fond of the Wall Street model of liberty than I am of the Pennsylvania Avenue model,\\" asserted the former president, for whom the Bill of Rights took precedence over property rights. Now, as in 1922, Hoover wrote in the shadow of revolution, nationalistic frenzy and economic confusion. But he did not fear Depression-era mobs in the streets of American cities. The threat to liberty was more subtile than that. What Hoover termed \\"the tragedy of Liberty\\" followed a similar pattern on both sides of the Atlantic: \\"idealism without realism, slogans, phrases and statements destructive to confidence in existing institutions, demands for violent action against slowly curable ills; unfair representation that sporadic wickedness in the system itself.\\" Next came the man on horseback, demanding delegation of authority from elected representatives, denouncing all opposition and exploiting propagandists in the pay of the state.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Id4lAQAAMAAJ&dq=American+Individualism+and+the+Challenge+to+Liberty&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A history of Greece: to the death of Alexander the Great","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=2asaAAAAYAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ashen Victor: Motorball Diaries From The World Of Battle Angel Alita (Viz Graphic Novel)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=06TqRwAACAAJ&dq=Ashen+Victor:+Motorball+Diaries+From+The+World+Of+Battle+Angel+Alita+(Viz+Graphic+Novel)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Decorating for Dining & Entertaining: 128 Projects & Ideas","description":"Whether you have a formal dining room, a casual one, or none at all, you can entertain guests graciously.

Dale S. Recinella compares biblical teaching about the death penalty, including such passages as \\"eye for eye, tooth for tooth, life for life,\\" with the nation's current system of capital punishment, and offers persuasive arguments for a faith-based moratorium on -- and eventual abolition of -- executions. Framing his careful and incisive analysis as a legal brief to those who believe the Bible mandates the ultimate punishment, the author addresses two critical areas of inquiry: what do the scriptures tell us about who is deserving of death and who has the authority to kill, and what do they tell us about the required standards for execution and the plight of victims' families. Recinella's examination of the Hebrew Torah, or Christian Pentateuch, and the Talmud reveals that the biblical death penalty was not a simple system of swift retribution, but a complex and practical set of laws that guided capital courts established under the Sanhedrin. His scrutiny of these texts, the Christian doctrine of atonement, and Romans 13 in the Pauline Epistles, draws parallels between the traditional biblical arguments used in favor of capital punishment and those used as the basis for pro-slavery positions in the nineteenth century. Demonstrating that both approaches are unsubstantiated in biblical terms, Recinella debunks the accepted religious reasoning for support of the death penalty and shows instead that the Bible's strict conditions for sanctioning execution are at odds with the arbitrary ways in which capital punishment is administered in the United States. He provides convincing evidence that a sentence of death in today's criminal justice system in fact fails to meet both the Bible's exacting procedural requirements and its strict limitations on judicial authority. By providing actual scriptural language and foundation to counter the position that biblical truth justifies a pro-death penalty stance, this thoughtful, solidly researched, and well-reasoned work will give pause to religious fundamentalists and challenge them to rethink their strongly held views on capital punishment.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=QPTwCgAAQBAJ&dq=The+Biblical+Truth+about+America%27s+Death+Penalty&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The gospel of healing","description":"Its scriptural statement and principles, popular objections, practical directions, a multitude of witnesses, the author's personal experience.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Bs83AQAAMAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Playboy Adult magazine: July 2006","description":"The electronic age is bringing sweeping changes to entertainment and media of all kinds, including publishing, broadcasting and film.

When the book was first published in 1983 Roger Staubach, class of 1965, wrote, \\"Anyone who has attended a service academy will recognize Philo T. McGiffin and his classmates. However, anyone who has ever had a dream or a goal will feel a special kinship with Philo. This is a book worth reading.\\" Poyer's Philo, burdened with the name of Annapolis's legendary prankster of the class of 1882, attracts attention from the day he reports for Plebe Summer, and the upperclassmen soon make his life a living hell. Stoop-shouldered and meek, he seems an unlikely candidate to carry on the tradition of the original Philo, whose outrageous escapades had served as a symbol of subversive individualism to generations of midshipmen. At first Philo nearly buckles under from the strain, but gradually \\"The Mouse\\" learns to roar and ultimately to triumph in the grand style of his predecessor. Funny, touching, and enormously realistic, this madcap novel will bring back to everyone what it was like to be 17--and in deep trouble.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=M1LWwAEACAAJ&dq=The+Return+of+Philo+T.+McGiffin&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sharpe's Havoc: Richard Sharpe & the Campaign in Northern Portugal, Spring 1809 (Richard Sharpe's Adventure Series #7)","description":"New York Times Bestselling Author Newly Reissued Richard Sharpe returns to the battlefields of the Iberian Peninsula, where he and his men bravely fight the French invasion into Portugal in 1809.

Understand and dispute the irrational beliefs that make you anxious ? Use a variety of exercises, including rational coping self-statements, reframing, problem-solving methods, and Unconditional Self-Acceptance (USA), to control your anxiety ?

Demaris also had access to wiretaps, surveillance reports, prison and court records, The result is the most important work to date on organized crime in America---a disturbing, yet extraordinary and vivid life story that makes the other \\"insider\\" stories of the Mafia look like tales of innocence.The Last Mafioso details eleven murders Fratianno was personally involved in, and relates Fratianno's inside knowledge of some two dozen others, including the slayings of Bugsy Siegel, Nick DeJohn, Albert Anastasia, Jimmy Hoffa, Sam Giancana, Johnny Roselli, and Tamara Rand. Fratianno was a confidant of Johnny Roselli, so Demaris tells the real story of Operation Mongoose, the CIA-Mafia plot to assassinate Castro. Here also are the behind-the-scenes deals and machinations of the Mafia in Las Vegas. Fratianno's life was not spent entirely with his criminal friends, although The Last Mafioso records the secret lives of virtually all the important Mafiosi of the last thirty years. Fratianno moved perpetually in exotic circles, a man of inexhaustible energy, an ingenious schemer and scammer, an insatiable womanizer and socializer who was quick to ingratiate him-self with Mafia royalty, Hollywood celebrities, politicians, prominent lawyers, successful businessmen, and Teamster officials. In The Last Mafioso there are countless episodes with the likes of Frank Sinatra and ex-San Francisco Mayor Joseph Alioto.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=0_xgewAACAAJ&dq=The+Last+Mafioso&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The World Wide Web and Contemporary Cultural Theory : Magic, Metaphor, Power","description":"Engaging the thematic issues of the Web as a space where magic, metaphor, and power converge, the chapters cover such subjects as The Web and Corporate Media Systems, Conspiracy Theories and the Web; The Economy of Cyberpromotion, The Bias of the Web, The Web and Issues of Gender, and so on.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=W85QAwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Music in the Old Bones: Jezebel Through the Ages","description":"\\"Music in the Old Bones is a guide to the eternal Jezebel story.

Moreover, this culture has also been based on a dominant religious tradition, that of Theravada Buddhism. The process of creating the modern nation-state of Thailand out of the traditional Buddhist kingdom of Siam began in the nineteenth century when the rulers of Siam, confronted with increasing pressure from the colonial powers of Britain and France, were able to preserve their country's independence by instituting revolutionary changes that established the authority of a centralized bureaucracy throughout the country. The new state asserted its authority not only over Siamese who lived in the core area of the old kingdom but also over large numbers of Lao, Yuan or Northern Thai, Khmer, Malays, tribal peoples, and other groups, all of which had previously enjoyed relative autonomy, and over the sizable immigrant Chinese population, which was assuming an increasingly significant role in the economy. Because the rulers of the Siamese state strove to incorporate these diverse peoples into a Thai national community, how this community should be defined and what type of state structure should be linked with it have been dominant questions in modern Thai history. Significant tensions have arisen from the efforts by members of the Thai elite to make the monarchical traditions of the Bangkok dynasty, Buddhism, and the central Thai language basic to Thai national culture. Other tensions have arisen as monarchy, military, bureaucracy, the Buddhist sangha, business interests, and elected political representatives assert or maintain an authoritative position in the state structure. This book examines these tensions with reference to the major changes that have taken place in Thai society, economy, polity, and culture in the twentieth century, especially since World War II.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=tayhDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Loving Reminders for Kids: 60 Nurturing Notes Sealed with Hugs & Kisses!","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=W_ViDYUOOtEC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Art of Etching (The New Art Library)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=emVxpwAACAAJ&dq=The+Art+of+Etching+(The+New+Art+Library)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Gideon Algernon Mantell: A Bibliography With Supplementary Essays (History of Earth Sciences Series)","description":"Biographical & bibliographical data tracing the life & career of the pioneering paleontologist Gideon Algernon Mantell (1790-1852).","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=HYPgAAAAMAAJ&dq=Gideon+Algernon+Mantell:+A+Bibliography+With+Supplementary+Essays+(History+of+Earth+Sciences+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"English Cricket","description":"In telling the story of cricket from the bottom up, Different Class demonstrates how the \\"quintessentially English\\" game has done more to divide, rather than unite, the English. In 1963, the West Indian Marxist C.L.R. James posed the deceptively benign question: \\"What do they know of cricket, who only cricket know?\\" A challenge to the public to re-consider cricket and its meaning by placing the game in its true social, political and economic context, James was, all too subtly, attempting to counter the game s orthodox history that, he argued, had played a key role in the formation of national culture. As a consequence, he failed, and the history of cricket in England has retained the same stresses and lineaments as it did a century ago   until now. In examining recreational rather than professional (first-class) cricket, Different Class does not simply challenge the widely accepted orthodoxy of English cricket, it demonstrates how the values and belief systems at its heart were, under the guise of amateurism, intentionally developed in order to divide the English along class lines at every level of the game. If the creation of opposing class-based cricket cultures in the North and South of England grew out of this process, the institutional structures developed by those in charge of English cricket continue to discriminate. But, as much as the exclusion of Black and South Asian cricketers from the recreational mainstream is the most obvious example, it is social class that remains the greatest barrier to participation in what used to be the national game.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=uWBUEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Outsmart Diabetes","description":"For the more than 21 million Americans who currently suffer from diabetes, there simply is no other reference that can match the breadth and depth of expertise found here.

Changes highlighted include the rapid shrinking of Lake Songor in Ghana, partly as a result of intensive salt production, and the extraordinary changes in the Zambezi river system as a result of the building of the Cabora Basa dam site. Other impacts, some natural and some human-made and which can only be truly appreciated from space, include the extensive deforestation around Lake Nakuru in Kenya, and the falling water levels of Lake Victoria which is now about a metre lower than it was in the early 1990s. The analysis recognises the importance of Africa's lakes as a source of livelihoods for many local communities, their contribution to the socio-economic development of the continent and the need for the sustainable management of these resources in order to help overcome poverty and meet internationally agreed development goals by 2015.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=YRC2p1TddpAC&dq=1998-99+World+Resources+Database+CD-Rom:+A+Guide+to+the+Global+Environment&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Zen in Medieval Vietnam : A Study and Translation of Thien Uyen Tap Anh (Classics in East Asian Buddhism)","description":"A study and translation of a 14th-century text on the transmission of the Zen lineages in Vietnam.

Unfortunately there are too many people who continue aimlessly along, overshadowed psychologically and physically because they are not aware of their own abilities. Such people are a great minus from their own viewpoint and from the viewpoint of society as well. The principles of ki lie in bringing to light man's natural strength and his hidden natural abilities. The author's earlier works, in which he introduced the principles of ki and aikido with mind and body coordinated, met with great response in many countries and created a demand for a still more detailed explanation of what ki really means. The present work is an answer to that demand. In the first section, while delving deeply into the principles of ki, the author gives a number of practical examples which anyone can easily follow. These examples are straight to that point, concrete and avoid abstractions such as how much power is there in spirit and the nature of feeling. The author's point is to have the reader learn the proper method of mastering the spirit and to have the spirit pervade the reader's body so that he will be able to grasp the basic meaning of ki. In part two of the book, the author gives detailed and concrete examples of how to apply the principles of ki to our daily lives. The author wishes that not only those who are in positions of leadership but also those who have physical or spiritual problems, or who do not fully realize their own abilities and strength, will learn the full meaning of ki.

With this objective in mind, the content of this textbook has been developed and arranged to provide a logical progression from the fundamental principles of institutional design at the founding, to avenues of political participation, to thorough coverage of the political structures that constitute American government. The book builds upon what students have already learned and emphasizes connections between topics as well as between theory and applications. The goal of each section is to enable students not just to recognize concepts, but to work with them in ways that will be useful in later courses, future careers, and as engaged citizens.

More precisely, Will remembers just a few days of that month and the quick sequence of astonishing events that have colored, ever since, the logic of his heart and the moods of his mind. He tells of his stunningly beautiful young mother, Leanne, who liked to recall the years of the Second World War, during which she sang with a dance band in a lounge in Cheyenne, Wyoming. He tells too of his father, Lewis, a soldier in the war who one night saw the  resplendently sequined  Leanne step onstage and began at that instant to plot his courtship of her. But mostly what Will summons up in his intimate remembrance are those few catastrophic days in early June when he was  three months shy of twelve,  more than a decade after his parents have married and returned to the Vaughns  home place, where Lewis farms his family s land. For it is during those days that Leanne s affair with a local man named Bobby Markum becomes known first to Lewis and then, in a fiercely dramatic public confrontation, to young Will, to his beloved Grandmother Vaughn, and by nightfall to all the citizens of the town. The knowledge of such scandal, in so small a place, sets off a series of highly charged reactions, vivid consequences that surely determine the fates of every member of this unforgettable family. A tale of memory and hero worship and the restless pulse of longing, The Book of Famous Iowans examines those forces that define not only a state made up of a physical geography, but more important, those states of the wholly human spirit.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=bfpHBAAAQBAJ&dq=The+Book+of+Famous+Iowans&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Classical Thought (A History of Western Philosophy)","description":"This clear and accessible introduction to classical thought spans over a thousand years, from Homer to St Augustine.

But contradictions and problems cloud even the most basic theoretical questions: What does a lesbian or gay reading of a literary text require or presume? Can we talk about a homosexual writer expressing him- or herself before the invention of \\"homosexuality\\"? Was it possible for a writer like Herman Melville, for example, to create literary works linked to his own prohibited eros? In Closet Writing/Gay Reading, Creech shows how a literary critic can be receptive to implicit and closeted sexual content. Forcefully advocating a tactic of identification and projection in literary analysis, he lends renewed currency to the kind of \\"sentimental\\" response to literature that continental theory particularly deconstruction has sought to discredit. In the second half of his book, Creech sets out to analyze what he considers the exemplary novel of the nineteenth-century closet, Melville's Pierre, or: The Ambiguities. By approaching Pierre as the gay man Melville longed to have as its reader, Creech is able to decipher the novel's \\"encrypted erotics\\" and to reveal that Melville's apparent tale of incest is actually a homosexual novel in disguise. The closeted \\"address\\" to queer-sensitive readers that Pierre disseminates finally receives a critical reading that strives to be explicit, shareable, and public.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=gqjE3DV9uEsC&dq=The+Gay+Herman+Melville+Reader&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Uncle Arthur's Bedtime Stories (fourteenth series)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=dQAcvgEACAAJ&dq=Uncle+Arthur%27s+Bedtime+Stories+(fourteenth+series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Batman: The Blue, the Grey, the Bat","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=b27PjgEACAAJ&dq=Batman:+The+Blue,+the+Grey,+the+Bat&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Series/Mnemonic","description":"Poetry.

That's the question that blues-playing police lieutenant Nicky Rachmaninoff must answer in Robert Westbrook's third book in The Left-Handed Policeman series, Lady Left. Having exposed the Hollywood dream ma-chine and the world of rock and roll in his previous two mysteries, Robert Westbrook now gives the same delightfully satirical treat-ment to another hot topic on the Hollywood scene: fashionable leftist politics. Nicky Rach-maninoff must take on Tinsel Town's liberal elite as it involves itself in a wild scheme to make the hemisphere safe for romance, revo-lution, and beautiful people everywhere. A reluctant Nicky is persuaded to \\"vacation\\" in Nicaragua by his loving ex-wife, Susan Merril, who is determined to shed her glamour-girl image by becoming a leftist activist. The vaca-tion goes wrong from the start: Nicky's feisty Bev-erly Hills daughter, fourteen-year-old Tanya, falls madly in love with a Nicaraguan soldier; and a far-left Hollywood professor, Cory Heard, introduces Nicky to a complicated scam that maybe just maybe is intended to bring the Sandinistas hack into power. But when Cory Heard is apparently mur-dered at the site of the late dictator Somoza s buried treasure, Nicky must put down his margarita in favor of a gun and mineral water, as he uncovers a trail that leads him back to Bev-erly Hills and into the arms of Cory's activist wife, the film superstar Katherine Hall. She is dark, passionate, devious, and out for Nicky, one way or another; she is the alluring and dangerous Lady Left. Nothing in Hollywood or the Third World is what it seems. From the jungles of Nicara-gua to the elegant homes of Beverly Hills and the palatial desert estates of Palm Springs, Lady Left is a darkly comic, intricate, and suspenseful story of what happens when glamour, murder, and politics mix.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=jc5mDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Living From Bees","description":"The updated bestselling guide to laid-back beekeeping for all, naturally!

Paul Getty Museum, found itself confronted by a century-old genocide. The Armenian Church was suing for the return of eight pages from the Zeytun Gospels, a manuscript illuminated by the greatest medieval Armenian artist, Toros Roslin. Protected for centuries in a remote church, the holy manuscript had followed the waves of displaced people exterminated during the Armenian genocide. Passed from hand to hand, caught in the confusion and brutality of the First World War, it was cleaved in two. Decades later, the manuscript found its way to the Republic of Armenia, while its missing eight pages came to the Getty. The Missing Pages is the biography of a manuscript that is at once art, sacred object, and cultural heritage. Its tale mirrors the story of its scattered community as Armenians have struggled to redefine themselves after genocide and in the absence of a homeland. Heghnar Zeitlian Watenpaugh follows in the manuscript's footsteps through seven centuries, from medieval Armenia to the killing fields of 1915 Anatolia, the refugee camps of Aleppo, Ellis Island, and Soviet Armenia, and ultimately to a Los Angeles courtroom. Reconstructing the path of the pages, Watenpaugh uncovers the rich tapestry of an extraordinary artwork and the people touched by it. At once a story of genocide and survival, of unimaginable loss and resilience, The Missing Pages captures the human costs of war and persuasively makes the case for a human right to art.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=S56HDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The posthumous papers of the Pickwick Club","description":"First published in serial form, \\"The Pickwick Papers\\" tells the story of Samuel Pickwick, a good natured elderly gentleman and president of the Pickwick Club.

The puff of smoke was sudden and it was hand colored so that it looked real. Today, we can look back at that primitive movie and see all the elements of what would evolve into the Western genre. Perhaps it is the Western's early origins_The Great Train Robbery was the first narrative, commercial movie_or its formulaic yet entertaining structure that has made the Western so popular. Whatever the case may be, with the recent success of films like 3:10 to Yuma and The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford, the Western appears to be in no danger of disappearing. The story of the western is told in The A to Z of Westerns in Cinema through a chronology, a bibliography, and an introductory essay. However, it is the hundreds of cross-referenced dictionary entries on cinematographers; composers; producers; films like Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, Dances With Wolves, The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly, High Noon, The Magnificent Seven, The Searchers, Tombstone, and Unforgiven; such actors as Gene Autry, Kirk Douglas, Clint Eastwood, Henry Fonda, James Stewart, and John Wayne; and directors like John Ford and Sergio Leone that will have you reaching for this book again and again.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Xdf8t-Vs3e4C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Clinical Laboratory Science Review","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=zA9GzgEACAAJ&dq=Clinical+Laboratory+Science+Review&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cowboy Serenade","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=o99btwAACAAJ&dq=Cowboy+Serenade&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"New Life (Hesperus Classics)","description":"Translated for the first time into English from Garibaldi s original manuscripts, these memoirs provide an authentic reading of the life and times of one of the most remarkable figures in history.

Thousands of others perished in the same way, and many people before and since have suffered far more gruesome torments. Why then is Jesus, Gerard Sloyan asks, uniquely and universally remembered for his suffering death? How has his death brought solace to many millions? To answer this question, Gerard Sloyan in this powerful historical tour de force tracks the legacy of the cross across two millennia of Christian reminiscences, piety, art, speculation, and mythicizing. Beginning with New Testament accounts, he shows how Jesus' death came to be seen as sacrificial. He then plots the emergence and development - in theology, liturgy, literature, art - of the conviction that Jesus' death was redemptive, as seen both in soteriological theory from Tertullian to Anselm, in the Reformation and modern eras, and in more popular religious responses to the crucifixion. Sloyan's impressive scholarship and keen theological insights bring to light both the historical realities of Jesus' death and the many and profound ways in which the cross has been received in the hearts and minds of those who profess Jesus' name.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=5DMmAQAAMAAJ&dq=The+Crucifixion+of+Jesus:+History,+Myth,+Faith+(Facets)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Early Candlelight","description":"\\"Young Deedee DuGay knew everyone at Fort Snelling in the 1830s ...

Now, in Dantes' Inferno, Sylvia is called to Los Angeles from her New Mexico home when a massive explosion blasts through the J. Paul Getty Museum, endangering children on a field trip and claiming two lives. The police peg notorious bomber John Dantes as the mastermind, even though he's in a maximum-security prison, serving a life sentence for another bombing he claims he didn't commit. Dr. Strange, a genius at accessing the most tortured psychiatric cases, is called in to evaluate Dantes. The prisoner is said to be unreachable -- and renowned for psychologically terrorizing his every visitor. But Dr. Strange forms a sudden, and unsettling, connection with Dantes. There's something about the enigmatic loner and his obsession with Los Angeles that both confounds and unnerves her. She's not at all convinced he's the man behind the bombs now ripping through the city -- but she is convinced he holds the key to finding the real bomber. The problem remains: how to get at Dantes? The police department's drug-and-interrogation campaign effectively stupefies the patient, and Dr. Strange's inability to \\"get results\\" troubles her deeply pragmatic supervisor, who in turn challenges her approach, her ability, and her intuition. As the death toll rises, so does public outcry, and sanctions against the fully demonized prisoner are further tightened. With the clock ticking on a bomb promised to be of epic proportions, Dr. Strange's sovereignty over her patient is slipping away -- along with, seemingly, her sanity. Dantes' Inferno is a hypnotic, heart-pounding journey to the soul of madness that reveals disturbing and darkly universal truths about human nature.

Using her well-known pseudonym, Gertrude Barrows Bennett published some of the twentieth century's greatest science fiction stories and novels. The Citadel of Fear, her debut novel, has been recognized as a powerful tale of the lost world genre of adventure and remains central to Stevens' reputation as a pioneering author of fantasy and science fiction. As the Great War rages on, two Irish American prospectors journey across the Mexican desert in search of fortune. Lucky to survive the heat and harsh conditions, they discover a dense jungle rumored to be the home of a lost tribe of Aztecs devoted to the serpent god Quetzalcoatl. Despite their fears, Kennedy and Colin O'Hara remain determined to complete their mission, no matter the cost. Venturing through the darkness of the jungle, they find the underground city of Tlapallam, where a group of assailants takes Kennedy prisoner. Left to return alone through the desert, O'Hara vows to return for his friend. Published at the height of Stevens' career as a popular storyteller in the nation's leading fantasy magazines, The Citadel of Fear is a lost world novel in the tradition of H. Rider Haggard and Edgar Rice Burroughs that continues to entertain and astound over a century after it appeared in print. With a beautifully designed cover and professionally typeset manuscript, this edition of Francis Stevens' The Citadel of Fear is a classic work of American science fiction reimagined for modern readers.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=RL5zzgEACAAJ&dq=The+Citadel+of+Fear&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Isaiah Effect: Decoding the Lost Science of Prayer and Prophecy","description":"Seventeen hundred years ago, key elements of our ancient heritage were lost, relegated to the esoteric traditions of mystery schools and sacred orders. Among the most empowering of the forgotten elements are references to a science with the power to bring everlasting healing to our bodies and initiate an unprecedented era of peace and cooperation between governments and nations. In his groundbreaking new book, The Isaiah Effect, Gregg Braden turns to the Isaiah Scroll, perhaps the most important of the Dead Sea Scrolls discovered in 1946, to offer insight into a powerful form of ancient prayer. In The Isaiah Effect, Braden, author of Awakening to Zero Point and Walking Between the Worlds, combines research in quantum physics with the works of the prophet Isaiah and the ancient Essenes. He demonstrates how prophecies of global catastrophe and suffering may only represent future possibilities, rather than forecast impending doom, and that we have the power to influence those possibilities. In addition to describing multiple futures, the Isaiah texts take us one step further, clearly describing the science of how we choose our futures. Tracing key words of Isaiah's text back to their original language, we discover how he taught a mode of prayer that was lost to the West during Biblical editing in the fourth century. Braden offers detailed accounts of how elements of this mode of prayer have been applied in a variety of situations, ranging from healing life-threatening conditions to entire villages using collective prayer to prevail during the 1998 fires in southern Peru. In each instance, the correlation between the offering of the prayer and a shift of the events in question was beyond coincidence--the prayers had measurable effects! As modern science continues to validate a relationship between our outer and inner worlds, it becomes more likely that a forgotten bridge links the world of our prayers with that of our experience. Each time we engage ourselves, our loved ones, and our communities with Isaiah's life-affirming message of hope, we secure nothing less than our future and the future of the only home we know.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=858MnPizsnkC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Taming the Night","description":"Working on converting an old house into a treatment facility for drug-addicted teenagers, Dr. Summer Lawrence attracts the attention of Chief of Police Brody Hollister, whose skepticism about the project is softened by the doctor's charms.

Until Ira Rutkow s Seeking the Cure, there have been no modern works, either for the lay reader or the physician, that convey the extraordinary story of medicine in the United States. Yet for more than three centuries, the flowering of medicine its triumphal progress from ignorance to science has proven crucial to Americans  under-standing of their country and themselves. Seeking the Cure tells the tale of American medicine with a series of little-known anecdotes that bring to life the grand and unceasing struggle by physicians to shed unsound, if venerated, beliefs and practices and adopt new medicines and treatments, often in the face of controversy and scorn. Rutkow expertly weaves the stories of individual doctors what they believed and how they practiced with the economic, political, and social issues facing the nation. Among the book s many historical personages are Cotton Mather, Benjamin Franklin, George Washington (whose timely adoption of a controversial medical practice probably saved the Continental Army), Benjamin Rush, James Garfield (who was killed by his doctors, not by an assassin s bullet), and Joseph Lister. The book touches such diverse topics as smallpox and the Revolutionary War, the establishment of the first medical schools, medicine during the Civil War, railroad medicine and the beginnings of specialization, the rise of the medical-industrial complex, and the thrilling yet costly advent of modern disease-curing technologies utterly unimaginable a generation ago, such as gene therapies, body scanners, and robotic surgeries. In our time of spirited national debate over the future of American health care amid a seemingly infinite flow of new medical discoveries and pharmaceutical products, Rutkow s account provides readers with an essential historic, social, and even philosophical context. Working in the grand American literary tradition established by such eminent writer-doctors as Oliver Wendell Holmes, William Carlos Williams, Sherwin Nuland, and Oliver Sacks, he combines the historian s perspective with the physician s seasoned expertise. Capacious, learned, and gracefully told, Seeking the Cure will satisfy armchair historians and doctors alike, for, as Rutkow shows, the history of American medicine is a portrait of America itself.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=nk2fVp7Xgn8C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Stealing Beauty","description":"From the acclaimed writer Susan Minot, author of Monkeys, Lust & Other Stories and Folly, and the legendary filmmaker Bernardo Bertolucci, director of Last Tango in Paris, The Last Emperor (winner of nine Academy Awards, including Best Director and Best Picture), The Sheltering Sky, and Little Buddha, comes a hauntingly beautiful film about innocence, seduction, and the pain and pleasures of youth.

It was the Greek and Roman rhetorical theorists who called the attention of later generations to the importance of speech and language. Likewise, when the author of the Fourth Gospel needed a comprehensive metaphor to describe the eternal significance of Jesus Christ, he turned to speech, calling him the Logos -- the Word and Reason of God, through whom the universe was made and by whom it was upheld. What would happen when these two systems of interpreting persuasive language collided -- and yet in some sense converged? To answer that question, this book examines three interpretations of the most universally acknowledged piece of rhetoric in the history of the West, the Sermon on the Mount: from the Latin and Catholic tradition (St Augustine), the Greek and Orthodox tradition (St John Chrysostom), and the Reformation and Protestant tradition (Martin Luther). Each is acknowledged in his tradition as a \\"prince of the pulpit.\\" Together and yet separately, they illuminate both the Sermon and the Speaker for anyone who still takes the challenge of the faith -- and of language -- seriously.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=UNKVsNC4sDkC&dq=Divine+Rhetoric:+The+Sermon+on+the+Mount+As+Message+and+As+Model+in+Augustine,+Chrysostom,+and+Luther&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sightings of the Savior: Meeting Jesus When We Need Him Most","description":"Where can you find Jesus today?

From the 1890s to the 1920s machines and structures shaped by this technology emerged in many forms, from automobiles and harvesting machines to bridges and skyscrapers. The most casual onlooker to American life saw examples of the new technology on Main Street, on the local railway platform, and in the pages of popular magazines. A major consequence of this technology was its effect on the arts, in particular the literary arts. Three prominent American writers of the time -- Ernest Hemingway, John Dos Passos, and William Carlos Williams -- became designer-engineers of the word. Tichi reveals their use of prefabricated, manufactured components in poems and prose. As designers, they enacted in style and structure the new technological values. The writers, according to Tichi, thought of words themselves as objects for assembly into a design. Using materials from magazines, popular novels , movie reviews, the toy industry, and advertising, as well as the texts of the nation's major enduring writers, Tichi shows how turn-of-the-century technology pervaded every aspect of American culture and how this culture could be defined as a collaborative effort of the engineer, the architect, the fiction writer, and the poet. She demonstrates that a technological revolution is not a revolution only of science but of language as well. Originally published in 1987.

In 2012, Dr. Karen King, a star religion professor at Harvard, announced a breathtaking discovery just steps from the Vatican: she'd found an ancient scrap of papyrus in which Jesus calls Mary Magdalene \\"my wife.\\" The mysterious manuscript, which King provocatively titled \\"The Gospel of Jesus's Wife,\\" had the power to topple the Roman Catholic Church. It threatened not just the all-male priesthood, but centuries of sacred teachings on marriage, sex, and women's leadership, much of it premised on the hallowed tradition of a celibate Jesus. Award-winning journalist Ariel Sabar covered King's announcement in Rome but left with a question that no one seemed able to answer: Where in the world did this history-making papyrus come from? Sabar's dogged sleuthing led from the halls of Harvard Divinity School to the former headquarters of the East German Stasi before landing on the trail of a Florida man with an unbelievable past. Could a motorcycle-riding pornographer with a fake Egyptology degree and a prophetess wife have set in motion one of the greatest hoaxes of the century? A propulsive tale laced with twists and trapdoors, Veritas is an exhilarating, globe-straddling detective story about an Ivy League historian and a college dropout--and how they worked together to pass off an audacious forgery as a long-lost piece of the Bible.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=98w5EAAAQBAJ&dq=Veritas&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Pawn in Frankincense: Fourth in the Legendary Lymond Chronicles","description":"Part of Dorothy Dunnett's series that explores the intricacies of 16th-century history through the exploits of the soldier Francis Crawford of Lymond.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=9KuePwAACAAJ&dq=Pawn+in+Frankincense:+Fourth+in+the+Legendary+Lymond+Chronicles&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Little Quack (Classic Board Books)","description":"One by one, four ducklings find the courage to jump into the pond and paddle with Mama Duck, until only Little Quack is left in the nest, trying to be brave.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=HWriAAAAQBAJ&dq=Little+Quack+(Classic+Board+Books)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Esoteric Christianity Or The Lesser Mysteries","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Kp0QAAAAYAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Manual of Acupuncture","description":"A companion to A Manual of Acupuncture, there are 384 durable point reference and study cards covering all 391 of the 14 channel and extra (miscellaneous) points.

'Hitler's favourite commando' acquired a reputation as a man of daring, renowned for his audacious 1943 mission to extricate Mussolini from a mountain-top prison. Skorzeny's influence on special operations doctrine was far-reaching and long-lasting  in 2011, when US Navy SEALs infiltrated Pakistan to eliminate Osama Bin Laden, the operational planning was influenced by Skorzeny's legacy. Yet he was also an egoist who stole other men's credit (including for the seminal rescue of Mussolini), brave and resourceful but also an unrepentant Nazi and a self-aggrandizing hogger of the limelight. Stuart Smith draws on years of in-depth research to uncover the truth about Skorzeny's career and complex personality. From his background as a student radical in Vienna, to his bloody service with the Waffen-SS on the Eastern Front, his surprise rebirth as a commando, and his intriguing post-war career and mysterious fortune, this book tells Otto Skorzeny's story in full  warts and all  for the first time.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=-YhoDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ramage's Diamond","description":"Newly promoted to be the youngest Captain in the Royal Navy, in 1804 Ramage is despatched to blockade the French in Martinique.

Grant, Volume 23: February 1 - December 31, 1872","description":"Notified of his nomination for a second term in June 1872, Ulysses S. Grant accepted, promising \\"the same zeal and devotion to the good of the whole people for the future of my official life, as shown in the past.\\" Challenged by a coalition of disaffected Republicans and Democrats led by New York Tribune editor Horace Greeley, Grant was privately optimistic about his own chances. \\"There has been no time from the Baltimore Convention to this when I have felt the least anxiety. The Soreheads & thieves who have deserted the republican party have strengthened it by their departure.\\" Despite his confidence, Grant found it difficult to ignore attacks against him?attacks that prudence prevented him from answering directly. He found vindication, however, on election day, when he carried all but six states. When Greeley died soon afterward, Grant set aside any bitterness and joined mourners at the New York City funeral. Among the policies that voters tacitly endorsed were Grant's continuing efforts to quell violence in the South, which achieved some success during 1872. He sought as before to support and encourage embattled Southern Republicans, hoping eventually to replace military protection with political legitimacy. On the subject of civil rights, he repeated his desire that blacks receive equal treatment in everyday life, telling a delegation that \\"a ticket on a railroad or other conveyance should entitle you to all that it does other men.\\" Grant also maintained a steady course toward Indians, defending his peace policy when many clamored for harsher measures. \\"I do not believe our Creator ever placed different races of men on this earth with the view of having the stronger exert all his energies in exterminating the weaker.\\" Protestant and Catholic missionaries and laymen continued to spread the twin gospels of religion and civilization among the various tribes. When a Sioux delegation visited the White House, Grant spoke of the future when \\"the game will be gone\\" and of his hope that the Sioux would join other tribes and move to Indian Territory. \\"We would at first build houses for your chiefs and principal men, and . . . send you large herds of cattle and sheep to live upon.\\" Grant's foreign policy in 1872 centered on the Geneva tribunal, established the previous year to arbitrate the thorny dispute with Great Britain over the Alabama Claims. At stake were both the responsibility for past damages and future rules for neutral countries. Grant and Secretary of State Hamilton Fish debated long over the men best suited to present the United States' case. When the tribunal awarded $15.5 million to the United States, Grant and Fish celebrated their greatest foreign policy achievement. Several minor scandals clouded the horizon in 1872, most notably at the New York City customhouse, where influence peddling by former staff aide George K.

I was there, a youngster growing up in the little town. The principal figures of these stories are the newly-arrived Baptist pastor and the most memorable lay woman in the Baptist church. I remember them both with appreciation and fondness.I was ten years old when Bill Wagner came to town as our new pastor, bringing remarkable vitality to a sleepy village church. Life in the Town of Columbia resonated with the cadence of a by-gone era, nearly untouched by the rapidly unfolding modern era.As a pastor myself, now, I have the deepest appreciation for the energy and creativity which Bill Wagner brought to the church in Columbia. My faith and my appreciation for what the church can be grew immeasurable under his able leadership.And, I certainly remember \\"Miss Rossie.\\" Robert and Rossie Purcells' house was two blocks from ours, and our family's milk supply came from the Purcell cows. From age six, it was my privilege to run up the front walk of \\"Miss Rossie's\\" house to pick up the slender-necked glass bottles of milk with the paper stoppers, while my mother waited in the car at the curb.It was at church, though, that Miss Rossie had the largest impact on me. Her considerable physical proportions offered an apt metaphor for the size of her heart and character. She was integrally involved in the work of the church, and, especially, in its missionary education. Loved for her joviality, dedication, and dependability, she was as fine an example of committed Christian discipleship as I have ever known. These stories accurately reflect her strength, wisdom, and grace.Edward B.

He also defined the essence of French landscape design -scientific, rationalist-in counterpoint to the more romantic, naturalistic English tradition and based his work on the then state-of-the-art science of optics and perspective. The castle and gardens at Vaux-le-Vicomte (approximately 50 km south of Paris) were begun in 1653. They are the first great landscape designed by Andr  Le N?tre and mark the beginning of the baroque tradition in gardening. Many of the principles Le N?tre tried and tested at Vaux were later employed to great acclaim at Versailles, which he designed at the height of his career. Vaux-le-Vicomte is among the most popular French public gardens visited by tourists, roughly 50 percent of whom are from English-speaking countries.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=HGRRAAAAMAAJ&dq=Vaux-le-Vicomte+(French+Edition)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Wordsworth Book of First World War Poetry (Wordsworth Poetry) (Wordsworth Poetry Library)","description":"This anthology serves as an introduction to the poetry of World War I, and the inclusion of a number rarely anthologized poets, many from the ranks, as well as anonymous poems and songs, attmepts to bring a quality of freshness to the selection.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=tuZ510vbMfAC&dq=The+Wordsworth+Book+of+First+World+War+Poetry+(Wordsworth+Poetry)+(Wordsworth+Poetry+Library)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The marvelous promises: The miracle of a Chinese Christian doctor : the true life story of modern faith in action through Dr. Chan and Promise, inc","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=kkQKGwAACAAJ&dq=The+marvelous+promises:+The+miracle+of+a+Chinese+Christian+doctor+:+the+true+life+story+of+modern+faith+in+action+through+Dr.+Chan+and+Promise,+inc&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Do You Know That I Love You","description":"Did you know that I love you?

May we eat just anything? Can we do everything with animals, even genetic modification? If not, how can we regulate those processes so that they lead to optimum animal welfare while at the same time producing optimum taste? The production of food also causes environmental pollution  does the fight against hunger have priority over the care of the environment? The care of the environment, animal welfare, and the quality of food should be in a certain harmony, but that is far from granted and hardly easy to achieve. These factors are often in conflict with each other, and a balance will thus need to be searched for. Other factors to take into consideration are the issue of global famine, the care for a farming class that is able to keep its head above water in a decent way, and a fair trade system that does not throw up unnecessary barriers for newcomers or small market participants and that promotes good nutrition. Famine continues to be a widespread phenomenon that violates human rights, causing nearly a billion people to suffer from hunger or malnutrition. At the same time, deliberate hunger, abundance, and obesity are prevalent in the Western world. Both issues refer to the social and cultural aspects of food. Scientific and technological developments like genetic modification and functional food also play an increasingly important role; almost every bite that we take is determined by scientific developments. An extra difficulty is that scientific information is often contradictory, or that it relies on statistical probabilities that are difficult to translate into everyday certitudes. All of these factors deserve attention, but it is the mix that is most important. In the land of food,  either or  does not exist, only  both and . The adequate measure of  both and  serves as the starting point for this philosophical reflection. Before Dinner is a must-read for all people interested in contemporary ethical issues of food, such as university students and researchers of food, agricultural and life sciences, as well as policymakers in these fields, such as members of professional organisations focusing on food and agriculture (f.e., EURSAFE (European Society for Agriculture and Food Ethics), the Agriculture, Food and Human Values Society (USA), and European Federation of Biotechnology).","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=vdMRBwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Terrorism and communism;: A reply to Karl Kautsky (Ann Arbor paperbacks)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=4PcHzQEACAAJ&dq=Terrorism+and+communism%3B:+A+reply+to+Karl+Kautsky+(Ann+Arbor+paperbacks)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"MICO: An Open Source CORBA Implementation","description":"MICO is a complete implementation of CORBA, the dominant standard for distributed application development.

It is with pride that this volume is now put before the public. Together with its predecessors, it is the fruit of a truly international project. Not only does the present volume constitute the first complete synopsis of the large and horticulturally important family Crassulaceae published since the treatment by Berger (1930), but the handbook series as a whole is a landmark in succulent plant literature. The history of the project that eventually led to the publication of the present handbook series was outlined in the Preface to the Monocotyledons Volume, published in the summer of 2001. A short summary of its history will therefore suffice. Handbooks devoted to succulent plants (including cacti) have a long-standing tradition. First treatments covering the family Cactaceae were already published in the 19th century, but the first handbook dealing with the so-called \\"other succulents\\", authored by Hermann Jacobsen, was only published in 1954 - 1955, then called \\"Handbuch der sukkulenten Pflanzen\\". A revised and en larged English edition was published in 1959 and was repeatedly reprinted subsequently.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=nU7mCAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Psychopath's Bible: For the Extreme Individual","description":"\\"Second Edition, Expanded & Revised\\"--cover.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=R3AhAQAAMAAJ&dq=The+Psychopath%27s+Bible:+For+the+Extreme+Individual&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Fighting Pokemon: Machop, Machoke, Machamp","description":"The popular Zoomers \\"TM\\" format has evolved to create the perfect venue for the Pokemon phenomenon.

In this classic introduction to existentialist thought, French philosopher Simone de Beauvoir's The Ethics of Ambiguity simultaneously pays homage to and grapples with her French contemporaries, philosophers Jean-Paul Sartre and Maurice Merleau-Ponty, by arguing that the freedoms in existentialism carry with them certain ethical responsibilities. De Beauvoir outlines a series of \\"ways of being\\" (the adventurer, the passionate person, the lover, the artist, and the intellectual), each of which overcomes the former's deficiencies, and therefore can live up to the responsibilities of freedom. Ultimately, de Beauvoir argues that in order to achieve true freedom, one must battle against the choices and activities of those who suppress it. The Ethics of Ambiguity is the book that launched Simone de Beauvoir's feminist and existential philosophy. It remains a concise yet thorough examination of existence and what it means to be human.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=XrSNtgEACAAJ&dq=The+ethics+of+ambiguity%3B&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Words of Inspiration: A Self-Divination and Healing Method for Awakening your Spiritual-Intuitive Side Using Playing Cards","description":"Words of Inspiration gently guides you in discovering the hidden influences that impact your life on a daily basis.

A searing, post-apocalyptic novel about a father and son's fight to survive, this \\"tale of survival and the miracle of goodness only adds to McCarthy's stature as a living master. It's gripping, frightening and, ultimately, beautiful\\" (San Francisco Chronicle). A father and his son walk alone through burned America. Nothing moves in the ravaged landscape save the ash on the wind. It is cold enough to crack stones, and when the snow falls it is gray. The sky is dark. Their destination is the coast, although they don't know what, if anything, awaits them there. They have nothing; just a pistol to defend themselves against the lawless bands that stalk the road, the clothes they are wearing, a cart of scavenged food and each other. The Road is the profoundly moving story of a journey. It boldly imagines a future in which no hope remains, but in which the father and his son, \\"each the other's world entire,\\" are sustained by love. Awesome in the totality of its vision, it is an unflinching meditation on the worst and the best that we are capable of: ultimate destructiveness, desperate tenacity, and the tenderness that keeps two people alive in the face of total devastation.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=PfmjWho_zOAC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Anything You Can Do...! / Anchor That Man!

When he was twelve, his mom treated him to a flying lesson at the local airfield. Taken on a short flight by an instructor and allowed to operate the controls for part of the flight, he was hooked forever. It wasn't until he was running low on college funds and saw a recruiter at his college that he joined the Marines and began the journey towards his dream from Parris Island to Bravo Company and, then, officer training school. One day at an airfield when President Reagan landed on this way to a fundraiser, Frenchy's life changed forever when encountered HMX1, the squadron that flies the President in Marine One. When he saw the white-topped Sea King and White Hawk helicopters, he was determined to become part of that elite group. Inside Marine One is Col.

Of the twenty-one men who have held the post of secretary of defense since it was created in 1947, only half served more than eighteen months. The first, James Forrestal, committed suicide soon after leaving the Pentagon. Seven of his successors were fired or allowed to resign gracefully after losing the confidence of the president. Many left frustrated and disappointed, while few retained the celebrity and esteem they held while in office. One observer has called the job \\"the graveyard of political ambitions.\\" Charles A. Stevenson, who as a national security adviser to four U.S. senators has seen several defense secretaries in action, examines the unique challenges of this office to learn why the failure rate has been so high. SECDEF focuses on how the secretary performs in the broader world of national security policymaking, how he handles civil-military relations in planning strategy and wars, how he functions on the National Security Council and deals with the president and secretary of state, and how well he performs as a politician, especially in dealing with Congress. In office, Charles Stevenson finds, these men have tended to fall into one of the three general roles for executing such responsibilities: revolutionaries, firefighters, or, the most common role, team players. Stevenson analyzes each type for its defining characteristics and evaluates individual secretaries. This book will appeal to defense professionals and students alike and to readers interested in American defense and foreign policy who want to learn more about the important role often played by the person informally labeled the SECDEF.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=sTSMk46mNvQC&dq=SECDEF:+The+Nearly+Impossible+Job+of+Secretary+of+Defense&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Betrayal: German Churches and the Holocaust","description":"Important and insightful essays provide a penetrating assessment of Christian responses in the Nazi era.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=gmuw9TvbFdUC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"These Lovers Fled Away","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=NkD4ngEACAAJ&dq=These+Lovers+Fled+Away&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ident-A-Kid: The Official Fingerprint Book and Complete Identification Record","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Q8NQAAAACAAJ&dq=Ident-A-Kid:+The+Official+Fingerprint+Book+and+Complete+Identification+Record&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Voyage of the Space Beagle","description":"A re-release of a golden-age classic follows the episodic adventures of a great space ship that explores the far reaches of the galaxy and chronicles their encounters with myriad alien beings, including the Ix, who lay their eggs in human bodies.

The complete story, however, encompasses much more history than that of the battle itself. While several accounts have taken a comprehensive approach to Shiloh, significant gaps still remain in the collective understanding of the battle and battlefield. In The Untold Story of Shiloh, Timothy B. Smith fills in those gaps, looking beyond two days of battle and offering unique insight into the history of unexplored periods and topics concerning the Battle of Shiloh and the Shiloh National Military Park. This collection of essays, some previously unpublished, tackles a diverse range of subjects, including Shiloh's historiography, the myths about the battle that were created, and the mindsets that were established after the battle. The book reveals neglected military aspects of the battle, such as the naval contribution, the climax of the Shiloh campaign at Corinth, and the soldiers' views of the battle. The essays also focus on the Shiloh National Military Park's establishment and continuation with particular emphasis on those who played key roles in its creation. Taken together, the essays tell the overall story of Shiloh in greater detail than ever before. General readers and historians alike will discover that The Untold Story of Shiloh is an important contribution to their understanding of this crucial episode in the Civil War. Timothy B. Smith is on staff at the Shiloh National Military Park. He is author of Champion Hill: Decisive Battle for Vicksburg and This Great Battlefield of Shiloh: History, Memory, and the Establishment of a Civil War National Military Park.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=S2aJif9Ei9oC&dq=The+Untold+Story+of+Shiloh:+The+Battle+and+the+Battlefield&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Handbook of Cheese (Cookery)","description":"In this book, the authors present current research in the study of the production, chemistry and sensory properties of cheese.

Her fellow passengers hitherto disdainful of her company are suddenly more than happy to benefit from her  immoral  trade. But Butterball is a loyal French nationalist, and she refuses to sleep with the enemy. Through the warmth and generosity of his heroine, Maupassant exposes the hypocrisy of the French middle class.

Several months later, she did. And so began a lifetime of travel and a lifelong enchantment with what she saw as the romance of the East, which evolved into a deep understanding of its cultures and people. This vivid and impressionistic series of sketches, her first foray into writing, is an evocative meditation that moves between Persia's heroic past and its long decline; the public face of Tehran and the otherworldly 'secret, mysterious life of the East', the lives of its women, its lush, enclosed gardens; from the bustling cities to the lonely wastelands of Khorasan.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=w8nNwQEACAAJ&dq=Persian+pictures&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Loved By Choice: True Stories That Celebrate Adoption","description":"Loved by Choice offers a clear and uplifting look at adoption from virtually every perspective.

Classical statistics fail to cope well with outliers associated with deviations from standard distributions. Robust statistical methods take into account these deviations when estimating the parameters of parametric models, thus increasing the reliability of fitted models and associated inference. This new, second edition of Robust Statistics: Theory and Methods (with R) presents a broad coverage of the theory of robust statistics that is integrated with computing methods and applications. Updated to include important new research results of the last decade and focus on the use of the popular software package R, it features in-depth coverage of the key methodology, including regression, multivariate analysis, and time series modeling. The book is illustrated throughout by a range of examples and applications that are supported by a companion website featuring data sets and R code that allow the reader to reproduce the examples given in the book. Unlike other books on the market, Robust Statistics: Theory and Methods (with R) offers the most comprehensive, definitive, and up-to-date treatment of the subject. It features chapters on estimating location and scale; measuring robustness; linear regression with fixed and with random predictors; multivariate analysis; generalized linear models; time series; numerical algorithms; and asymptotic theory of M-estimates. Explains both the use and theoretical justification of robust methods Guides readers in selecting and using the most appropriate robust methods for their problems Features computational algorithms for the core methods Robust statistics research results of the last decade included in this 2nd edition include: fast deterministic robust regression, finite-sample robustness, robust regularized regression, robust location and scatter estimation with missing data, robust estimation with independent outliers in variables, and robust mixed linear models. Robust Statistics aims to stimulate the use of robust methods as a powerful tool to increase the reliability and accuracy of statistical modelling and data analysis. It is an ideal resource for researchers, practitioners, and graduate students in statistics, engineering, computer science, and physical and social sciences.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=K5RxDwAAQBAJ&dq=Statistics:+Theory+and+Methods&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Waging Peace: Israel and the Arabs, 1948-2003","description":"Considerably expanded to include the impact of the 2003 war in Iraq and its aftermath, this new edition of Waging Peace provides a unique insight into the critical debate on the future of peace in the Middle East. A former chief negotiator for Israel, noted scholar-diplomat Itamar Rabinovich examines the complete history of Arab-Israeli relations beginning in 1948. He then gives a vivid account of the peace processes of 1992-1996 and the more dispiriting record since then. His updated analysis on Iraq, Ehud Barak, and Ariel Sharon--and on the expanding role of the United States in the Middle East--sheds new light on the long and tumultuous history between Arabs and Jews. As Rabinovich brings the conflict into this century, he widens the scope of his proposals for achieving normalized and peaceful Arab-Israeli relations. While he considers the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians--a classic dispute between two national movements claiming the same land--Rabinovich also studies the broader political, cultural, and increasingly religious conflict between Israel and Arab nationalism and discusses the region in an international context. Rabinovich's firsthand experiences as a negotiator and an ambassador provide an extraordinary perspective on the major players involved. The result is a shrewd assessment of the past and current state of affairs, as well as a hopeful look at the possibilities for a peaceful future.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=bW_yI-MAcCgC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Just Ballin': The Chaotic Rise of the New York Knicks","description":"It's the stuff NBA nightmares are made of. Michael Jordan retires after the most spectacular career in league history; Latrell Sprewell returns after one of the most violent incidents in the long history of player-coach relations; and a nasty lockout threatens to cancel the entire misbegotten season. The NBA had become a dysfunctional family, suddenly low on star power and scoring while high on self-serving players with little use for authority. And the perfect symbol for this new era of chaos was the New York Knicks. In Just Ballin', Mike Wise and Frank Isola take you behind the scenes of an incredible run to the 1999 NBA Finals -- and into a diverse and often divided locker room. Well established as two of the nation's top NBA writers, Wise and Isola examine the Knicks' turbulent and nearly triumphant season. After barely making the playoffs, the Knicks somehow transformed themselves from underachieving malcontents into the least-loved underdog sports has ever seen. Revered in the Big Apple bur reviled throughout the rest of America, this team became a powerful mix of hip-hop icons, aging veterans, and born-again believers. Just Ballin' unravels the curious contradictions: Is Sprewell a coach-choking monster or a misunderstood leader who came to rule Madison Square Garden? Is coach Jeff Van Gundy a fall-in soldier or a master manipulator who cunningly turned public opinion his way? Is franchise center Patrick Ewing an honorable warrior or an albatross who hurts the team with his on-court limitations? In addition, Wise and Isola examine the key issues facing the league as it enters the new millennium: labor problems heightened by escalating salaries, the lack of a suitableambassador following Jordan's departure, a rising influence of urban culture, and racial tension in a league dominated by black players and a white power structure. Not since David Halberstam's The Breaks of the Game has any book provided such an insightful, definitive account of life in and around the NBA's arenas. Just Ballin' takes us to dramatic playoff games and wild practice sessions, on memorable rides aboard team buses and charter planes. From the locker room to the boardroom, from the preseason through the Finals, it tells the unforgettable story of a team that won over New York -- and the ongoing saga of a league still wondering about the shape of its future.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ZawqAAAAYAAJ&dq=Just+Ballin%27:+The+Chaotic+Rise+of+the+New+York+Knicks&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Roll of Thunder, Hear My Cry boxed set","description":"The story of one African-American family fighting to stay together and strong in the face of brutal racist attacks, illness, poverty, and betrayal in the Deep South of the 1930s.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=f4OxeUTj2UkC&dq=Roll+of+Thunder,+Hear+My+Cry+boxed+set&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Tim Hawkinson","description":"The most comprehensive survey of a seminal artist who is legendary within the art world for his endless creativity and ingenuity, and rapidly gaining recognition by the general public.

It is not heaven. Award-winning author N. T. Wright outlines the present confusion about a Christian's future hope and shows how it is deeply intertwined with how we live today. Wright, who is one of today's premier Bible scholars, asserts that Christianity's most distinctive idea is bodily resurrection. He provides a magisterial defense for a literal resurrection of Jesus and shows how this became the cornerstone for the Christian community's hope in the bodily resurrection of all people at the end of the age. Wright then explores our expectation of \\"new heavens and a new earth,\\" revealing what happens to the dead until then and what will happen with the \\"second coming\\" of Jesus. For many, including many Christians, all this will come as a great surprise. Wright convincingly argues that what we believe about life after death directly affects what we believe about life before death. For if God intends to renew the whole creation and if this has already begun in Jesus's resurrection the church cannot stop at \\"saving souls\\" but must anticipate the eventual renewal by working for God's kingdom in the wider world, bringing healing and hope in the present life. Lively and accessible, this book will surprise and excite all who are interested in the meaning of life, not only after death but before it.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=M5df9T6QJjMC&dq=Hope+of+heaven,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Nights with Uncle Remus;: Myths and legends of the old plantation,","description":"\\"Nights With Uncle Remus: Myths and Legends of the Old Plantation\\" by Joel Chandler Harris.

They're good at absorbing and repeating material from sermons, commentaries, and blogs, but they miss the fullness and joy that comes from studying the Bible for themselves. The power to change the world is available, but it goes untapped. Though study aids are helpful, imagine if your primary ministry curriculum was Scripture itself. You could study the Bible, teach people how to study it themselves, and expect those folks to lead their own Bible studies with their neighbors, coworkers, and friends. Each year, you'd see an increasing number of men and women wield the sword of the Spirit, piercing hearts and drawing the lost to Jesus. Ordinary people can learn to study the Bible. These people may not have been to seminary. They don't have much free time. But they love Jesus and want to be more like him. They want to know him. Knowable Word offers a foundation on why and how to study the Bible. Using a running study of the first chapter of Genesis, it illustrates how to observe, interpret, and apply the Scripture-and gives the vision behind each step. It also shows how to read each Bible passage in light of salvation history. But besides being just a how-to on Bible study, it fuels the desire to learn and grow through studying the Scriptures. This book will appeal to three kinds of people: 1. Beginners who love God and his Word 2.Mature Christians who want to improve their Bible study skills 3.Leaders who long not only to teach but also to equip Knowable Word offers what each group needs: a sensible Bible study method. By learning to observe, interpret, and apply, ordinary people will grow extraordinarily close to Jesus Christ as they learn to study his knowable Word.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=WHeHoAEACAAJ&dq=How+to+Read+the+New+Testament&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Social Movements Past and Present Series: Let the People Decide: Neighborhood Organizing in America, Updated Edition (Twayne's Social Movements Past & Present)","description":"\\"Contrary to political myth, community activism did not die out in the 1980s. If anything, it intensified. According to one estimate, the United States is now home to more than 2 million citizen action groups. In this new edition of his classic study, Robert Fisher rounds out his 100-year history of neighborhood organizing in America with an appraisal of those activists and organizations whose pursuit of communal good set them apart during a decade that celebrated the unabashed pursuit of personal wealth.\\" \\"Fisher views the 1980s as an era of practical adaptation for neighborhood organizers. In contrast to the politically charged 1960s and early 1970s, when the predominant philosophy of activism was based on opposition to the established power bases of government and business, the philosophy of 1980s activism was rooted in consensus and moderation: work with those with money and power to get things done. This kind of thinking - which evolved while the neoconservative view of a free-market solution to every social problem dominated policymaking in Washington - encouraged community development corporations: the nuts-and-bolts enterprises now found in cities across the country that rely on government and corporate seed money to develop low-income housing and business activity in economically depressed areas.\\" \\"Throughout the book Fisher concerns himself with the national political and economic backdrops against which neighborhood interests play themselves out. Discussed here are the settlement houses and community centers that thrived during the flush years of the progressive era; the militant tenants' and workers' councils inspired by the Communist and Socialist parties during the lean years of the Great Depression; the Back of the Yards Neighborhood Councils started up during Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal era by Saul Alinsky, widely regarded as the founder of neighborhood organizing; the protectionist suburban neighborhood improvement associations of the cold war years; the radical student organizations and the Great Society programs of the incendiary 1960s; and the new populist organizations of the recessionary 1970s.\\" \\"In this updated edition of Let the People Decide, Fisher's analysis - particularly of the 1980s - is informed by new directions in social movement theory that focus on the increasing emphasis on culture and identity in social activism. What it means to be African-American, Hispanic, female, or homosexual now enters into discussions of fair housing or employment practices as notions of class - long a common bond of community activists - decline.\\" \\"What is needed in the 1990s, say Fisher and other social historians, is for the expedience of the 1980s to be infused with an ideology that encourages oppressed groups to unite. This ideology \\"needs to combine new demands for autonomy and identity with older ones for social justice,\\" Fisher writes, and to foster \\"a spirit of connectedness and solidarity rather than competition.\\" Fisher's assessment of what has worked and what hasn't over the history of community organizing will be instructive for the next generation of activists as they take up the struggle for social change.\\"--BOOK JACKET.Title Summary field provided by Blackwell North America, Inc.

Around ninety of them received death sentences, but the death penalty was confirmed only for the fifteen men considered to be the leaders. All fifteen were executed. Until 1999, official British records of these fifteen trials were kept a close secret, and in 2001 further material was released, including the trial of Countess Markievicz and important evidence about the shoot to kill tactics used by the British Army. These records, the subject of heated speculation and propaganda for over eighty years, are clearly presented in this important new edition of From Behind a Closed Door, containing previously unpublished material from archive sources, such as the Bureau of Military History witness statements. The complete transcripts are all revealed, together with fascinating photographs of the Rising, the fifteen leaders and the key British players. Brian Barton incisive commentary explains the context of the trials and the motivations of the leaders, providing an invaluable insight into what went on behind closed doors at a defining moment in Irish history.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=OVITDQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Rights and wrongs in the Arab-Israeli conflict: To the anatomy of the forces of progress and reaction in the Middle East","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=X65AAAAAIAAJ&dq=Rights+and+wrongs+in+the+Arab-Israeli+conflict:+To+the+anatomy+of+the+forces+of+progress+and+reaction+in+the+Middle+East&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Tarka the otter: His joyful water-life and death in the Two Rivers","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=AV1QswEACAAJ&dq=Tarka+the+otter:+His+joyful+water-life+and+death+in+the+Two+Rivers&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Tortilla flat, (The Modern library of the world's best books [216.1])","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=cFdYQYq0hp8C&dq=Tortilla+flat,+(The+Modern+library+of+the+world%27s+best+books+%5B216.1%5D)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Twenty and Ten","description":"Twenty school children hide ten Jewish children from the Nazis during the occupation of France during World War II.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=T-OaPAAACAAJ&dq=Twenty+and+Ten&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Goya and the Duchess of Alba (Pegasus Library)","description":"The story of the relationship between Goya and the Duchess of Alba is shrouded in mystery and secrecy, and has captured the imaginations of authors since the middle of the 19th century. It is not only Goya's artistic crisis, which began with his traumatic illness in 1792-93 in Cadiz, and the creation of his famous \\"Caprichos\\" series, but also his affair with the Duchess of Alba that make the period in Goya's life between 1790 and 1800 so intriguing. But what do we know about this love affair, which continues to fascinate us today? Did it actually take place, or was it merely a rumor? What really happened? How is it documented? And what sort of woman was the Duchess of Alba, who, according to a romantic version of the story, nearly drove Goya out of his senses? If we rely on contemporary accounts, her life consisted largely of gossip, illicit love affairs, and all conceivable breaks with social conventions. We would know very little about this woman today had she not encountered Francisco de Goya. Susann Waldmann investigates these and other events by examining various contemporary documents, letters from Goya to his friends, and numerous anecdotes, unfolding a sensational turn of events full of suspense.

For years, no remedy--not orthodontia, not the escalating threats of his father, Mike, a washed-out linebacker turned sporting goods entrepreneur, not the noxious cayenne pepper-based Suk-No-Mor--can cure Justin's thumbsucking habit.Then a course of hypnosis seemingly does the trick, but true to the conservation of neurotic energy, the problem doesn't so much disappear as relocate. Sex, substance abuse, speech team, fly-fishing, honest work, even Mormonism--Justin throws himself into each pursuit with a hyperactive energy that even his daily Ritalin dose does little to blunt.Each time, however, he discovers that there is no escaping the unruly imperatives of his self and the confines of his deeply eccentric family. The only \\"cure\\" for the adolescent condition is time and distance.Always funny, sometimes hilariously so, occasionally poignant, and even disturbing, deeply wise on the vexed subject of fathers and sons, Walter Kirn's Thumbsucker is an utterly fresh and all-American take on the painful process of growing up.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=mdKjGwyy2ZMC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Love Fights Volume 1","description":"All I ever wanted was to be a female fighter.

In 1988 Newsweek headlined the startling discovery that everyone alive on the earth today can trace their maternal DNA back to one woman who lived in Africa 150,000 years ago. It was thought that modern humans populated the world through a series of migratory waves from their African homeland. Now an even more radical view has emerged, that the members of just one group are the ancestors of all non-Africans now alive, and that this group crossed the mouth of the Red Sea a mere 85,000 years ago. It means that not only is every person on the planet descended from one African 'Eve' but every non-African is related to a more recent Eve, from that original migratory group. This is a revolutionary new theory about our origins that is both scholarly and entertaining, a remarkable account of the kinship of all humans.

Journal of Modern History  Stoler presents a groundbreaking work that emanates from her empirical investigations of the European colonial experiences in Asia of the 19th and early 20th centuries. At the same time, she engages with cutting-edge discussions advanced by postcolonial theorists in recent years. By introducing the issues of race, sexuality, and intimacy into the study of colonialism, or the interactions of Europeans with the indigenous populations in their households and in their personal or sex lives, Stoler offers a fresh look at the European colonial experience, in which the line between the colonizers and the colonized becomes significantly blurred. This 'blurring,' or hybridity, is, of course, an important issue in postcolonial theory, yet Stoler's presentation reveals that this hybridity is not only a theoretical question, but also (though largely absent from the extant scholarship) a reflection of historical reality. Stoler shows that hybridization took place at the personal, quotidian level, where the Europeans interacted actively with the natives, and in the economic arena, where impoverished Europeans were forced to compete with locals for a good living in 'their' colonies. An eye-opening book . Highly recommended.  Choice  Carnal Knowledge and Imperial Power is a compelling text, its dense analysis made accessible and almost visceral by the historical ethnography and scholarly detail the book offers a rich and intricate account of the imperial project at work and strikes a difficult balance between theory, history, and ethnography in its analysis.

Davis, a sociologist as well, uses his dual background to demonstrate that current treatment of domestic violence abuses is ineffective. A must read for all police officers, criminologists, and citizens who care about finding a successful solution to this issue. Ann W. Burgess, Chair of the Panel on Research on Violence Against Women, established by the National Research Council in 1995 at the request of congress writes that, Since the mid 1970s the body of research on violence against women has grown, yet misinformation abounds, and we seem little closer to ending violence against women now than 20 years ago. This book proposes that continuing to rely on the criminal justice system as the remedy for domestic violence is irresponsible and illogical public policy. This nation remains incapable of framing a coherent, consistent, or understandable criminal justice procedure that has effectively prevented domestic violence. Arrest without proper sanctions or proper supervision of abusers and the issuance of civil restraining orders without valid programs in place to assist the victims of abuse are predestined to failure. Current policies that provide for reactive intervention in domestic violence incidents must be replaced by policies that address the cause of domestic violence rather than simply treating its symptoms. This book explains why the criminal justice system can not prevent domestic violence and what the proper role of the criminal justice system should be. To prevent domestic violence we must concentrate on educational programs and policies that provide for alteration of our social and cultural patterns of behavior that foster this form of abuse. The formula to prevent or curb the continued escalation of domestic violence is available to women by means of our democratic process. Women can challenge the thousands of years of male domination politically, economically and socially by taking public office. The instrumentality to curb what goes on behind the closed doors of our homes and the mechanism to challenge what goes on behind the closed mahogany doors of Capitol Hill are one and the same. The illusory goal of equality of gender, equality and sameness are not synonymous, should be exchanged for a goal of an equity of conduct and a comportment of behavior that provides for fairness and frankness towards one another and a renewed respect for each other.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=0mHlQoL82BAC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mountie Makers: Putting the Canadian in RCMP","description":"Bob Teather entered RCMP Basic Recruit Training three decades ago with no idea of what he was getting into. Along with 31 other confused young men, he found himself in Regina, Saskatchewan, as a lowly member of Troop 18.

Corporal Teather s story brings you close to six recruits from across the country Prairie Dog, Andr , Lumchuck, Francois, weird Harold Burl and Teather himself, a scrawny kid from Hamilton who often learned the hard way that  if it hurts you just tape an aspirin to it.  Their experiences capture the essence of Canada and provide revealing aspects of the traditional RCMP training process. Near the end of his active career, Bob came to realize that it was Basic Training that put the Canadian in his RCMP and that bonds its members into a force capable of policing this complex country.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=XEhYOWiFjPkC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dictionary of Dreams: Interpretation and Understanding","description":"This work takes 1000 key words and using a game of 24 cards, offers almost 3500 possible dream interpretations.

That process was more contested and gradual in Yucatan than in any other Mexican region, and this close examination of the Yucatan experience sheds light on an issue of particular relevance to students of Central America, South America s southern cone, and other postcolonial societies: the capacity of national oligarchies to  hang on  in the face of escalating social change, the outbreak of local rebellions, and the mobilization of multiclass coalitions. Latin American historiography has generally failed to integrate the study of popular movements and rebellions with examinations of the determined efforts of elite establishments to prevent, contain, crush, and, ultimately, ideologically appropriate such rebellions. Most often, these problems are treated separately. This volume seeks to redress this imbalance by probing a set of linkages that is central to the study of Mexico s modern past: the complex, reciprocal relationship between modes of contestation and structures and discourses of power.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=zRp1twTYSYAC&dq=Summer+of+Discontent,+Seasons+of+Upheaval:+Elite+Politics+and+Rural+Insurgency+in+Yucatan,+1876-1915&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The song of our Syrian guest,","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=LjKx_WBHV1wC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"St. Vrain's expedition to the Gila in 1826","description":"Unlike some other reproductions of classic texts (1) We have not used OCR(Optical Character Recognition), as this leads to bad quality books with introduced typos.

(Spirituality & Practice). Written for spiritual seekers who deal with unenlightened coworkers and inconsiderate bank tellers more often than Zen masters and Tibetan monks, this book demonstrates the practical side of Buddhism. Author Franz Metcalf shows how to weave simple vows, quick rethinks, instant relaxations, fast visualizations, and many other stripped-down Buddhist practices into every area of life. Individually, Metcalf s techniques work as quick fixes for specific dilemmas, but woven together, they gradually strengthen one s spiritual base when one day a habitual way of being has been quietly transformed. While not written to impress pure Buddhists, this book takes Buddhism seriously. Approachable sections on Buddhism s rich tradition and a sprinkling of quotes from ancient scripture and contemporary teachers connect the book s practices to the deeper wisdom underlying them. Always, Just Add Buddha! remains squarely focused on daily life, drawing out the most practical aspects of Buddhism.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=UckQ6mhaiTwC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Going Lobstering (Outdoor Adventures)","description":"One beautiful day at the beach, Linda and Erik see a lobsterman pulling up traps.

Lansdale (1908--1987) was a Cold War celebrity. A former advertising executive turned undercover CIA agent, he was credited during the 1950s with almost single-handedly preventing a communist takeover of the Philippines and with helping to install Ngo Dinh Diem as president of the American-backed government of South Vietnam. Adding to his notoriety, during the Kennedy administration Lansdale was put in charge of Operation Mongoose, the covert plot to overthrow the government of Cuba's Fidel Castro by assassination or other means. In this book, Jonathan Nashel reexamines Lansdale's role as an agent of American Cold War foreign policy and takes into account both his actual activities and the myths that grew to surround him. In contrast to previous portraits, which tend to depict Lansdale either as the incarnation of U.S. imperialist ambitions or as a farsighted patriot dedicated to the spread of democracy abroad, Nashel offers a more complex and nuanced interpretation. At times we see Lansdale as the arrogant \\"ugly American,\\" full of confidence that he has every right to make the world in his own image and utterly blind to his own cultural condescension. This is the Lansdale who would use any conceivable gimmick to serve U.S. aims, from rigging elections to sugaring communist gas tanks. Elsewhere, however, he seems genuinely respectful of the cultures he encounters, open to differences and new possibilities, and willing to tailor American interests to Third World needs. Rather than attempting to reconcile these apparently contradictory images of Lansdale, Nashel explores the ways in which they reflected a broader tension within the culture of Cold War America. The result is less a conventional biography than an analysis of the world in which Lansdale operated and the particular historical forces that shaped him -- from the imperatives of anticommunist ideology and the assumptions of modernization theory to the techniques of advertising and the insights of anthropology.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=MXSIAAAAMAAJ&dq=Edward+Lansdale%27s+Cold+War+(Culture,+Politics,+and+the+Cold+War)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"In the Footsteps of William Wallace","description":"A superbly illustrated journey through the landscape and events of the life of the iconic Scottish knight who was brought to life in the film Braveheart For nearly 700 years debate has raged over the true nature of William Wallace and his role in Scotland's turbulent history was he the Braveheart of Blind Harry's legendary account, the bold, but savage, hero of the Scottish wars, or, as some contemporary chroniclers attested, was he nothing but a villainous thief and vagrant fugitive? This book draws on a wide range of contemporary and modern sources to look behind the figure of legend to find Wallace's true character. It traces Wallace's journey from his modest upbringing in south-west Scotland and his first victory as a \\"guerilla\\" leader and military commander at Stirling Bridge to his painful death seven years later, including his \\"invasion\\" of Northumberland and Cumberland.

He maintains that we cannot get clear about ethics until we get clear about human nature. So these are the sorts of questions he addresses: Why do we behave as we do? Can we improve? Is our ethics at war with our passions, or is it an upshot of those passions? Blackburn seeks the answers in an exploration of guilt, shame, disgust, and other moral emotions; he draws also on game theory and cognitive science in his account of the structures of human motivation. Many philosophers have wanted a naturalistic ethics a theory that integrates our understanding of human morality with the rest of our understanding of the world we live in. What is special about Blackburn's naturalistic ethics is that it does not debunk the ethical by reducing it to the non-ethical. At the same time he banishes the spectres of scepticism and relativism that have haunted recent moral philosophy.

The break-up of Agatha's first marriage to Archibald Christie and her subsequent ten-day disappearance had made headline news. Feeling hunted and wounded by the press, Christie determined never again to let them into her private life. Instead she developed a public persona - seemingly tongue-tied and dull - which ensured the journalists and the public would let her be. This successful strategy helped to account for a happy second marriage and family life as well as an astonishing literary productivity. Skillfully weaving the details of Christie's life with the plots and characters of her mystery novels, Gillian Gill uncovers the flesh-and-blood woman behind the popular and celebrated Marple-like image, and establishes Agatha Christie as a unique and determined person whose fictional creations sparked the imagination of millions around the world.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=5k8mEAAAQBAJ&dq=Agatha+Christie:+The+Woman+and+Her+Mysteries&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"My Years With Xerox: the Billions Nobody Wanted","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=WhgHnwEACAAJ&dq=My+Years+With+Xerox:+the+Billions+Nobody+Wanted&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Rolfing: Stories of Personal Empowerment","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=JWHXAAAACAAJ&dq=Rolfing:+Stories+of+Personal+Empowerment&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Treasure Hunt (Advanced Dungeons and Dragons Module N4)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=CfvVoAEACAAJ&dq=Treasure+Hunt+(Advanced+Dungeons+and+Dragons+Module+N4)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"I Asked For Wonder: A Spiritual Anthology","description":"The excerpts in this book have been grouped around the major themes of Heschel's spiritual vision, God, Prayer, Sabbath, Religion, and so on.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=6VcqAAAAYAAJ&dq=I+Asked+For+Wonder:+A+Spiritual+Anthology&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Early American Steam Locomotives","description":"Relive train travel's earliest days with this splendidly illustrated story of steam locomotion, from \\"teakettles\\" to \\"titans.\\" Working from builders' specifications, old engravings, and contemporaneous accounts, the author re-creates, in accurate renderings, the earliest locomotives.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=WAHCAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Near Horizons: The Story of an Insect Garden","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=9Y1fuAAACAAJ&dq=Near+Horizons:+The+Story+of+an+Insect+Garden&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Media Economics: Concepts and Issues (Commtext Series)","description":"The media of Western Europe and the US are for the most part capitalist ventures, operated by private parties for the purpose of generating profit, and are thus subject to the operational principles of the market system.

The focus is on two main topics: the negative role of instruments in ancient cult music; and the development of ecclesiastical song in early Christianity. Presented in this book are 16 articles written by the author over a period of 30 years. They span two millenia in their coverage, ranging from classical Greece and ancient Israel to the late 15th-century Flanders and Spain. Liturgical music in some form or another is the theme that binds them together, and two topics in particular are focused on: the negative role that instruments play in ancient cult music; and the development of ecclesiastical song in early Christianity. For the negative role of instruments, a series of articles treats classical Greek ethical notions of instruments, the status of instruments in temple and synagogue and the absence of instruments from early Christian and medieval Church music. The second focus - that of the development of ecclesiastical song - is dealt with in several studies that trace the psalmody and hymnody of the Christian tradition from its roots in Judaism to the origins of Gregorian chant in 7th-century Rome. The articles rely strongly on the writings of the Christian Church Fathers, such as Augustine, Basil and John Crystostom.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=PI1wQgAACAAJ&dq=The+Fathers+of+the+Western+Church&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Masterpieces from the Pushkin Museum of Fine Arts/Moscow","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=3VqeswEACAAJ&dq=Masterpieces+from+the+Pushkin+Museum+of+Fine+Arts/Moscow&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Legacy (The Lavette Saga, No. 4)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Ie8IoJvyQawC&dq=The+Legacy+(The+Lavette+Saga,+No.+4)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Waisted Efforts: An Illustrated Guide to Corset Making","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=_cJvQgAACAAJ&dq=Waisted+Efforts:+An+Illustrated+Guide+to+Corset+Making&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Martini's Atlas Of The Human Body","description":"The Atlas offers an abundant collection of anatomy photographs, radiology scans, and embryology summaries, helping students visualize structures and become familiar with the types of images seen in a clinical setting.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=cSYVngEACAAJ&dq=Martini%27s+Atlas+Of+The+Human+Body&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Disorder in the Court: Great Fractured Moments in Courtroom History","description":"In America's courtooms, the verdict is laughter.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=dP24f8-HTlEC&dq=Disorder+in+the+Court:+Great+Fractured+Moments+in+Courtroom+History&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"1000 Years of Irish Poetry: The Gaelic and Anglo Irish Poets from Pagan Times to the Present","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ri94AAAAIAAJ&dq=1000+Years+of+Irish+Poetry:+The+Gaelic+and+Anglo+Irish+Poets+from+Pagan+Times+to+the+Present&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Alienation:Marx's Conception of Man in Capitalist Society","description":"Revised throughout with an entirely new chapter, \\"In Defense of Internal Relations,\\" and with replies to critical comments on the 1st edition, which the N.Y.

Is its proper Christian purpose to save souls, or to transform the social order? This question is especially fraught when the church is one built by an enslaved people and formed, from its beginning, at the center of an oppressed community s fight for personhood and freedom. Such is the central tension in the identity and mission of the black church in the United States. For decades the black church and black theology have held each other at arm s length. Black theology has emphasized the role of Christian faith in addressing racism and other forms of oppression, arguing that Jesus urged his disciples to seek the freedom of all peoples. Meanwhile, the black church, even when focused on social concerns, has often emphasized personal piety rather than social protest. With the rising influence of white evangelicalism, biblical fundamentalism, and the prosperity gospel, the divide has become even more pronounced. In The Divided Mind of the Black Church, Raphael G. Warnock, Senior Pastor of the historic Ebenezer Baptist Church, the spiritual home of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., traces the historical significance of the rise and development of black theology as an important conversation partner for the black church. Calling for honest dialogue between black and womanist theologians and black pastors, this fresh theological treatment demands a new look at the church s essential mission.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=i9baDwAAQBAJ&dq=Piety&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dictionary of Premillennial Theology: A Practical Guide to the People, Viewpoints, and History of Prophetic Studies","description":"More than 50 scholars combine their expertise to present a historical and topical dictionary of premillennial theology.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=rPeo38M2d9UC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Jew and Palestine in Prophecy","description":"IT WOULD be hazardous for anyone to attempt to predict the future of the United States, Great Britain or any of the great nations of today, but one who knows his Bible can predict, in considerable detail, the future of the Jewish people. From beginning to end, this people has had its history already written, and in our day its movements furnish a key with which we may unlock the meaning of world events. Who now doubts that the World War was fought to open the way for the Jew to return to the Holy Land, after long centuries of absence from home? Who doubts that the Great War marked the beginning of the end of the times of the Gentiles? The political world is in a state of utter confusion today. The economic world is a hopeless tangle. Rulers and statesmen in every nation are puzzled and fearful, making a desperate effort to be optimistic. In the midst of all this confusion and uncertainty, we find the Jewish question occupying the front pages of the papers day after day, and in diplomatic circles and halls of government, men are debating over the question of what is to be done about the Jew. Some insist that the Jew is the cause of all humanity s ills, and give themselves vigorously to the work of spreading propaganda that must ultimately result in open persecution and bloodshed. There are Christians who seem to understand prophecy as teaching that we may expect the Jew, in this age, to enslave the Gentiles and gain a stranglehold upon all nations. There is a pitifully small number who seek to expose the fantastic stories of the Jew-haters and to stem the rising tide of anti-Semitism. Nations affected by Hitlerism, seek to drive the Jews out and at the same time use their best efforts to keep them from getting into Palestine, or to stir up the enmity of the Arabs against those Jews who already have gained entrance to the land. Thus the Jew is everywhere talked about, much lied about, little prayed about. Those who have no knowledge of prophecy foresee the time of  Jacob s trouble  around the corner. The discerning Bible student knows that the Jews must remain the  tail of the nations  until the millennial age, and see no Scriptural warrant for the fear that designing Jews are shortly to plunge the world into a depression which will place all Gentiles at their mercy. The Author s earnest prayer is that these chapters may open the eyes of many to the spiritual peril of participation in the persecution of the Jews. God grant that many shall be stirred to  pray for the peace of Jerusalem  and to show every kindness  to the least of these,  our Lord s brethren according to the flesh, in this hour when they are feeling the birth pains of the nation that is yet to be.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=NsLwCwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"From Johnson's Kids to Lemonade Opera: The American Classical Singer Comes of Age","description":"Until the first half of the twentieth century, American opera singers were considered to be inferior to their foreign counterparts, until the upheaval of World War II led a generation of performers to seize their destiny, an odyssey charted in a fascinating chronicle of an American musical legacy.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=k3165uj1pxUC&dq=From+Johnson%27s+Kids+to+Lemonade+Opera:+The+American+Classical+Singer+Comes+of+Age&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Pulmonary Pathology, Second Edition","description":"Now fully revised to include recent advances in the field, the second edition of Pulmonary Pathology, a volume in the Foundations in Diagnostic Pathology series, is an essential foundation text for residents and pathologists.

Old Testament Series, 11)","description":"Several of the ways and cultures that the Bible privileges or denounces slip by unnoticed. When those the privileged and the denounced are not examined, they fade into and hide in the blind spots of the Bible. This collection of essays engages some of the subjects who face dispersion (physical displacement that sparks ideological bias) and othering (ideologies that manifest in social distancing and political displacement). These include, among others, the builders of Babel, Samaritans, Melchizedek, Jezebel, Judith, Gomer, Ruth, slaves, and mothers. In addition to considering the drive to privilege or denounce, the contributors also attend to subjects ignored because the Bible s blind spots are not examined. These include planet Earth, indigenous Australians, Palestinians, Dalits, minjungs, battered women, sexual-abuse victims, religious minorities, mothering men, gays, and foreigners. This collection encourages interchanges and exchanges between dispersion and othering, and between the Bible and context. It flows in the currents of postcolonial and gendered studies, and closes with a script that stages a biblical character at the intersection of the Bible s blind spots and modern readers  passions and commitments.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=VyhMEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Argument Without End: In Search of Answers to the Vietnam Tragedy","description":"The former Secretary of Defense, and leading scholars from the U.S. and Vietnam, offer a groundbreaking new study of exactly how the Vietnam War happened-- and why it could not be stopped before three million people died.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=6OlPmAEACAAJ&dq=Argument+Without+End:+In+Search+of+Answers+to+the+Vietnam+Tragedy&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Gift of Miracles: Experiencing God's Extraordinary Power in Your Life","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=vvV_swEACAAJ&dq=The+Gift+of+Miracles:+Experiencing+God%27s+Extraordinary+Power+in+Your+Life&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Only in the Meantime & Office Poems","description":"Poetry.

On every page I learned something new. Read it every night if you want to restore your faith in our country.\\"  James Mattis, General, U.S. Marines (ret.) & 26th Secretary of Defense The Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist and #1 New York Times bestselling author offers a revelatory new book about the founding fathers, examining their educations and, in particular, their devotion to the ancient Greek and Roman classics and how that influence would shape their ideals and the new American nation. On the morning after the 2016 presidential election, Thomas Ricks awoke with a few questions on his mind: What kind of nation did we now have? Is it what was designed or intended by the nation s founders? Trying to get as close to the source as he could, Ricks decided to go back and read the philosophy and literature that shaped the founders  thinking, and the letters they wrote to each other debating these crucial works among them the Iliad, Plutarch s Lives, and the works of Xenophon, Epicurus, Aristotle, Cato, and Cicero. For though much attention has been paid the influence of English political philosophers, like John Locke, closer to their own era, the founders were far more immersed in the literature of the ancient world. The first four American presidents came to their classical knowledge differently. Washington absorbed it mainly from the elite culture of his day; Adams from the laws and rhetoric of Rome; Jefferson immersed himself in classical philosophy, especially Epicureanism; and Madison, both a groundbreaking researcher and a deft politician, spent years studying the ancient world like a political scientist. Each of their experiences, and distinctive learning, played an essential role in the formation of the United States. In examining how and what they studied, looking at them in the unusual light of the classical world, Ricks is able to draw arresting and fresh portraits of men we thought we knew. First Principles follows these four members of the Revolutionary generation from their youths to their adult lives, as they grappled with questions of independence, and forming and keeping a new nation. In doing so, Ricks interprets not only the effect of the ancient world on each man, and how that shaped our constitution and government, but offers startling new insights into these legendary leaders.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=-hrQDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Last Battle","description":"SOON TO BE A MAJOR MOTION PICTURE The incredible story of the unlikeliest battle of World War II, when a small group of American soldiers joined forces with German soldiers to fight off fanatical SS troops May, 1945.

He draws distinctions between the different Europes - geographic Europe, the European Union, 'Security Europe' (based around NATO) and the emerging 'Civil Europe'.

However, none satisfactorily explain why the Japanese lost that battle, given their overwhelming advantage in firepower. While no book may ever silence debate on the subject, Midway Inquest answers the central mystery of the battle. Why could the Japanese not get a bomber strike launched against the American carrier force before being attacked and destroyed by American dive bombers from the Enterprise and Yorktown? Although it is well known that the Japanese were unable to launch an immediate attack because their aircraft were in the process of changing armament, why wasn't the rearming operation reversed and an attack launched before the American planes arrived? Based on extensive research in Japanese primary records, Japanese literature on the battle, and interviews with over two dozen Japanese veterans from the carrier air groups, this book solves the mystery at last.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=lOUPxsGwRLcC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Captains: Bk.2","description":"Captain Picard recounts his secret mission to rescue a former Starfleet officer who had disappeared while searching for the legendary treasure trove known as Dujonian's hoard","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=KmbDFZkmKggC&dq=The+Captains:+Bk.2&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Domino 5 Web Programming with XML, Java, and JavaScript","description":"With all the latest information about Domino Designer technologies, this book shows how to program client interfaces with the Domino Designer.

With the original 1987 publication of Ain't No Makin' It, Jay MacLeod brought us to the Clarendon Heights housing project where we met the 'Brothers' and the 'Hallway Hangers'. Their story of poverty, race, and defeatism moved readers and challenged ethnic stereotypes. MacLeod's return eight years later, and the resulting 1995 revision, revealed little improvement in the lives of these men as they struggled in the labor market and crime-ridden underground economy. The third edition of this classic ethnography of social reproduction brings the story of inequality and social mobility into today's dialogue. Now fully updated with thirteen new interviews from the original Hallway Hangers and Brothers, as well as new theoretical analysis and comparison to the original conclusions, Ain't No Makin' It remains an admired and invaluable text.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=FHhQDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Book of Two Halves: Football Short Stories","description":"Contributors include:Stephen Baxter, Geoff Dyer, Maureen Freely, John Hegley, Geoff Nicholson, Tim Pears, Iain Sinclair, Irvine Welsh'A Book of Two Halves stands out as one of the most incisive and witty books on the game to come out in the last few years...a collection of quality tales about life's highs and lows inspired by the game we love' 90 Minutes'Reading A Book of Two Halves is like going to watch Newcastle when you're used to Northampton Town.

During this season the Church reads consecutively from the Acts of the Apostles, recounting the external life of the Church after Pentecost. The accompanying readings from the Gospel according to John portray the internal life of Christian disciples and promise a coming Paraclete to be sent by the Father. Father Brown's title A Once-and-Coming Spirit signifies these two great biblical sources that he reflects on. He shows how these readings speak to our time as we live out the external history of a visible Church while internally drawing life from Jesus as branches on the vine.

Much like in real life, it is simply a magazine that is delivered in a digital form. Most of the E-zines today are targeted towards Internet distribution and is meant to promote a website. Normally, an E-zine usually caters to a particular niche or topic. It could be anything from 'How to make money online' to 'How to train your pet'. E-zines are distributed to their subscribers normally through e-mail. Normally people send E-zines to be published on a consistent, pre-planned basis. For example, an e-mail will be sent out every day, every three days, weekly, biweekly or monthly. These E-zines are distributed using an autoresponder. An autoresponder is programmed for every subscriber to receive the e-mails in a chronological format in a sequential order. This is the biggest difference between an E-zine and its offline counterpart. An E-zine can send previous issues anytime regardless of when the subscriber has opted in to the E-zine. The autoresponder will do its job of follow-up from the day the subscriber has opted in and will follow through until its 'run' is exhausted. Today, the majority of E-zines are website driven. It would be a surprising fact to know that the first E-zines were delivered on an electronic format such as CD-ROM and delivered to the subscriber's house by mail. That was in the 'stone age' when the power of e-mails and autoresponders were not realized yet. But now, the majority of the formats stick with e-mails or they send out notifications (or updates) in conjunction with websites or blogs. The e-mail usually contains the issue itself or a summarized format that ultimately links back to the original website for the main cheese.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=LsJ4DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Stanton: Lincoln's Secretary of War","description":"\\"Of the crucial men close to President Lincoln, Secretary of War Edwin Stanton (1814-1869) was the most powerful and controversial.

The rise of childless women is one of the most overlooked and under-appreciated social issues of our time. Never previously have more women lived longer before having their first child or remained childless toward the end of their fertility. In the U.S., the level of childlessness of women age forty to forty-four has doubled, from 10 percent in 1976 to 20 percent in 2006. Society assumes that women either are mothers or choose not to be mothers, but waiting for love and marriage or at least a committed union before embarking on motherhood seems to be the least acceptable life choice for the modern woman. Nearly half of North American women of childbearing age are childless,a steep rise from 35 percent in 1976. Nevertheless, childless women are perceived as the exception, not the norm. In Otherhood, Melanie Notkin explores this modern phenomenon to understand the reasons for this shift, the social and emotional impact of childlessness, and how this  new normal  will impact social structures in the decades to come. Part anecdotal storytelling, part inspirational, part reportage, and part manifesto, Otherhood sets out to get to the heart of the issues, enliven the societal consciousness, and trigger conversation.

By 1930 more than two million people lived in such towns, dotted across an industrial frontier which stretched from Lowell, Massachusetts, through Torrance, California to Norris, Tennessee. Margaret Crawford focuses on the transformation of company town construction from the vernacular settlements of the late eighteenth century to the professional designs of architects and planners one hundred and fifty years later. Eschewing a static architectural approach which reads politics, history, and economics through the appearance of buildings, Crawford portrays the successive forms of company towns as the product of a dynamic process, shaped by industrial transformation, class struggle, and reformers  efforts to control and direct these forces.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=5aCG17xAfTwC&dq=Building+the+Workingman%27s+Paradise:+The+Design+of+American+Company+Towns+(Haymarket)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"THE LOUISA MAY ALCOTT COOKBOOK","description":"Recipes based on the dishes mentioned in \\"Little Women\\" and \\"Little Men\\" and recreated from nineteenth-century cookbooks by the nine-year-old author.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=MUJ5GwAACAAJ&dq=THE+LOUISA+MAY+ALCOTT+COOKBOOK&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The 201 Best Things Ever Said!","description":"The famous and infamous offer the most profound, pithy and powerful words in this classic collection of quotes and illustrations.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=6gFctAEACAAJ&dq=The+201+Best+Things+Ever+Said!&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Kaleidoskop: Kultur, Literatur Und Grammatik","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=3XRnPwAACAAJ&dq=Kaleidoskop:+Kultur,+Literatur+Und+Grammatik&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Simplicity and Success: Creating the Life You Long For","description":"I would not give a fig for the simplicity this side of complexity, but I would give my life for the simplicity on the other side of complexity. Oliver Wendell Holmes. Crafting a simple life would be easy if getting rid of stress and clutter was all that simplicity seekers sought, but it isn't; we alos seek success. We long to create results that matter in our lives, work, and relationships. However, by defining simplicity as a solution to life's stress and complexity, many approaches point us toward relief rather than results. Because relief is usually temporary, we often oscillate between simplicity and success without realizing either. At best, the simplicity we achieve is the simplicity on this side of complexity. Simplicity and Success: Creating the Life You Long For will help you go beyond merely getting rid of what you don't want. It will help you discover what you love and create a life that shows it. It will help you integrate conflicting desires by shifting your focus from solving problems to creating what matters. It will empower you to embrace life's complexity, appreciate its richness, and move through its often chaotic \\"messiness\\" to the deep, lasting and fulfilling simplicity on the other side of complexity. Driven by vision, grounded in reality, and focused on results that matter, this simple yet powerful approach will help you simplify your life, achieve the success you long for, and feel energized, authentic and whole.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=7db-nQEACAAJ&dq=Simplicity+and+Success:+Creating+the+Life+You+Long+For&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"With God on the Golf Course (Outdoor Insights Pocket Devotionals)","description":"Although popular author Phil Callaway offers no guarantee for a lower golf score, he does offer 40 short devotionals full of warm, humorous, and enjoyable reflections on the sport Mark Twain called \\"a good walk ruined.\\" \\"This isn't a book about the mechanics of golf.

Together, these counties are home to only 5 million people (that is, 1.5% of the American population), but it was in these communities that Barack Obama won the 2008 and 2012 elections, and in 2016, they hold the key to the states Republicans must win in order to take back the White House. For Republicans, this is bad news and good news. Bad news, because all seven of the counties pulled for Obama in one or both of the last two elections; good news, because they all voted for George W. Bush in 2004, and due to the Democrats' misadventures under the Obama administration, the door is open for Republicans to win these counties--and the presidency--once again, making a decisive mandate against progressivism for the generation to come. Going Red will take readers inside these battlegrounds, weaving never-before-seen data into human portraits that illuminate why these communities have changed from Republican to Democrat, why the Obama administration has disappointed them, and what conservatives can do to win them back in this election cycle--and beyond. With echoes of Nate Silver, Dick Morris, and Charles Murray, this is a timely and crucial book for anyone who cares about conservatism's future\\"--","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=BzfTCwAAQBAJ&dq=THE+RED+PRESIDENT&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Magic, Science and Religion and Other Essays","description":"This book contains three prolific essays by the world renown polish anthropologist Bronislaw Malinowski.

It is an indispensable manual that will be used daily by beginners and seasoned corporate writers/editors alike in the daily business of crafting creative organizational publications. Lionel Fisher writes in a fresh, down-to-earth style honed by his forty-five years of experience as a corporate communicator, newspaper correspondent/columnist, advertising/public relations creative director-copy chief, and as a freelance writer specializing in business-sales-marketing-organizational communications. He provides essential, hands-on counsel, instruction and advice on the esoteric challenges of corporate writing. The seminal message Fisher conveys is that business-related magazines, newsletters, ezines, and other organizational publications need not be dull, dry, or merely informational. Rather, corporate journalists must earn and sustain the interest of their readers, which can only be done with powerful writing. His descriptive instruction and crisp counsel is packed with riveting examples of journalistic and business prose to illustrate critical points as he teaches organizational communicators how to write. The author's engaging, iconoclastic style instructs on the essentials of corporate and business writing: How to craft powerful leads; compose and edit articles with the proper structure, pace, and flow; nurture creativity; dissolve writer's block and interview effectively. But organizational communicators must do more than just produce outstanding feature and news stories. They are also responsible for organizing their material into attractive, seductive packages. They must target and involve readers; present appetizing arrays of news and feature stories; define and tailor their publications; set stylistic guidelines; motivate correspondents; and much, much more.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=F_mLiPcrt3sC&dq=The+Craft+of+Corporate+Journalism:+Writing+and+Editing+Creative+Organizational+Publications&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Joshua: An Expositional Commentary (Boice Commentary Series)","description":"Commentaries by James Montgomery Boice explain the meaning of the biblical text verse by verse and section by section, while also relating the text to the realities of Christian life.
